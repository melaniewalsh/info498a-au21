Whereas a platform like Google Docs automatically keeps track of changes that you make in a document, Git needs you to record and track your own changes in a more explicit way. You will need to \"commit\" any changes that you make (e.g., adding your map file) and include a message that describes this change (e.g., \"added a map file\").\n",
