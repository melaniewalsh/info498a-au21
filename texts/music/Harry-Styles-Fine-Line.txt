Hey!

Golden, golden, golden as I open my eyes
Hold it, focus, hoping, take me back to the light
I know you were way too bright for me
I'm hopeless, broken, so you wait for me in the sky
Brown my skin just right
You're so golden

You're so golden
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken

I don't want to be alone
I don't want to be alone when it ends
Don't wanna let you know
I don't want to be alone
But I can feel it take a hold (I can feel it take a hold)
I can feel you take control (I can feel you take control)
Of who I am, and all I've ever known
Lovin' you's the antidote
Golden

You're so golden
I don't want to be alone
You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken

(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
(Golden, golden, golden, golden)
I know that you're scared because I'm so open

You're so golden
I don't want to be alone
You're so golden
You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get brokenTastes like strawberries on a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want more berries and that summer feelin'
It's so wonderful and warm

Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without
I'm just thinking out loud
I don't know if I could ever go without

Watermelon sugar high

Strawberries on a summer evenin'
Baby, you're the end of June
I want your belly and that summer feelin'
Getting washed away in you

Strawberry lipstick state of mind (State of mind)

You don't have to say you love me
You don't have to say nothing
You don't have to say you're mine

Honey (Ah-ah-ah)

Just let me adore you

Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do

Brown skin and lemon over ice

I'm sorry by the way
Never coming back down
Can't you see?
I could, but wouldn't stay
Wouldn't put it like that
What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
Never coming around
It'd be so sweet if things just stayed the same
La-da-da-da-da

All the lights couldn't put out the dark
Runnin' through my heart
Lights up and they know who you are
Know who you are
Do you know who you are? (Oh)

Shine, step into the light
Shine, so bright sometimes
Shine, I'm not ever going back
Shine, step into the light

Runnin' through my heart
Lights up and they know who you are
Know who you are
Do you know who you are?Coucou

Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me

I, I confess I can tell that you are at your best
I'm selfish so I'm hating it
I noticed that there's a piece of you in how I dress
Take it as a compliment

Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me

I, I just miss
I just miss your accent and your friends
Did you know I still talk to them?

Does he take you walking 'round his parents' gallery?

Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me
Don't you call him "baby" (Coucou)
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me (Coucou)

Coucou ! Tu dors ? Oh, j'suis désolée...
Bah non... Nan, c'est pas important...
Ouais, on a été à la plage, et maintenant on—
Parfait ! Allez !I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink and my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'

You said you care, and you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've ran out of things we can say

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'

And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again

What am I now? What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'Don't blame me for falling
I was just a little boy
Don’t blame the drunk caller
Wasn't ready for it all

You can't blame me, darling
Not even a little bit, I was away
And I’m just an arrogant son of a bitch
Who can't admit when he's sorry

Don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, it's hard for me to go home
Be so lonely

I just hope you see me in a little better light
Do you think it's easy being of the jealous kind?
’Cause I miss the shape of your lips
You’ll win, it's just a trick
And this is it, so I’m sorry

Don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, it’s hard for me to go home
Be so lonely

To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely

And I'm just an arrogant son of a bitch
Who can't admit when he's sorry

Don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, it's hard for me to go home
Be so lonely

To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonelyNine in the morning, the man drops his kids off at school
And he's thinking of you, like all of us do
Sends his assistant for coffee in the afternoon
Around 1:32, like he knows what to do

She (She), she lives in daydreams with me (She)
She's the first one that I see, and I don't know why
I don't know who she is (She, she)

He takes a boat out, imagines just sailing away (Away, away)
And not telling his mates (Not telling his mates)
He wouldn't know what to say (Wouldn't know what to say, to say)

She (She), she lives in daydreams with me (She)
She's the first one that I see, and I don't know why
I don't know who she is (She)
She (She), she's the first one that I see (She)
She lives in daydreams with me, and I don't know why
I don't know where she is (She, she)

Lives for the memory
A woman who's just in his head (Just in his head)
And she sleeps in his bed (His bed)
While he plays pretend (Pretend)
So pretend (Pretend)

She (She), she lives in daydreams with me (She)
She's the first one that I see, and I don't know why
I don't know who she is (She, she)
She (She), she's the first one that I see (She)
She lives in daydreams with me, and I don't know why
I don't know where she is (She, she)Sunflower
Sunflower, my eyes want you more than a melody
Let me inside, wish I could get to know you
Sunflowers sometimes keep it sweet in your memory
I was just tongue-tied

I don't wanna make you feel bad
But I've been trying hard not to talk to you
Sunflower (Sunflower, sunflower)

I couldn't want you any more
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor
I couldn't want you any more
Tonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight)

Wondering, headshake
Tired eyes are the death of me
Mouthful of toothpaste before I got to know you
I've got your face hung up high in the gallery
I love this shade, sunflower, sunflower
Your flowers just died, plant new seeds in the melody
Let me inside, I wanna get to know you

I don't wanna make you feel bad
But I've been trying hard not to act a fool
Sunflower (Sunflower, sunflower)

I couldn't want you any more
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor
I couldn't want you any more
Tonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight)
I couldn't want you any more
Kids in the kitchen, listen to dancehall
I couldn't want you any more
Tonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight)

Sunflower, my eyes want you more than a melody
Let me inside, wish I could get to know you
Sunflowers just died, keep it sweet in your memory
I'm still tongue-tied
Sunflower, sunflower

Sunflower, sunflower
Sunflower, sunflower
Ayy, woo, ow
Woo-woo, woo-woo
Woo-woo, woo-woo
Woo-woo, woo-woo
Yeah!
Ooh, woo, ooh
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, dooGotta see it to believe it, sky never looked so blue
So hard to leave it, that's what I always do
So I keep thinking back to a time under the canyon moon

The world's happy waitin', door's yellow, broken blue
I heard Jenny saying, "Go get the kids from school"
And I keep thinking back to the time under the canyon moon

I'll be gone too long from you

Staring at the ceiling, two weeks and I'll be home
Carry the feeling, through Paris, all through Rome
And I'm still thinking back to the time under the canyon moon

I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going home
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going home

Quick pause in conversation, she plays songs I've never heard
An old lover's hippie music, pretends not to know the words
And I keep thinking back to the time under the canyon moon

I'll be gone too long from you

I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going home
I'm going, oh, I'm going (I'm going home)
I'm going, oh, I'm going  (I'm going home)
I'm going, oh, I'm going home (Yeah)
I'm going, oh, I'm going (I'm going home)
I'm going, oh, I'm going  (I'm going home)
I'm going, oh, I'm going home (Hey)Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good

I've got a good feeling
I'm just takin' it all in
Floating up and dreamin'
Droppin' into the deep end

And if we're here long enough
They'll sing a song for us
And we'll belong

Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good

Giving second chances
I don't need all the answers
Feeling good in my skin
I just keep on dancin'

And if we're here long enough
We'll see it's all for us
And we'll belong

Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good

And it's just another day (And it's just another day)
And if our friends all pass away (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
It's okay (It's okay, it's okay)
It's okay (It's okay, it's okay, yeah)
Hey!
Here we go now

Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good

All we ever want is automatic all the time
All we ever want is auto, auto all of the time
All we ever want is automatic all the time
All we ever want is auto, auto all of the time
Maybe, we can (All together now, one more time)
Find a place to feel good (Oh yeah)
And we can treat people with kindness (Just a little bit of kindness)
Find a place to feel good (Ow)Put a price on emotion
I'm looking for something to buy
You've got my devotion
But man, I can hate you sometimes
I don't want to fight you
And I don't want to sleep in the dirt
We'll get the drinks in
So I'll get to thinking of her

We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line

Test of my patience
There's things that we'll never know
You sunshine, you temptress
My hand's at risk, I fold
Crisp trepidation
I'll try to shake this soon
Spreading you open
Is the only way of knowing you

We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright
We'll be alright
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright (Alright, alright, alright)

(We'll be alright)
(We'll be alright)
We'll be alright
We'll be alright
Oh
