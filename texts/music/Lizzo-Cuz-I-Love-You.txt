No glory, let's go

Yeah, the old me used to love a Gemini
Like a threesome, fuckin' with him every night
A lotta two-faced people show me both sides
So I figured out I gotta be my own type

They used to say to get a man, you had to know how to look
They used to say to keep a man, you had to know how to cook
But I'm solo in Soho, sippin' Soju in Malibu
It's a me, myself kinda attitude

'Cause I'm my own soulmate (Yeah, yeah)
I know how to love me (Love me)
I know that I'm always gonna hold me down
Yeah, I'm my own soulmate (Yeah, yeah)
No, I'm never lonely (Lonely)
I know I'm a queen, but I don't need no crown
Look up in the mirror like "Damn, she the one"

One, one, one, one, one, one (The one)
Like "Damn, she the one"
One, one, one (The one)
Bad bitch in the mirror like "Yeah, I'm in love"
Love, love, love, love, love, love (In love)

We always get extra fries
And you know the sex is fire
And I gotta testify
I get flowers every Sunday
I'ma marry me one day

True love ain't something you can buy yourself
True love finally happens when you by yourself
So if you by yourself, then go and buy yourself

But it's so hard to say goodbye
I don't need to apologize
Us big girls got to cry

Ooh, ooh, ooh
