Lights up on Washington Heights, up at the break of day
I wake up and I got this little punk I gotta chase away
Pop the grate at the crack of dawn
Sing while I wipe down the awning
Hey y’all, good morning

Ice cold piragua! Parcha. China. Cherry. Strawberry. And just for today, I got mamey!

Oye, piragüero, como estas?

Como siempre, Señor Usnavi.​

I am Usnavi and you prob’ly never heard my name
Reports of my fame are greatly exaggerated
Exacerbated by the fact that my syntax
Is highly complicated 'cause I immigrated
From the single greatest little place in the Caribbean:
Dominican Republic! I love it!
Jesus, I’m jealous of it, and beyond that
Ever since my folks passed on, I haven’t gone back
Goddamn, I gotta get on that...
Fo! The milk has gone bad, hold up just a second
Why is everything in this fridge warm and tepid?
I better step it up and fight the heat
'Cause I’m not makin' any profit if the coffee isn’t light and sweet!

Ooo-oo!

Abuela, my fridge broke. I got café but no "con leche."

Try my mother’s old recipe: one can of condensed milk.

Nice.​


Ayy! Paciencia y fe…

That was Abuela, she’s not really my “abuela,”
But she practically raised me, this corner is her escuela
Now, you’re prob’ly thinkin: "I’m up shit’s creek!
I've never been north of Ninety-Sixth Street!”
Well, you must take the A Train
Even farther than Harlem to northern Manhattan and maintain
Get off at 181st, and take the escalator
I hope you’re writing this down, I’m gonna test ya later
I’m getting tested; times are tough on this bodega
Two months ago somebody bought Ortega’s
Our neighbors started packin’ up and pickin’ up
And ever since the rents went up
It’s gotten mad expensive, but we live with just enough

In the heights
I flip the lights and start my day
There are fights

And endless debts

And bills to pay

In the Heights
I can’t survive without café

I serve café

'Cause tonight seems like a million years away!
En Washington—

Next up to bat, the Rosarios
They run the cab company,​ they struggle in the barrio
See, their daughter Nina’s off at college, tuition is mad steep
So they can’t sleep; everything they get is mad cheap!

Good morning, Usnavi!

Pan caliente, café con leche!

Put twenty dollars on today’s lottery

One ticket, that’s it!

Hey! A man’s gotta dream...

Don’t mind him, he’s all excited
‘Cause Nina flew in at 3 A.M. last night!

Don’t look at me, this one’s been cooking all week!

Usnavi, come over for dinner

There’s plenty to eat!

So then dona Yesenia walks in the room—

Aha…

She smells sex and cheap perfume!

Uh oh…

It smells like one of those trees
That you hang from the rear view!

Ah, no!

It’s true! She screams, “Who’s in there with you, Julio?”
Grabs a bat and kicks in the door
He’s in bed with José from the liquor store!

No me diga!

Daniela and Carla, from the salon.​

Thanks, Usnavi!

Sonny, you’re late.​

Chillax, you know you love me.​

Me and my cousin run it
Just another dime-a-dozen mom-and-pop stop-and-shop
And, oh my god, it’s gotten too darn hot
Like my man Cole Porter said
People come through for a few cold waters and
A lottery ticket, just a part of the routine
Everybody’s got a job, everybody’s got a dream
They gossip, as I sip my coffee and smirk
The first stop as people hop to work
Bust it— I’m like:
"One dollar, two dollars, one fifty, one sixty-nine.​
I got it. You want a box of condoms? What kind?
That’s two quarters.​ Two quarter waters
The New York Times.​
You need a bag for that? The tax is added.​"
Once you get some practice at it
You do rapid mathematics automatically
Sellin’ maxi-pads, fuzzy dice for taxicabs and practically
Everybody’s stressed, yes!
But they press through the mess
Bounce checks and wonder what’s next

In the heights
I buy my coffee and I go
Set my sights
On only what I need to know
In the heights
Money is tight
But even so

In the heights
I buy my coffee and—
Set my sights
What I need to know
In the heights
Money is tight
Even so

When the lights go down I blast my radio!

You ain’t got no skills!

Benny!

Yo, lemme get a—

Milky Way

Yeah, lemme also get a—

Daily News—

And a—

Post—

And most important, my—

Boss’ second coffee, one cream—

Five sugars

I’m the number one earner—

What?!

The fastest learner—

What?!

My boss can’t keep me on the damn back burner!

Yes, he can

I’m makin’ moves, I’m makin’ deals, but guess what?

What?

You still ain’t got no skills!

Hardee-har

Yo, Vanessa show up yet?

Shut up!

Hey little homie, don’t get so upset

Man...

Tell Vanessa how you feel, buy the girl a meal
On the real, or you ain’t got no skills

Nooo!
No no nooo!
No no nooo, no-no-no!
Nooo, no-no-no!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no-no!
Mr. Johnson, I got the security deposit
It’s locked in a box in the bottom of my closet
It’s not reflected in my bank statement
But I’ve been savin’ to make a down payment and pay rent
No, no, I won’t let you down—

Yo, here’s your chance; ask her out right now!

I’ll see you later, we can look at that lease!

Do somethin’, make your move, don’t freeze!

Hey!

You owe me a bottle of cold champagne!

Are you moving?

Just a little credit check and I’m on that downtown train!

Well, your coffee’s on the house

Okay!

Usnavi, ask her out

No way!

I’ll see you later, so…

Oooh... Smooth operator, aw, damn, there she goes!
Yo, bro, take five, take a walk outside!
You look exhausted, lost, don’t let life slide!
The whole hood is struggling, times are tight
And you’re stuck to this corner like a streetlight!

Yeah, I’m a streetlight, chokin' on the heat
The world spins around while I’m frozen to my seat
The people that I know all keep on rollin' down the street
But every day is different so I’m switchin’ up the beat
'Cuz my parents came with nothing, they got a little more
And sure, we’re poor, but yo, at least we got the store
And it’s all about the legacy they left with me, it’s destiny
And one day I’ll be on a beach with Sonny writing checks to me

In the Heights, I hang my flag up on display

We came to work and to live and we got a lot in common

It reminds me that I came from miles away

D.R., P.R., we are not stoppin’

In the Heights
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
In the Heights
I’ve got today!

Every day, paciencia y fe

Until the day we go from poverty to stock options

And today’s all we got, so we cannot stop
This is our block!

In the Heights
I hang my flag up on display

Lo le lo le lo lai lai lo le!

It reminds me that I came from miles away

My family came from miles away—

In the Heights
It gets more expensive every day

Every day

And tonight is so far away—

But as for mañana, mi pana
Ya gotta just keep watchin’

You’ll see the
​late nights
You’ll taste
​beans and rice
The syrups and
​shaved ice
I ain’t gonna
​say it twice
So turn up the stage lights
We’re takin’ a flight
To a couple of days
​in the life of what it’s like

Late nights!
Beans and rice!
Shaved ice!
Say it twice!

In the Heights!

In the Heights!

In the Heights!
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah!

En Washington Heights!Sigue andando el camino por toda su vida
Respira...

Breathe

Y si pierdes mis huellas que dios te bendiga
Respira

This is my street
I smile at the faces
I’ve known all my life
They regard me with pride
And everyone’s sweet
They say, “You’re going places!’
So how can I say that while I was away
I had so much to hide!
“Hey guys, it’s me!
The biggest disappointment you know.”
The kid couldn’t hack it
She’s back and she’s walkin’ real slow
Welcome home
Just breathe...

Just breathe—

Sigue andando el camino por toda su vida
Respira—
Y si pierdes mis huellas que dios te bendiga
Respira—

As the radio plays old forgotten boleros
I think of the days when this city was mine
I remember the praise

“Ay, te adoro, te quiero,”
The neighborhood waved, and
Said, “Nina, be brave and
You’re gonna be fine!”
And maybe it’s me
But it all seems like lifetimes ago

Te adoro
Te quiero
Respira!
Respira!

So what do I say to these faces that I used to know?
“Hey, I’m home?”

Mira Nina

Hey…

No me preocupo por ella

They’re not worried about me

Mira, allí esta nuestra estrella!

They are all counting on me to succeed

Ella sí da la talla!

I am the one who made it out!
The one who always made the grade
But maybe I should have just stayed home…
When I was a child I stayed wide awake
Climbed to the highest place
On every fire escape
Restless to climb
I got every scholarship
Saved every dollar
The first to go to college
How do I tell them why
I’m coming back home?
With my eyes on the horizon

Ah! Ah, aah…
Mira Nina
Respira…
Respira…
Ah!

Just me and the GWB, asking, “Gee Nina, what’ll you be?"
Straighten the spine
Smile for the neighbors
Everything’s fine
Everything’s cool
The standard reply:
“Lots of tests, lots of papers.”
Smile, wave goodbye
And pray to the sky, oh, god…
And what will my parents say?

Nina…

Can I go in there and say

Nina…

“I know that I’m letting you down…”

Nina…

Just breathe...Check one two three... Check one two three...
This is Benny on the dispatch. Yo!
Atención, yo, attention!
It’s Benny, and I’d like to mention
I’m on the microphone this mornin’
Honk ya horn if you want it!
Okay, we got traffic on the west side
Get off at 79th, and take the left side
Of Riverside Drive, and ya might slide
West End’s ya best friend if you catch the lights
And don’t take the Deegan;
Manny Ramirez is in town this weekend
Sorry Dominicans, take Route Eighty-seven
You ain’t getting back in again
Hold up a minute

Benny, hey—

Nina, you’re home today!

Any sign—

...Of your folks, they’re on their way!

Anyway—

It’s good to see your face—

Anytime—

Hold up a minute, wait!
You used to run this dispatch, right?

Once or twice—

Well check the technique! Yo!
There’s a traffic accident I have to mention
At the intersection of 10th Ave and the Jacob Javitz Convention Center
And check it, don’t get stuck in the rubber-neckin’
On a Hundred-Ninety-Second, there’s a double-decker bus wreck!
Now listen up, we got a special guest!

Live and direct from a year out west! (Benny...)
Welcome her back, 'cause she looks mad stressed! (Benny...)
Nina Rosario, the barrio’s best!

Honk your horns…
She’s smiling… say hello!

Hello!
Good morning!
I better find my folks
Thanks for the welcome wagon

Anytime. Anytime, Nina
Wait here with me
It’s getting hot outside, turn up the A.C
Stay here with meThe elevated train by my window
Doesn’t faze me anymore
The rattling screams don’t disrupt my dreams
It’s a lullaby, in its way
The elevated train drives everyone insane
But I don’t mind, oh no
When I bring back boys they can’t tolerate the noise
And that’s okay, 'cause I never let them stay
And one day, I’m hoppin’ that elevated train and I’m riding away!
It won’t be long now!
The boys around the way holler at me when I’m walking down the street
Their machismo pride doesn’t break my stride—
It’s a compliment, so they say
The boys around the way holler at me every day but I don’t mind, oh no
If I’m in the mood, it will not be with some dude
Who is whistling 'cause he has nothing to say
Or who’s honking at me from his Chevrolet!
And one day… I’m hoppin’ in a limousine and I’m driving away!
It won’t be long now!
(spoken)
Ay, Usnavi, help! SOS!

Good morning, Vanessa!
If it isn’t the loveliest girl in the place...

You’ve got some schmutz on your face

Good morning!

Good morning!

Vanessa!

Vanessa!

Vanessa!

VANESSSSSAAAAAA! I’m thirsty, coño!

Can I get a Pepsi and some packing tape?

Uh, my cousin over there with his tongue hanging out, has been meaning to ask you…

Yes?

What a lady such as yourself might be doing tonight?

Does your cousin dance?

Like a drunk Chita Rivera.​

Okay… After Nina’s dinner, we can hit a few clubs and check out the fireworks…

Oh snap! Who’s that?
Don’t touch me, I’m too hot! Yes!
Qué pasó? Here I go!
So dope! Y tu lo sabes!
No pare

Sigue sigue!

Did you see me?

Freaky freakit!

What a way to begin the weekend
Sonny, anything you want is free, man!
And my dearly beloved Dominican Republic
I haven’t forgotten

You!

Gonna see this honey, make a little money
And one day I’ll hop Jet

Blue!

But until that fateful day, I’m grateful
I got a destination
I’m runnin’ to make it home
And home’s what Vanessa’s runnin’ away from!
I’m runnin’ to make it home
And home’s what Vanessa’s runnin’ away from…

The neighborhood salon is the place I am working for the moment
As I cut their hair, ladies talk and share—
Every day, who’s doin' who and why...
The neighborhood salon doesn’t pay me what I wanna be making but I don’t mind
As I sweep the curb I can hear those turbo engines blazing a trail through the sky
I look up and think about the years gone by
But one day—I’m walkin’ to JFK and I’m gonna fly!
It won’t be long now!
Any day...This isn’t happening
Inútil! Useless
Just like my father was before me:
Inútil! Useless
And every day
He cut the cane
He came home late and prayed for rain
Prayed for rain
And on the days
When nothing came
My father’s face was lined with shame
He’d sit me down beside him and he’d say,​
“My father was a farmer,​
His father was a farmer,​
And you will be a farmer.”
But I told him, “Papi, I’m sorry, I’m going farther.​
I’m getting on a plane.​
And I am gonna change the world someday!”
And he slapped my face
He stood there, staring at me, useless
Today my daughter’s home and I am… useless
And as a baby she amazed me with
The things she learned each day
She used to stay on the fire escape
While all the other kids would play
And I would stand beside her and I’d say:
“I’m proud to be your father
‘Cuz you work so much harder
And you are so much smarter
Than I was at your age.”
And I always knew that she would fly away
That she was gonna change the world someday
I will not be the reason
That my family can’t succeed
I will do what it takes
They’ll have everything they need
Or all my work, all my life
Everything I’ve sacrificed will have been uselessGorgeous!

Linda!

Tell me something I don’t know!

Vieja!

Sucia!

Cabrona!

Tell me something I don’t know!

A little off the top!

A little off the side!

A little bit of news you’ve heard around the barrio!

Tell me something I don’t know!

Bueno
You didn’t hear it from me!
But some little birdie told me
Usnavi had sex with Yolanda!

No me diga!

Ay, no! He’d never go out with a skank like that!
Please tell me you’re joking!

Okay!
Just wanted to see what you’d say!

Oh ho, Dani!

Tell me something I don’t know!
Mmm-hmm-mmm…

What? I don’t care!

Ay, bendito!

So, Nina, I hear you been talking to Benny

And what do you hear?

I hear plenty!
They say he’s got quite a big… taxi!

No me diga!

Okay! I don’t wanna know where you heard all that!

I don’t think I know what you mean…

Carla! He’s packing a stretch limousine!

Tell me something I don’t know!

Long as he keeps it clean!

Ay dios mio!

Nina, seriously, we knew you’d be the one to make it out!

I bet you impressed them all out west;
You were always the best, no doubt!

We want front row seats to your graduation—

They’ll call your name—

And we’ll scream and shout!


You guys, I dropped out.​

No me diga?!

I should go.​

Well, that’s a shitty piece of news.​

That girl never quit anything.​

What the hell happened?

I don’t know…

I don’t know

I don’t know...

Tell me something I don’t know!

Qué sé yo?Ninety-six thousand!

Damn!

Ninety-six thousand!

Dollars? Holler!

Ninety-six thousand!

Yo, somebody won!

Ninety-six thousand!

Yo,​
If I won the lotto tomorrow
Well, I know I wouldn’t bother goin’ on no spendin’ spree
I pick a business school and pay the entrance fee!
Then maybe if you’re lucky, you’ll stay friends with me!
I’ll be a businessman, richer than Nina’s daddy!
Donald Trump and I on the links, and he’s my caddy!
My money’s makin’ money, I’m goin’ from po’ to mo’ dough!
Keep the bling, I want the brass ring, like Frodo!

Oh no, here goes Mr. Braggadocio
Next thing you know, you’re lying like Pinocchio—

Yo, if you’re scared of the bull, stay out the rodeo!

Yo, I got more hoes than a phone book in Tokyo!

Ooh, you better stop rappin’, you not ready
It’s gonna get hot and heavy
And you already sweaty—

Yo-yo-yo! Yo!

Yo! I’m sorry is that an answer?
Shut up, go home and pull ya damn pants up!
As for you, Mr. Frodo of the Shire—
96 G’s ain’t enough to retire

C'mon, I’ll have enough to knock your ass off its axis!

You’ll have a knapsack full of jack after taxes!

Ninety-six thousand!

Ay, alabanza!

Ninety-six thousand!

No me diga!

Ninety-six thousand!

I never win shit!

Ninety-six thousand!

For real, though, imagine how it would feel goin’ real slow
Down the highway of life with no regrets
And no breakin’ your neck for respect or a paycheck
For real, though, I’ll take a break from the wheel and we’ll throw
The biggest block party, everybody here
It’s a weekend when we can breathe, take it easy

Yo! Ma, it’s me, check my tickets!

Check one two three
What would you do with ninety-six G’s—

Who me?

I mean if it’s just between you and me—

Esa pregunta es tricky!

I know

With ninety-six G’s
I’d start my life with a brand new lease
Atlantic City with a Malibu Breeze

And a brand new weave!

Or maybe just bleach...

Y’all are freaks.​

Yo, I’m just sayin’...
(sung)
It’s silly when we get into these crazy hypotheticals
You really want some bread? Then go ahead create a set of goals
And cross them off the list as you pursue ‘em
And with those ninety-six, I know precisely what I’m doin’

What'chu doin’?

What’m I doin? What’m I doin?
It takes most of that cash just to save my ass from financial ruin
Sonny can keep the coffee brewin’
I’ll spend a few on you
‘Cause  the only room with a view is a room with you in it
And I could give Abuela Claudia the rest of it
Just fly me down to Puerto Plata, I’ll make the best of it!
You really love this business?

No

Tough, Merry Christmas
You’re now the youngest tycoon in Washington Hiznits!

Yo!
With ninety-six thousand, I’d finally fix housin’
Give the barrio computers with wireless web browsin’
Your kids are livin’ without a good edjumication
Change the station, teach 'em about gentrification
The rent is escalatin’

What?!

The rich are penetratin’

What?!

We pay our corporations when we should be demonstratin’

What?!

What about immigration?

What?!

Politicians be hatin’

What?!

Racism in this nation’s gone from latent to blatant

Oooooh!

I’ll cash my ticket and picket, invest in protest
Never lose my focus 'til the city takes notice
And you know this man! I'll never sleep
Because the ghetto has a million promises for me to keep!

You are so cute!

I was just thinking off the top of my head.​

Ninety-six K: Go.​

If I win the lottery, you’ll never see me again

Damn, we only jokin’, stay broke then

I’ll be downtown
Get a nice studio, I'll get out of the barrio

If I
​win the

You’ll wonder where

Calor… calor… calor…
Ay Mamá!
The summer’s hottest day!
Paciencia y fe! Paciencia y fe!
Ay, carajo, it’s hot!
But that’s okay!
Mamá would say, "Paciencia y fe!"
It was hotter at home in La Víbora
The Washington Heights of Havana!
A crowded city of faces the same as mine!
Back as a child in La Víbora
I chased the birds in the plaza
Praying, Mamá, you would find work
Combing the stars in the sky for some sort of sign!
Ay, Mamá, so many stars in Cuba…
En Nueva York we can’t see beyond our streetlights…
To reach the roof you gotta bribe the supa...
Ain’t no Cassiopeia in Washington Heights…
But ain’t no food in La Víbora…
I remember nights, anger in the streets, hunger at the windows
Women folding clothes, playing with my friends in the summer rain…
Mamá needs a job, Mamá says we’re poor, one day you say, "Vamos a Nueva York..."
And Nueva York was far
But Nueva York had work and so we came…
And now, I’m wide awake
A million years too late
I talk to you, imagining what you’d do
Remembering what we went through
Nueva York! Ay Mamá!
It wasn’t like today, you’d say
"Paciencia y fe

"Paciencia y fe

Paciencia y fe!"

Paciencia y—

Fresh off the boat in America
Freezing in early December
A crowded city in 1943!
Learning the ropes in America
In español, I remember
Dancing with Mayor La Guardia
All of society welcoming mami and me!
Ha!

You better clean this mess!

Paciencia y fe…

You better learn inglés!

Paciencia y fe…

You better not be late…
You better pull your weight…
Are you better off than you were with the birds of La Víbora?

Sharing double beds, trying to catch a break, struggling with English
Listening to friends, finally got a job working as a maid
So we cleaned some homes, polishing with pride
Scrubbing the whole of the Upper East Side
The days into weeks, the weeks into years, and here I stayed

Paciencia y fe…
Paciencia y fe…
Paciencia y fe…

And as I feed these birds
My hands begin to shake
And as I say these words
My heart’s about to break
And ay Mamá
What do you do when
Your dreams come true?
I’ve spent my life
Inheriting dreams from you

What do I do with this winning ticket?
What can I do but pray?
I buy my loaf of bread
Continue with my day
And see you in my head
Imagining what you’d say
The birds, they fly away
Do they fly to La Víbora?
(spoken)
Alright, Mamá. Okay

Paciencia y fe

Calor, calor, calor!I used to think we lived at the top of the world
When the world was just a subway map
And the one-slash-nine
Climbed a dotted line to my place

There’s no nine train now

Right
I used to think the Bronx was a place in the sky
When the world was just a subway map
And my thoughts took shape

On that fire escape…

Can you remind me of what it was like
At the top of the world?

Come with me
We begin July
With a stop at my corner fire hydrant

You would open it every summer!

I would bust it with a wrench
Till my face got drenched
Till I heard the sirens
Then I ran like hell!

You ran like hell!

Yeah, I ran like hell!

I remember well!

To your father’s dispatch window
“Hey, let me in, yo!
They’re coming to get me!”

You were always in constant trouble—

Then your dad would act all snide, but he’d let me hide
You’d be there inside—

Life was easier then

Nina, everything is easier
When you’re home…
The street’s a little kinder when you’re home
Can’t you see
That the day seems clearer
Now that you are here or
Is it me?
Maybe it’s just me…
We gotta go I wanna show you all I know
The sun is setting and the light is getting low

Are we going to Castle Garden?

Maybe, maybe not, but way to take a shot, when the day is hot
I got a perfect shady spot
A little ways away that oughta
Cool us down

Cool us down—

Welcome back to town...

Now, back in high school when it darkened
You’d hang out in Bennett Park and

Usnavi would bring his radio…

As I walked home from Senior Studies
I’d see you rapping with your buddies

With the volume high

I walked on by

You walked on by—

No pare! Sigue, sigue! (Woah)
No pare! Sigue, sigue! (Oh)
No pare! Sigue, sigue! (Woah)
No pare! Sigue, sigue! (Oh)
No pare! Sigue, sigue! (Woah)
No pare! Sigue, sigue! (Oh)
No pare! Sigue, sigue! (Woah)
No pare sigue! (Oh)

When you’re home

Oh, the summer nights are cooler

When you’re home!

Now that you’re here with me…

And that song you are hearing is the (ooh, ooh)
Neighborhood just ​cheering you along (ooh, ooh)

Don’t say that

What’s wrong?

Don’t say that!
When I was younger, I’d imagine what would happen
If my parents had stayed in Puerto Rico
Who would I be if I had never seen Manhattan
If I lived in Puerto Rico with my people
My people!
I feel like all my life, I’ve tried to find the answer
Working harder, learning Spanish, learning all I can
I thought I might find the answer out at Stanford
But I’d stare out at the sea
Thinking, where’m I supposed to be?
So please don’t say you’re proud of me, when I’ve lost my way

Then can I say:
I couldn’t get my mind off you all day
Now listen to me!
That may be how you perceive it
But Nina please believe
That when you find your way again
You’re gonna change the world and then
We’re all gonna brag and say we knew her when...
This was your home

I’m home—

Welcome home—

When you’re here with me—

Welcome home—

I used to think that we lived at the top of the world!

Welcome home—

I’m home—

You’re finally home (I'm home)
You’re home! (I'm home)Oh, qué calor, qué calor, qué calor, qué calo-o-or!
Piragua, piragua
New block of ice, piragua
Piragua, piragua
So sweet and nice, piragua
Tengo de mango
Tengo de parcha
De piña y de fresa!
Tengo de china, de limón
De peso y de peseta, hey!
Piragua, piragua
New block of ice, piragua
Piragua, piragua
So sweet and nice, piragua
It’s hotter than the islands are tonight
And Mister Softee trying to shut me down
But I keep scraping by the fading light
Hey pana, this is my town
Piragua, piragua
Keep scraping by, piragua
Piragua, piragua
Keep scraping by, piragua
Keep scraping by, keep scraping by…
Lai lo le lo lai! Lai lo le lo lai!
Keep scraping by, keep scraping by…
Lai lo le lo lai!
Keep scraping by…
Oh, qué calor, qué calor, qué calor, qué calo-o-or!Vanessa!

Damn, this is nice
I really like what they’ve done with the lights
So, the hot club in Washington Heights
You might be right, this music’s tight
Yo, did I mention that you look great tonight
Because you do you really—

Usnavi, relax!

Relax, qué relaxed? I’m relaxed

Wepa! Vanessa!

So you’ve been here before
I don’t go out; I get so busy with the store
Y cada día it’s a brand new chore
My arms are sore; no time for the dance floor
But maybe you and me should hang out some more
I’m such a dork, but I—

Let’s go get a drink

Something sweet

You know me, a little bit of cinnamon

Wepa! Vanessa!

Here’s to getting fired!

To killing the mood!

Salud!

Without so much as a “thank you!”

After five long years

Cheers!

To finally getting Vanessa!
Man, fix your collar...

Holler!

To doing shots on a weekend!

As long as you buy ‘em, l’chaim!

Hey you!

Who?

You!

Who, me?

You wanna dance?

Naw, man…

Okay, I took my chance…

It’s cool, it’s cool, hey, if you want to…

You don’t mind?

I’m fine! I’m fine!

Yo!

Yo!

Who’s Vanessa talkin’ to?

Some dude!

Some dude?!
That’s messed up, she’s tryin’ to make you jealous!

Jealous, I ain’t jealous, I can take all these fellas, whatever!
Usnavi grabs Vanessa from José and dances with her

Benny, can we take a walk outside?

And there she is

I’m so sorry, I didn’t know

Who let you in? Yo, this is the girl who cost us our jobs today!

I’m going to make it right!

A toast to the end of all I know!

You’ve had enough!

Says the girl who has it all

That’s not fair

Well why don’t you run home to daddy?
He loves to remind me that I’ll never be good enough for your family… for you…

You don’t know me

Poor you...

I thought you were different

Salud

Vanessa, let me get the next one!
Vanessa, let me interject some!
The way you sweat, the way you flex on the floor
It makes me want you more!
Vanessa, let me get the next one!
Vanessa, let me interject some!
The way you sweat, the way you flex on the floor
It makes me want you more!
Vanessa, let me get the next one!
Vanessa, let me interject some!
The way you sweat, the way you flex on the floor
It makes me want you more!

Bartender!
Let me get an amaretto sour for this ghetto flower!
How are you so pretty?
You complete me
You had me at "hello," you know you need me
Truly, madly, deeply, let’s get freaky
Oh I get it you’re the strong and silent type
Well, I’m the Caribbean island type
And I can drive you wild all night!
But I digress!
Say something so I don’t stress

No hablo inglés

Yes!¿Oye, qué pasó?

Blackout, blackout!

Vino el apagón

¿Oye, qué pasó?

Are you OK?

Paciencia y fe!
Paciencia y fe!

Let me see it again!

We kept it safe

So we survived the night;
What happens today?

A third for you

Uh huh, uh huh! Uh huh, uh huh!

A third for me!

No pare! Sigue, sigue!

The rest for Sonny—
And with our share of the money
And with our share of the money—
Dream of the seaside air!
See me beside you there!
Think of the hundreds of stories we will share!
You and I!

Ayy…

Now you can sell your store!
Open a bar by the shore!
I’ve told you hundreds of stories
About home; make some more

More…

Yo! I know just where to go!
There’s a little beach named Playa Rincón
With no road, you need a rowboat or motorbike
To reach this beach, it’s just a stone’s throw
From home
My folks’ home
Before I was born
Before they passed on
And left me on my own, in New York, with the grocery store
They would talk about home, I listened closely for
The way they whispered to each other
‘Bout the warmer winter weather
Inseparable, they even got sick together
They never got better… passed away that December
And left me with these memories like dyin’ embers
From a dream I can’t remember…
Ever since then it’s like
Another day deeper in debt with different dilemmas
The bodega’s a mess, I’ll be seeing less of Vanessa
Abuela I don’t know how I can keep it together!

Remember the story of your name...
It was engraved on a passing ship on the day your family came
Your father said “Usnavi,​
That’s what we’ll name the baby.”

It really said “U.S. Navy,” but hey…
I worked with what they gave me okay…

They’d be so proud of you today!

Then by the end of July

Uh huh, uh huh! Uh huh, uh huh!

Out where the sea meets the sky!

No pare! Sigue, sigue!

Think of the hundreds of stories
We’ll create
You and I!
Ay…

We’ll find your island—

I’ll find my island sky

Ay, find your island—

But whatever we do it’s—

You and I!Oh my god, enough!
Now you listen to me…

Mom…

Carajo, I said enough!
I’m sick of all this fighting!

Cami…

Yapapapapa!
I think you’ve said enough
Now listen to what I say
What I say goes!
Papi, you’ve pushed us all away

I’m trying to…

I don’t wanna hear it! We make decisions as a family
And throwing Benny out like that?
You sound just like your father!
We both know what a sonofabitch he was!
You think it all comes down to you…

Cami, let’s talk about it…

No no no no no!
No no no no no! No, you don’t!
When you have a problem you come home
You don’t go off and make matters worse on your own
One day you’re gonna come back home
And you’re not gonna find me waiting any more

I’m sorry…

Huh. Damn right you’re sorry.​
So you stayed out all night

Mom…

I’m talking now!
You scared us half to death, you know that right?

I’m sorry—

Don’t apologize to me. You save it for your father

What?

Look at your father
He doesn’t sleep when you’re gone
He’s worked his whole life to help you go farther
And he can’t admit when he’s wrong
Now who does that remind you of?
You two deserve each other!
For months you lied to us
What did we do…
To make you think we wouldn’t do anything and everything for you?
When you have a problem, you come home
You don’t run off and hide from your family all alone!
You hear me?
When you have a problem, you come home
As long as we’re alive, you’re never on your own
Leave Benny!
Take Benny!
It doesn’t make any difference, as long as you come home!

Camila—

No no no no no!
Enough lying!
Enough screaming!
I’m done trying
And I'm leaving it up to you!
It’s up to you!
I’ll see you both back home!
Enough!Hey! Hey!
What’s this tonterÍa that I’m seeing on the street?
I never thought I’d see the day…
Since when are Latin people scared of heat?
When I was a little girl
Growing up in the hills of Vega Alta
My favorite time of year was Christmas time!
Ask me why!

Why?

There wasn’t an ounce of snow
But oh, the coquito would flow!
As we sang the Aguinaldo
The carnaval would begin to grow!
Business is closed, and we’re about to go…
Let’s have a carnaval del barrio!

¡Wepa!

You can’t even go to a club with a friend
Without having somebody shove you!

Ay, por favor
Vanessa, don’t pretend that Usnavi’s your friend
We all know that he looooove you!

Ohhhh!!

Wow, now that you mention that sexual tension is easy to see!

Yo, this is bogus!

Wow, it involves large amounts, it’s
Somewhere in the range of ninety-six thousand!
Atención, I’m closin’ shop!
Sonny, grab everybody a soda-pop!
Yo, grab a bottle, kiss it up to God
‘Cause Abuela Claudia just won the lotto!

And Benny went and stole the girl
That I’m in love with?
She was my babysitter first!

Hoo!

Listen up, is that
What y’all want?
We close the bodega
The neighborhood is gone!
They selling the dispatch
And they closing the salón
And they’ll never turn the lights back on, ‘cause—

We are powerless, we are powerless!

And y’all keep dancin’ and singin’ and celebratin’
And it’s gettin’ late and this place disintegratin’ and—

We are powerless, we are powerless!

Alright, we’re powerless, so light up a candle!
There’s nothing going on here that we can’t handle!

You don’t understand, I’m not trying to be funny!

We’re gonna give a third of the money to you Sonny!

What?

Yeah, yeah…

For real?

Yes!
Maybe you’re right, Sonny, call in the coroners!
Maybe we’re powerless, a corner full of foreigners
Maybe this neighborhood’s changing forever
Maybe tonight is our last night together, however!
How do you want to face it?
Do you wanna waste it, when the end is so close you can taste it?
Y’all could cry with your head in the sand
I’m a fly this flag that I got in my hand!

¡Pa’rriba esa bandera!

Hey!

¡Álzala donde quiera!

Hey!

Can we raise our voice tonight?
Can we make a little noise tonight?

Hey!

They can hear us across the bridge in East Secaucus?

Hey!Atención, atención
Roll down your windows
Turn up your radios
Un momento, por favor
Atención, atención
Please drive slow
Let everybody know
Abuela Claudia passed away
At noon todayShe was found and pronounced… at the scene
She was already lying in bed
The paramedics said
That her heart gave out…
I mean, that’s basically what they said. They said
A combination of the stress and the heat…
Why she never took her medicine, I’ll never understand
I’d like to think she went out in peace
With pieces of bread crumbs in her hand
Abuela Claudia had simple pleasures
She sang the praises of things we ignore
Glass Coke bottles, bread crumbs, a sky full of stars
She cherished these things, she’d say: “Alabanza.”
Alabanza means to raise this
Thing to God’s face
And to sing, quite literally: “Praise to this.”
When she was here, the path was clear
And she was just here, she was just here…

AlabanzaIn this album there’s a picture
Of the ladies at Daniela’s
You can tell it’s from the eighties
By the volume of their hair
There’s Usnavi, just a baby
‘Eighty-seven, Halloween
If it happened on this block, Abuela was there
Every afternoon I came
She’d make sure I did my homework
She could barely write her name
But even so…
She would stare at the paper
And tell me
“Bueno, let’s review
Why don’t you tell me
Everything you know.”
In this album there’s a picture
Of Abuela in Havana
She is holding a rag doll
Unsmiling, black and white
I wonder what she’s thinking
Does she know that she’ll be leaving
For the city on a cold, dark night?
And on the day they ran
Did she dream of endless summer?
Did her mother have a plan?
Or did they just go?
Did somebody sit her down and say
“Claudia, get ready, to leave
Behind everything you know”?
Everything I know
What do I know?
In this folder there’s a picture
From my high school graduation
With the program, mint condition
And a star beside my name
Here’s a picture of my parents
As I left for California
She saved everything we gave her
Every little scrap of paper
And our lives are in these boxes
While the woman who held us is gone
But we go on, we grow, so…
Hold tight, Abuela, if you’re up there
I’ll make you proud of everything I know!
Thank you, for everything I knowOh, qué calor, qué calor, qué calor, qué calo-o-or!
Piragua, piragua
New block of ice, piragua
Piragua, piragua
So sweet and nice, piragua
Tengo de mango
Tengo de parcha
De piña y de fresa!
Tengo de china, de limón
De peso y de peseta, hey!
Piragua, piragua
New block of ice, piragua
Piragua, piragua
So sweet and nice, piragua
It’s hotter than the islands are tonight
And Mister Softee trying to shut me down
But I keep scraping by the fading light
Hey pana, this is my town
Piragua, piragua
Keep scraping by, piragua
Piragua, piragua
Keep scraping by, piragua
Keep scraping by, keep scraping by…
Lai lo le lo lai! Lai lo le lo lai!
Keep scraping by, keep scraping by…
Lai lo le lo lai!
Keep scraping by…
Oh, qué calor, qué calor, qué calor, qué calo-o-or!So I got you a present
I went downtown to get it
Doing anything tonight?

Cleaning

Done for the day

No way

‘Cuz we got a date

Okay—

Before you board that plane
I owe you a bottle of cold champagne

No…

Yeah, cold champagne

Damn, the bottle’s all sweaty and everything
You went and got this—

Pop the champagne

I don’t know if we have coffee cups
Or plastic cups, I think Sonny has the cups—

Tonight we’re drinking straight from the bottle. Usnavi?

Yeah?

Daniela told me what you did for me
And it’s honestly the sweetest thing anyone ever did for me
Now, what can I say or do to possibly repay you for your kindness?

How do you get this gold shit off?

Usnavi!

Yeah!

Before we both leave town!
Before the corner changes and the signs are taken down
Let’s walk around the neighborhood and say our goodbyes
Usnavi, are you alright?

I’m fine, I’m tryn’a open this champagne
Y'see the twisty thing is broken
But I’m gonna open this damn champagne!

Lemme see it

No, I got it!

Yo, Usnavi, drop the champagne!

I mean you went to all this trouble to get us a little bubbly—

And it’s gonna be okay

I’m sorry, it’s been a long day

You oughta stay

What?

You can use that money to fix this place

Ha ha, very funny

And it’s not like Sonny’s got role models—

Role models?

Stepping up to the plate—

Yo, what are you talking about?

I’m just saying, I think your vacation can wait—

Vacation? Vanessa, you’re leaving too—

I’m going down to West Fourth Street; you can take the A—

What are you trying to say?

You’re leaving the country, and we’re never gonna see you again—

What are you trying to say?

You get everyone addicted to your coffee then off you go

Vanessa, I don’t know why you’re mad at me

I wish I was mad—
I’m just too lateWhen the sun goes down
You’re gonna need a flashlight
You’re gonna need a candle—

I think I can manage that

When you leave town
I’m gonna buy you a calling card

‘Cuz I’m falling hard for you

I go back on Labor Day

And I will try to make my way

Out west to California

So we’ve got this summer

And we’ve got each other
Perhaps even longer

When you’re on your own
And suddenly without me
Will you forget about me?

I couldn’t if I tried

When I’m all alone
And I close my eyes

That’s when I’ll see your face again

And when you’re gone
You know that I’ll be waiting when you’re gone

But you’re here with me right now…

We’ll be working hard, but if we should drift apart

Benny—

Lemme take this moment just to say—

No, no—

You are gonna change the world some day—

I’ll be thinking of home—

And I’ll think of you every night
At the same time—

When the sun goes down

When the sun goes down

When the sun goes downNo te vayas
Si me dejas
Si te alejas de mi
Seguirás en mis recuerdos para siempre
Para siempre, para siempre
Para siem—
Para siem—
Para siempre…

Lights out on Washington Heights
And now the crack of dawn
The blackout goes on and on and on…

Para siempre

Sonny’s out back, sortin’ the trash
As I think about the past with a sack full of cash

Para siempre

Abuela really wanted me up on a beach
With margaritas in my reach, and
Soon that’s how it’s gonna be…

Para siempre

Imagine me, leavin’ today
On a seven-forty-seven boardin’ JFK…

The hydrants are open
Cool breezes blow…

The hydrants are open
Cool breezes blow…

Piragua!
Good morning
The hydrants are open
Piragua!
New block of ice, piragua!
Cool breezes blow
So sweet and nice, piragua!
Piragua!
Piragua!

Piragua!
Good morning
The hydrants are open
(Siempre)
Piragua!
New block of ice, piragua!
(Seguirás en mis recuerdos)
Cool breezes blow
So sweet and nice, piragua!
(Para siempre...)
Piragua!
Piragua!

Piragua!
Good morning
The hydrants are open
I'll be downtown...
(Siempre)
Piragua!
New block of ice, piragua!
(Seguirás en mis recuerdos)
Cool breezes blow
So sweet and nice, piragua!
It won't be long now...
(Para siempre...)
Piragua!
Piragua!

There’s a breeze off the Hudson
And just when
You think you’re sick of living here the memory floods in
The morning light, off the fire escapes
The nights in Bennett Park blasting Big Pun tapes
I’m ‘a miss this place, to tell you the truth:
Kevin dispensin’ wisdom from his dispatch booth
And at dawn, Vanessa at the salon, we gotta move on
But who’s gonna notice we’re gone?
When our job’s done, as the evening winds
Down to a crawl, son, can I ease my mind
When we’re all done? When we’ve resigned
In the long run, what do we leave behind?
Most of all, I’ll miss Abuela’s whispers
Doin’ the Lotto Pick Six every Christmas
In five years, when this whole city’s rich folks and hipsters
Who’s gonna miss this raggedy little business?

What it do? Ha ha, great sunlight this morning.​

Yo cuz! We fixed the grate!

What did I tell you about this punk?

You have to commission an artist while his rate is still good.​

It’s the first work in my new series.​
He rolls down the grate. Silence

He hates it.​

Shh. He’s forming an artistic opinion.​

You did this last night?

Yeah.​

There goes my flight.​

What?

Graffiti Pete you’re gonna need some new cans
Here’s some money, finish up
There’s been a slight change of plans!

Nice!

Listen up guys, you got a job, I’m not playin’
You gotta go now, tell the whole block I’m stayin’!
Go ahead, tell everyone we know!
Sonny…
Alright, go!
Yeah, I’m a streetlight!
Chillin’ in the heat!
I illuminate the stories of the people in the street
Some have happy endings
Some are bittersweet
But I know them all and that’s what makes my life complete

We’re home!

And if not me, who keeps our legacies?
Who’s gonna keep the coffee sweet with secret recipes?
Abuela, rest in peace, you live in my memories
But Sonny’s gotta eat, and this corner is my destiny

We’re home!

Brings out the best in me, we pass a test and we
Keep pressin’ and yes indeed, you know I’ll never leave
If you close your eyes that hydrant is a beach
That siren is a breeze, that fire escape’s a leaf on a palm tree!
[CARLA/DANIELA/NINA/CAMILA/
VANESSA/SONNY/PIRAGUA GUY/KEVIN]
We’re home!

Abuela I’m sorry
But I ain’t goin’ back because I’m telling your story
And I can say goodbye to you smilin’, I found my island
I been on it this whole time
I’m home!

We’re home!
The hydrants are open
Cool breezes blow!

It’s a wonderful life that I’ve know
“Merry Christmas you ole’ Building and Loan!”
I’m home!

We’re home!
The hydrants are open
Cool breezes blow!

Abuela that ain’t a stoop, that’s your throne
Long after ya birds have all flown

I’m home!
Where the coffee’s non-stop
And I drop this hip-hop
In my mom and pop shop
I’m home!
Where people come
People go
Let me show all of these
People what I know
There’s no place like home!
And let me set the record straight!
I’m steppin’ to Vanessa
I’m gettin’ a second date
I’m home!
Where it’s a hundred in the shade
But with patience and faith
We remain unafraid
I’m home!
You hear that music in the air?
Take the train to the top of the world
And I’m there
I’m home!
