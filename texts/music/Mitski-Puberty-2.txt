Happy came to visit me, he bought cookies on the way
I poured him tea and he told me it'll all be okay
Well, I told him I'd do anything to have him stay with me
So he laid me down, and I felt Happy come inside of me
He laid me down, and I felt happy

Oh, if you're going, take the train
So I can hear it rumble, one last rumble
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you

I was in the bathroom, I didn't hear him leave
I locked the door behind him and I turned around to see
All the cookie wrappers and the empty cups of tea
Well, I sighed and mumbled to myself, again I have to clean
I sighed and mumbled to myself

If you're going, take the train
So I can hear it rumble, one last rumble
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you

And if you're going, take the moon
Then maybe I will see you, in the night I'll see you
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more youDan had very long limbs
From leading day to day
Hanging onto a cliff
That stretched him everyday
And when she'd ask to hold hands
He would smile and
Let one of his hands go
His whole life in one hand
His whole life
And when he'd say goodnight and
Leave her doorstep
He'd use his last strength
To wave back
And once back in his room
Once back in his room
He'd return his waving hand
Back to its cliff
He liked her more than life itself
I'm sure
'Cause Dan had never danced outside of his room
When no one was home and he would start to hear the door
So when he moved with you
And felt his body let go
Of course you couldn't know
It was you and you alone
That he had shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
And he would never tell you that it was his first timeIn the rearview mirror
I saw the setting sun on your neck
And felt the taste of you bubble up inside me
But with everybody watching us
Our every move
We do have reputations
We keep it secret
Won't let them have it

So come inside and be with me
Alone with me
Alone
With me alone
If you would let me give you pinky promise kisses
Then I wouldn't have to scream your name atop of every roof in the city of my heart
If I could see you
Once more to see you

Come inside and be with me
Alone with me
Alone
With me alone
If you would let me give you pinky promise kisses
Then I wouldn't have to scream your name atop of every roof in the city of my heart
If I could see you
Once more to see you
If I could see you
Once more to see youOne morning this sadness will fossilize
And I will forget how to cry
I'll keep going to work and you won't see a change
Save perhaps a slight gray in my eye
I will go jogging routinely
Calmly and rhythmically run
And when I find that a knife's sticking out of my side
I'll pull it out without questioning why

And then one warm summer night
I'll hear fireworks outside
And I'll listen to the memories as they cry, cry, cry

I will be married to silence
The gentleman won't say a word
But you know, oh, you know in the quiet he holds
Runs a river that will never find home

And then one warm summer night
I'll hear fireworks outside
And I'll listen to the memories as they cry, cry, cry
Oh, one warm summer night
I'll hear fireworks outside
And I'll listen to the memories as they cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cryIf I could, I'd be your little spoon
And kiss your fingers forevermore
But, big spoon, you have so much to do
And I have nothing ahead of me

You're the sun, you've never seen the night
But you hear its song from the morning birds
Well, I'm not the moon, I'm not even a star
But awake at night I'll be singing to the birds

Don't wait for me, I can't come

Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
But I do, I think I do
And you're an all-American boy
I guess I couldn't help trying to be your best American girl

You're the one
You're all I ever wanted
I think I'll regret this

Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
But I do, I finally do
And you're an all-American boy
I guess I couldn't help trying to be the best American girl

Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
But I do, I think I doMy baby, my baby
You're my baby, say it to me
Baby, my baby
Tell your baby that I'm your baby
I bet on losing dogs
I know they're losing and I pay for my place
By the ring
Where I'll be looking in their eyes when they're down
I'll be there on their side
I'm losing by their side
Will you let me, baby
Lose on losing dogs?
I know they're losing and I pay for my place
By the ring
Where I'll be looking in their eyes when they're down
I wanna feel it
I bet on losing dogs
I always want you when I'm finally fine
How you'd be over me looking in my eyes when I cum
Someone to watch me die
Someone to watch me die
I bet on losing dogs
Did you get that?I'm not doing anything
I'm not doing anything
My body's made of crushed little stars
And I'm not doing anything

I wanna see the whole world
I wanna see the whole world
I don't know how I'm gonna pay rent
I wanna see the whole world

Would you kill me, Jerusalem?
Kill me, Jerusalem
Kill me, Jerusalem
Come find me

I better ace that interview
I better ace that interview
I should tell them that I'm not afraid to die
I better ace that interview

Uh
I work better under a deadline
I work better under a deadline
I pick an age when I'm gonna disappear
Until then I can try again
Until then I can try again

Kill me, Jerusalem
Kill me, Jerusalem
Kill me, Jerusalem
Go and kill meGlory, glory, glory to the night
That shows me what I am
As I go to the party on my knees
Saying "Take it all, please...

And tell me no
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no"
Somebody, please
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Tell me no

Glory, glory, glory to the night
It shows me what I am (Glory)
I'm not happy or sad, just up or down
And always bad

Tell me no
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Somebody, please
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Tell me no
Somebody here
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Tell me noWhat do you do with a loving feeling
If the loving feeling makes you all alone?
What do you do with a loving feeling
If they only love you when you're all alone?

Holding hands under a table
Meeting up in your bedroom
Making love to other people
Telling each other it's all good
Kisses like pink cotton candy
Talking to everyone but me
I'm staying up late just in case you come up and ask to leave with me

What do you do with a loving feeling
If the loving feeling makes you all alone?
What do you do with a loving feeling
If they only love you when you're all alone?
What do you do with a loving feeling
If the loving feeling makes you all alone?
What do you do with a loving feeling
If they only love you when you're all alone?

You only love me when we're all aloneDown empty streets sniffing glue me and you
Blank open eyes watch the moonflower bloom
It's been a long hard twenty-year summer vacation
All these twenty years trying to fill the void

Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you had it once
And you know that you want it back
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you're needing it
And you know that you need it bad

With wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones

Went to your room thinking maybe you'll feel something
But all I saw was your burning body waiting
All these twenty years on a vacation

Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you had it once
And you know that you want it back
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you're needing it
And you know that you need it bad
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you want it
Yeah you know that you want it
You know that you
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you need it
And you know that you need it bad

With wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bonesToday I will wear my white button-down
I'm tired of wanting more
I think I'm finally worn
For you have a way of promising things
And I've been a forest fire
I am a forest fire
And I am the fire and I am the forest
And I am a witness watching it
I stand in a valley watching it
And you are not there at all

So today I will wear my white button-down
I can at least be neat
Walk out and be seen as clean
And I'll go to work and I'll go to sleep
And I'll love the littler things
I'll love some littler things
