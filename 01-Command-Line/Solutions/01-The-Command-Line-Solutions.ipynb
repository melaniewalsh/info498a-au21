      "It is very seldom that mere ordinary people like John and myself secure\n",
      "ancestral halls for the summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "A colonial mansion, a hereditary estate, I would say a haunted house,\n",
      "and reach the height of romantic felicity—but that would be asking too\n",
      "much of fate!\n",
      "\n",
      "Still I will proudly declare that there is something queer about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Else, why should it be let so cheaply? And why have stood so long\n",
      "untenanted?\n",
      "\n",
      "John laughs at me, of course, but one expects that in marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "John is practical in the extreme. He has no patience with faith, an\n",
      "intense horror of superstition, and he scoffs openly at any talk of\n",
      "things not to be felt and seen and put down in figures.\n",
      "\n",
      "John is a physician, and perhaps—(I would not say it to a living soul,\n",
      "of course, but this is dead paper and a great relief to my\n",
      "mind)—perhaps that is one reason I do not get well faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "You see, he does not believe I am sick!\n",

      "And what can one do?\n",
      "\n",
      "If a physician of high standing, and one’s own husband, assures friends\n",
      "and relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but\n",
      "temporary nervous depression—a slight hysterical tendency—what is one\n",
      "to do?\n",
      "\n",
      "My brother is also a physician, and also of high standing, and he says\n",
      "the same thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I take phosphates or phosphites—whichever it is, and tonics, and\n",
      "journeys, and air, and exercise, and am absolutely forbidden to “work”\n",
      "until I am well again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personally, I disagree with their ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personally, I believe that congenial work, with excitement and change,\n",
      "would do me good.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what is one to do?\n",
      "\n",
      "I did write for a while in spite of them; but it does exhaust me a good\n",
      "deal—having to be so sly about it, or else meet with heavy opposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and\n",
      "more society and stimulus—but John says the very worst thing I can do\n",
      "is to think about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel\n",
      "bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I will let it alone and talk about the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most beautiful place! It is quite alone, standing well back from\n",
      "the road, quite three miles from the village. It makes me think of\n",
      "English places that you read about, for there are hedges and walls and\n",
      "gates that lock, and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners\n",
      "and people.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a delicious garden! I never saw such a garden—large and shady,\n",
      "full of box-bordered paths, and lined with long grape-covered arbors\n",
      "with seats under them.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were greenhouses, too, but they are all broken now.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was some legal trouble, I believe, something about the heirs and\n",
      "co-heirs; anyhow, the place has been empty for years.\n",
      "\n",
      "That spoils my ghostliness, I am afraid; but I don’t care—there is\n",
      "something strange about the house—I can feel it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I even said so to John one moonlight evening, but he said what I felt\n",
      "was a draught, and shut the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "I get unreasonably angry with John sometimes. I’m sure I never used to\n",
      "be so sensitive. I think it is due to this nervous condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "But John says if I feel so I shall neglect proper self-control; so I\n",
      "take pains to control myself,—before him, at least,—and that makes me\n",
      "very tired.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t like our room a bit. I wanted one downstairs that opened on the\n",
      "piazza and had roses all over the window, and such pretty old-fashioned\n",
      "chintz hangings! but John would not hear of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no\n",
      "near room for him if he took another.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special\n",
      "direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a schedule prescription for each hour in the day; he takes all\n",
      "care from me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said we came here solely on my account, that I was to have perfect\n",
      "rest and all the air I could get. “Your exercise depends on your\n",
      "strength, my dear,” said he, “and your food somewhat on your appetite;\n",
      "but air you can absorb all the time.” So we took the nursery, at the\n",
      "top of the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a big, airy room, the whole floor nearly, with windows that look\n",
      "all ways, and air and sunshine galore. It was nursery first and then\n",
      "playground and gymnasium, I should judge; for the windows are barred\n",
      "for little children, and there are rings and things in the walls.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paint and paper look as if a boys’ school had used it. It is\n",
      "stripped off—the paper—in great patches all around the head of my bed,\n",
      "about as far as I can reach, and in a great place on the other side of\n",
      "the room low down. I never saw a worse paper in my life.\n",

      "constantly irritate, and provoke study, and when you follow the lame,\n",
      "uncertain curves for a little distance they suddenly commit\n",
      "suicide—plunge off at outrageous angles, destroy themselves in\n",
      "unheard-of contradictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The color is repellant, almost revolting; a smouldering, unclean\n",
      "yellow, strangely faded by the slow-turning sunlight.\n",

      "word.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have been here two weeks, and I haven’t felt like writing before,\n",

      "reason to suffer, and that satisfies him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course it is only nervousness. It does weigh on me so not to do my\n",
      "duty in any way!\n",
      "\n",
      "I meant to be such a help to John, such a real rest and comfort, and\n",

      "And yet I cannot be with him, it makes me so nervous.\n",
      "\n",

      "this wallpaper!\n",
      "\n",
      "At first he meant to repaper the room, but afterwards he said that I\n",
      "was letting it get the better of me, and that nothing was worse for a\n",
      "nervous patient than to give way to such fancies.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said that after the wallpaper was changed it would be the heavy\n",
      "bedstead, and then the barred windows, and then that gate at the head\n",
      "of the stairs, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know the place is doing you good,” he said, “and really, dear, I\n",

      "Out of another I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private\n",

      "runs down there from the house. I always fancy I see people walking in\n",
      "these numerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give\n",
      "way to fancy in the least. He says that with my imaginative power and\n",
      "habit of story-making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to\n",
      "all manner of excited fancies, and that I ought to use my will and good\n",
      "sense to check the tendency. So I try.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think sometimes that if I were only well enough to write a little it\n",

      "\n",
      "But I find I get pretty tired when I try.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about my\n",

      "\n",
      "I wish I could get well faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I must not think about that. This paper looks to me as if it knew\n",

      "I get positively angry with the impertinence of it and the\n",
      "everlastingness. Up and down and sideways they crawl, and those absurd,\n",
      "unblinking eyes are everywhere. There is one place where two breadths\n",
      "didn’t match, and the eyes go all up and down the line, one a little\n",
      "higher than the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never saw so much expression in an inanimate thing before, and we all\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The furniture in this room is no worse than inharmonious, however, for\n",
      "we had to bring it all from downstairs. I suppose when this was used as\n",
      "a playroom they had to take the nursery things out, and no wonder! I\n",
      "never saw such ravages as the children have made here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wallpaper, as I said before, is torn off in spots, and it sticketh\n",

      "hatred.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the floor is scratched and gouged and splintered, the plaster\n",
      "itself is dug out here and there, and this great heavy bed, which is\n",
      "all we found in the room, looks as if it had been through the wars.\n",

      "But I don’t mind it a bit—only the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "There comes John’s sister. Such a dear girl as she is, and so careful\n",
      "of me! I must not let her find me writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is a perfect, and enthusiastic housekeeper, and hopes for no better\n",
      "profession. I verily believe she thinks it is the writing which made me\n",
      "sick!\n",
      "\n",
      "But I can write when she is out, and see her a long way off from these\n",
      "windows.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is one that commands the road, a lovely, shaded, winding road,\n",
      "and one that just looks off over the country. A lovely country, too,\n",
      "full of great elms and velvet meadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "This wallpaper has a kind of sub-pattern in a different shade, a\n",
      "particularly irritating one, for you can only see it in certain lights,\n",
      "and not clearly then.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the places where it isn’t faded, and where the sun is just so, I\n",
      "can see a strange, provoking, formless sort of figure, that seems to\n",
      "sulk about behind that silly and conspicuous front design.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s sister on the stairs!\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, the Fourth of July is over! The people are gone and I am tired\n",
      "out. John thought it might do me good to see a little company, so we\n",
      "just had mother and Nellie and the children down for a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course I didn’t do a thing. Jennie sees to everything now.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it tired me all the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "John says if I don’t pick up faster he shall send me to Weir Mitchell\n",
      "in the fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I don’t want to go there at all. I had a friend who was in his\n",

      "so!\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, it is such an undertaking to go so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t feel as if it was worth while to turn my hand over for\n",
      "anything, and I’m getting dreadfully fretful and querulous.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cry at nothing, and cry most of the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course I don’t when John is here, or anybody else, but when I am\n",
      "alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I am alone a good deal just now. John is kept in town very often by\n",
      "serious cases, and Jennie is good and lets me alone when I want her to.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I walk a little in the garden or down that lovely lane, sit on the\n",
      "porch under the roses, and lie down up here a good deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m getting really fond of the room in spite of the wallpaper. Perhaps\n",
      "because of the wallpaper.\n",
      "\n",
      "It dwells in my mind so!\n",
      "\n",
      "I lie here on this great immovable bed—it is nailed down, I believe—and\n",
      "follow that pattern about by the hour. It is as good as gymnastics, I\n",
      "assure you. I start, we’ll say, at the bottom, down in the corner over\n",
      "there where it has not been touched, and I determine for the thousandth\n",
      "time that I will follow that pointless pattern to some sort of a\n",
      "conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know a little of the principle of design, and I know this thing was\n",
      "not arranged on any laws of radiation, or alternation, or repetition,\n",
      "or symmetry, or anything else that I ever heard of.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is repeated, of course, by the breadths, but not otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looked at in one way each breadth stands alone, the bloated curves and\n",
      "flourishes—a kind of “debased Romanesque” with delirium tremens—go\n",
      "waddling up and down in isolated columns of fatuity.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, on the other hand, they connect diagonally, and the sprawling\n",

      "wallowing seaweeds in full chase.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole thing goes horizontally, too, at least it seems so, and I\n",
      "exhaust myself in trying to distinguish the order of its going in that\n",
      "direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have used a horizontal breadth for a frieze, and that adds\n",
      "wonderfully to the confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is one end of the room where it is almost intact, and there, when\n",
      "the cross-lights fade and the low sun shines directly upon it, I can\n",
      "almost fancy radiation after all,—the interminable grotesques seem to\n",
      "form around a common centre and rush off in headlong plunges of equal\n",
      "distraction.\n",

      "\n",
      "Dear John! He loves me very dearly, and hates to have me sick. I tried\n",

      "\n",
      "I turned it off with a laugh. I had no intention of telling him it was\n",

      "\n",
      "I’m feeling ever so much better! I don’t sleep much at night, for it is\n",

      "daytime.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the daytime it is tiresome and perplexing.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are always new shoots on the fungus, and new shades of yellow all\n",

      "\n",
      "It is the strangest yellow, that wallpaper! It makes me think of all\n",

      "old foul, bad yellow things.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is something else about that paper—the smell! I noticed it\n",
      "the moment we came into the room, but with so much air and sun it was\n",
      "not bad. Now we have had a week of fog and rain, and whether the\n",
      "windows are open or not, the smell is here.\n",
      "\n",
      "It creeps all over the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "I find it hovering in the dining-room, skulking in the parlor, hiding\n",

      "It gets into my hair.\n",
      "\n",

      "it—there is that smell!\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a peculiar odor, too! I have spent hours in trying to analyze it,\n",
      "to find what it smelled like.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not bad—at first, and very gentle, but quite the subtlest, most\n",
      "enduring odor I ever met.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this damp weather it is awful. I wake up in the night and find it\n",
      "hanging over me.\n",
      "\n",
      "It used to disturb me at first. I thought seriously of burning the\n",
      "house—to reach the smell.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now I am used to it. The only thing I can think of that it is like\n",
      "is the color of the paper! A yellow smell.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a very funny mark on this wall, low down, near the mopboard. A\n",
      "streak that runs round the room. It goes behind every piece of\n",
      "furniture, except the bed, a long, straight, even smooch, as if it had\n",
      "been rubbed over and over.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder how it was done and who did it, and what they did it for.\n",
      "Round and round and round—round and round and round—it makes me dizzy!\n",
      "\n",
      "I really have discovered something at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through watching so much at night, when it changes so, I have finally\n",
      "found out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The front pattern does move—and no wonder! The woman behind shakes it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes I think there are a great many women behind, and sometimes\n",
      "only one, and she crawls around fast, and her crawling shakes it all\n",
      "over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then in the very bright spots she keeps still, and in the very shady\n",
      "spots she just takes hold of the bars and shakes them hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "And she is all the time trying to climb through. But nobody could climb\n",
      "through that pattern—it strangles so; I think that is why it has so\n",
      "many heads.\n",
      "\n",
      "They get through, and then the pattern strangles them off and turns\n",
      "them upside-down, and makes their eyes white!\n",
      "\n",
      "If those heads were covered or taken off it would not be half so bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that woman gets out in the daytime!\n",
      "\n",
      "And I’ll tell you why—privately—I’ve seen her!\n",
      "\n",
      "I can see her out of every one of my windows!\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the same woman, I know, for she is always creeping, and most\n",
      "women do not creep by daylight.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see her on that long shaded lane, creeping up and down. I see her in\n",
      "those dark grape arbors, creeping all around the garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see her on that long road under the trees, creeping along, and when a\n",
      "carriage comes she hides under the blackberry vines.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t blame her a bit. It must be very humiliating to be caught\n",
      "creeping by daylight!\n",
      "\n",
      "I always lock the door when I creep by daylight. I can’t do it at\n",
      "night, for I know John would suspect something at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "And John is so queer now, that I don’t want to irritate him. I wish he\n",
      "would take another room! Besides, I don’t want anybody to get that\n",
      "woman out at night but myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I often wonder if I could see her out of all the windows at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, turn as fast as I can, I can only see out of one at one time.\n",
      "\n",
      "And though I always see her she may be able to creep faster than I can\n",
      "turn!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have watched her sometimes away off in the open country, creeping as\n",
      "fast as a cloud shadow in a high wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "If only that top pattern could be gotten off from the under one! I mean\n",
      "to try it, little by little.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have found out another funny thing, but I shan’t tell it this time!\n",
      "It does not do to trust people too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are only two more days to get this paper off, and I believe John\n",
      "is beginning to notice. I don’t like the look in his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I heard him ask Jennie a lot of professional questions about me.\n",
      "She had a very good report to give.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said I slept a good deal in the daytime.\n",
      "\n",
      "John knows I don’t sleep very well at night, for all I’m so quiet!\n",
      "\n",
      "He asked me all sorts of questions, too, and pretended to be very\n",
      "loving and kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "As if I couldn’t see through him!\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, I don’t wonder he acts so, sleeping under this paper for three\n",
      "months.\n",
      "\n",
      "It only interests me, but I feel sure John and Jennie are secretly\n",
      "affected by it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hurrah! This is the last day, but it is enough. John is to stay in town\n",
      "over night, and won’t be out until this evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jennie wanted to sleep with me—the sly thing! but I told her I should\n",
      "undoubtedly rest better for a night all alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was clever, for really I wasn’t alone a bit! As soon as it was\n",
      "moonlight, and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern, I\n",
      "got up and ran to help her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I pulled and she shook, I shook and she pulled, and before morning we\n",
      "had peeled off yards of that paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "A strip about as high as my head and half around the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then when the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me\n",
      "I declared I would finish it to-day!\n",
      "\n",
      "We go away to-morrow, and they are moving all my furniture down again\n",
      "to leave things as they were before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jennie looked at the wall in amazement, but I told her merrily that I\n",
      "did it out of pure spite at the vicious thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed and said she wouldn’t mind doing it herself, but I must not\n",
      "get tired.\n",
      "\n",
      "How she betrayed herself that time!\n",
      "\n",
      "But I am here, and no person touches this paper but me—not alive!\n",
      "\n",
      "She tried to get me out of the room—it was too patent! But I said it\n",
      "was so quiet and empty and clean now that I believed I would lie down\n",
      "again and sleep all I could; and not to wake me even for dinner—I would\n",
      "call when I woke.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now she is gone, and the servants are gone, and the things are gone,\n",
      "and there is nothing left but that great bedstead nailed down, with the\n",
      "canvas mattress we found on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shall sleep downstairs to-night, and take the boat home to-morrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "I quite enjoy the room, now it is bare again.\n",
      "\n",
      "How those children did tear about here!\n",
      "\n",
      "This bedstead is fairly gnawed!\n",
      "\n",
      "But I must get to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have locked the door and thrown the key down into the front path.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t want to go out, and I don’t want to have anybody come in, till\n",
      "John comes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to astonish him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve got a rope up here that even Jennie did not find. If that woman\n",
      "does get out, and tries to get away, I can tie her!\n",
      "\n",
      "But I forgot I could not reach far without anything to stand on!\n",
      "\n",
      "This bed will not move!\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried to lift and push it until I was lame, and then I got so angry I\n",
      "bit off a little piece at one corner—but it hurt my teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I peeled off all the paper I could reach standing on the floor. It\n",
      "sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it! All those strangled\n",
      "heads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with\n",
      "derision!\n",
      "\n",
      "I am getting angry enough to do something desperate. To jump out of the\n",
      "window would be admirable exercise, but the bars are too strong even to\n",
      "try.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides I wouldn’t do it. Of course not. I know well enough that a step\n",
      "like that is improper and might be misconstrued.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t like to look out of the windows even—there are so many of those\n",
      "creeping women, and they creep so fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if they all come out of that wallpaper as I did?\n",
      "\n",
      "But I am securely fastened now by my well-hidden rope—you don’t get me\n",
      "out in the road there!\n",
      "\n",
      "I suppose I shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes\n",
      "night, and that is hard!\n",
      "\n",
      "It is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as I\n",
      "please!\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t want to go outside. I won’t, even if Jennie asks me to.\n",
      "\n",
      "For outside you have to creep on the ground, and everything is green\n",
      "instead of yellow.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here I can creep smoothly on the floor, and my shoulder just fits\n",
      "in that long smooch around the wall, so I cannot lose my way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, there’s John at the door!\n",
      "\n",
      "It is no use, young man, you can’t open it!\n",
      "\n",
      "How he does call and pound!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now he’s crying for an axe.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be a shame to break down that beautiful door!\n",
      "\n",
      "“John dear!” said I in the gentlest voice, “the key is down by the\n",
      "front steps, under a plantain leaf!”\n",
      "\n",
      "That silenced him for a few moments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he said—very quietly indeed, “Open the door, my darling!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t,” said I. “The key is down by the front door under a plantain\n",
      "leaf!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And then I said it again, several times, very gently and slowly, and\n",
      "said it so often that he had to go and see, and he got it, of course,\n",
      "and came in. He stopped short by the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is the matter?” he cried. “For God’s sake, what are you doing!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I kept on creeping just the same, but I looked at him over my shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve got out at last,” said I, “in spite of you and Jane! And I’ve\n",
      "pulled off most of the paper, so you can’t put me back!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now why should that man have fainted? But he did, and right across my\n",
      "path by the wall, so that I had to creep over him every time!\n",
