Troubling Fact
--- 

In some of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's other writings, she expresses troublingly racist ideas. Literary scholar Dana Seitler asks:

"[H]ow can we reconcile the feminist themes of Gilman's much acclaimed short story "The Yellow Wallpaper" and her eugenic thinking? How can we reconcile the gap that extends between the contemporary feminist reclamation of "Yellow" and the rest of her fiction, like the eugenic premises of the critically under-examined and out-of-print novel The Crux?"
