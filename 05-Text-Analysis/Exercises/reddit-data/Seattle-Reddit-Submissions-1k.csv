Parsnip,2021-06-18 05:55:07+00:00,Diamantenhände (from Seattle) 💎👐 German market is open 🇩🇪,"Hello Great Apes of the world! 👋 Many thanks to u/thecactusblender for stepping in during my unexpected internet outage yesterday. Diamantenhände continues strong! It's been a week of sideways action on GME, though not in other (related?) news. Enormous jump in reverse repo activity, u/dlauer absolutely *KILLING* it on CNBC, and numerous failed attempts to break the floor only increase our resolve. Prepare your Diamantenhände as the German market leads us into a quad-witching day, and join together to watch low-frequency updates from a single German exchange as we prepare for the US pre-market to open!

##Voting rights

*As of February 19, 2021, state lawmakers have carried over, prefiled, or introduced 246 bills with provisions that restrict voting access in 43 states. By far the states with the largest number of restrictive bills are Arizona and Georgia, with at least 22 in each. It’s important to note that there have been more bills expanding voting rights filed or introduced in the same time frame: over 700 in a different set of 43 states. Source: [Brennan Center](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/state-voting-bills-tracker-2021).*

* Update: I made a [spreadsheet list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YEIWJdbZ2D4CQubHQ-mJ7RlRC8fdW234eG85tqLie9I/edit?usp=sharing) of all the restrictive voting rights bills (the one above is spread across multiple pages). Spreadsheet includes a handy chart. Maybe in the future I'll add links to each bill.

**The Supreme Court heard arguments in a critical voting rights case on Tuesday involving two Arizona laws that make it harder for some voters to cast a ballot.** The first law in question in *Brnovich v. DNC* and *Arizona Republican Party v. DNC* blocks the counting of ballots cast in the wrong precinct. The second law prohibits so-called “ballot harvesting,” or the collection of ballots by a third party who isn’t a close family member. It is unclear from [questioning](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-questions-need-restrictive-voting-laws-voting-rights-act-n1259301) which way the key justices like Chief Justice John Roberts and Trump-appointee Amy Coney Barrett are leaning, with legal observers contradicting each other on the likelihood of the Republicans’ case succeeding.

A pivotal moment in the hearing came when the Republican Party lawyer was asked by Barrett why the party cared about whether votes cast in the wrong precinct should be counted. He [responded](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/supreme-court-gop-attorney-defends-voting-restrictions-saying-they-help-n1259305), “Because it puts us at a competitive disadvantage relative to Democrats.”

* Vox’s Ian Millhiser [believes](https://www.vox.com/2021/3/2/22309326/supreme-court-voting-rights-act-brnovich-democratic-national-committee-carvin-brett-kavanuagh) the justices will rule against the voting restrictions. Adam Liptak of the New York Times, however, [thinks](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/us/politics/supreme-court-arizona-voting.html) the justices seem more likely to uphold Arizona’s laws, thus allowing other states to impose similar limitations to voting.

**Georgia state House Republicans approved a 66-page bill that requires ID for absentee voting, curbs the use of ballot drop boxes, and restricts weekend early voting hours.** HB 531 [passed](https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-house-to-vote-on-election-restrictions-amid-staunch-opposition/46SNHMIYGZGMZDG5KLGHAB6NQ4/) along party lines 97-72; it will now be taken up by the Republican-controlled state Senate. The massive “election reform” package has wide-reaching impacts, including stripping the Secretary of State of his role as chair of the State Election Board and preventing county elections offices from receiving direct grant funding. Additionally, a [separate bill](https://www.ajc.com/politics/senate-panel-backs-bill-to-end-automatic-voter-registration-in-georgia/HLQU3OUNKNDYPJHGXXWQRPMC7U/) in the state Senate to end automatic voter registration and no-excuse absentee voting was passed out of committee last week.

&gt;“Republicans in the Georgia General Assembly are trying to change the rules of the election here in Georgia, rules that you wrote, because you were handed defeat,” said [Rep. Kimberly] Alexander, a Democrat from Hiram. “You know that your only chance of winning future elections is to prevent Georgians from having their votes counted and their voices heard.”

According to exit polls, [88%](https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/georgia) of black voters in the state cast a ballot for Biden and [more than 90%](https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/georgia) voted for Senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff in the January runoff elections. During arguments in the *Brnovich v. DNC* case before the Supreme Court, Justice Elena Kagan appeared to allude to Georgia’s proposed limitations on Sunday voting:

&gt;“If a state has long had two weeks of early voting and then the state decides that it is going to get rid of Sunday voting on those two weeks, leave everything else in place, and Black voters vote on Sunday 10 times more than white voters, is that system equally open?” Justice Kagan [asked](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/03/us/politics/georgia-voting-laws.html).

**The Idaho Senate approved a bill to make it more difficult for citizens to get initiatives or referendums on ballots, sending it next to the state House for consideration.** The [legislation](https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2021/legislation/S1110/) would [require](https://www.idahostatesman.com/latest-news/article249611043.html) initiative campaigns to collect signatures from 6% of registered voters in each of Idaho's 35 legislative districts, a dramatic increase from the current 18 district requirement. Both critics and proponents say the measure would give more power to Idaho’s rural corners, which tend to trend more conservative than the rest of the state. There isn’t another state that currently requires a minimum number of signatures in every district.

&gt;Voter-driven ballot initiatives, which act as a check on the Legislature, have become a major focus in the state in recent years. After years of inaction by Republican lawmakers, 62% of Idaho voters approved an initiative expanding Medicaid in 2018… In response to Medicaid expansion, Republicans in the House and Senate in 2019 tried to make the initiative process nearly impossible so they could head off future measures such as raising the minimum wage and legalizing marijuana.

**Similar bills:** Six other states—Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Missouri, North Dakota, and South Dakota—are considering laws to enact or increase supermajority requirements for certain ballot measures. Missouri has seen great success with citizen-led initiatives, passing independent districting, medical marijuana, and expanded Medicaid measures during the past three years. Last month, 11 Republican-sponsored [bills](https://www.examiner.net/story/news/2021/02/17/missouri-constitution-missouri-general-assembly-initiative-petition-republicans/6786484002/) making the initiative petition process more difficult were voted out of committee.

**To combat the rise in voting rights restrictions, House Democrats passed HR 1 “For the People Act” by a 220-210 vote, with only Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-MS) breaking ranks.** The 700+ page [bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+1%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1&amp;s=1) covers a lot of ground, including creating a national system for automatic voter registration, instituting two weeks of early voting in every state, putting in transparency requirements for political advertising, and instituting nonpartisan redistricting commissions to end partisan gerrymandering. 

Passing the landmark bill through the Senate, however, would require either Republican support - which isn’t going to happen - or reforming the filibuster, if not killing it altogether. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who [recently](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/03/the-house-is-poised-to-pass-a-major-voting-rights-bill-and-create-a-helluva-battle-in-the-senate/) called for “get[ting] rid of the filibuster” to pass HR1/S1, set the first Senate hearing for March 24.

As Washington Post columnist Greg Sargent [wrote](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/03/03/klobuchar-filibuster-reform-hr1/): 

&gt;Democrats such as Manchin and Sinema constantly treat keeping the filibuster as something that will *facilitate* the operations of democracy… That’s nonsense. In an ideal world where civic virtue and good faith reigned, denying a partisan majority the ability to pass legislation would theoretically result in more bipartisanship, since that majority then would need a few members of the minority to get 60 votes to end filibusters.

##Extremism

*This does not include any of the insurrection news.*

**Law enforcement in Ankeny, Iowa, detonated a live pipe bomb left inside a community polling center during a school district election on Tuesday.** There is [no indication](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/police-live-pipe-bomb-found-polling-place-iowa-76224825) of who left the bomb in the suburb just outside of Des Moines or when it was placed. The center was closed for around three hours while authorities disposed of the device.

**A member of the relatively new neo-nazi group, the 14 First Foundation, was arraigned in Spokane, Washington, on malicious harassment charges for defacing a synagogue.** Raymond Bryant, 44, was [identified](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/times-watchdog/a-new-neo-nazi-group-in-spokane-harkens-back-to-era-of-virulent-extremism-in-the-northwest/) from surveillance video spray-painting a swastika on Temple Beth Shalom and vandalizing a Holocaust memorial. The 14 First has been active distributing white nationalist flyers across the nation, including in Texas, Kentucky, and Louisiana, though they have arguably taken a more aggressive position in eastern Washington than anywhere else. 

**The Oregon state Republican Party elected a far-right senator who supported extremists storming the state Capitol in January as their chairman.** Sen. Dallas Heard [addressed](https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/2021/01/06/pro-trump-election-rallies-close-oregon-marion-county-offices/6558277002/) a pro-Trump crowd in Salem on Jan. 6, telling them that the Capitol was being ""occupied"" by elitists and encouraging listeners to “bring the power to them.” In December, he participated in a similar event that [resulted](https://www.opb.org/article/2021/02/21/oregon-gop-ousts-chair-taps-state-sen-dallas-heard-as-new-leader/) in the anti-mask rightwing crowd breaking into the state Capitol building, smashing windows, and fighting with police.

##Social issues

*There were 79 pieces of legislation in states to restrict transgender rights last year, many focused on student-athletes. In 2021 so far, there have been 69 bills in more than 20 states, many sailing quickly through state legislatures where the GOP grew its majorities. The ACLU is tracking some of the anti-LGBTQ legislation under consideration [here](https://www.aclu.org/legislation-affecting-lgbt-rights-across-country).* 

**The Tennessee Senate passed a bill forcing student-athletes to compete in events under the gender they were assigned at birth,** teeing up the Republican-controlled House to take up the matter this month. SB228/HB3 passed in a 27-6 party-line vote, without an amendment that would have made exceptions for transgender athletes receiving gender-affirming care, such as hormone blockers. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee (R) has [voiced](https://sports.yahoo.com/tennessee-senate-passes-bill-banning-transgender-high-school-athletes-from-playing-sports-194522776.html) support for the legislation, saying that transgender athletes “will destroy women’s sports.”

**Minnesota state Rep. Eric Lucero (R) introduced a bill to criminalize transgender girls who play on the school sports teams of their gender or use their gender’s bathroom.** [H.F. 1657](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2021/03/trans-girls-face-criminal-charges-trying-school-sports-minnesota-bill-passes/) would make it a petty misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $300, for transgender girls to play on women’s school sports teams. Furthermore, using a women’s bathroom as a transgender girl would be a full misdemeanor, which could lead to a transgender person being sentenced to up to 90 days in jail, a fine of up to $1,000, and one to two years of probation. 

While the bill is not expected to pass, it is a dangerous sign of how far some in the GOP are willing to go to discriminate against transgender people:

&gt;“This is one of the most extreme political attacks on trans youth that I have ever seen,” said the ACLU’s Chase Strangio in a statement. “Even if the bill does not pass, it has already sent a dangerous message to trans youth in Minnesota and around the country. Being trans is not a crime and trans youth should never be banned from sports or criminalized for simply being themselves.”

**The Washington state Supreme Court struck down the law making simple drug possession a crime,** providing lawmakers an opportunity to rework the criminal code. Justices [ruled](https://www.opb.org/article/2021/02/25/washington-state-justices-strike-down-drug-possession-law/) 5-4 that the statute was unconstitutional because it doesn’t require prosecutors to prove that someone knowingly or intentionally possessed the drugs. Currently, a person cannot be arrested for possessing a small amount of an illegal substance unless there is evidence that the individual was selling the drugs. 

There is, in fact, already a bill teed up that could fix this particular situation: [HB 1499](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1499&amp;Year=2021&amp;Initiative=false) was approved by the Washington House Public Safety Committee just days before the Supreme Court ruling. Called the Pathways to Recovery Act, the bill would remove penalties for personal use amounts of illegal drugs and greatly expand recovery services in the state. 

&gt;Rep. Tarra Simmons (D), who voted in favor of the change, said that in her experience as someone in recovery, criminalization only prevents people from getting help. “As a person who now has 9 1/2 years in recovery from substance use disorder that included opiates, methamphetamine and marijuana,” she said, “I remember wanting to get help but being afraid because it was a crime.”

##Other

**Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton had his first court hearing Monday in a case brought against him by four whistleblowers who formerly worked in his office.** James Brickman, David Maxwell, J. Mark Penley, and Ryan Vassar were among the aides and officials who [reported](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/11/ken-paxton-whistleblowers-texas-bribe/) Paxton to law enforcement last year, alleging the AG used his office to serve the interests of a political donor. They were later fired in retaliation.

&gt;[The whistleblowers claim] that Austin real estate developer Nate Paul helped Paxton remodel his house and gave a job to a woman with whom Paxton allegedly had an affair. In return, the aides allege, Paxton used his office to help Paul’s business interests, investigate Paul’s adversaries and help settle a lawsuit. The claims in the filing provide even more details about what the former aides believe Paxton’s motivations were in what they describe as a “bizarre, obsessive use of power.”

Most of the hearing was spent on the motion to dismiss the case brought by the Office of Attorney General (OAG), which was ultimately denied by Texas District Judge Amy Clark Meachum. During the short amount of witness testimony, OAG attorneys [raised](https://www.sacurrent.com/the-daily/archives/2021/03/02/lawyer-for-texas-attorney-generals-office-repeatedly-tries-to-block-testimony-and-evidence-at-whistleblower-hearing) numerous objections to questions and claimed attorney-client privilege in an attempt to block admission of evidence. By the end of the day, Paxton’s office filed an appeal of Meachum’s decision to allow the case to proceed and was [granted](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2021/03/02/new-details-about-texas-ag-ken-paxtons-ties-to-campaign-donor-could-emerge-at-whistleblower-hearing/) a stay by the 3rd Court of Appeals, halting the lawsuit hearing for the time being.

**A wealthy ultra-exclusive private community in Florida received enough doses to fully vaccinate nearly all residents over 65 years old by mid-January.** At a time when the state was struggling to obtain enough of the vaccine to sustain a week’s-worth of first doses, Ocean Reef Club [received](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/florida-keys/article249666463.html) enough to provide first and second doses to over 1,200 homeowners. Officials have not explained how the community, home to many wealthy Republican donors, was chosen as an early distribution site, but evidence suggests political connections played a key role:

&gt;In fact, the only people from Key Largo who gave to DeSantis’ political committee live in Ocean Reef. All 17 of them had given the governor contributions of $5,000 each through December 2020, according to the Florida Division of Elections. But on Feb. 25, one resident of Ocean Reef, Bruce Rauner, the former Republican governor of Illinois and former chairman of the Chicago-based private equity firm GTCR, increased his contribution and wrote a $250,000 check.

I posted about a month ago about him giving me an ultimatum between him/our life/our home or my baby. I was a bit defensive and bothered by people mentioning that he didn’t want the baby which I thought was completely wrong. 


He allowed me to take off work after my second miscarriage so I could dedicate everything to having a full term pregnancy/healthy baby. I put all my money into a “baby trust” and he started dedicating a percentage of his pay into it. 


He used that smoke and mirror to attach the savings to his bank account so that his pay deposited directly. I thought him supporting me was so sweet when in reality he was doing everything he could to make me completely dependent on him, alienating me from friends/co workers, and made sure I wasn’t working so I wouldn’t be able to support myself, have any independence or back up plans. He didn’t want a baby and never did. It was just a tool he used to have complete control. 


I tried giving him time to process, tried staying in the spare bedroom for privacy but he told me if I shut another door in his house he will take it off the hinges. I can’t help but compare his reaction to the Shannan Watts case. I no longer felt safe, I had a gut feeling that I needed to leave. The “baby trust” was bullshit and it’s in his bank account so I can’t withdraw it because we aren’t married and it’s not a joint account. 


I’m now hitchhiking from Seattle to Maine where I have a room at my only friends home. While she can’t help me financially get to her she will be letting me live rent free for 6 months so I can save for my own place which is so much more valuable.

Unfortunately, the image was too blurry to read the plates.  Also, renters insurance only covers about 1/3rd the cost since it was not stolen directly from inside my apartment.

The apartment staff have been almost useless, and don't seem to care about this happening.  They did provide the PD with the blurry image.

chunkyhrvatski,2021-02-25 01:26:14+00:00,[WASHINGTON URGENT] Open Carry ban likely to be voted on in the SENATE tomorrow! Contact senators now!,"Based on the schedule SB 5038 is likely getting a floor vote tomorrow YOU MUST CALL AND EMAIL TODAY! REALLY NEED TO PULL THIS OFF! 

**Today's objective: send an email that covers ALL THREE bills, comment on ALL THREE bills, then CALL YOUR DISTRICT'S REPS!** 

**Ban on open carry at protests: [SB 5038](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5038&amp;Initiative=false&amp;Year=2021)**  Comment on this too! **Again, you must submit a NEW comment now! Tell them you DO NOT accept the amendments!**

Talking points:

- This bill directly mirrors the racism and classism of the Mulford act signed by then-governor Reagan to ban the open carry of firearms to disarm black civil rights protesters and activists in California.

- **While the radius of entrapment was changed from 1000 to 250 feet in the updated bill this seems like an admittance that the liability sphere on its own is problematic. You can still walk by a single person with a sign or be blocked on the highway by a protest (this is an extremely common occurrence near seattle, it has happened to me personally) and find that you are now committing an arrestable offense punished by up to a year in prison simply for carrying in your vehicle.**

- There exists no objective standard whatsoever by which to define and is and is not a protest, this law could essentially criminalize the carriage of firearms at any time a demonstration is occurring. Tell your representatives to listen to their constituents, not lobbyists funded by billionaires. **While the definition of a demonstration has been expanded in the updated bill, it remains vague and unacceptably broad.**

- Multiple people were killed with firearms relating to protests on Capitol Hill, Seattle his year. The assailants recorded themselves violating multiple WA gun laws on camera (I-594, I-1639, intimidation by firearm) for hours or days before the killings. No arrests were made and no intervention occurred. The claim that making this already felonious activity slightly more illegal will prevent violence at protests is unevidenced and irrational. Existing laws are failing to be enforced as is. 

- Bans like this in other states have been used to arrest or search passersby who are not carrying weapons or are not involved in protests at all. States like New York have adopted absurdly generous definitions of brandishing (so much as seeing a weapon's imprint through a shirt) in connection to restrictions on open carry.

- Violence at protests can only be prevented with a low-intensity, non-lethal police presence.

HasSomeSelfEsteem,2021-02-24 07:27:30+00:00,A Fallout game set in the Pacific Northwest would offer some terrain variety to a series overflowing with radioactive desert,"I hope you guys aren't sick of posts like this, because  my ideal fallout setting would be the Pacific Northwest. I think the PNW would be an interesting setting because it's so different from the landscapes we're accustomed to in the Fallout series. Rather than a vast empty desert upon which nothing grows, the wasteland of this game would be verdant forest teeming with mutant life. This landscape is inhospitable to humans, and as such what people remain stay close to cities. Large population centers, genuine cites, make up the vast majority of human settlement. In this fallout there are cities, and then there is wasteland, there is almost no non-urban human dwelling. What few towns fight through their daily hardships in the dense forests have become insular and entrenched in their strange ways, hostile to outlanders and making pacts with forces deep in the forest.

\*The Forest\* is the dominant wasteland terrain in this game, acting as the open desert in earlier instalments. The trees and soil are all irradiated, so that even being in these forests gives the player some dose of radiation. Because of this few venture into the woods, and few know what tread upon the glowing moss. The only true city in this part of the map is Victoria. Once a thriving trade community, Victoria has gone silent. No one knows what has become of Victoria or her people, but the answers may be borne on the voices that carry through the trees. The most dangerous part of the game world, comparable to FO4's Glowing Sea, is the Olympic Peninsula. Already intensely rugged before the war, \*the peninsula\* is a hostile land of nuclear jungle and otherworldly forces. Among the high peaks, and in the deep glens, bizarre and terrible monsters tread, and to venture there is a fools errand.

While the west of the map is dominated by inhospitable wilderness, the east of the map is where the cities of game lay. A part of Fallout I've always loved is that the communities feel like places people actually live in. People go to bars, eat in restaurants, and generally do more than just survive. In the far south of the map we have Portland. Portland is the largest of the Oregon city states, many of whom have already joined the NCR. Portland's status as an independent entity is contentious, as many see joining the NCR to be the surest route to true security. North of Portland we have Cascadia, a lose confederation made up of the cities of Tacoma, Everett, and Seattle. This confederacy is loosely connected politically, but pools its resources towards a singular navy. This navy's main purpose is to repel the pirate attacks which originate from the lawless islands of Puget Sound, mainly the San Juan Islands. In the far north of the map there is Vancouver, a ghost city razed by the United States during the annexation of Canada. The remnants of the Washington state ferry system make up an essential part of the Cascadian economy. Transportation via these ferries is much more efficient than driving caravans along broken roads, but is also more dangerous. These massive boats act as both cargo ship and dreadnought.

I'm unsure what the central conflict would be, but I think the general world is  fun and weird in a way that works well with the grim setting of Fallout. I think some a dense forest would be a welcome change after a series that has fixated on sand.

And if for no other reason, radioactive orcas eating you if you're stupid enough to fall off the boat.",Fallout,2637

 my friend recently got a job at the amazon warehouse in Seattle, and, out of curiosity, I asked what they do with returns. surely they resale them right? or at least discount/donate them? NOPE. according to her, 80% of all returns are sent STRAIGHT TO THE DUMPSTER. but that's not the best part, they are legally obligated BY THE COMPANY TO DESTROY THEM so that HOMELESS PEOPLE CANT USE THEM. what. the. dystopian. fuck. is. this. shit. 

according to her, they throw away so many returns, that they have EXTRA DUMPSTERS, JUST FOR THE PERFECT, UNOPENED RETURNS. and guess what? they aren't allowed to take ANYTHING. according to Amazon it's and I fucking quote '' unnecessary patronization'' and if they do take something? FIRED. NO SECOND CHANCES. she estimates that 5,000 POUNDS A DAY of returns in amazon warehouses are simply tossed in the garbage, clothes, food, technology, even MEDICINE. 

I literally cannot stress this enough, FUCK AMAZON. not only are they shit to their employees, but they are wasteful, and completely unapologetic whilst Jeff Bezos makes THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A SECOND. fuck amazon, fuck capitalism, and fuck unnecessary consumerism.

##Portland protests

**Trump’s agents are sweeping peaceful citizens off the streets.** [Oregon Public Broadcasting](https://www.opb.org/news/article/federal-law-enforcement-unmarked-vehicles-portland-protesters/):

&gt;Federal law enforcement officers have been using unmarked vehicles to drive around downtown Portland and detain protesters since at least July 14...Personal accounts and multiple videos posted online show the officers driving up to people, detaining individuals with no explanation of why they are being arrested, and driving off.”

&gt;The tactic appears to be another escalation in federal force deployed on Portland city streets, as federal officials and President Donald Trump have said they plan to ‘quell’ nightly protests outside the federal courthouse and Multnomah County Justice Center that have lasted for more than six weeks.

* There are numerous Twitter accounts of journalists and protestors with video from Portland. One of the best is Zane Sparling of The Portland Tribune. Scroll through his timeline if you haven’t seen the recent video, like [this one](https://twitter.com/PDXzane/status/1284733976582615040?s=20) he took of a Navy vet being beaten or [this one](https://twitter.com/MrOlmos/status/1284417770973626371?s=20) he retweeted of the Portland Police rushing protestors. Here’s a different person’s [thread](https://twitter.com/tuckwoodstock/status/1284734198926852097?s=20) with more footage of local police. And of course, one of the first videos to make headlines (sadly), of federal agents [abducting](https://twitter.com/sparrowmedia/status/1283436911307218948?s=20) a protestor off the street.

**Homeland Security officers are using Trump’s monument order to crack down on protests in Portland.** Trump signed an executive order on June 26 aimed at protecting monuments and statues. The Dept. of Homeland Security then created the “Protecting American Communities Task Force” and [sent officers](https://apnews.com/4435a1f27cf85e087e112ba1224a2f1f) from Customs and Border Protection and other agencies to D.C., Seattle, and Portland. 

&gt;Among the federal forces deployed in Portland are members of an elite Border Patrol tactical team, a special operations unit that is based on the U.S.-Mexico border and has been deployed overseas, including to Iraq and Afghanistan… BORTAC members, identifiable by patches on their camouflage sleeves, are mixed in with Federal Protective Service officers outside the courthouse. 

**DHS is operating in Portland under the guide of protecting federal property.** [Legally](https://www.lawfareblog.com/what-heck-are-federal-law-enforcement-officers-doing-portland), the federal government is within its rights to use federal law enforcement officers to enforce federal law (including destruction or vandalism of federal property). Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf [says](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/07/16/acting-secretary-wolf-condemns-rampant-long-lasting-violence-portland) his officers are preventing vandalism to the federal courthouse:

&gt;Each night, lawless anarchists destroy and desecrate property, including the federal courthouse, and attack the brave law enforcement officers protecting it. A federal courthouse is a symbol of justice - to attack it is to attack America… This siege can end if state and local officials decide to take appropriate action instead of refusing to enforce the law. DHS will not abdicate its solemn duty to protect federal facilities and those within them.

Wolf then lists crimes “justifying” the use of violent, confrontational, unidentified federal agents. However, the crimes prior to the dispatching of federal agents consist only of graffiti incidents and the “removal” of fencing.

*In other words, DHS is using minor vandalism to federal property as a “hook” to authorize CBP and ICE (among others) to act as Trump’s private police.*

&gt;Gov. Kate Brown [said](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/us/portland-protests.html#click=https://t.co/plQJYh1JiV) in an interview that she believed that the protests were starting to ease before the federal officers waded into the scene. 

* Note, also, that none of the DHS leaders were confirmed by the Senate. We have an acting Secretary, acting Deputy Secretary, acting head of CBP, and acting head of ICE. It’s been that way for over a year.

**Oregon officials, including the governor and senators, have told DHS to get out of Portland’s streets.** Gov. Kate Brown made it clear that the federal officers are inflaming the situation, but Wolf refused to pull back. Combined with Trump’s dangerous rhetoric regarding protests, it is reasonable to surmise that escalation is the whole point of these exercises in the first place.

&gt;“Let me be very, very clear, having federal troops on the streets of Portland does not solve the problem and in fact, it escalates the problem,” Brown [said](https://www.kptv.com/news/governor-brown-talks-covid-19-protests-and-schools-in-one-on-one-interview/article_69e6c558-c89b-11ea-9f5e-b3924be016e4.html). “I was very clear with Secretary Wolf about that fact. This is pure politics; this isn’t about problem-solving.”

&gt;“Platoons self-designated and self-mobilized by Donald Trump to be flown thousands of miles into US cities to attack Americans fits the definition of abuse of power in any democracy,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) [said](https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2020/07/federal-agents-portland-border-patrol-chad-wolf-statues/). “The legal justification is absurd—Trump’s occupation has nothing to do with statues. If that executive order is their basis of their authority, they are massively exceeding it and those involved should find their federal employment terminated before this is all resolved.”

**The Trump administration is planning on expanding their federal force into other American cities.** DHS acting Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli told NPR that “we intend to continue not just in Portland but in any of the facilities that we’re responsible for around the country.” White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told Fox News this could happen as early as this week:

&gt;“Attorney General Barr is weighing in on that with [DHS] Secretary Wolf, and you’ll see something rolled out this week, as we start to go in and make sure that the communities—whether it’s Chicago or Portland or Milwaukee or someplace across the heartland of the country—we need to make sure their communities are safe,” Meadows said ([video](https://twitter.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1284906924740423681?s=20)).

##Court cases

**The Supreme Court expedited the implementation of its ruling allowing Vance to seek Trump’s financial information.** While the case can now resume [more quickly](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/17/politics/vance-trump-taxes-grand-jury/index.html), Trump still has the time and opportunity to file additional arguments in SDNY’s district court. Last week, the Manhattan district attorney’s office [accused](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/nyregion/donald-trump-taxes-cyrus-vance.html?action=click&amp;module=Latest&amp;pgtype=Homepage) Trump of deliberately delaying the process to allow the statute of limitations to expire.

**Court filings reveal that Vance is interested in more than just hush-money payments, veering into the hundreds of millions of dollars Trump sunk into hotels and golf courses** in the 2000s. Once he ran out of cash, Trump [took out](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/akzndj/the-manhattan-da-is-going-where-mueller-wouldnt-trumps-money) over $300 million in loans from the private-wealth management office of Deutsche Bank. 

&gt;“The subpoenas seek records, dating from 2011 to the present, concerning transactions that are unrelated to any official acts of the President, and that occurred largely before [Trump] assumed office,” Vance told the high court, adding that his probe goes into “issues beyond those involved in the Cohen matter.”

&gt;Vance’s team also told the high court their investigation is based, in part, on “multiple public reports of possible criminal misconduct” by employees of the Trump Organization.

**The nonprofit that funded Trump’s post-election transition has agreed to shut down in a settlement** with New Jersey’s attorney general for [failing](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-transition-agrees-shut-down-state-dept-official-fined-n1233858) to register with the state as a charitable organization. The State Dept.’s acting Chief of Protocol Cam Henderson was paid by the Trump transition to raise money and will have to pay a fine for failing to register as a fund raiser as required. 

* Note: State Dept. IG Steve Linick was [investigating](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/20/fired-state-department-watchdog-was-probing-protocol-office-270660) Cam Henderson and her deputy prior to being fired by Pompeo and Trump. Henderson has worked in the past as an aide to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

**The Justice Department carried out its third federal execution in four days on Friday, after only putting three people in death over the previous three decades.** The Supreme Court [cleared](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/07/supreme-court-federal-execution-daniel-lee.html) the way for these executions last week, issuing a 2 am unsigned ruling allowing the execution of Daniel Lee - the first federal execution since 2003. All four liberal justices dissented.

&gt;According to his attorney, [Ruth Friedman](https://twitter.com/mjs_DC/status/1283034580442849281), Lee remained strapped to a gurney for four hours while the Department of Justice sought the green light from the Supreme Court. The government then executed him without first notifying Friedman that her client would be killed.

* Further reading: “The Justice Department’s Shameful Rush to Federal Executions. The push to impose the federal death penalty no matter the cost poses a grave threat to the rule of law,” [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/opinion/justice-department-federal-execution.html). 

**Also last week, the Supreme Court ruled that Florida’s law restricting felon voting rights can stay in place,** all but [guaranteeing](https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2020/07/16/us-supreme-court-keeps-florida-felon-voting-law-in-place-1301508) that nearly 1 million Floridians will be unable to vote in the 2020 election because of unpaid court debts. The high court did not explain its decision; Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented.

&gt;“This Court’s order prevents thousands of otherwise eligible voters from participating in Florida’s primary election simply because they are poor,” wrote Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor in a hard-charging dissent. “And it allows the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit to disrupt Florida’s election process just days before the July 20 voter-registration deadline for the August primary, even though a preliminary injunction had been in place for nearly a year and a Federal District Court had found the State’s pay-to-vote scheme unconstitutional.”

Sotomayor ended by [noting](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/sotomayor-blasts-supreme-court-for-upholding-florida-poll-tax-that-excludes-voters-simply-because-they-are-poor/) that the conservatives of the court ruled with opposing rational to block extended voting in Wisconsin’s pandemic primary:

&gt;This Court’s inaction continues a trend of condoning dis-franchisement. Ironically, this Court has wielded Purcell as a reason to forbid courts to make voting safer during a pandemic, overriding two federal courts because any safety-related changes supposedly came too close to election day. Now, faced with an appellate court stay that disrupts a legal status quo and risks immense disfranchisement—a situation that Purcell sought to avoid—the Court balks.

* Note also that Florida does not know how much court debt ex-felons owe. And it has [no intention](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/05/florida-amendment-4-fines-fees-unconstitutional-ruling.html) of figuring it out. The state has forced ex-felons to pay up—then refused to tell them how much they must pay.

##Voting rights

**Voting rights and civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis passed away last week. The Voting Rights Advancement Act has been sitting on McConnell’s desk for over 225 days.** [Rep. James Clyburn](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/19/democrats-demand-expansion-voting-rights-memory-john-lewis/) (D-SC): “It should be the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act of 2020. That’s the way to do it. Words may be powerful, but deeds are lasting.” 

* Opinion: [Do Not Call John Lewis a “Hero” if You Stood in His Way.](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/07/john-lewis-mitch-mcconnell-brian-kemp-gop-voting-rights.html) Republicans like Mitch McConnell and Brian Kemp are the reason the civil rights icon had to keep fighting until his dying breath.


**Trump’s new USPS chief is slowing the delivery of mail, raising concerns over late delivery of absentee ballots during primary and general elections.** In a memo obtained by [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/14/postal-service-trump-dejoy-delay-mail/), USPS workers were told, “One aspect of these changes that may be difficult for employees is that — temporarily — we may see mail left behind or mail on the workroom floor or docks.” 

**Leaving mail behind endangers your vote.** In [34 states](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/15/how-trumps-war-postal-service-could-create-an-election-nightmare/), under current law your absentee ballot must be received by election authorities by election day. If your local post office is overwhelmed with ballots (which is likely, given the pandemic), your ballot could be received late and your vote will not count. 

* Remember, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has been a [top donor](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-usps-head-top-trump-donor-what-does-mean-its-n1231124) to Trump and the Republican National Committee, and he was in charge of fundraising for the 2020 Republican National Convention.

**In the primary elections held so far this year, at least 65,000 absentee or mail-in ballots have been rejected because they arrived past the deadline, often through no fault of the voter.** Those who use mail-in voting for the first time — especially young, Black and Latino voters — are [more likely](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/13/889751095/signed-sealed-undelivered-thousands-of-mail-in-ballots-rejected-for-tardiness) to have their ballots rejected because of errors.

##Trump raking in donor money

**In just two days in March, Trump’s re-election campaign gave Trump’s hotels nearly $400,000 of donor money** for “facility rental/catering services. The campaign has [also](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/17/trump-campaign-is-grift-that-keeps-grifting/) been paying more than $37,000 a month in rent to Trump Tower in New York, which is odd, considering that the campaign’s headquarters is in an office building in Rosslyn.

&gt;According to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics (CRP), Trump-allied political committees and the Republican party have [spent](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/09/how-trumps-business-empire-is-cashing-in-on-the-2020-campaign) a whopping $18.1m at Trump properties since he launched his 2016 campaign. Republican candidates, elected officials and Pacs have ponied up another $1.2m in the same period.

&gt;Donald J Trump for President leads the pack, having spent a total of $14.5m since he began his 2016 campaign, with the Republican National Committee in second place at $1.8m and Trump Victory ranking third at $1.6m, Center data shows.

**Meanwhile, Trump is illegally campaigning on federal property by using official White House press briefings to dump opposition research on Joe Biden.** On Tuesday, the president convened reporters for a press conference purportedly about punishing China, but [instead](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-uses-rose-garden-event-for-extended-campaign-like-attack-on-biden/2020/07/14/cba91838-c600-11ea-a99f-3bbdffb1af38_story.html) spent an hour bashing Biden:

&gt;“Biden was here for 47 years...now he says as president he’s going to do all the things he didn’t do, he never did, he never did anything except make very bad decisions.” ([video](https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1283155449345462275?s=20))

[First post from when I bought the car](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/avuay7/i_just_purchased_the_2nd_veloster_n_sold_in_wa_i/)

###I have $30k, I know I want a new car, what do I buy? 

&gt;Best performing car, that's all I care about. Give me those driving dynamics baybeee let's have fun everywhere.    

**Miata is the answer**

&gt;I want to zoom zoom every once in a while but I also have to pick up clients, bring a chair home from ikea, and I do care about creature comforts and maximizing practicality

**GTI, obviously**

&gt;I want to zoom zoom more than anything, but I still want to have SOME practicality.

**Buy a Veloster N**

Simple, right?

Here's tl;dr, right up front: **The Veloster N gives up a bunch of creature comforts to gain performance. What it lacks in daily-ability, it more than makes up for in fun driving dynamics.**

To get into a little bit more detail, my experience with the Veloster N has been largely positive. It really is as much fun as all the reviewers say it is online. It has more grip than I'm comfortable throwing around my backroads and you can really feel it rotate. I had never experienced the rotation that reviewers always talk about until I had this car and got really comfortable driving it. I haven't had any truly sketchy moments in the car and I've been able to push it pretty far. Always inspiring confidence and communicating everything I need to know to drive hard. It's quick, too. It's not fast in a straight line, but that's not what we care about, do we? It's quick around corners and more than anything it's a lot of fun.

##Backroad, canyon, spirited driving: 7.5/10

Took 2.5 off because how could I possible say a $30k hot hatch is a 10/10 backroad/canyon carver? You can't. You're lying to yourself if you think your $30k car is as fun as a $100k+ sports car. 

Now, onto the majority of what the car is used for. Daily driving. This is where it starts to fall off for me. Let's be honest, probably 90% of the driving I (and most of us) do is around town, to restaurants, grocery stores, etc. That is what we all do with our daily drivers; we drive, daily. Some people will drive like a douche everywhere no matter what. I tend to save that for the backroads and drive pretty peacefully when I'm in town. There is one thing that stands out the most to me as the biggest annoyance ever.     
***No rain sensing wipers!!!***    
You're probably like ""wow, really u/pandahatch you're going to complain about your damn wipers"" and yes, yes I am. I live in Washington (shoutout r/Seattle, r/SeattleWA, r/SeaWA - we have a lot of sub drama over which one is the best - but that's neither here nor there) and the amount of rain hitting your windshield changes every 5 seconds. Not having rain sensing wipers is truly the ***worst***. Whenever it's raining I'm changing the wiper speed every 5 seconds and it’s so annoying.

**The rest of the negatives are probably as expected:**    
The suspension is a lil stiff for everyday driving    
The steering weight is a lil stiff for everyday driving    
The squeaks are omnipresent    

**There are some positives though:**    
It's always engaging to drive, and I'm always having fun    
Rev-matching is a must for daily driving. Basically feels like having a semi-automatic transmission    
The soundsystem is actually quite good and I'm pretty impressed!    
It's pretty rare - I've only seen 2 other Veloster N's in the year+ that I've had the car    
It's a Hyundai - maintenance is so cheap. I just got my 13,000 mile maintenance and it cost me $17 in labor + oil filter. I provide my own oil to the dealership which is about $50 (Amsoil Signature Series 0w-30) - I have a used oil analysis if anyone is interested in seeing that.    
Reliability has not been any issue. Always starts right up and I've never been worried about anything. Of course I'm only 13k miles in so I'll let you know when I get to 50k how it's doing.    

##Daily driving: 5/10

If you think it's more than 5/10 you need to go drive a Lexus and then re-evaluate your life.

Now, time for the overall impression. Was it worth it? Yes. I am quite happy with my purchase. Would I recommend it to you? That depends on your priorities - see above.

For me, the daily driving shortfalls are well worth putting up with for the smiles that I get when I take it out to a backroad. If I had to do it again with the same budget, I would get the VN again. 

##Overall: 7/10

So, I wrote out more than I was originally planning - but I still want to include the notes from my phone that I've been building out whenever I notice something. Here are my perceived highs, mehs, and lows.

###Highs:

+ Bang bang POP - Best sounding 4cyl aside from the STI. And it's a legit ALS so it's allowable.
+ Playful handling - it oversteers! I can’t express enough just how much FUN this car is to drive. It begs to be thrown around everywhere and I’ll happily oblige. It’s an extremely communicative chassis and will never bite you. I’ve built up my skills with this car and it’s very predictable and you know when the back end is going to come out or when you’re about to get some understeer. It’s very easy and fun to drive fast. 
+ Driver inputs feel high quality - steering weight and feel, leather steering wheel, steering wheel size, pedals, seats are comfortable and well bolstered, and the shift knob feels nice. All of the inputs that the driver experiences look and feel high quality. 
+ N Custom mode - I get to choose exactly how stiff I want my dampers, how much steering weight I want, if I want hot boi exhaust or putt around town exhaust... it’s amazing and just one button away. 
+ The gauges are actually dope - they have a honeycomb texture to them that looks amazing
+ Automatic rev matching - it’s fast and makes daily-ing a lot better
+ Shift lights
+ The looks - subjective but it’s grown on me and my girlfriend thinks it's 'cute'
+ The rarity - in my 14ish months of ownership I’ve only seen 2 other VN's on the road
+ 10 year powertrain warranty that isn’t voided with track use
+ Apple CarPlay (a godsend)
+ Sound system is actually pretty damn good. More than one person has pointed it out 
+ Happy with the MPG - I’ve averaged 23mpg
+ LSD - you can really feel the front end hook up and pull you out of corners

###Mehs:

* Quick, but I still want more. 4th gear just doesn’t feel like it’s pulling, but I should never be going faster than the top of 3rd anyway so I guess it’s a good thing?
* Shifter feel isn’t a Type R by any means, but it’s a ton better than a GTI
* Interior is just ok. Doesn’t feel very special.
* 19” wheels - wish it came with 18’s and a lil more sidewall
* Cabin noise - I wish it were quieter on the highway
* Brake dust is annoying. But like... who cares?

###Lows:

* SQUEKY FUCKING REAR VIEW MIRROR MAKE IT FUCKING STOP
* RAIN SENSING WIPERS ARE YOU KIDDING ME
* Lack of creature comforts in general
* ~~No aftermarket support yet~~ this is not true anymore. This note was from when I got the car a year ago. 
* Electronic Sound Generator (ESG) can get annoying at times",cars,1460

But a big part of me was left wondering if its creators just should have left well enough alone.*|PS4|
|[**Kotaku**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/276/kotaku) \- [Riley MacLeod](https://opencritic.com/critic/1808/riley-macleod)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-the-kotaku-review-1844006193)|*It’s a visually beautiful game that feels distinct to play, and the story it tells and how it tells it, at the most basic level, certainly pushes the edges of what games have done before. None of those accomplishments elevated or redeemed it for me. Like the nature consuming Seattle, or the outbreak consuming humanity, its ugliness overshadowed everything else.*|PS4|
|[**Polygon**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/87/polygon) \- [Maddy Myers](https://opencritic.com/critic/772/maddy-myers)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/6/12/21288535/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4-naughty-dog-ellie-joel-violence)|*Part 2 ends up feeling needlessly bleak, at a time when a nihilistic worldview has perhaps never been less attractive. Its characters are surviving, but they’re not learning, and they’re certainly not making anything better.*|PS4|
|[**Skill Up**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/639/skill-up) \- [Ralph Panebianco](https://opencritic.com/critic/5428/ralph-panebianco)|Unscored \~ [Unscored](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB20A8CitRU)|*While I appreciate the ambition, I just think there are too many failures in execution here to call the experiment a success.*|PS4|

It’s an unflinching, impeccable example of how the medium can be used to propel the art form forward by employing the same visceral storytelling techniques and disturbing imagery you’d see from Oscar-nominated films. Critics have been asking when video games would “grow up” for years. The real question is this: when will films catch up with video games like The Last of Us Part II?*|PS4|
|[**Eurogamer**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/114/eurogamer) \- [Oli Welsh](https://opencritic.com/critic/751/oli-welsh)|Unscored \~ [Essential](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-06-12-the-last-of-us-part-2-review-a-gut-wrenching-sequel)|*Can a slick, mainstream action game really reckon with the violence that drives it? The answer is yes - messily, but powerfully.*|PS4|

At the same time, it is a game like no other and deserves to be played, if not enjoyed, by everyone with a Sony system*|PS4|
|[**COGconnected**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected) \- [Paul Sullivan](https://opencritic.com/critic/808/paul-sullivan)|100 \~ [100 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/last-us-part-2-review/)|*The Last of Us Part 2 is uncomfortably real. It’s gritty, heavy, and polished to a mirror sheen. Even now, a week on from completing it, I’m feeling its weight. It’s far from what I anticipated, but crucially it did the work to get me invested. An astounding technical marvel, The Last of Us Part 2 deftly weaves diverse exploration and fun combat into the mix, resulting in a truly brilliant package.*|PS4|
|[**Critical Hit**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/299/critical-hit) \- [Brad Lang](https://opencritic.com/critic/5914/brad-lang)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://www.criticalhit.net/gaming/the-last-of-us-part-ii-review/)|*The Last of Us Part II is an exceptional experience from beginning to end, uniting its gameplay and narrative into a cohesive unit while also delivering some of the best writing and acting seen in a video game to date. It is undeniably one of the best games I've ever played.*|PS4|
|[**Daily Star**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/686/daily-star) \- [Dom Peppiatt](https://opencritic.com/critic/253/dom-peppiatt)|100 \~ [5 / 5 stars](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/last-of-us-2-review-22179028)|*Naughty Dog has done it again. The Last of Us Part 2 is a game that’s going to be talked about for a long time to come, and with good reason.*|PS4|
|[**Digitally Downloaded**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/65/digitally-downloaded) \- [Matt Sainsbury](https://opencritic.com/critic/1604/matt-sainsbury)|100 \~ [5 / 5 stars](https://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2020/06/review-last-of-us-part-ii-sony.html)|*I really loved the moment-to-moment movement of The Last of Us Part II. I enjoyed plotting my way around, trying to minimise the amount of combat I needed to get into. I loved the rhythms and structure of the game, and as one of the final big shows for the PlayStation 4 it makes me wonder why we’re even bothering with a “next generation” at all.*|PS4|
|[**Game Informer**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/35/game-informer) \- [Andy McNamara](https://opencritic.com/critic/1042/andy-mcnamara)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://www.gameinformer.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii/the-last-of-us-part-ii-review-a-perfect-circle)|*The Last of Us Part II is a monumental achievement in video game storytelling*|PS4|
|[**Game Rant**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/60/game-rant) \- [Anthony Taormina](https://opencritic.com/critic/262/anthony-taormina)|100 \~ [5 / 5 stars](https://gamerant.com/last-of-us-2-review/)|*Developer Naughty Dog builds on its post-apocalyptic opus with The Last of Us Part 2, delivering incredible visuals and an emotional story.*|PS4|

|[**GamesRadar+**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/91/gamesradar-) \- [Alex Avard](https://opencritic.com/critic/2092/alex-avard)|100 \~ [5 / 5 stars](https://www.gamesradar.com/last-of-us-part-2-review/)|*Naughty Dog's PS4 swansong is an astonishing, absurdly ambitious epic that goes far and beyond what we could have imagined for a sequel to an all-time classic.*|PS4|
|[**GamingTrend**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/102/gamingtrend) \- [Ron Burke](https://opencritic.com/critic/483/ron-burke)|100 \~ [100 / 100](https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/you-have-no-idea-what-loss-is-the-last-of-us-part-ii-review/)|*The Last of Us Part II is a stunningly beautiful and impeccably written story of family, consequences, horror, and loss. It pulls you in and holds tight, forging a deeper connection with Ellie, her fellow survivors, and the hostile world in which they live. From start to finish, this could be the best game on the PlayStation 4 -- ever.*|PS4|
|[**Hardcore Gamer**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/23/hardcore-gamer) \- [Kevin Dunsmore](https://opencritic.com/critic/892/kevin-dunsmore)|100 \~ [5 / 5](https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&amp;p=380049)|*The Last of Us left a memorable impression.*|PS4|
|[**IGN**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/56/ign) \- [Jonathon Dornbush](https://opencritic.com/critic/2579/jonathon-dornbush)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-review)|*The Last of Us Part 2 is a masterpiece that evolves the gameplay, cinematic storytelling, and rich world design of the original in nearly every way.*|PS4|
|[**Next Gen Base**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/364/next-gen-base) \- [Ben Ward](https://opencritic.com/critic/2308/ben-ward)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://www.nextgenbase.com/the-last-of-us-part-2-review/)|*The Last of Us Part 2 makes some bold moves. Whether it’s from a story perspective or a gameplay one, Naughty Dog haven’t been afraid to make some big leaps with this game. Fortunately, it’s almost all for the better, and the result is a game that is as diverse as it is challenging, with visuals that I can’t see being beaten until the new consoles hit, and a story that will raise some eyebrows but ultimately sticks the landing, in spite of how dark it can get. A magnificent example of what is capable in the medium of video games. We absolutely needed this sequel.*|PS4|
|[**PlayStation Universe**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe) \- [John-Paul Jones](https://opencritic.com/critic/843/john-paul-jones)|100 \~ [10 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-part-2-review/)|*The Last of Us Part 2 is a frankly incredible achievement. Intertwining deep, richly written characters, cementing themes of consequence and loss all the while widening a world that was so well established in the first game, Naughty Dog have crafted one of the finest action adventures of all time and one that invariably stands as the most opulent jewel in an already glittering crown of first-party PlayStation 4 exclusives.*|PS4|
|[**Push Square**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square) \- [Sammy Barker](https://opencritic.com/critic/943/sammy-barker)|100 \~ [10 / 10](http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/last_of_us_part_ii)|*The Last of Us: Part II adds a couple more inches to the already outrageously high bar that Naughty Dog has set for itself. This is the developer's crowning achievement to date, expanding and improving upon the concepts that it's been iterating on for over a decade now. Unparalleled presentation combines with an engaging gameplay loop that puts you in the shoes of its characters – and forces you to feel all of the tension and misgivings of its cast. It's uncomfortable and not everyone will necessarily enjoy its direction, but that's ultimately what makes it so essential.*|PS4|
|[**Tech Advisor**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/628/tech-advisor) \- [Dominic Preston](https://opencritic.com/critic/5179/dominic-preston)|100 \~ [5 / 5 stars](https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/games/last-of-us-part-ii-3790347/)|*The Last of Us Part II is not a perfect game, and it’s not even a particularly revolutionary one. But it is a great game.*|PS4|
|[**Telegraph**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/28/telegraph) \- [Dan Silver](https://opencritic.com/critic/3464/dan-silver)|100 \~ [5 / 5 stars](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/features/last-us-part-2-review-video-game-study-cycle-violence-bloody/)|*Sony's big budget PS4 exclusive might actually surpass the achievements of its illustrious predecessor*|PS4|

Naughty Dog have truly surpassed themselves yet again, crafting a heartfelt sequel that will leave you gasping as they continue to raise the bar for the video game industry. It's yet another must-buy for PlayStation 4 owners, supercharging Sony's unstoppable stable of exclusives.*|PS4|
|[**VG247**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/549/vg247) \- [Kirk McKeand](https://opencritic.com/critic/109/kirk-mckeand)|100 \~ [5 / 5 stars](https://www.vg247.com/2020/06/12/the-last-of-us-2-review/)|*When the credits rolled on The Last of Us Part 2 I was still buzzing from the excitement of the final few hours.*|PS4|

If I could rate things higher than 10, I would.* |PS4|
|[**Geek Culture**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/701/geek-culture) \- [Jake Su](https://opencritic.com/critic/6215/jake-su)|98 \~ [9.8 / 10](https://geekculture.co/geek-review-the-last-of-us-part-2)|*The Last of Us Part II justifies its existence with a truly stunning delivery of a strong narrative, coupled with great gameplay, and excellent worldbuilding.*|PS4|

As I said, the action in this game is intense, grueling, and raw.*|PS4|

It tells a very mature tale of revenge and what the effects of civilization crashing down has brought on humanity. At times, it will push you out of your comfort zone as we see people being tortured, mutilated, and brutalized by even the protagonist herself.*|PS4|
|[**Wccftech**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/304/wccftech) \- [Kai Powell](https://opencritic.com/critic/1914/kai-powell)|95 \~ [9.5 / 10](https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-all-the-sins-we-bear/)|*The Last of Us Part II is bleak and at times leaves the player feeling hopeless as they play through one of the finest crafted pieces of gaming ever to grace a home console.

It's oppressing, it's brutal, and it's a sucker punch, by way of the positions it puts you in to drive home what a change of perspective can do. As it's said, every villain is the hero of their own story — and vice versa.*|PS4|

OrganiCyanide,2020-06-11 19:38:05+00:00,CHAZ is a mistake,"Our protests against the police equate to a game of Red Rover where the winner will decide whether change will be made, and by how much. Just like the kindergarten recess game, we win by having the largest body of public support.

**Our peaceful protesting caused us to have insanely good momentum** at bringing the public to our side. We subjected ourselves to being victims of police violence, and that led to news images and videos of protestors with arms raised becoming targets of police brutality. **This tactic was genius** in its simplicity. The collective media networks had nothing to report other than “The peaceful protests continue, but more and more protestors are being harmed at the hands of police.” **Political opponents and Police Unions had no response to this**. Nothing they said could justify their actions.

At some point the City/Police decided to pull the police out of the East Precinct. This plan is genius in its own right for several reasons.

1. Moving to another undisclosed location stops the violence against protestors in that area. It **takes “Capitol Hill” out of the headlines**, which is important because repetition and consistency is crucial to political movements like ours.
2. Moving to a new location means it becomes **harder for protestors to assemble and coordinate**. Capitol Hill is a hotbed for political activity, and having protests there was to our favor as we didn't have to travel anywhere to protest. Now, if we want to protest at the police, we have to travel, which means more time and more money. What’s more, the city can now possibly use hidden tactics like decreasing bus routes or metro cars to place further obstacles to assemble large numbers.
3. Leaving the barricades up after the police leave, means the **protestors may decide to set up a camp there**.

An “Autonomous Zone” seemed like a great idea—an area for open and peaceful discussion. But **an “occupation” makes us look like the aggressors**. As a result, **it leaves us vulnerable to political spin**, and *we are seeing that play out before our eyes* with news channels saying that we have “devolved into anarchy,” “we seek to overthrow the government,” and “lawlessness has descended upon Seattle.” ""We \[the Police\] are trying to negotiate but they have no leaders and they won't leave."" **Occupation distracts from our message and goals. Our goal is not to overthrow the government and set up our own city-state. Our goal is to elicit change in police accountability, actions, policies targeting people of color, and overall societal role.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Here is what we should do:**

**1)** **Take down the barriers**. Open the block back up. Allow businesses to take down the plywood and return the community to normal. This makes it look like the area is peaceful and economically successful now that the police have left. If the police return to the East Precinct, let the protesting continue there.

**2)** **Follow the police to their next precinct** with the message of “Running away won’t make this issue disappear. It won't make us disappear. We represent this issue and we will follow you until we get a response.”

Leaving the area with the barriers in place was no random act. It was a calculated decision aimed at swinging public opinion by enticing us to occupy the area. We took the bait and now they have us by the political balls because we cannot defend this action to the American public nearly as well as we could with peaceful, hands-raised protests in front of a brutal police line.",SeattleWA,2245

me_hill,2020-06-10 23:28:54+00:00,I ran Franchise Hockey Manager until every team without a cup won at least once. Most of us won't live to see the last team win.,"11 NHL franchises have never won a Stanley Cup. Four have never even played in a Cup Final. If you watch sports solely to see your team win a championship, you will likely be disappointed. In a league of 31 teams playing a game where the way a piece of rubber bounces across a sheet of ice can change destinies, even the professionals have to accept a level of influence from an indifferent universe. As fans, watching it all unfold without being able to offer any input at all can be maddening. Some fans joke, or seriously worry, that they won’t see a championship in their lifetime. But, thanks to Franchise Hockey Manger, we can simulate as many lifetimes as we need. We will follow the Arizona Coyotes, Buffalo Sabres, Columbus Blue Jackets, Florida Panthers, Minnesota Wild, Nashville Predators, Ottawa Senators, San Jose Sharks, Winnipeg Jets, Vancouver Canucks, and Vegas Golden Knights until they have all lifted the greatest trophy in sports. I will not manipulate the simulation to help them. You may argue that letting a computer program play this all out will produce an entirely arbitrary result. I would argue that you’re probably right, but the cruel whimsy of fate is part of why we love sports to begin with. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2019/20:** This season is replayed from scratch, starting with the original opening night lineups. In the real world, just four of our 11 protagonists were in a playoff spot before the shutdown. FHM gives us four as well, although the field of Buffalo, San Jose, Columbus, and Winnipeg looks different than what we were expecting. Buffalo and San Jose go out with just a single win between them, but the Jets and Blue Jackets cruise to their respective Conference Finals. The Jackets defeat the Leafs, but the Jets lose to the Flames. Who then go on to defeat the Jackets. This is the one situation where I don’t want the Flames to win, and they’ve gone and done just that. Let’s hope that, and those three series going 6, 6, and 6, are not omens. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2020/21:** I’ve excised the Seattle expansion, because its fans and future fans have not yet suffered any real-life disappointment. This experiment is about alleviating suffering, or perhaps prolonging it to horrifying extremes. Seattle’s pain must develop naturally.

&amp;nbsp;

The Canucks, Jets, and Blue Jackets all win their divisions, and the Sabres and Sharks qualify too. San Jose and Buffalo again exit with a whimper and, while our trio of division winners all advance to the second round, all fail to advance beyond it. The Canucks are knocked out in six by the Flames, who go on to repeat by sweeping Carolina. I must reiterate that I’m not manipulating the simulation. 

&amp;nbsp;


**2021/22:** The Jackets and Jets return to the playoffs, and this year they’re accompanied by the Panthers, Predators, and Coyotes. But only the Jets advance beyond the first round, needing just nine games to dispatch both Nashville and Dallas before they lose in five to, I’m so sorry, the Pacific division winning Calgary Flames. If it’s any consolation, the Flames are denied the three-peat, as the Flyers, who started the playoffs by dispatching the Jackets in six, also win the Cup in six. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2022/23:** This year it’s the Panthers, Sabres, Canucks, Predators, and Jets who get a shot at breaking the drought. Only the Predators and Sabres advance beyond the first round (apparent perennial threat Calgary knocks out Vancouver in six). Nashville and Buffalo lose to the Stars and Leafs in five in their respective Conference Finals, after which the Leafs need just another five games to secure their first Cup since 1967. A drought has been broken, but it’s not the one we’re looking to address. Even when Toronto wins they screw up.  

&amp;nbsp;

**2023/24:** The Sabres win their division, and the Jackets, Coyotes, Jets, Predators, and Wild all secure spots to give us our most promising field yet. Three teams lose hard fought seven game series, while the Coyotes sweep the Flames but are then swept by the Oilers. The Predators and Sabres make it all the way to their Conference Finals but lose in five and four, respectively. The Oilers and Devils wage a hard-fought, seven game battle for a Cup that goes to New Jersey. We’ve made no progress, but at least I can enjoy the tears of digital Oilers fans. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2024/25:** We’re back to just four challengers, with the Panthers, Sharks, Canucks, and Jets representing the ranks of the Cupless. The Oilers and Flames knock out the Canucks and Sharks, while the Jets and Panthers stall out in the second round. The Oilers go on to win a six game Battle of Alberta, a four game sweep of the Kings, and a seven game epic against the Red Wings. They are, ew, Stanley Cup champions, and have punished the hubris of my previous paragraph. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2025/26:** The Sabres win their division, while strong Preds, Sharks, and Knights teams join the field. With the appearance of Vegas, only the Ottawa Senators have yet to appear in this experiment. Their playoff drought goes back to 2017/18.

&amp;nbsp;

The Sharks and Predators make the second round. The former push the defending champions to seven before bowing out, while the latter are crushed in five by a Colorado juggernaut that goes on to win a thrilling seven game series against the Penguins. At the end of the season, Alexander Ovechkin announces his retirement. He leaves the league 17 goals behind Wayne Gretzky’s all-time record. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2026/27:** This is a promising year. The Wild and Golden Knights win their divisions, while the Sabres, Jets, Coyotes, and Canucks also qualify. The Coyotes show no mercy to their Cupless brethren, defeating Vancouver in seven before knocking out Las Vegas and Minnesota in two six game series. With the Sabres and Jets dropping out in the first round, the Coyotes are the second Cupless team to reach the Stanley Cup Finals in this experiment, and it’s the first of their now 30-year history in Arizona. 

It is anticlimactic. But, for Coyotes fans, it is anticlimactic in the best way possible. Arizona cruises to a four game sweep of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Led by returnee Dylan Strome and his 28 playoff points, the Arizona Coyotes are Stanley Cup Champions. One down, 10 to go.

&amp;nbsp; 

**2027/28:** The grim irony of this experiment is that, like with so many things in life, each success makes the next success just a little bit harder to achieve. Still, half of our seekers -- the Jackets, Canucks, Predators, Wild, and Jets -- all get a crack this year. Three of those teams promptly lose, although the Wild’s loss in a seven game opening series is Winnipeg’s victory. But it’s Nashville that draws eyes this year. Inspired by last year’s sight of Arizona lifting the first cup in franchise history, they rampage through the playoffs. After a thrilling seven game nail-biter against Chicago, they defeat the Jets and Avs in five each. Momentum appears to be on their side. Destiny appears to be on their side. They won their division. They racked up 105 points. Will they be the second team in as many years to win their first Cup?

No. They lose to Philadelphia in five. The 106 point Flyers lost just two games across the entire playoffs. A hot team is extinguished by a team going supernova. Sometimes sports are cruel. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2028/29:** The Nashville Predators win the Stanley Cup. Sometimes sports are a lesson in delayed gratification. 

In the regular season the Preds regressed to 95 points, but the hard lessons learned from last year’s Finals had clearly stuck. The Jets, Sharks, and Wild joined them in this year’s dance, and the Predators showed absolutely no mercy in immediately sweeping Winnipeg. After again taking out Colorado, this year in six, they met San Jose, who had dispatched Minnesota in seven back in the first round. They are once again merciless to their fellows in extended suffering, shoving them aside in five. The Cup Finals against Pittsburgh are a challenge, but nothing they can’t handle over six games. Filip Forsberg’s dominant 92 regular season points and 26 playoff points have brought an entire city joy and an entire franchise a slice of immortality. Nine teams watch on with increasingly frustrated envy.

&amp;nbsp;

**2029/30:** The east is shutout, but the Golden Knights, Sharks, Canucks, and Wild represent our shrinking field. The Golden Knights, for good measure, even win their division with 110 points. They look good in the playoffs. They look real good. They beat the Sharks and Flames in five, then the defending champs in six. But, much like Nashville two years before, they run into a team that’s even hotter. The 111 point Rangers defeat them in five. 

Despite the anticlimactic finish to their season, there are many reasons for Vegas to be excited for next year. It would be almost prophetic for them to repeat the script of a promising Cupless team losing the Finals in five, only to return with a vengeance the following season. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2030/31:** The New York Rangers win the Stanley Cup. Again. Vancouver, San Jose, and Minnesota all returned to the playoffs, but Las Vegas’ 69 point season sees them miss the playoffs entirely. Our smallest Cupless field since this experiment began saw all three teams advance to the second round, where the Canucks took down the Flames in seven while Minnesota defeated Winnipeg in five. A passionate all Canadian, all Cupless Western Conference Finals sees the Jets emerge after six games but, six games later, New York had broken the hearts of two cities in as many years. Dick move, New York. Dick move. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2031/32:** The Senators (did you forget they were in this experiment?) win their division, qualifying them for their first postseason since 2016/17. They lose in the first round, although they do give Boston a seven game fight. 

The Canucks and Wild are our only other teams, and they’re forced to play each other in the first round. Vancouver wins in six, then defeats Arizona in another six, but then they lose in five to, oh no I really am sorry, the Calgary Flames. The Flames then defeat the Red Wings in five more games for another Cup. 

When, in reality, the Calgary Flames won their only Stanley Cup, I was barely a year old. My father tells me I celebrated by urinating on him. As an adult in this hypothetical future I have been able to witness them win three more Cups, but every single one of them has served only to prolong this experiment.

&amp;nbsp;  

**2032/33:** The Blue Jackets return to the playoffs, joining a strong Cupless field that also includes Vancouver, San Jose, Minnesota, and Winnipeg (Ottawa has already returned to irrelevance). The Wild sweep the Jets, making them the only team of the five to advance to the second round. There they sweep again, this time against Chicago, before losing to Arizona in seven. The recently Cupless are now prolonging the torment of the teams they could once identify with. If it’s any consolation to their former fellows, the Coyotes lose the Cup to the Islanders in six. 

During the offseason, Connor McDavid retires. Although it will still be a few more years before every player active today leaves the league, we are approaching the point where FHM’s rosters will be entirely fictional. When that happens I will, in one sense, just be spinning an roulette wheel until the ball lands in the right slots. But this program can still capture the ebbs and flows of declines and rebuilds, of bad ownership and missed opportunities. And, perhaps most importantly, it can still capture some of the ineffable horror that embodies a long-suffering fandom. In a league of this size, much suffering is inevitable. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2033/34:** The Panthers return to the playoffs, joined only by Vancouver and Vegas. Only Florida wins a round, scraping out a seven game victory over Toronto, before losing to Pittsburgh in six. See? Suffering. The Penguins go on to the final, but fall in six to the Ducks.

&amp;nbsp;

**2034/35:** The Sabres win their division, San Jose finishes second in the Pacific, and Winnipeg also squeaks in before losing in seven to the Avs. Buffalo wins in seven over Pittsburgh but, in another grueling seven game series, falls to Boston. The Bruins march on to the Cup Finals, where they will face the San Jose Sharks.

Both teams have had hard roads. San Jose needed seven against both the Ducks and the Kings, then six against Chicago. Boston’s played just one game fewer. All signs point to another long, agonising series. Instead, it is a sweep. Led by Conn Smythe winning defencemen Dan Stevens, the San Jose Sharks are Stanley Cup champions. Eight teams remain.

&amp;nbsp;

**2035/36:** Seven teams remain. Half of our shrinking Cupless ranks -- Columbus, Buffalo, Vancouver, and Minnesota -- qualified this year. The Blue Jackets fall in the first round, the Canucks in the second. In the Conference Finals, the Wild defeat the Ducks in six but the Devils cruelly deny us an all Cupless Finals thanks to their seven game victory over Buffalo. But Minnesota doesn’t care about quibbles like that. After an easy five game series, the Minnesota Wild are Stanley Cup champions. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2036/37:** The momentum for the Cupless can’t continue. Winnipeg, Vancouver, Buffalo, Columbus, and Ottawa all suffer first round defeats. Ottawa’s five game loss is to the Panthers, who go out in five to the Bruins. Those Bruins advance to the Finals but lose in six to the Ducks.

&amp;nbsp;

**2036/37:** Vancouver, Columbus, Vegas, and Ottawa reach the postseason. But Vegas, Columbus, and Ottawa go out in the first round (after again losing to Boston in seven, it has now been 20 years since the Senators have won a playoff series), and Vancouver goes out a round later to Calgary in five. In the Cup Finals, the Avs sweep the Islanders. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2038/39:** The Jackets, Knights, Canucks, and Jets get another shot at ending the pain. It’s promising that so many of our shrinking field can still qualify, and Vegas and Columbus both reach their Conference Finals. But five game losses to the Blues and Bruins instead gives us a rematch of 2018/19, and while this installment only goes five games the Blues again emerge victorious. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2039/40:** We are now 20 years removed from reality, and a new decade brings new promise. The Canucks, Knights, and Sabres will attempt to make the most of it. With only Vancouver managing to escape the first round (in a five game defeat of Arizona), it looks to be another dour year for Cupless teams. But then they defeat the Oilers in six. And then they defeat the defending champion Blues in another six. In the Finals, they will meet the New York Rangers, who were terrorising Cupless teams a decade ago. The tradition continues.

Sorry, I meant *a* tradition continues. The tradition of Cupless teams winning easy, anticlimactic Cup Finals. After five games, the Vancouver Canucks are Stanley Cup champions. FHM is not yet sophisticated enough to tell us what happens to the city of Vancouver in the aftermath. Six teams remain. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2040/41:** Vegas and Buffalo return to the playoffs, and Columbus joins them. Like last season, two teams lose in the first round. And, like last season, one team goes all the way. After six games against Tampa Bay, a sweep of Toronto, and two more six game wins against Carolina and St. Louis, the Buffalo Sabres are Stanley Cup champions. It has taken the franchise 71 years. Fans who witness this moment will think of friends and family who couldn’t. Five teams remain.

&amp;nbsp; 

**2041/42:** Vegas and Columbus return to the playoffs, and Florida joins them. Like last season, two teams lose in the first round. And, like last season, one team goes all the way. If that sounds familiar, that’s because this is a golden age for Cupless teams. But will it be the Golden Knights or the Blue Jackets that emulate the Sabres in learning from recent defeats?

It will be neither. After a four year absence from the playoffs, the Panthers defeat the Jackets in six, sweep the Lightning, squeak past the Flyers in seven, then sweep the Blues who, in a reverse-Rangers, have lost two Finals in a row to Cupless teams. The Florida Panthers are Stanley Cup champions. Three Cupless teams have won in as many years, and only four remain. After some initial bumps, this experiment appears to be going well. But while some golden ages come to crashing halts, others can decline so gradually that, in the end, you don’t even realise that you’ve arrived in hell.  

&amp;nbsp;

**2042/43:** The slim ranks of the Cupless teams are beginning to feel desperate. Columbus and Vegas are playoffs perennials that can’t quite get over the hump, a generation of promise in Winnipeg has given way to an extended absence, and the Senators have had two playoff appearances in a quarter century. Only Vegas qualifies this year, and they go out in six to Colorado. In the Finals, the Devils defeat the Predators in six.

&amp;nbsp;

**2043/44:** Vegas is again the only team to qualify, and they again go out in the first round. The Islanders defeat the Avs in five.

&amp;nbsp;

**2044/45:** Vegas is now joined by Winnipeg and Columbus. Winnipeg’s return is short-lived—they lose in six to the Wild—while Columbus defeats the Rangers in seven but can’t handle a second helping of New York in a five game loss to the Islanders. But the Golden Knights are battle hardened. They’re frustrated by their recent first round exits, and they take their frustrations out on the division winning Ducks by sweeping them. The Sharks are defeated in seven, the Stars in five. The defending champion Islanders await.

It is a brutal, dramatic series that goes the distance. The Golden Knights are in their first Cup final since 2030, and they don’t want to lose to another New York team. But the universe doesn’t care what we want. Las Vegas loses game seven, and the Islanders repeat. Vegas is now 0-3 in Cup Finals. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2045/46:** Remember when Vegas lost the 2030 Finals? And I said they could build off of the experience, they could come back stronger next year, yadda yadda yadda, and then they had a miserable season? I should have saved that theory.

The Vegas Golden Knights win the Presidents’ Trophy. The first round sees the Jets lose while the Blue Jackets and, shock of shocks, the Senators, are absent entirely. But Vegas defeats the Canucks in six. They sweep the Sharks. They sweep the Avs. They do not sweep the Red Wings, who push them to another Cup Final game seven. Nervous fans are tired of seeing this script unfold before them. But the Golden Knights built off experience. They came back stronger. The Vegas Golden Knights become Stanley Cup champions. Three teams remain. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2046/47:** For the first season since this experiment began, no Cupless team qualifies for the playoffs. After a seven game Finals against Vancouver the Islanders become a modern dynasty by winning their third Stanley Cup in four years. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2047/48:** Columbus and Winnipeg lose in the first round. Vegas wins their second Cup in three years with a sweep of the Rangers. Revenge feels good. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2048/49:** Winnipeg loses an opening round matchup to Colorado for the second straight year, and this one is a sweep. Columbus misses the playoffs, while Ottawa fans struggle to remember what the playoffs even feel like. In a seven game Finals between the Flyers and the Predators, Nashville emerges victorious.

&amp;nbsp;

**2049/50:** The Jets reason that they can’t lose to the Avs in the playoffs if they don’t make the playoffs. There is no evidence that the Senators reason at all. But the Blue Jackets intend to make their golden anniversary in Columbus a memorable one, and they win their division with a 102 point season. They live up to the seeding, cruising past the Devils in five. The Penguins fall in six. So do the Leafs. 

Hot Cupless teams have, over the course of these decades, struggled against even hotter Finals opponents. But this year the West is fractured. The Presidents’ Trophy winning Avalanche were swept by the Blackhawks, prompting middle-aged Reddit users to recount some of their greatest memes. Those Hawks couldn’t capitalise on the momentum and fell to the Wild, who then advanced past the Oilers to reach the Finals. The Blue Jackets, a model of consistency this year, defeat them in six. The Columbus Blue Jackets are Stanley Cup champions. A half-century of shortcomings feel like they’ve been erased over night. Two teams remain. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Interregnum (2050/51 – 2059/60):** We should be witness to an epic duel to avoid the cruel fate of being the league’s last Cupless team. We instead descend into a sad farce. The entirety of the 2050s sees the Ottawa Senators muster up just one first round loss, and the Jets outperform them with two. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2060/61:** The Senators reappear in the playoffs and promptly lose to the Islanders, making it well over 40 years since their last series victory. But the Jets finally get some revenge against the Avalanche over the course of a gruelling seven game series, and then the Wild fall in seven as well. The Predators are swept away, pitting the Jets against the Flyers for the Cup. 

Much of the hockey world is pulling for the Jets. They couldn’t win a Cup in their original NHL years. The franchise couldn’t win a Cup in Atlanta. The Jets haven’t won a cup since their return to Winnipeg in 2011. In 2061, in a series that’s fought over a titanic seven games, the Winnipeg Jets do not win a Stanley Cup.

&amp;nbsp;

**2061/62:** The Senators and Jets both miss the playoffs. Jets fans wonder how many more years of suffering last year’s defeat has consigned them to. Senators fans have ascended beyond the traditional understanding of suffering to achieve either an advanced state of enlightenment or an advanced state of alcoholism. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2062/63:** The Winnipeg Jets face the Chicago Blackhawks in the first round, and win in six. The Ottawa Senators face the Montreal Canadiens in the first round and, after seven games, win their first playoff series since 2016/17. In that 46 year gap, some Senator fans will have lived and died without witnessing a single series victory. But now, in a year where the only two Cupless teams remaining both managed to advance to the second round, it feels like it should be fate for them to meet in an epic Finals that will be talked about throughout the ages.

Both teams lose round two game sevens.

&amp;nbsp;

**2063/64:** The Senators build on their round two game seven loss to the Red Wings with a round one game seven loss to the Red Wings, because no matter the era Ottawa ownership does not understand the concept of “build.” Winnipeg, however, marches on. Their 112 point season is good for second in the league, behind that titanic 127 point Detroit team. The Jets live up to the expectations of their long suffering fanbase by defeating the Coyotes and Blackhawks in five, then the Kings in six. Three seasons after suffering a heartbreaking game seven Cup Finals loss, the Jets will have to face an overwhelmingly talented Red Wings team.

No one would fault the Jets for losing here. This Wings team is one of the best the league has seen in decades. And, that sad gap in their trophy case aside, two Cup Finals in four years would be a lot for the Jets to build on. Winnipeg fans are supportive, but they are also realistic. When they go to another game seven, it’s hard for them to feel any optimism. It feels like they’ve seen this story before, only now their opponent is a minor deity. Fate, they feel, is simply stacked against them, and they are resigned to that. 

The Winnipeg Jets win the Stanley Cup. The Ottawa Senators are the only NHL franchise still wandering through the desert. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Purgatory (2064/65 – 2074/75):** The Senators are… okay. They qualify for the playoffs six times, their best 10 year stretch since this experiment began, and they win three first round series. It is as though, with the pressure of the Cupless race over, they can focus on simply being a competent hockey franchise. “Okay” isn’t nearly good enough to win a Cup, but it’s a start. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2075/76:** An 89 point Senators season feels much like the 10 seasons that have just preceded it. Ottawa is decent, but unremarkable. They will go to the playoffs and, thanks to their first wild card slot placing them against a Rangers team that won their division with just 95 points, their more optimistic fans think they can even win a series. They do, in six, which is nice.

Then they defeat the Islanders in six.

Then they defeat the Bruins in six.

This is suddenly a team of destiny. When the 200th anniversary of Canadian Confederation rolled around in 2067, the Senators were derided for being the only Canadian franchise without a Cup. Perhaps instead, on the 300th anniversary of American independence, the Senators can free themselves from hockey purgatory. The city of Ottawa is excited about hockey in a way it hasn’t been in the lifetime of most of its citizens. This is their moment. It has to be.

The Senators lose to the Oilers in five. 

Goddammit, Ottawa. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2076/77:** The Ottawa Senators miss the playoffs. The Edmonton Oilers win their third straight Stanley Cup. 

*Fuck.* 

&amp;nbsp;

**The Hell Years (2077/78 – 2093/94):** Over a 16-year stretch the Ottawa Senators qualify for the playoffs just five times. In 2079 they reach the Conference Finals, losing in seven to the Capitals, and in 2090 they manage to reach the second round before losing in six to the Lightning. This is a fate far worse than purgatory. Fans in Ottawa had a taste of opportunity, and it turned to ash in their mouths. 

&amp;nbsp;

**2094/95:** The Ottawa Senators began their first NHL season 103 years ago. Children born in Ottawa as I write this, babes who are being swaddled lovingly in Senators blankets, will turn 75-years-old. If you are an 18-year-old Senators fan reading this today you will be 93, perhaps a grandparent or great-grandparent who regales your descendants with tales of your legendary shitposting. Assuming, of course, that Sens-fandom induced cirrhosis hasn’t killed you long ago. Most of you reading this will have died for one reason or another, and the vast majority of the players we watched this year and in years past will have also passed away. 

In 2095, in a world that will bare little resemblance to the one we live in today, the Ottawa Senators skate to a competent but unremarkable 43-35-4 season, good for third in a weak Atlantic division. In the first round of the playoffs they face the Montreal Canadiens who, having not won the Stanley Cup since 1992-93, are facing their own century long existential crisis. The Senators win in six games, and fans will at least be happy that they’ll suffer a bit less than their long-time rivals this year. If you’re going through hell you’re told you should keep going, but it helps to see some other poor bastard getting it even worse while you do.   

One of the things that fascinates me about sports is its ability to transcend time. Were you to be dropped 75 years into the past you may not have many of the same opinions or cultural touchstones of those around you, but you could all still agree that you want your team to put the puck in the net. Time also gives meaning to sports, as much of the drama comes from knowing that the events and opportunities we witness may not come around again for a long, long while. 75 years are, after all, a long time. In the second round of the 2095 NHL playoffs, the Senators defeat the Red Wings in six and advance to their first Conference Finals since 2079. 

75 years ago World War II was wrapping up, and much of what we take for granted today -- norms, technologies, nations -- did not exist. I can’t even begin to conceive of what the world will look like 75 years from now, nor can I really conceive of the fact that I will almost certainly no longer exist to witness it. But I can tell you that, over six games, the Ottawa Senators will defeat the Pittsburgh Penguins and advance to face the Vegas Golden Knights in the Stanley Cup Finals. 

On the cusp of the 22nd century, I imagine that even hockey will look quite different from how it does today. The sport today certainly looks quite different from how it did on the cusp of the 20th and 21st centuries. But hopefully people will still love it, and that will be enough. It’s been 202 years since the Stanley Cup was first awarded and, after a five game series, it will be awarded to the Ottawa Senators.

One friend took 5 weeks to get over it, his mom was hospitalized, his dad was in the ICU for two days before recovering. 

My good friend just texted me about how her nana died overnight from COVID and she wasn’t able to say goodbye because no ones allowed in the hospitals. 

I know we’re all geeking out over the tea—I legit enjoy a steamy brew as well as anyone else—but I’m from her hometown (VB), my whole family is there, and I’ve been super worried about them. And I bet a lot of y’all are in similar boats. And it’s just such *-t r a s h-* behavior for BN contestants to go flying around, violating these orders, like it’s not a big deal or like they’re somehow impervious to this virus. 

That shit was difficult to get over and I’m young. These orders exist for a reason and shouldn’t be violated so she can get her external validation and he can get his dick wet. Ditto for anyone else in BN traveling now.

**ETA** This blew up! I’m glad to see I’m not alone. I appreciate the well wishes and *really* appreciate every person working in medicine right now to take care of us. Y’all are the real MVPs. Sending love to everyone worried about their loved ones too 💐

I actually just got off a telehealth check-in with my doc and wanted to share this little bit of info. I see a lot of us are exhausted—with the sheltering, the sustained outrage, the rule breakers, with the loneliness... Shit is draining. But he gave me info that made me feel hopeful for the first time. 

I’m from VB, all my family lives in VB, but my partner and I moved to Seattle where they had the first diagnosed case back in January and the first deaths here too. **For the first time since we’ve all started SIP/SAH orders, my doc told me that the local r0 number is below 1:** (it was like est. 1:0.89)

Basically, for every 1 person infected with Covid in king county/Seattle right now, *less than 1 person will catch it because of the work we’ve been doing staying in place. We are flattening the curve!!!* 🎉

It’s hard, draining, miserable work, but it’s working. Lots more to do. Seattle was first hit, first to recover. But if we do our part, there is reason to hope. 🌒",thebachelor,2158

Anilxe,2019-10-31 16:04:00+00:00,"I just want to say thanks to random Seattle man, but also thank myself for the growth I've gone through","Yesterday I was waiting at the bus with a somewhat large crowd of people, holding my tiny dog. The bus was pulling in and everyone was lining up. A guy who I believe was drunk came up behind me and slid his hand down my back and almost to my ass. It made my skin crawl, and I jerked away from him. I'm usually pretty timid/ nervous, and I've been sexually assaulted more times than I can count on one hand in my 28 years. But lately, I've been working on my backbone and saying no instead of trying to alleviate other people's feelings. Especially now that I have a small dog, I've noticed more and more people are perfectly fine getting into my personal space without my consent and I'm just not cool with that 

I looked back at him and said very clearly, 

""Don't touch me.""

He had scoffed at me, and said, loudly and incredulously ""Don't touch you?!"" This really hit a nerve, I've already established my boundary and he just dismisses it like I'm some overreacting child. So I looked him square in the eye, and said ""Yes, don't *fucking* touch me."" in the loudest voice I could muster. He froze and stared at me for a moment, and before he could say anything else a guy at the front of the line to get on the bus called me over and said ""Here ma'am, get on the bus, he's a drunk asshole."" I nodded and jumped the line, and as the guy behind me got on I heard him tell the bus driver ""Hey, don't let that guy on. He inappropriately touched that woman and isn't listening to her No."" 

It just felt so relieving to have someone on my side. Normally in large crowds like that, I've noticed people are just too nervous to help or say something, so I really appreciated it.",TwoXChromosomes,3686

RustyGlass,2019-10-26 09:41:16+00:00,TIFU by Playing Music for a Sex Dungeon,"I currently live in an apartment building in Seattle. Nearby my unit is a man named ""Frank"" and his girlfriend (who is quite vocal, thus why I know her boyfriend's name). Now Frank and his girlfriend have incredibly loud sex throughout the entirety of Friday and Saturday nights. Annoyed by all of the sound and trying to find a way to blot it out, I began a habit a few months ago of playing music (singing, playing guitar) whenever they would start doing the dirty over the course of the last couple months. As an added bonus, I could hear my neighbors yell ""sing"" throughout the night, so I assumed it was a helpful solution to an unfortunate circumstance born by all of the neighbors.

&amp;#x200B;

However, tonight, I noticed something kind of strange. They were having sex, per usual, and I began to play music to cover up the sound. I stopped to drink some water between songs, when some of my neighbors started yelling ""play."" For some reason, though, I didn't do anything for a few seconds, and I heard the guy, Frank's, voice call out ""keep playing or I'm not going to cum"" through the walls. I listened a while longer to see if I was right, and they both kept moaning the same thing. It was at this point that I came to a terrible conclusion. In my attempts to cover up the sound of them having sex, I managed to pull some weird Pavlovian trick where whenever they had sex, I played guitar and sang. Thus, whenever I started to play guitar to cover up an original sound, it just added to their voyeuristic thrill and they started to depend upon it to finish. When I'd heard my presumed neighbors yell sing, it was actually Frank and his girlfriend. Unsure if I was right, I started playing another song and when I finished, they were going as hard as possible and moaning heavily so I assumed correctly. 

&amp;#x200B;

My neighbors them get understandably angry and begin to have really rough revenge sex against my wall because they think that I've caused this problem (which I have). At this point, I'm listening to Frank and his girlfriend and the couple next to my wall, one couple horny and one full of revenge, and all of this was because I tried to save myself from listening to sex in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Thought I was covering up sex sounds with music, turns out I was serenading a couple while they fucked and keeping them horny all night. Neighbors had angry sex against my bedroom wall as revenge for disturbing their sleep by my musical facilitation.",tifu,32035

qafail,2019-10-19 16:57:59+00:00,Be careful taking a QA role if you really want to do SWE work,"I'm just writing this as a warning to others. I graduated college and had some SWE offers, which is where I wanted to be. However, I then happened to get a QA role at a really good company. I figured that I could just switch internally after a year or two and then I would be SWE + be at a good company.

I should've known something was up because this was also the only interview where they tried to 'sell' to me. They claimed throughout the entire process that QA is just ""another form of development"" and I would be doing all sorts of scripting and work on lots of coding projects. I also had no technical questions at all, my only interview to be like that. The constantly claimed that I would ""basically be SDET"" but my title was Test Engineer (which by the way, is a trap. They want to pay you as a manual tester but want the work output of a SWE). They also started off my salary at the same as my SWE offers.

I was naive so I thought they were just really into me (when in fact they were desperate for software engineers in their department). I took it, and when I tried to leave I realized how stuck I was.

Throughout my job there for 2 years I spent a decent amount of time stuck with manual testing. I went ""above and beyond"" and tried to change the pipelines by writing scripts/using Jenkins/general CI/CD stuff. I was the only one doing this on my team, so things were slow, and I was still required to do all my manual testing. Luckily I took some initiative during my job there and did some scripting and Jenkins.

I basically couldn't even get a job interview for any software engineer roles (even internally). I would sometimes get to HR and then the hiring manager and they would just brush me off. I understood, it made sense to just hire a software engineer instead of a test engineer. If you take a QA role, you're pigeonholing yourself into QA (or some form of it). And I know that at least in my area, QA pays lower, you have smaller raises, fewer opportunities, and generally will be ""2nd class"" to SWE. I don't mean that in a bad way, I know QA is important and I really respected my teammates who actually liked doing it, but this warning is for those of you that are graduating or faced with a QA offer but want to be SWE.

After 8 months I finally got stupid lucky and impressed a company into a software engineer role. 

The other thing is that I'm a pretty average guy, I'm not aiming towards the big companies in SF/Seattle. I had to work so hard to get my interviewing skills to handle essentially leetcode medium to switch to an average company as a software engineer.

Just a heads up for those of you interested in development but getting potentially spicy offers in the QA department.",cscareerquestions,1010

IanMazgelis,2019-10-03 05:36:51+00:00,I am sincerely disturbed by how transparently many members of the associated press are hoping that there be a mass murder during the opening weekend of Joker.,"I think that in the past couple years, people have begun to become receptive to the idea that heavy reporting on mass murder begets more mass murders. What especially bothers me is that there has essentially been no action taken on this particular part of the epidemic.

Recently, and I'm sure many people reading this have noticed the same thing, this has gotten to the point where reporters are hyping up mass murders as if it's a sporting event or video game convention. I've seen the exact same level of rumor peddling and dripping information lead to the announcement of a big football player trade or the announcement of a remake of an old PlayStation game.

I can't be alone in being disgusted by it. The abhorrent giddiness in these headlines is almost palpable through the text alone. It's as if they're excited for every little scrap of information that might indicate a big event happening this weekend, that event being people's lives ending in a gruesome way.

I'm sure people will, perhaps rightfully so, argue that I'm reading too deeply into this. But doesn't anyone else get the feeling that this is, at the very least, harmful? The idea of a mass murder at these screenings is being pushed so hard they might as well be literally asking high risk individuals to do it.

I know people often shame movies, games, and comic books for glorification of violence, but this is giving a hypothetical murder an actual buzz akin to the movies they shame for depicting them. I feel like, whether they admit it or not, they'll be disappointed if everyone goes home happy and healthy having enjoyed the movie.",unpopularopinion,1142

This week at Bungie, we’re on final countdown for launch.


It’s been a long summer of reveals, travels, interviews, and updates. Now we find ourselves in that old familiar clearing at the end of the path. This is the final weekly update that we’ll have before we blast off on another adventure.


Our new launch trailer is making the rounds. Here it is if you haven’t had a chance to watch yet.


[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFYJTudJ540)


Today, you’ll find us ticking all the boxes on the pre-flight checklist. There are some final items we want to cover before you set out to investigate the mysteries of the Moon. Here’s what you’ll find during a lengthy final scroll:



* Combat Changes
* Progression and Economy Changes
* Patch Note Preview
* Ritual Weapons and Perk Changes
* Set It Straight
* Wear It With Pride
* Bungie Rewards


Let’s start the clock.


***



##Combat Changes

As discussed [previously](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48072), damage numbers in Destiny 2 have been a bit out of control. We’re making some adjustments so the numbers shown are smaller and easier to comprehend without affecting the percentage of damage you’re dealing. We’re also adjusting how your Power works when you go up against enemies tougher than you. Here are some more details on what to expect. 

###PvE Damage Numbers Display

Goal: To provide players with useful and legible feedback for damage dealt to enemy combatants across many years of Power progression.



* Displayed damage numbers for damage dealt to non-Guardian enemy combatants are crunched


   * Damage dealt is displayed using fewer digits to enhance readability of damage output
   * Occurrences of displayed damage getting capped at 999,999 should be significantly reduced or eliminated
   * The exponential curve used to calculate damage numbers for display is replaced with a new linear curve that is built to last for many years
   * As players grow in Power, displayed damage numbers increase at a much more measured pace than previously
   * **This is a UI update only; player damage output, whether measured as hits to kill, time to kill, or DPS, remains unchanged by this update**

###**PvE Difficulty Tuning**

Goals: Widen the sweet spot where fighting higher-level combatants provides a fun, challenging, and rewarding combat experience for a more enjoyable Power climb. Also, allow players looking for even greater challenges to confront much higher-level enemies.



* Combatants that are 10–40 levels higher take less time to kill and deal less damage
* Higher-level combatants continue to increase in difficulty up to 100 Power levels above the player
* When enemies are 100 Power levels or higher above the player, they are immune to damage
* Nameplate icons on higher-level combatants have been updated to reflect these changes
* These changes affect only higher-level combatants; the at-level or over-level experience remains unchanged



***



##Progression and Economy Changes

Every Season brings with it some tweaks to the Power climb. Shadowkeep is going to deliver significant changes to how you grow in strength. We also want to make you aware of changes to various currencies and the [Eververse Trading Company](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47935) before you set out to power up your gear.

###Rewards Power and Progression



* All non-powerful rewards now drop 3 to 0 points below your highest equippable Power level, up from 15 to 20 below
* Year 2 powerful reward sources have changed to Legendary rewards

   * These sources no longer have a chance to drop a random Exotic instead of the Legendary gear
* Bonus Exotics that drop from Nightfall: The Ordeal will drop at the character’s highest equippable Power level
* Under- and over-leveling activities no longer adjust how much Power is received from the rewards
* Experience no longer fuels a player’s character level, which has been changed to be level 50 for all characters


   * Experience instead progresses the Season Pass, Seasonal Artifact mod, and Power progressions, as well as the unlocking of destinations for new characters
   * Experience rewards have been rebalanced with the introduction of the Season Pass and Seasonal Artifact progressions
* The Power granted from the Seasonal Artifact is additive with the Power of the player’s equippable gear, but does not increase the Power of gear drops
* All existing gear has had its Power increased to a minimum of 750; new characters will begin Destiny 2 at Power 750 as well
* The Power bands for Season 8 are as follows

   * Floor: 750
   * Soft Cap: 900


      * All drops up to this point will be upgrades to the most powerful item in your inventory or vault
      * Beyond this point, only powerful and pinnacle rewards will increase a player’s Power
   * Powerful Cap: 950


      * All non-powerful/pinnacle rewards are capped at 950
      * Pinnacle rewards are the only way to raise Power above this point
      * Powerful rewards are equivalent to the character’s highest-equippable Power beyond this point
   * Pinnacle Cap: 960


      * This is the highest Power at which gear drops; also known as the “hard cap”
      * The Seasonal Artifact bonus Power allows characters to attain values above this level
* Prime Engrams


   * Prime Engrams now gain charges more quickly, drop more frequently, and have a higher maximum charge cap (nine charges, up from six during Year 2)
   * The Power gains have been rebalanced for the increased frequency, providing +3 Power, down from a range of +4 to +7
   * Players who have completed the “Prime Example” quest prior to Shadowkeep’s release will earn charges, but those charges won’t drop until the character has reached 900 Power
   * This will help players avoid spending charges early for gains that are most beneficial during the Soft Cap to Powerful Cap range

###Bright Dust



* Bright Dust is now earned by completing Crucible, Gambit, and Vanguard weekly and repeatable bounties


   * We chose to grant all of Bright Dust from ritual weekly bounties rather than spreading it out across the weekly and daily bounties so players could more easily earn Bright Dust without having to make sure they complete every single daily
   * Players will be able to do the repeatable bounties as many times as they like
   * Any Crucible, Gambit, or Vanguard completed bounties need to be turned in before maintenance begins on 9/30 as these changes will reset them; other bounties—Gunsmith, clan, Eververse, etc.—can still be claimed after Oct 1
* Eververse items no longer dismantle into Bright Dust, and instead grant legendary shards and glimmer
* New Eververse items for Season of the Undying will become available for Bright Dust two weeks into the Season
* Eververse items no longer require Bright Dust to reacquire them(or re-roll perks) from Collections; instead, they cost the same materials that reward items of the same type/rarity use
* Fireteam Medallions have been removed from the store, deprecated into Fizzled Fireteam Medallions, and can now be dismantled into Bright Dust to recover their purchase price (50 Bright Dust)
* Gleaming Boon of the Vanguard price has been lowered to 150 Bright Dust
* Gleaming Boon of the Crucible price has been lowered to 500 Bright Dust

###Eververse



* The Season 7 Best of Year One Engram has been retired, and in its place, players can now obtain the new Season 8 Nostalgic Engram
* The Seasonal Milestone no longer grants a bounty; instead, it directly grants a Bright Engram
* The Season 8 Nostalgic Engram is no longer earned at level up


   * Instead, the Bright Engram is now included in the free rewards of the Season Pass that are visible before level 100; it’s also awarded every 5 levels after level 100
* The Eververse storefront is now available via the Director
* Eververse bounties (standard and IGR versions) have been deprecated; any remaining bounty notes can be broken down into Bright Dust


   * You can still complete and turn in any outstanding Eververse bounties until they expire 

###Glimmer



* Players can now store up to 250,000 Glimmer
* Glimmer rewards from the majority of sources in the game have been rebalanced


   * Most open world sources (public events, Lost Sectors, chests) have been significantly increased
   * Passive Glimmer gain on kill has been reduced
   * In addition to directly awarding Glimmer on kill, combatants will sometimes drop additional Glimmer chunks
* Weekly bounties award a large amount of Glimmer in addition to their other rewards

###Spider’s Exchange



* The Spider welcomes new opportunities with four arms open and now deals in materials from all planets
* However, the Spider has noted changes in market value, and has adjusted his exchange rates accordingly:


   * Glimmer exchange now costs 10 Legendary Shards or 20 materials, and yields 10,000 Glimmer
   * Tangled Shore daily bounties no longer award Glimmer, providing instead Etheric Spirals (in keeping with his competition)
   * Weekly wanted bounties no longer award gear, but now provide between 3,000 and 15,000 Glimmer in addition to the Enhancement Cores currently offered

###Xûr



* Xûr’s inventory pool and Fated Engram now include world-drop Exotics from Year 2


***


##Patch Note Preview

We’ll have a bunch of bullet points for you to peruse next week. Here’s something to tide you over until then.


* Added rally banners to Leviathan, Eater of Worlds, and Spire of Stars 


* “The Shattered Throne” Dungeon is now available at all times instead of on a three-week cycle


   * It can also be launched and reset from the Director


* Black Armory forges are now accessible through a Director-launched playlist on EDZ


* Weapon mods are now treated as reusable unlocks instead of consumables; any mods you have in your inventory will be converted to unlocks


   * If the only copy of a mod you have is already in a gun, you will need to reacquire one to unlock it 


* Discarding an Enhancement Core no longer deletes the entire stack


* Borealis and Hardlight now match the Prism modifier when changing elements on reload, rotating through Void, Arc, and Solar


* Fixed an issue where the Hunter’s Tempest Strike melee ability couldn’t be performed if the sprint button/key was set to Hold


* The Phoenix Protocol Hearth perk will no longer award bonus Super energy on kills and assists to Warlocks inside a Well of Radiance if they do not also have the Well of Radiance (Attunement of Grace) subclass equipped


* Fixed an issue where allied Golden Gun projectiles weren’t going through Banner Shields


* Fixed an issue where the Queen’s Wrath perk for the Exotic Wish-Ender Bow wasn’t correctly highlighting players if their shield was depleted


* Players who’ve obtained the Salute emote in the past can now correctly select it in their collection and assign it to their emote wheel


* Multiplayer (buddy) emotes will now have a visible indication of where a player can stand to interact and initiate the emote


* Failing the first encounter for any Black Armory forge will no longer award planetary destination materials. ಠ_ಠ

##Ritual Weapons and Perk Changes

In Season of the Undying, pinnacle weapons will become ritual weapons. They will no longer have special perks and will instead be curated rolls. A previous article incorrectly showed two new pinnacle weapons. The good news is you will be getting three ritual weapons for each of the ritual activities: Crucible, Vanguard, and Gambit. Here’s the **Destiny Dev Team** on why we made this difficult decision and some information on upcoming perk changes. 


&gt;
&gt;**Destiny Dev Team**: The decision to stop creating extremely powerful pinnacle weapons was made for a variety of reasons. The first was that the band in which “pinnacle” perk can exist is actually quite small, and most of them far exceeded the efficacy they should have been at. Another issue is that they cause problems in the player ecosystem, particularly in the case of the Crucible pinnacle weapons. Due to the nature of PvP and PvE, anything that works well in PvP is likely going be extremely effective in PvE as well. This forces players into the Crucible if they want the “best” loadouts. Even the title of “pinnacle” set a variety of unrealistic expectations. Rather than being the absolute height of Legendary power, they were supposed to be interesting novelties to chase.


&gt;
&gt;These problems became more pronounced the more of them we produced. In the end, we decided to move away from pinnacle weapons. If you managed to collect them all, we hope you enjoy them!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;While we’re on the subject of weapons, here are a few important notes on changes to how perks will work.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;###Reduced the effectiveness of the following perks in PvE:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* Rampage, Kill Clip, Swashbuckler, Multikill Clip, Desperado, Surrounded, Master of Arms, Onslaught
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   * In general, these perks use the same damage multipliers for PvE that they did in PvP
&gt;   * The change to Rampage does not affect the Huckleberry
&gt;   * Onslaught and Desperado now change bullet impact values while active in PvE
&gt;   * Surrounded no longer multiplies precision damage on top of base damage, as it was benefiting some weapon types more than others as a result
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Legendary weapons have become too powerful overall. In many cases, they even outclass Exotic Primary weapons, so we’re walking them all back a bit. All the way back in original Destiny, we had a perk named Crowd Control, which was Rampage’s predecessor. Crowd Control capped out at a bonus of +15% extra damage. At this point in Destiny 2, Rampage caps out at about +67%. That’s a 447% increase from the original iteration. Legendary damage perks have become so powerful, they simply invalidate non-damage related perks. 


Here’s a quick preview of the three ritual weapons you can earn in Season of the Undying. Because these weapons are no longer pinnacle weapons, the quest required to earn them is not as in depth as previous seasons.

##Set It Straight

During the run up to launch, we’ve been dropping videos, articles, interviews, and information all over the internets. Along the way, the fact-checkers called us out a few times. Today, we’re issuing some corrections to previous transmissions.


1. There was a shot of Trials of the Nine armor in the launch trailer by mistake. We wanted to clear up any confusion and let players know that the Trials of the Nine set will not obtainable in Season of the Undying.


2. We also had to revise our gameplay calendar for Season of the Undying. The menu of action is the same, but we are adjusting the timing of the Nightmare Hunts. The new schedule looks like this:


[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127658/Destiny_SoU_Calendar_EN.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/RbcJnvC.png)


3. Back when we were first talking about finishers and some of the mods that go with them, we talked about how one of the mods enabled you to spawn Heavy ammo for your fireteam when you executed a finisher. That was still in flux at the time, and for balance reasons we ended up making a mod that will spawn Heavy ammo for yourself and a mod that will spawn Special ammo for your fireteam.

##Wear It With Pride

At Bungie, our mission is to build worlds the inspire friendship. Our games become places where people—all kinds of people—can gather to share meaningful experiences. One of the most important aspects of friendship is acceptance. Earlier this year, we took to the streets as part of the Seattle Pride Parade. We also offered up a Pride Pin via the Bungie Store that was rumored to have an emblem that would come with it. The rumors are true, and we’ve chosen International Coming Out Day as the advent to deploy the in-game expression of acceptance. 


[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127658/Pride.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/58LI4EX.jpg)


For the details, along with a personal story to capture the spirit of that day, here is one of our own…


&gt;
&gt;Hi Y’all,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;My name’s Nigel. You may know me from things like the [Shattered Throne Ride Along](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/418163901?t=00h12m01s), or this [wonderful fan video](https://youtu.be/UDpZbFdJ14Y?t=52) made during our St. Jude’s charity stream. This is my first TWAB post and I’m a little nervous, so I’m going to use one of my favorite TV shows, Golden Girls, as a crutch.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Picture it. Tempe, Arizona 2009.  A sophomore in college. At this point in my life, I’d never really had a girlfriend or really found myself attracted to a woman. I refused to believe I was gay. Having seen so many coming-out stories go poorly, with family and friends abandoning people they loved, I didn’t want that for myself. So I ignored it by playing video games.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Dragon Age: Origins had just released, and my twin brother had been bugging me for a good week to buy it and play it. Quickly I found myself wrapped in magic and steel for an untold, but probably perfectly healthy, amount of time. During this time, I found myself conversing with one of the male party members, simply trying to raise his approval.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;That’s when it appeared. The option to flirt with this character. I was as the kids say, “[shooketh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMrh0MnCxw).” I sat for what must have been twenty minutes before deciding to click on it. He flirted back. My heart skipped. I was a ball of nerves and anxiety as the conversation continued with another chance to confess romantic feelings to the character. I thought I was going to vomit all over a simple choice in a video game. I debated with myself, what did it mean that I wanted to flirt with this character? Why did I suddenly feel like my entire existence would be changed with this one conversation? I clicked it.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;And that’s when I learned about [rejection](https://media.giphy.com/media/a9xhxAxaqOfQs/giphy.gif). From a digital character. He wasn’t gay, and my heart sunk. But his next words were something I didn’t know I needed. “There’s nothing wrong with who you love. You are my friend no matter what.” I spent the next two hours on the floor [crying](https://m.imgur.com/a/8WgexWA), finally feeling that it was okay to be gay. I felt more comfortable than I’d ever felt in my life. I vowed, if I ever got the opportunity to pay it forward, I would.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Well I’m helping to pay it forward. I’ve spent a lot of my time at Bungie helping to make sure Destiny is a welcoming place. I have marched in the Seattle Pride Parade. I have helped set up the Trevor Foundation and other LGBTIQA+ charities. Most recently, I helped create those wonderful Bungie Pride Pins you keep seeing on our streams. I’m happy to announce that, on October 11, International Coming Out Day, we’ll be releasing a Pride emblem for your Guardian if you’ve purchased this pin. If you missed the chance to buy the pin back in June, mark your calendars, because we’ll be restocking our supply on the Bungie Store.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Destiny and Bungie are places where we can foster community and work together, no matter your background. We at Bungie want to make sure no matter who you love, or who you are, that everyone belongs in the Tower. Or the Farm, if you’re into that.


Nigel speaks true. Thanks for being excellent to each other. Any players who previously purchased the Pride Pin will be receiving codes for the emblems through email.

##Bungie Rewards

Last week, we showed off a preview of the World’s First belt and some of the emblems you can earn in our upcoming pinnacle PvE activity. We weren’t quite ready to show off the awesome jacket Bungie Rewards will be offering, but the design is ready for the runway.


[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127658/Raid_Jacket.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4TwWvYX.jpg)


Any player who beats the “Garden of Salvation” raid and claims their code before the weekly reset on 10/15 will be eligible to purchase the raid jacket through Bungie Rewards. We are giving you some extra time to Power up this time. We know many of you don’t enjoy rushing through content, so even if you aren’t ready to take on the raid before 10/15, any player who completes “Garden of Salvation” during Season of the Undying will be eligible to purchase a special raid T-shirt through Bungie Rewards.


[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127658/Raid_Shirt.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/UOzP0Wd.jpg)


So… the shirt has some spoilers on it, but we’ll share out what it looks like after the raid is completed.


That’s not all! Players can also claim a free Eris Morn papercraft mask by completing the main Shadowkeep quest by the end of Season 8. If you’re already receiving Bungie newsletter emails, you’ll get a direct link the next day, or you can visit [www.bungie.net/rewards](http://www.bungie.net/rewards) to redeem it. Stay tuned for more Bungie Rewards throughout the season.

##Full Steam Ahead



[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127469/D2_DPS_Gif_.gif)


Player Support is waiting in the wings to support our next launch. 


This is their report.

&gt;
&gt;###Upcoming 24-Hour Maintenance
&gt;
&gt;This upcoming Monday, September 30, Destiny 1 and Destiny 2 will be taken offline for extended maintenance on all platforms.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**This maintenance will last for approximately 24 hours**, starting at 10 AM PDT (1700 UTC), ending with the launch of Destiny 2: Shadowkeep on October 1. During this downtime, players will be unable to log in to Bungie.net or access Destiny API features.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;For the latest information on this maintenance as it occurs, including download availability and emergent issues, players should follow [@BungieHelp](https://twitter.com/bungiehelp) on Twitter or monitor our support feed on [help.bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/help).
&gt;
&gt;###Pre-loading Destiny 2: Shadowkeep and Update 2.6.0
&gt;
&gt;Right now, [all PC players can pre-load Destiny 2 on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1085660/Destiny_2/), which includes pre-loading for [New Light](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/NewLight) and [Shadowkeep](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/Shadowkeep). Since New Light makes Destiny 2 accessible to everyone for free, no purchase is necessary to pre-load.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Existing console players will be able to pre-load Update 2.6.0 during the maintenance leading up to launch. The moment we confirm that downloads are available, we’ll sound off from the support links provided above.
&gt;
&gt;###FOLLOW UP: Delay in Forsaken License Transfers for Migrating PC Players
&gt;
&gt;[Last week](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48163), we discussed the likely delay of Forsaken license transfers for migrated PC players on Steam. With the announcement of our upcoming 24-hour maintenance, we hope to mitigate any possible delay in Forsaken license transfers following the launch of Shadowkeep on October 1. If any such delays occur, we’ll be sure to sound off from the support links provided above.
&gt;
&gt;###PC Migration and New Characters on Steam
&gt;
&gt;Following the launch of Shadowkeep and Destiny 2 Update 2.6.0 on October 1, players who link their Steam account to their Bungie.net profile will be able to manually trigger PC Migration.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Players should be aware, however, that any new characters created on Steam before performing PC migration will be overwritten when players migrate from Battle.net. This will result in the potential loss of new characters and gear, as well as Silver, Eververse items, and Season Passes—if purchased on these new characters before performing PC migration.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;To make things as simple as possible, here’s the recommended order of operations for players who perform PC migration to Steam after Shadowkeep launches on October 1:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;



&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;1. [Link your Steam account to your existing Bungie.net profile](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/PCMove) and initiate PC Migration. Please ensure you are linking to the same Bungie.net profile associated with your Battle.net account. **Once manually triggered, PC Migration cannot be undone.**



&gt;
&gt;
&gt;2. If desired, [enable Cross Save](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/CrossSave) so your preferred characters are available when you log in to Destiny 2 on Steam. PC Migration will still transfer your Battle.net characters to Steam, even if another set of characters is selected for Cross Save. This also determines which characters receive any Silver or Season Passes purchased on Steam before logging in.



&gt;
&gt;
&gt;3. On Steam, download and install [*Destiny 2*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1085660/Destiny_2/). If you have not yet downloaded Steam, [click here](https://store.steampowered.com/about/).



&gt;
&gt;
&gt;4. Log in to Destiny 2.



&gt;
&gt;
&gt;5. Your Battle.net characters, licenses, and Silver will already be migrated to your Steam account, however your Cross Saved characters will appear if Cross Save is enabled.



&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**IMPORTANT**: Since purchased Silver and Season Passes are applied to the first character set that players log in with after purchase, we **strongly** recommend that players enable Cross Save before logging in to Destiny 2 on Steam. This will ensure that your desired characters are receiving your Silver and Season Passes on the Steam platform. Cross Save-enabled characters will be able to bring their Season Passes with them to any platform after they have been applied.
&gt;
&gt;###REMINDER: Destiny 2 and Silver Purchases on Battle.net
&gt;
&gt;This week, we’d like to remind PC players that Destiny 2 game content and Destiny 2 Silver can no longer be purchased from the Battle.net Shop.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Existing PC players can continue to play on Battle.net until Destiny 2 undergoes maintenance for Steam launch. Players should also be aware that in order for recent Silver purchases to successfully transfer to Steam, **players MUST log in to Destiny 2 on Battle.net ****before 10 AM PDT (1700 UTC) on September 30, 2019 ****to claim their purchased Silver.**
&gt;
&gt;###**REMINDER: Battle.net Code Redemption for Destiny 2**
&gt;
&gt;As another reminder, **players should be aware that any Battle.net code they possess for Destiny 2 content MUST be redeemed on their Battle.net account before they perform PC Migration**. Players who have already prepared for PC Migration have until the start of Destiny 2 maintenance on **September 30** to redeem any unused Battle.net codes—to have that license transfer to their Steam account.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Players who migrate to Steam after our October 1 maintenance must also ensure that their Battle.net code is redeemed before they link their Steam account. Once a Steam account is linked, their Guardians, Silver, and game licenses will be migrated from Battle.net to Steam. **This is a one-time process that cannot be repeated for new licenses**. For information on Battle.net code redemption, players should visit Blizzard’s [How to Claim a Code](https://battle.net/support/article/11263) knowledgebase article. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;It’s worth noting that all content previously included in the base Destiny 2 game, Curse of Osiris, or Warmind, will be available to all players for free through the launch of Destiny 2: New Light on October 1.
&gt;
&gt;###Steam Limited User Accounts
&gt;
&gt;Next week, Destiny 2 officially launches on Steam. Before it does, we’d like to make players aware of Steam’s Limited User Accounts.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;In short, any player whose account has spent less than $5.00 USD on the Steam Store will have limited access to community and social features that are commonly used for spamming, phishing, and other abuse.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;This will also apply to any Destiny 2 player new to the Steam platform who migrates from Battle.net. For more information, please see Valve’s [Limited User Accounts](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3330-iagk-7663) support article.
&gt;
&gt;###Premonition Legendary Pulse Rifle
&gt;
&gt;Following the launch of Shadowkeep next week, players will be able to view new items added to Destiny 2 using the in-game Collections. Before then, we’d like to make players aware of a known issue with one particular weapon listing.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Following the launch of Shadowkeep, the Collection listing for the Premonition Legendary Pulse Rifle will state that it is “found by exploring the Moon.” This weapon’s specific source is actually the new dungeon, which will become available sometime after Shadowkeep’s launch.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Players who encounter other issues following the launch of New Light, Shadowkeep, and Steam PC should report them to the [#Help](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help) forum.

sorta_ftb,2019-09-23 16:47:20+00:00,Pokémon Going Through Hard Times,"Sorry for formatting I’m on mobile.

I’ve been playing Pokémon Go for like 2 years, my wife has always tolerated my playing but always made fun of me for doing it. The teasing was almost always in good nature. I always told her that If she started playing she’d enjoy it, but she always said no.

She decided that she wanted to get her Masters in Architecture and we moved across the country in July. It’s been hard adjustment. she has never lived more than a few hours from home, and we were both living in the city we finished undergrad in so we had a ton of friends, good jobs, family close by all that good stuff.

The week before school started I needed to make a new friend for a research objective and we were laying in bed so I grabbed her phone and made her an account and added myself as a friend. I showed her how to catch Pokémon and the very basics of the game and we went to sleep. The next night I look over and she is playing on her own! She said she had went to pokestops all day around campus and was catching tons of Pokémon. Her favorite was the fire dog (growlithe lmao). 

Then a few days into the new semester we got a phone call, her uncle had been killed in action overseas. Her uncle was a AMAZING guy. So nice, kind, gentle, and insanely smart. You never would have known he was a super bad ass military guy. The two of them had been really close. He was only 8 years older than us, he would pick her up from school all the time, always made an effort to make it to her dance competitions. Even with how busy they are as adults they still would talk on the phone a few times a month. 

The death has hit her super hard. She went to Delaware to be there when the body arrived and two weeks later we went to Seattle for the funeral. All while she is trying to keep up on her pretty demanding school schedule. 

She has basically been a shell of herself for the past few weeks. BUT amazingly one of the only things that makes her smile is talking about and playing Pokémon Go.  

Yesterday was particularly rough, she was saying how guilty she felt still, she feels so lonely being so far from her family, she is angry at no one in particular. She feels bad because she feels like she should be over it by now. She has no energy or desire to get her work done. It was a sad conversation. I’m trying to be supportive but I also feel at a loss. 

A few hours later she asks if we can go play Pokémon, so we get in the car to go do a MewToo raid. It was her first 5 start raid and within 2 seconds of the raid starting she was cheering and smiling and having a super great time. It was so relieving and great to see her so genuinely happy. 

Thank you for reading this far. This is such a great game and great community.",pokemongo,9372

I just finished uploading the videos on youtube:

The Art of College: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF80ItSXNzvgPiSoGKANx2g](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF80ItSXNzvgPiSoGKANx2g)

&amp;#x200B;

**In each video, you'll see some pretty useful stats by ""looking down"":**

\- USNews undergrad rank from 2009 - 2014 - 2019 (2020 ranks will be updated next month, these vids take a long time to render)

\- Full undergrad cost of attendance. This information is harder to come by than you'd think, I couldn't find it aggregated somewhere so I went to every school's website and added up tuition+room+board+fees+insurance, basically everything you need to budget for 1 school year. Headsup, a handful of schools' figures only show tuition (anything under $40k should be a red flag), these will be corrected in the 2020 videos to be uploaded next month.

\- Average undergrad starting salary from Payscale.com

\- SAT ranges (new 1600 SAT)

\- Undergrad early and regular deadlines

\- Nearest major city and relevant stats

&amp;#x200B;

**When walking/driving outside of buildings:**

\- Each video also has at least 10 fun facts that I feel really define that school. I hand picked these after reading from Fiske's Guide, Princeton Review guide, reviews from students at [unigo.com](https://unigo.com/), and online about the colleges. After reading hundreds of comments about each college, you end up with a ""feel"" for what's unique and what's the same everywhere.

\- Half the vids are in 5k and have drone/walking footage on the main quad, library and student center (I only went to those places so comparisons are easier). The other half is in 4k and being updated with better footage as I get to visit them (it's become a hobby/goal to visit all top 100)

\- \~20 videos have 360 drone footage, if you ever wished you were a bird, you'll enjoy these :)

&amp;#x200B;

**Pro tips for more immersive playback**

1. Youtube tends to default to 720p – 1080p playback, which is too low for 360° video. Click the settings icon on the youtube player and manually adjust to 4k or higher for better quality.
2. Playback on your phone/ipad tends to be much smoother than playback on PC (unless your PC has dedicated graphics card)
3. For the most immersive experience, play back on your computer in full screen mode and scroll down on your mouse. You’ll get about 1-2 notches on your scroll wheel before the page itself starts to scroll down. This is the widest view, press Page Up to go back up to the top of the video and enjoy the wider field of view!

&amp;#x200B;

**These 2 college application advice videos should be especially helpful:**

\- Some thoughts and insights after visiting these top colleges: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3da\_vxtEvo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3da_vxtEvo)

\- Advice for the applications themselves, this one is very specific: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFWAuIF-YBg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFWAuIF-YBg)

\- Will be coming out with a video shortly that analyzes the data l collected on the top 150 colleges. I think the college selection process is highly subjective and emotional. I try to strip that away by looking at just the data, which gives a lot more clarity to how one should think about the shortlist process.

&amp;#x200B;

**My background:**

I don't offer paid services, just trying to give back.

I was a full ride Stamps Scholar at Georgia Tech and did my B.S. in Industrial Engineering with a M.S. in Econ.

I've been working full time with high school students in a counselor/mentor role for 6 years.

My students have gotten acceptances to UPenn, Columbia, Duke, Georgetown, UCLA, NYU, GT, BC, BU, UGA, and $100+k in annual merit scholarships.

I don't care what your excuse is - ""he's so nice, he's never hurt anyone, he's old, etc "" - you are part of the problem. If you want to walk your dog off-leash, then go to the fucking dog park. 

My dog is a shelter pup. We have been working with him for years to help him get comfortable with the outside world. We were finally able to start walking in parks without a breakdown. But now all that training is undone because of another fucking off-leash dog. 

Don't let your dog run ahead of you on the trail. Don't assume they'll get along with the neighbors' pets. And definitely don't assume every other person wants a dog up in their business. Lots of people are scared of dogs and that's okay, stop trying to shove it down their throats about how ""he's friendly.""

Public parks are for everyone. But when you let your dog go off-leash, you are limiting who can use that park.  Shelter pups struggling to adjust to life in the city, people who aren't comfortable around dogs, and of course local wildlife - your dog is an issue to everyone. 

This whole goddamn city thinks dogs are celestial beings sent to earth. Maybe they are. But it's still illegal to let them off leash.

End rant. 

...

Just kidding. 

While we're on the topic of Seattle dogs, it is illegal to let your dog on the beach. They're a menace on tidal ecosystems and can spread disease, especially when you let them use the restroom in an area where kids are swimming or playing in the sand. What the fuck, guys? If being a decent citizen doesn't convince you, it's a danger to your dog to be out there too. Razor clams and sewage spills and algae blooms can all seriously mess up your pup. Plus it's a decent fine if beach patrol catches you.

So put a fucking leash on your precious angel and keep them off the beach.

znameshame,2019-08-29 21:23:12+00:00,Name and shame: Zillow,"I recently left the worst job in my life: a software engineer at Zillow in Seattle. Do not consider working there.

It was the singlemost toxic work environment I’ve ever experienced or heard about. Some of the lowlights:

* A male manager told a female manager that her skirt was so “distracting that the meeting will grind to a halt...or grind in another direction” then made porn music sounds. He also suggested she “shouldn’t get into an elevator with any sales guys if you catch my drift”

* A manager bragged that he had had 7 HR complaints. The same manager was overheard telling someone “don’t tell HR the things I said in that meeting because less important people than you ave tried to get me fired”

* constant name calling from all my team members about each other and others in the company. One guy “is such a fucking idiot” another is an “asshole” and another a “fucking prick” and these things were said seriously and daily, also by managers, directors, and leads 

* A manager said he “hates” his employees “disability” while that employee was present 

* A senior dev would openly and angrily berate a new college grad he was supposed to be mentoring to not bother him or ask questions. “Figure it out! This is the job” and later got that jr dev fired.

* Another manager would go to lunch and get drunk 

When I put in my notice the first thing the director said was “would you stay if I could move you teams and make sure you work with different people?” So they know these issues and do nothing.

I have a lot of other toxic stories but I’ll stop there as this is long enough and hopefully saves a lot of people from ever working at Zillow",cscareerquestions,3004

Slats7,2019-08-28 02:15:00+00:00,"Before their first regular season matchup, Michael Jordan refused to shake Gary Payton's hand and said out loud: “Leave the (expletive) rookie to me.” After the game, MJ said to GP: “This is the real (expletive) right here. Welcome to the NBA, little fella.”","Gary Payton told stories about his childhood and his time on the Seattle Supersonics for a Players’ Tribune piece that published on Thursday. One of the best stories he included was about the first time he faced fellow Hall of Famer Michael Jordan as a rookie and made the mistake of talking trash.

At that time in 1990, as Payton explains, Jordan wasn’t a legend yet. This was before the six championships, so when young No. 2 draft pick Payton went up against the Chicago Bulls that preseason, he had the mindset of, “I don’t care who the hell Michael Jordan is … OK, he’s good … but he’s not all that.”

Payton says he dropped 19 points while Jordan was on the bench for most of the Bulls-Sonics preseason game, and while he was doing it, he ran by the bench to talk trash to MJ and stare his opponents down. The 22-year-old Sonics guard thought he was on top of the world.

But then, Jordan turned it on for their first regular season matchup. Payton recalls before the game, MJ refused to shake his hand and said out loud, “Leave the (expletive) rookie to me.”

Here’s the rest, in Payton’s own words via The Players’ Tribune:
In a matter of minutes, I’m in foul trouble. K.C. benches me. I didn’t really go back in the game much more after that. I remember I finished with no points — played about seven or eight minutes. MJ ended up going for 33.

But that wasn’t the end of it. Near the end of the game, I’m sitting on the bench, and MJ comes over to our bench — comes right up to me while the game is still going on. Coach is standing right there. Everyone on the bench is staring at him.

Looks right at me. “That (expletive) you talking in preseason?”

The wild thing is, MJ isn’t even mad or nothing. He’s chewing his (expletive) gum.

“This is the real (expletive) right here. Welcome to the NBA, little fella.”

The Bulls won the title that season, and then five more before he was done.

Be prepared for some leisurely MC,"Longtime lurker on this sub just waiting for the perfect opportunity for malicious compliance and it recently occurred during a recent trip back from Washington to California. After graduating college I had to move a number of large pieces of furniture back to California so my friend and I decided we would rent a box truck to get all of our furniture back. The drive from Seattle to SLO is about 16 hours and my friend and I had decided to take the drive in one go and stop for lunch in Oregon, about an hour away from the CA border. We pull into the parking lot and immediately notice that it’s completely full BUT they have 2 designated truck/oversized parking facing a wall so we take the truck over to the corner of the lot. As we pull I see another car, a regular sized car, that decide to park in the middle of a truck/trailer spot. Not only that but a second normal sized car has already taken the second spot so we were stuck, until the MC. The sign in-front of the spots says, “trucks and trailer parking only” so what do I do? I pulled the trailer horizontal into the parking spot, just behind the lines and effectively blocking both cars in, parked, went inside and had myself a nice leisurely lunch. As soon as we walked out  I could see the scene I had caused and it was glorious. As I walk up I can see one full fledged Karen, who was visibly fuming, and her husband as well as another couple standing sheepishly off to the side. As I walk up to the truck Karen strikes. (K will be Karen and OP will be me.) 
K: what the hell is your problem? 
OP: what? 
Karen: you parked your big truck here and blocked us in, we’ve been waiting 20 minutes!
OP: not my fault, I just parked in the parking spot that was meant for me. 
Karen: do you think you can do whatever you want? There are laws that say you cannot block another car in 
OP: (while trying to hold back laughter and pointing to the sign) Well, shit. I guess we both have problems following the rules. 

All the while the other couple in the back didn’t say a word. With that I hopped in my truck and continued on my way.",MaliciousCompliance,2441

PKMN_Maestro,2019-08-19 01:02:49+00:00,Want to share a story about a Pokemon Go friend who recently passed away,"I found out today that a old high school classmate and Pokemon Go friend passed away, and I want to share a story about him.

A couple of years ago, after the demoralizing failure of me trying to leave our rural, small town, I was forced to tuck tail and come back. I spent three years away, and tried my hardest to make it work, but there came a time I knew it just wouldn't work anymore and I had to come home. Pokemon Go came out in year two of that time and I was an active player. Moving from Seattle to very rural Idaho, I knew it would affect my playing (the nearest town of more than 3,000 is roughly 40 miles away). I was fortunate to discover that my town of 900 had four gyms within 15 minute drive of each other, so my playing became car-based. I also found out that the town was ruled by a Team Mystic player named Strongbow287, who would do their best to ensure Team Instinct would have no quarter. For months I fought this guy through the game, trying to figure out who it was.

Shortly after moving back, I started reconnecting with old friends from high school and one of them sent me an Instagram follow request. Lo-and-behold, it was from Strongbow. I started freaking out, I messaged him ""YOU'RE STRONGBOW! Dude we need to work together. Let's get a truce and together we can always have coins and keep this town from our mutual enemy, the valor menace."" From that day on, we agreed we would never fully knock each other and would always leave at least one gym the other color so we could take the others over daily and get our coins. We had this arrangement for two years and it worked well. It also made the game fun and made my situation something I could handle better. I was playing recently with an out of town friend and I told him ""we can take these gyms, but we won't take the fourth one because Strongbow's only been it a couple hours. We will get it tomorrow."" 

This morning I found out that he was killed in a car accident south of our town. It stung me harder than I thought because, while I wasn't awesome friends with him, we worked together and had our little friendly rivalry that I will miss. He was a good man, a family man, and loved his community and tribe so much. Rest in Peace Strongbow \~ I will miss seeing you in these gyms. Pokemon Go in our community won't be the same without you \~

He's still in one last gym in my community. It won't last long (as it was the one that tourists often got being at a gas station and all), but I got a picture of it so he will always be remembered.

**tl;dr - Moved back home during an incredibly low point in life, got into a rivalry with a hometown rival, found out a rival was a friend I knew from high school, worked together for two years to keep our town in balance and made game fun again, friend was killed in accident, the game won't be the same without him.**

rusticgorilla,2019-08-12 02:07:01+00:00,"A neo-nazi group is planning on holding a ""hate camp"" in Spokane, WA this month","Authorities are investigating:

&gt; Spokane [Eastern Washington State] police are investigating rumors that **members of a militant neo-Nazi group known as The Base are planning to travel through Spokane this month en route to a gathering they call a “hate camp.”**
&gt; 
&gt; Police believe that if the rumors are accurate, the gathering would take place outside Spokane County.
&gt; 
&gt; The rumors surfaced last weekend when Eugene Antifa, a group of anonymous left-wing activists in Eugene, Oregon, posted on Twitter that members of The Base “are flying in from around the country to Spokane” to hold the event.
&gt; 
&gt; Eugene Antifa said the leader of The Base, who uses the aliases Norman Spear and Roman Wolf, recently purchased land near Colville or Chewelah. The Spokesman-Review’s attempts to verify that claim were unsuccessful.
&gt; 
&gt; **The Base is a secretive network of neo-Nazis that emerged online last summer with the explicit goal of plotting and training for terrorist attacks.** It is said to share members and ideology with the Atomwaffen Division, another terrorist group that has been linked with killings and has recruited members of the U.S. military.
&gt; 
&gt; Vice News, which gained access to one of the group’s online chat rooms, reported in November that **The Base maintains “a trove of manuals with instructions on lone wolf terror tactics, gunsmithing, data mining, interrogation tactics, counter-surveillance techniques, bomb making, chemical weapons creation and guerrilla warfare.”** [Source](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2019/aug/10/spokane-police-investigating-rumors-of-neo-nazi-ha/)

You may remember the controversy when Spokane-area State Rep. Matt Shea had [distributed](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/state-lawmaker-matt-shea-defends-advocacy-for-holy-army-as-spokane-sheriff-refers-his-writings-to-fbi/) a four page manifesto linked to the Christian Identity movement, which called for the killing of non-Christian males if they do not follow fundamentalist biblical law. 

&gt;The document, consisting of 14 sections divided into bullet points, had a section on ""rules of war"" that stated ""make an offer of peace before declaring war"", which within stated that the enemy must ""surrender on terms"" of no abortions, no same-sex marriage, no communism, ""must obey Biblical law"", then continued: ""If they do not yield — kill all males"". Shea acknowledged the document and claimed that it was a summary of ""biblical sermons on war.""

He later [participated](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/20/matt-shea-rightwing-messages-chat-records) in a right wing chat room where he volunteered to conduct background checks on residents of Spokane to help the group carry out surveillance, intimidation and violent attacks on political enemies, including ""Antifa"" activists and ""communists"".",Keep_Track,1345

Monk_Adrian,2019-08-08 16:33:59+00:00,Grading Ever Team's Offseason: Seattle Supersonics(2/31),"This offseason many were surprised to see the franchise decide to stay pat with their current roster, not adding or subtracting a single player. Some may see this as controversial but in my mind this is a safe play (we are talking about the team that was, after all, undefeated last season).

The famously hard to please Seattle fans were, however, not so happy with the lack of moves. ""We don't have a roster"", ""An arena would be nice"", and ""Can we please have a G league team at least?"" are all common complaints within the fanbase. As the saying goes, you can't please everyone. 

My recommendation to the team and fans: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Even the 73 win Warriors lost games that season, meanwhile Seattle has had 0 losses since 2008. Greatness is hard to maintain in the NBA and if Seattle wanted to I can see them stretching this unbeaten streak out to 10, maybe 100, years.

Seattle, keep doing you. If you disagree with me and think Seattle should have added something (anything) this offseason then let me know in the comments.

CummyCummyCummy,2019-08-04 20:44:01+00:00,I saved a newborn's life last summer with a pizza jacket.,"This story sounds like it came out of a fucking movie but I promise it's 100% true.

I'm a delivery driver for a small carryout/delivery place in a suburb of Seattle. Our area is really weird, because although our radius is 5 miles, we have all types of neighborhoods: section 8 housing to multi-million dollar homes, urban to rural, etc. It's a fast growing area so it's a total mixed bag.

Last summer I had a delivery to an upper-middle class area of my town. Regular customer, a guy who ordered from us every week while his wife was pregnant with their first kid. Same order every time, 2 large pizzas.

Their house is new and pretty nice, but they live on a hill so the platform outside their front door is a 5 foot drop down onto their front yard, which is also concrete.

I go to deliver their pizza and the wife opens the door with a newborn no older than a week or two sitting on her arm resting against her chest. She's clearly exhausted, and her husband is coming home from work, so he isn't home to help her out. Her hands are full so I offer to set her pizzas down somewhere for her, but she insists that she can take them.

I hand her the food and while she's focused on balancing the boxes on her hand, I see her baby lean backwards and start to fall out of her arm. I reach to catch him and he slips into my fucking bag feet first and lands perfectly inside of it, completely unhurt but crying. She drops the pizza and grabs him out of the bag and we just silently stare at each other for a few moments in shock. She hands me the money she owes me and says ""thank you"" in a shaky voice and closes the door.

I'm not sure if we have delivered there again since that incident, but it shook me pretty bad to the point where I sat in my car and cried for a minute or two just out of sheer shock and speculation out of what would've happened if I wasn't able to catch him.",TalesFromThePizzaGuy,1122

JimmyGuwoppolo,2019-07-22 12:41:54+00:00,"I crunched some numbers. Whenever Justin Holiday signs with the Pacers, we'll be able to make the proclamation official. BEST OFFSEASON EVER!","So, I made [this](https://docdro.id/OI1flu2). I charted player movement from one season to the next over the last 25 years as contribution towards league-wide counting stats. Basically, what share of a season's points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks did a player take with him from the prior year to a new team. In aggregate, it shows how much production is moving across the league during the summer. Obviously, there are some serious flaws using this route to judge an offseason, but here are the major ones I care to address.

1. Since I'm going one season to the next, it does not capture injuries, rehab, or players coming back from retirement all that well.
2. Bad players can fill up counting stats on a bad a team. In 2014, Kevin Love ranked ahead of Lebron James by this metric. I'm not saying Kevin Love is bad by any means, but you're definitely Kevin Love's mom if you think one is as important as the other.
3. Applying that more broadly across eras, there were definitely lean years. In 1997, Vin Baker was taking about 69 basis points worth of the previous season's counting stats to Seattle as the lead free agent by this metric. That's roughly the same number KD took to GS in 2016. If you never watched Vin Baker play, this bullet point alone right here should have you hitting the back button and stop wasting your time with this ridiculousness.
4. It does absolutely nothing to capture news, buzz, and drama like Jordan retiring, and Jordan coming back, and a generational rookie class, and the Decision, etc., etc. There is an alternate timeline where we're getting our morning coffee at Duncan Donuts if a certain gentleman makes a different decision in 2000. This chart gives no shits about that timeline.

So, that's all to say that this exercise is as much a bit of cheeky fun as it's informational. But if you're still with me, let's see where we are. (Full res version in the link at the top).

&amp;#x200B;

On average over this period of time, about 23% of a season's total counting stats move on to another team the next season. The remaining 77% are held over by the same team with some retiring, which of course is offset by an entering rookie class. So most of the stats stay in place, some retire, but new blood comes in, and almost a quarter of the stats start the next season with a different team.

&amp;#x200B;

[Only players 30+ BP labeled](https://i.redd.it/4wtd01ytssb31.jpg)

In this time span, 7 offseasons saw &gt;25% of stats move to a new team. The top 5 are:

&amp;#x200B;

\#5 **2013**: Dwight Howard's second consecutive season being the #1 FA, leads a class of 140 players that accounted for 26.64% of counting stats in the 2012-2013 season.

\#4 **2004:** TMac and Stevie Franchise traded for each other, and Shaq heads to MIA. 149 players move 27.79% of stats in that offseason.

\#3 **1996:** [Here's](https://sports.yahoo.com/paying-needed-tribute-to-the-nba-s-1996-offseason--the-wackiest-one-by-miles-201944082.html?y20=1) a decent summary of the wackiness that was the summer of '96. I won't spoil all of it for you but Chuck, Shaq, Mutombo, Grandmama, all go on the move. In total, 27.84% migrated that season.

\#2 **2019:** Well, I'm sure I don't have to give you the synopsis on this one. If you're unfamiliar, do yourself a favor, and go Google ""NBA 2019 OFFSEASON"". I'll wait... So far, we're at 28.43% with half the summer left!

\#1 **2012:** Howard, Nash, and Jamison to the Lakers as the top 3 FAs above a class that includes Harden to the Rockets, Joe Johnson to the Nets, and Iguodala to the Nuggets. In total, 28.72% of stats the prior season moved on that summer.

&amp;#x200B;

We're about 30 BP away from being able to claim witness to the greatest offseason in NBA history (maybe) by this measure. That would be the equivalent of one Justin Holiday circa 2018-2019. Or, if the deal falls through for some reason, a Nuggets trade of Monte Morris would do it. So, get that bubbly on ice for when Justin Holiday puts his John Hancock on that Pacer's contract.

&amp;#x200B;

BEST.

OFFSEASON.

EVER!!!

Allthrownawaytoday,2019-06-23 14:44:11+00:00,My wife is a powerful executive and I hate it,"I’m from a small town in Texas. She’s from NYC. We met in college. We married at 24 and now We’re 40. 


I always wanted to work as a contractor. I like working with my hands. My father built homes and so did my grandfather. It’s not a glamorous job but I like what I do and I’m proud of it. I started my own business and it does pretty well. Not great. Not bad. 


My wife started working at a tech startup after college answering the phone and taking everyone’s coffee order. She had an art degree and it was a just-for-now type gig for her. She hated that first year, but then something clicked. She became obsessed. She got promoted again and again and again. You have to remember that this was the tech business in the early 2000s when the internet went from being a useful gadget to being the center of the known-universe. When smartphones came out... everything changed.



Today, my wife has several thousand employees spanning all 7 continents. We own pre-IPO stock in a household name tech behemoth. We have so much goddamn money I can’t wrap my head around it. My “business” is a hobby at this point. I work hard for my customers, but it’s masturbation in the grand scheme of our income. 



I’m proud of my wife. What an achievement! But I grew up one step above a trailer park. I don’t really care much about money. I certainly don’t care for going to fancy parties in San Francisco and meeting congressmen who tell me that my line of work is “charming.” There are usually cocktail shrimp. I like that part. What I really like is going home and sitting in the back of my brother’s truck drinking beer with his buddies - a glimpse into the life of the redneck I was born to be. 



Most of all, I miss my wife. I admire her work ethic. She takes leading so many people seriously. But sometimes I don’t remember what her face looks like without the glow of a computer screen on her face. She’s adopted this corporate way of speaking that she can’t turn off anymore. I think back to the hipster girl I met at a house party with her cutoff jeans shorts and one white-girl dreadlock. She was smoking a joint and talking about how she could help her friend fix her bike. I thought that was hot. She was handy. She used to show up at the bar covered in paint. She used to pull me into the bathroom at parties and shove my hand down her pants. In that sense, she hasn’t changed at all. She always took what she wanted. I just didn’t think what she wanted would change so much. 



Today, I write this from my living room in Seattle. It’s very clean because our maid was here yesterday. Our hilltop home overlooks the Puget Sound on one side and the forest on the other. The sun will rise soon and it will be glorious. She’s not here. She’s in Japan. I feel out of place in my own home. I have what so many people want and did nothing to earn it.



That’s all. Just thinking about how this all happened. Thanks reddit.",confessions,9098
alopeciatakesover,2019-06-21 22:48:23+00:00,"IamA 25F with absolutely no body hair, AMA!","I like to do one of these about once a year to raise some general awareness for Alopecia!!

I’ve had Alopecia Universalis for about 5 years now. I rapidly started losing all of my body hair when my mother died at 52 from COPD/CHF. There are 3 categories of Alopecia; areata (patchy hair loss), totalis (hair loss above the neck) and Universalis (total body hair loss)

Currently there is no known cause or cure for Alopecia. Many insurance companies will not covers wigs for those with Alopecia and only cover them for patients with cancer or leukemia. I'm actually traveling to Seattle next week for the annual conference!!

TrinityAdams,2019-06-19 00:11:29+00:00,My shift supervisor at work was a petty tyrant who treated me like garbage. So I got him fired and arrested.,"I work as a computer technician now, but when I was in college I worked part time at a well-known chain cafe. Let's call it Seattle's Finest.

Other than babysitting or odd one-off, under the table work helping at friends' booths at renaissance faires, it was my first job.

The manager, ""Eliza,"" had aspirations for rising in the company at a corporate level, so she was obsessed about making our store the finest. Seattle's Finest. 

At the same time, though, she wasn't an especially effective manager at the store level. She didn't really know how to make all the drinks, and had to constantly refer to the recipe cards even though she was supposed to be an expert on everything. She also didn't really care to learn, which meant that during a particularly busy rush, she could never step in and help us out in making drink orders. She would just hole up in her little office in back, near the kitchen.

However, she had a college degree, and our company's policy, at least at the time, was that only college degree holders could be the full manager of a store.

She left the day to day running of the store to ""Steven,"" the lead shift supervisor who had been working at that location for twenty-five, since he was sixteen, ""and the only reason I'm not a manager is because I don't have a college degree.""

He never tired of reminding all the workers that the store ""would go to sh\*t"" if he wasn't around.

Steven didn't really have to do much, other than delegate others to do things, and make sure orders were sent out to suppliers, and to sign those orders in when they arrived. Our store followed standard company practice, and so a fixed amount of supplies was usually ordered in every day, with only slight variations to account for particular store's needs (for example, we might order sixty chocolate muffins a day, while company average is a hundred, because our store was next to a yoga studio and the ladies who came in ordered less of the fattening items).

Steve also wrote the schedule every week.

When I was hired on, Eliza was the one who interviewed me, and she assured me I'd get at least twenty hours a week, four hour shifts (to coincide with my school schedule), and I only worked Sundays, not Saturdays.

During my two week training period, she kept her word. I'd hover right around 18-22 hours a week, four, four and a half hours at a time.

After that, however, since I was fully trained, she passed me over to Steven.

Steven followed Eliza's pattern for a week or so, but soon he began trying to schedule me in the mornings, which I couldn't do because of school. He'd pretend to get really angry and disappointed, and talk about how ""in my twenty five years with the company, one of the first thing you learn is to be a team player.""  


Well, I thought that was great but I still couldn't work in the mornings. So he'd grumble and say ""I'll have to talk to Eliza to see what we have to do about you.""

Eliza would only occasionally show up to the store, usually she was there midmorning and left well before closing. Steve would always open the store. ""I've been opening the store for more than twenty years blah blah blah blah...""

Steven would try to suck up to customers and at the same time condescend to us in front of them.

""Forgive her, she's new.""

""You see what I have to work with, raw recruits!""

Sometimes he'd outright call us ""dumbasses"" if we couldn't clean things up fast enough, or make drinks quickly enough.

Like, he'd be hanging out in back, counting boxes, meanwhile it's 12:00pm on a Saturday and I'm running the register and making all the drinks and our line is ten deep, and he sent his other worker off to lunch, and he himself refuses to help.

""You've got to have your baptism of fire.""

He took himself way too seriously.

He thought he was special because he spoke fluent Spanish.

Since he worked in the morning, a lot of people who had early morning jobs would come in, and many of them spoke Spanish only. He thought it was ""his speciality"" that he could communicate with them.

Well, my father is from Spain and I happen to speak fluent Spanish myself, so one Saturday when I opened to store with him I started speaking Spanish to one of the customers, and the customer complimented me on how well I spoke the language.

Steve looked like he was ready to murder me.

Whenever customers would come in who spoke Spanish, rather than let me communicate with them, Steve would get up off his butt and say, ""I'll handle this.""

As time went on, Steve would only schedule me for eight hours a week, like closing Friday night and opening Saturday morning.

I thought whatever, I'll just start applying to other jobs. I didn't tell him that, though.

I knew he was giving all the hours to his favorites, usually young women who he tried to flirt with. I know, because he tried the same thing with me at first. He said that he could give me more hours, but I had to ""play ball.""

Nothing that I could actually prove in court, but he was hinting that if I go out with him, he would give me more hours. No thanks, man.

Well, Eliza was up for promotion to district manager, which meant she would oversee five or six Seattle's Finest coffee shops instead of just one. However, in a whole team meeting one special Sunday, she said that our store consistently was losing product. She warned us to stop giving discounts to friends, stop giving away free cookies or snacks to friends, etc. She also said that if we planned to have some of the pastries ourselves (we were allowed a certain amount of free product depending on the hours we worked), we had to make sure to write it down on the ""store use"" board.

At least during the hours I worked, I never witnessed anyone giving away free product, and I certainly wasn't using any of it myself.  Other than Steve.

Steve got a bonus every time the store use board was below a certain threshold, and he would always accuse us of stealing or giving away things.

In fact he said so at the meeting, that ""shrinkage is caused by these rookies who think a company runs on fee-fees. It's a business based on cold money and we're bleeding it when we steal product or give it away.""

Meanwhile I always notice STEVE giving free discounts to certain customers, giving things away.

One of those rules for thee, not for me, types of things.

Another worker actually asked him about it, and he said ""managers had certain privileges.""

Dude. You're not a manager.

You make three dollars more an hour than me and you've spent your whole life here.

He also resented the fact that most of us who worked in the store were college students who would eventually move on someday to something hopefully more financially profitable.

Steve would do this working class hero bit where he would talk about how college people were snobs, didn't know how to do real work, were lazy, privileged. He also mocked me for majoring in computing as a female, and accused me of just trying to get my ""MRS"" degree. He acted like he was kidding, but he was still really slimy.

Then he went back to his homily about how business people's whole day would collapse without people like him to get them started the right way with coffee. ""I'm as indispensable to a large corporation as the CEO.""

Meanwhile we're all thinking, calm down Steve you're a shift supervisor at a suburban coffee shop and you wear an apron with your name embroidered on it, you're not curing cancer.

But anyway, Eliza's promotion depended on our store reducing its shrinkage. On a date a few days from our Sunday meeting, company bigwigs would come to the store and check out how well Eliza ran things. We were told to look sharp. 

The bigwigs would be in the dining room, chatting with Eliza while the rest of us who were scheduled that day tried to look our best.

Steve didn't really have any incentive to make Eliza look good because as long as he kept overall shrinkage beneath a certain number, he would still get his bonus. But, that threshold was too high for Eliza to her her promotion. Also, it wasn't as if Steve would become manager if Eliza got promoted. The company would simply get a new manager as an outside hire. Informally, we'd call Steve ""assistant manager"" but the company did not officially recognize him in this capacity. Since he was a longtime worker and worked full time, he did get health benefits and a two week vacation.

The rest of us lowly part timers just got a store discount and some free food or drink while working.

We got paid every two weeks, but we got tips every single week. If you've never worked at a coffee shop like Seattle's Finest, customers would throw money into a jar at the register if they felt like being generous. The tips would be emptied out every night, and eventually at the end of the week all the money would be parceled out to all the workers, depending on the hours they worked. Since I only worked a few hours, my tips were small, but at least it paid for laundry.

My school starts a couple of hours after the store opens, and since I wasn't burning too much energy working I'd get up nice and early every day. The store was close to my apartment, and I always walked there.

It was the time of year where the moon was still out early in the morning.

I decided that I'd walk to the store and get my tips for that week.

I approached the store from the alley entrance, but I intended to enter through the front. Store policy was that you could only enter the back way if you were scheduled to work. As usual at that hour, our daily supply truck was pulling out of the alley, and there was a huge stack of daily supplies in crates outside the back door. Steve propped open the back door with a trash can, and was carrying one crate at a time into the store's back room. My first instinct was to help him, but then I remembered that I wasn't being paid, and besides that Steve was a total a$shole.

I was fascinated watching him as he worked, because usually he was such a lazy ass. I was hidden by cars and trees, so he couldn't see me.

He stopped working but there was still a crate left at the back door. It was filled with what looked to be croissants, and random boxes of granola bars. In addition to coffee and pastries, our store also sold third-party nutrition bars, the kind where you can buy a box of six for $4 but we'd charge you $2.99 for one.

He was talking on his cellphone, and only a minute or two later a beat up car pulls into the alley. The driver pops the trunk, and Steve puts the crate into the car and the car speeds off. Steve then goes back into the store.

At first, I tried to rationalize what I had seen. Maybe it was just a work-related thing that I didn't understand because I wasn't a shift supervisor. Maybe the person in the car was from another store, and our store was supposed to send those items to them?

I decided to forget my tips for the time being, and walked back home.

By the time I got there, I realized it was most likely that Steve was just a thief.

I went to school and forgot about it for a few hours, but every now and then that day I'd think about it again.

The next morning I woke up, and made sure I had my cellphone ready. I waited outside really early, even before the supply truck came. When it did come, sure enough, Steve did the same song and dance as the day before. He left one crate outside, coordinated with his accomplice on his phone, the same car arrived, and it pulled away after Steve packed its trunk with stolen goodies.

I thought I was being real slick in recording the scene, but later when I reviewed what I had, it was way too dark and unclear what was going on. And, if I tried to get closer to get a better picture or where there was more light, Steve would see me and my cover would be blown.

I actually worked that day because it was a Saturday.

Steve was his usual douchewallet self, but hearing him banter with customers, it reminded me of other pieces of other conversations I overheard from him over the past many weeks.

Steve had a side business, or at least his wife did, selling snacks outside of clubs and sporting events. I put two and two together and realized that if Steve stole even one crate and sold off its items at a massive discount, he'd still make a pretty penny, and all of it profit. And he had stolen a crate two days in a row. Who knew how many more crates he had stolen in the past?

I realized that if I told Eliza, she wouldn't believe me, and Steve would deny it.

I had to catch him red handed.

The approach I'd been making to the alley was too far to record him without being observed, but I saw that there was an apartment complex on the other side of the alley. If I could somehow get into that apartment complex, all I'd have to do is quietly hold my phone over the brick wall, and it would be close enough to record him.

That was precisely what I did.

Staking out Steve's stealing became my morning ritual for a week.

Out of four days, he stole a crate three times. And each time, I had him recorded. I wasn't scheduled to come in until an afternoon the next week. 

Now, all I needed to do was show Eliza my phone, and I'd nail this bastard. Unfortunately she wouldn't be in the store for a while, either.

But then I remembered that the big company meeting regarding Eliza's promotion was coming up that Monday afternoon, just a couple days later.

I wasn't scheduled to work, but I knew I could talk my way into the back room with an excuse that I needed my check.

Our back room has a computer where we clock in and out. It's just one window on the screen. If you click out of it, you have access to the rest of the computer's functions. 

One thing the computer always has running in the background is what we called ""store TV."" It was basically just a series of short infomercials about how wonderful Seattle's Finest coffee was. How our beans are from plantations where workers are treated humanely, how we donate to underprivileged communities, offer funding to women in STEM, and things like that. The file was stored as a .WMA file, and the store just played it on a continuous loop. Every so often, Eliza would obtain a new set of infomercials, and we'd loop those out.

Our store had one big screen mounted from the ceiling which faced out into the store, away from the registers.

My plan, obviously, was to upload my video of Steve stealing onto the store computer. I had the files, which I combined at home into one big file of three occasions where you could clearly see his face, and the face of the woman driving the car who I assume is his wife, and how they clearly are stealing product from the store.

Eliza and the big bosses were already there at the restaurant, so the sensible thing would be for me to say ""excuse me Eliza"" and just brazenly interrupt her meeting with my cellphone video held up to her face.

But I love a bit of drama, and Steve had this coming.

So I see Eliza with her colleagues sitting at a table near the registers, where Steve is standing with a sh\*t-eating, kiss-a$s grin on his face. The store isn't really crowded.

Eliza sees me when I come in and, in full ""I love my staff"" mode, says, ""Oh, everyone! Here's Eliza, one of our newest and best. She's going to college for computing!""

Followed by a bunch of nods and ""ooo-aaah"" pretending to give a f\*ck.

I smile and mouth the words ""I'm just here to get my tips.""

""Of course, OP!""

And Steve looks like he wants to slap me with his little d\*ck. But too bad, I'm going into the back room, jerkwad!

Our tips are placed in little baggies labeled with the amount in our cubbies in the backroom, with an honor system not to go grabbing anyone else's tips.

I grab my tips ($11.50, not bad!) but I go straight for the computer. I have my phone's data cable and plug it into the USB port of the store computer.

I upload the file, as planned.

I un-click the propaganda channel for Seattle's Finest, and switch it to ""Steve the Thief,"" and set the video for ""continuous loop.""

I come out into the restaurant, and as usual no one really cares about the TV.

I go to Steve, and order a hot latte.

Steve looks like he wants to stab me in the throat, but he still has the sh\*t-eating grin on his face because the bosses are all there. He doesn't know that just a few feet above his head, there's a continuous loop of him and his wife stealing product in the alley every morning. I had made sure to include a time and date stamp on the videos when editing. 

He already had some hot milk ready and all he had to do was pull two espresso shots.

I had my drink in thirty seconds.

I pulled out my wallet, but uncharacteristically, he smiled at me and waved me off. Eliza saw me and nodded in approval.

Then I saw at a table not far from where the bosses were sitting.

Above Steve's head, his video was playing silently.

Finally, the payoff.

One of the bosses said, ""Say Eliza, that isn't our company video of our donations to minority scholarships. What IS that?""

Eliza looks at the video. Everyone else looks at the video. 

Mouths agape.

Only Steve is still standing there like a grinning ninny.

Finally, Eliza says, ""Steve, can you explain what's going on here?""

Steve looks at the video, and looked for a second like he was going to run out of the room. He didn't do or say anything, other than run into the back room. Seconds later, the video stopped, and a few moments later, it began playing again.

Haha Steve.

I deleted the correct video, made a duplicate of YOUR video, and renamed it as if it were the propaganda channel.

Everyone in the dining room was once again treated to a loop of Steve and his wife stealing an entire crate of designer granola bars and pastries repeatedly.

One of the big bosses said, ""Eliza, let's close the store, right now. Young lady, I'm sorry but...""

He pointed me to the door.

Who am I to argue, sir?

I walked home with $11.50, but sooooo much richer than that.

A few days later I came in, to find neither Eliza nor Steve at the restaurant.

One of my coworkers told me that she heard that Steve was arrested for theft. Both he and his wife.

Eliza got her promotion because it was proven that the only reason her store had shrinkage was because Steve was stealing. However, because she was supposed to be keeping a close eye one Steve, she's being watched carefully to ensure she's actually a good employee. Well that's fair. She wasn't a thief, but she should have kept a closer watch on her store. The whole, getting a full time salary but only showing up for a few hours a week think wasn't acceptable.

As for me, the new manager got me my final check because I quit.

I went and applied for a job on campus at their off-brand coffee shop.

Same basic job, a few jerks here and there (I'm no prizewinner myself, just saying), but I did make a buck an hour more.

As time went on and I graduated school, I did eventually learn that Steve was not only stealing product, but also embezzling tips and tampering with the timeclock to reduce people's hours, and give himself more.

He went to jail for six years, but his wife got a suspended sentence because they had two children under age 13.

I learned this because the company I work for actually did tech service for Seattle's Finest's corporate office, where Eliza now works. She remembered me, and over the finest coffee in all of Seattle, she told me the whole story.",ProRevenge,7133

Swedeniscold,2019-06-16 21:22:08+00:00,I let an AI language model rank the top Quarterbacks of the 2019 season,"So I've been playing around with an AI language model called GPT-2. You might have seen the [subreddit simulator](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubSimulatorGPT2) that uses it to generate threads and discussions. The model became a bit famous this past winter for being able to generate very realistic texts. 

So I decided to see what it thinks about the 2019 NFL Quarterbacks. I copied the intro of an article that ranked QB's to give it a sample to base its text off of, and ran a couple of simulations to see what it came up with. This is the one I liked the most.

Keep in mind, this is only a language model, and not even the full model, so it does not know anything about football in particular. It's been trained on tons of text from the internet, and basically what it does is try to predict what word would come next based on the sample. 

I could only generate texts about 1000 words long, which meant that it got almost half way in ranking the QB's. I tried a couple of times to feed it the same text that I got out as a new sample to prolong the article, but it didn't succeed in creating a complete list, so I decided to let it be. 

**So here is the GPT-2 (345M) ranking of the 2019 top NFL Quarterbacks:**


1. **Tom Brady, New England Patriots** -- Brady has been the best QB of his era to wear jersey No. 20 all the way through the 2020 season. There's no telling how many years he'll be able to play at that level, but Brady is the top QB in the NFL’s history and can't be denied. 

2. **Matt Ryan, Atlanta Falcons** -- The Falcons were the laughingstock of the NFL when they made the Super Bowl in 2014. The Falcons have won nine Super Bowls and missed the playoffs just once during their 30-year existence, but Ryan has had his moments. He finished fourth in the MVP voting in 2016. And despite not being the best quarterback in the NFL, Ryan is the one with the closest finish to the end of his career.

3. **Matthew Stafford, Detroit Lions** -- The Lions' streak of winning at least 10 games every year is the longest in NFL history, and Stafford has been the reason for that. He finished second in the MVP voting in 2016, and he has more career wins with an NFL-leading 6,099 and has won more games than any other active player.
 
4. **Andrew Luck, Indianapolis Colts** -- After losing to the Jacksonville Jaguars in the first round of the playoffs for the second time this regular season, Luck finished with the second-most passing yards ever in a Super Bowl. He also finished as the highest scoring QB in NFL history with 1,828 passing yards, eclipsing Andrew Luck and Eli Manning for the most in a Super Bowl. The Colts aren't exactly short on talent at the position, but Luck, after his second Super Bowl, is the one with the best ring for a Hall of Famer that we know of.

5. **Joe Flacco, Baltimore Ravens** -- The Ravens have won five Super Bowls and reached the AFC title game once in the past six seasons. The Ravens have never finished outside the top five since 2008, and they have won three of the past four Super Bowls. Flacco, who is under contract for another six years, may have the longest streak of winning a Super Bowl to this point.
 
6. **Russell Wilson, Seattle Seahawks** -- Wilson has never led a team to the playoffs, but he has been one of the best quarterbacks in the game. The one-time No. 1 overall pick is among the best QBs in the league, and the Seahawks are already a playoff team this season. Wilson has a career winning percentage of 80.1.

7. **Josh McCown, Cleveland Browns** -- Not only did McCown win the starting QB job at Pittsburgh in 2014, but he also led the team to the postseason. The Browns have been the favorites at quarterback all year, but McCown leads the team with a 99.1 passer rating, the second-best mark in the league, and is tied for second in wins on the season.  
 
8. **Cam Newton, Carolina Panthers** -- The Panthers have been the highest-performing team all year. They finished 11th in the league in rushing yards this season and had the highest scoring offense in NFL history with 23,974 in 2016. Newton is likely to win the MVP award for 2016, but we'll take the best QB in the NFL this year in this poll.  
 
9. **Ryan Tannehill, Miami Dolphins** -- The Dolphins are not expected to compete for a playoff spot this year, but their defense is one of the best in the NFL and quarterback Ryan Tannehill is one of the best in the game. Tannehill finished second to Tom Brady in the MVP voting when he reached 1,000 yards passing and tied for second in rushing yards.  
 
10. **Derek Carr, Oakland Raiders** -- Carr was not the best NFL QB of his era (his passing touchdown total of 24 in 2016 was actually the sixth-most by any QB in history), but Carr's three-game winning streak in the AFC Championship series was a huge step forward and Carr leads the league in completion percentage (66.2), yards per attempt (9.7), touchdown passes (5), interceptions (6), total TDs (63) and passer rating (88.8).  
 
11. **Matthew Stafford, Detroit Lions** -- Stafford, who is under contract through 2017, has been the best quarterback of his era and has won the Super Bowl twice. Stafford had the most passing touchdowns in NFL history with 12, but he's also finished as the fourth-best quarterback in the league. Stafford is the best quarterback in NFL history and is the No. 1 overall pick that we know of.  
 
12. **Russell Wilson, Seattle Seahawks** -- Wilson's team has been among the top quarterbacks in the NFL for the past few seasons, but there are a lot of factors that go into it. They have the best defense, but their offense is also one of the best in NFL history. Wilson has 6,099 passing yards per game and has eclipsed Manning's all quarterbacks with 6,9 in 1999. He has three career victories.   
 
13. **Eli Manning, New York Giants** -- It wasn't pretty, but Eli Manning has run for 4,679 yards in the regular season with 13 touchdowns and only three interceptions. That's a pretty good record, and in his MVP season, he had 1,083 passing yards and tied for fifth in passing touchdowns. The 49ers had the fourth-highest scoring offense in NFL history in 2016, and Manning was the only quarterback in the league to notch more passing yards.   

14. **Eli Manning, New York Giants** -- The Giants had a lot going for them this season, but Eli Manning's performance was not enough to win the MVP award. In his MVP season, he finished second to Tom Brady in passing yards allowed per game, but tied for fourth in passing touchdowns.",nfl,3989

vanillagurilla,2019-06-04 18:19:56+00:00,In 1984 someone brutally murdered single mother Patricia Dixon and her five-year-old daughter Amanda during their dream vacation to Disneyland.,"I hope you all appreciate this case, as it has been close to my heart ever since I found it randomly.

Here are the specifics: 

Unsolved double homicide: Patricia Dixon, 25 and Amanda Dixon, 5

In 1984 at a small motel near Disneyland, a 25-year-old single mother named Patricia Dixon and her five-year-old daughter Amanda were found murdered in their hotel room, both from multiple gunshot wounds to the head. Patricia was a single mother who had divorced Amanda's father (who at the time of the murders was in Boston, serving in the Coast Guard) and lived in Seattle with her parents. 

She worked as a secretary and was able to scrimp and save for months to be able to take her daughter to the most magical place on earth. They purchased a Travel Package deal through travel agents in Seattle, flew to Anaheim and checked in on Monday, scheduled to check out that Friday. They were last seen at the motel's pool Tuesday afternoon. 

Wednesday morning a motel maid scheduled to clean the room found their bodies. Patricia was found partially nude in the corner of the room with her underwear pulled down, however, it was determined later she was not sexually assaulted. 

Most tragically, little Amanda was found in bed, still in her pajamas clutching her new Minnie Mouse stuffed animal, shot in the head as well. 

The detective OCSD Sgt. Michael Webb said an assailant, possibly known to Mrs. Dixon, entered the poolside room Tuesday night. The Dixons were killed about 5 a.m. PST.

*From a cold case write up in the OCRegister published in 1988:*

It was a sight veteran Anaheim police detectives never will forget.  Lying nude next to the bed in a motel room within walking distance of Disneyland was Patricia Ann Dixon, 25, of Seattle. In the bed was the pajama-clad body of her 5-year-old daughter, Amanda. The little girl was clutching a Minnie Mouse doll. Both had been shot several times in the head early March 28, 1984, only a few hours after returning from the amusement park. There was no sign of forced entry into the room of the West Street motel, leading investigators to believe the woman was killed by someone she knew. While numerous gunshots were fired, no one reported hearing any. Neither victim was sexually attacked. Police investigated leads and suspects in Seattle, including some former suitors of the woman. ""We just recently had another lead come up, within the past few months,"" DePaola said. ""It was in another state. We checked it all the way through. It didn't pan out. The case is still open.""

I really want someone to solve this thing, and maybe this added exposure would help. Below are the only items I can find on this:

That shit magical just seeing it on TV, they treat every shot that goes in like a buzzer beater and it just makes things so much hype. From the 76ers series till now the crowd has been so hype, every time Siakam hit a shot last night the place blew up.

And it doesn’t stop their because it extends to whomever their playing, it motivates that teams home court to get hype. I had never seen the Sixers home court more hype than game 6 of that series same with the Bucks. Some will say it’s just because it’s the postseason but I haven’t seen that level of excitement from the home court since the Pacers 2012-2013 postseason. That’s some Seattle Seahawks 12th man level of hype.

It also helps they have their own hypeman errrr I mean.... Global Ambassador in Drake, so to the Raptors home court, as a neutral viewer this Finals, thanks for the hype. Can’t wait to see if the Warriors crowd can match that energy in game 3.",nba,1834

claball,2019-05-30 00:06:54+00:00,One cold hard truth for each NFL team in 2019,"It’s tough to be negative on Reddit. Actually, I’ll rephrase that. It’s tough to not be ridiculed for being negative on Reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s understandable. Every team *does* have reason to be optimistic about this upcoming season. Anyone who comes flying in to talk down on those positive expectations is only raining on the parade of anticipatory fans.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I hate being negative. Nothing good comes of it.

&amp;#x200B;

But, every year, fans can get overcome by their emotions in the lead up to the season and get blindsided by glaring weaknesses that doom a season that could have been seen from a mile away.

&amp;#x200B;

That’s what I’m here for. I’m here to scream “watch out!” as that golf ball is hurtling towards your head. I’m here to nudge your drink away from the edge before your elbow sends it crashing to the floor. I’m here to let you discretely know that you’re fly is down before you leave the bathroom.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m here to even things out.

&amp;#x200B;

Bad things happen. But, they’re less bad when you see them coming.

&amp;#x200B;

*\*There were a few teams I had a hard time hating on. The Colts, Saints, Chargers, Packers and Bears have assembled really air-tight rosters. These team’s critiques were more of a stretch than the others.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Arizona Cardinals

**David Johnson is 27 years old**

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to kick this off with something no one can argue me on. David Johnson is 27, that is until December 16th when he’ll be 28. But we’re living in the moment here.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I point this out is because it feels like we’re still waiting for him to fully unleash who he is as a player. He had a spectacular season in 2016 where he tallied over 2,000 yards from scrimmage and 20 total touchdowns. He followed that up with an unfortunate early season exit after carrying the ball just 11 times. Then, in 2018, Johnson got caught up in Mike McCoy’s web of ineptitude and didn’t look like himself.

&amp;#x200B;

Johnson has suffered two season-ending injuries in his short career: a sprained MCL and a dislocated wrist. In a league with only two starting running backs over age 29 (McCoy and Peterson) it’s looking like David Johnson’s career is closer to the end than the beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s a sobering thought for one of the most entertaining running backs in the NFL. But that’s just the cold, hard truth.

&amp;#x200B;

# Atlanta Falcons

**Atlanta’s pass rush won’t be any better**

&amp;#x200B;

Most team’s are known for something. For the Cowboys it’s dominating offensive line. For the Ravens it’s a stifling secondary. For the Falcons, it’s their inability to create pressure on the quarterback.

&amp;#x200B;

Atlanta’s non-existent pass rush has been a known deficiency for a few years. Even in Vic Beasley’s deceptive break-out season with 15.5 sacks his overall impact wasn’t as dramatic as that number would suggest.

&amp;#x200B;

This season’s group is looking a lot like last season’s group. Vic Beasley and Takkarist McKinley at end. Grady Jarrett and a rotation of “J.A.G.’s” at the other DT spot. In free agency Atlanta brought back Adrian Clayborn. They did add a defensive end in the fourth round as well in John Cominsky. Conveniently enough, Cominsky’s biggest weakness is as a pass rusher. Perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

Without many changes on the defensive front, this unit isn’t looking improved heading into the new season. That doesn’t bode well for a top-10 offense that’s hoping to get some help from their counterpart.

&amp;#x200B;

# Baltimore Ravens

**Baltimore's old-school ground and pound attack will drive them right into the ground**

&amp;#x200B;

Lamar Jackson’s 147 rushing attempts as a rookie was 21 more than the next highest quarterback in 2018. Jackson only started seven games.

&amp;#x200B;

Granted, it was largely as a result of the Ravens acclimating him midseason and playing to his immediate skill-set. But, that aspect of Jackson’s game is not going anywhere. On top of that they added hard-hitting between the tackles runner Mark Ingram. Baltimore is gearing up for a “wear you down” type of offense in 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

That directly contradicts what literally every one of the other 31 teams are doing. Sure, the Seahawks and Cowboys will always be a run first team. However, no squad will be passing as little as the Ravens are preparing to.

&amp;#x200B;

This was an interesting attack for a few weeks when Jackson was making his first few starts. But that identity aged quickly. In Baltimore’s playoff game, Lamar completed less than 50% of his passes. The Chargers held their rushing attack to less than 100 total yards.

&amp;#x200B;

Baltimore got beat. Not terribly thanks to their elite defense. But, Los Angeles proved that this attack could be stopped if they do just one thing: Force Lamar Jackson to throw. Rushing the ball 50 times per game isn’t helping Jackson develop. That game plan could doom them this season.

&amp;#x200B;

# Buffalo Bills

**Josh Allen might be the answer, but we won’t know after this season**

&amp;#x200B;

Quarterbacks need at least two seasons in the NFL to even begin to be judged. Josh Allen is probably going to need three.

&amp;#x200B;

He looked promising at times but one thing held him back: A lack of talent around him. That issue has followed them into 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

LeSean McCoy is back at running back and they added another 30+ name for support in Frank Gore. Zay Jones leads a receiving corps followed by John Brown, Robert Foster and Cole Beasley. Tyler Kroft was set as the dynamic young tight end until his season ended early with a broken foot.

&amp;#x200B;

Buffalo’s offensive line received some solid reinforcements with center Mitch Morse and tackle Cody Ford among other players to fill the gaps.

&amp;#x200B;

Oddly enough, the Bills were one of the most active teams in the offseason on offense. You can’t say they didn’t try. Unfortunately, it’s the same core group in terms of skilled position players. Josh is going to need more than a washed up running back and a drop-prone receiver to help pull the Bills out of the depths.

&amp;#x200B;

# Carolina Panthers

**Carolina is in the toughest position to make the postseason of all playoff contenders**

&amp;#x200B;

It’s 2019, which means the Panthers are a threat again. The odd/even year theory has been pretty consistent in Charlotte.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, they find themselves in an uphill battle before the season has even begun. Out of division schedule aside, Carolina has more working against them than any other playoff contender.

&amp;#x200B;

The Saints are a favorite by many to reach the Super Bowl. The Falcons are a perennial playoff menace barring injury to key players. The Bucs are are feisty enough to be a factor. So where does that leave the Panthers?

&amp;#x200B;

They’re basically the unanimous third best team in this division. That puts them in play for a hotly contested Wild Card spot.

&amp;#x200B;

For a team that is absolutely in play for a postseason birth, they have an unusually hard journey ahead to just escape their division.

&amp;#x200B;

# Chicago Bears

**Chicago's receiving corps is not very good**

&amp;#x200B;

At a glance, Chicago’s arsenal of wide receivers is as solid as any in the league. But if you look a little closer, it could be what keeps Trubisky from taking that next step.

&amp;#x200B;

Let’s start with Allen Robinson. At this point in his career, it would be apt to label him a “one-year wonder”. He broke out as a sophomore for 1,400 yards and 14 touchdowns at a massive 17.5 yards per reception. Outside of 2015, though, Robinson has never topped 900 yards, six touchdowns or 14 yards per reception in a season. It’s a clear outlier that has led AR14 to being greatly overrated.

&amp;#x200B;

Next is the shifty duo of Taylor Gabriel and Anthony Miller. Gabriel is a niche player. He’s best as the third option in an attack and especially thrives in creating yards. Anthony Miller is entering just his second season. He’s a crafty receiver with great moves with the ball in his hands. Both are complimentary players.

&amp;#x200B;

Rounding out the receiver group is “Swiss Army Knife” Cordarelle Patterson and rookie Riley Ridley.

&amp;#x200B;

At tight end is Trey Burton. The expectations for him were sky-high after leaving Philly. But, he only averaged 10 yards per reception in 2018. His threat as a receiver appears limited on the field.

&amp;#x200B;

None of these players averaged more than 14 yards per reception in 2018. Matt Nagy’s system is certainly creative, but there seems to be a lack of blue-chip talent to carry the group.

&amp;#x200B;

# Cincinnati Bengals

**Cincinnati is wasting an elite skilled-position corps by keeping Andy Dalton**

&amp;#x200B;

Despite vastly outplaying his draft position, Andy Dalton cannot catch a break. That’s not about to change now.

&amp;#x200B;

The Bengals are the most home-grown team in the NFL. They rarely dip into free agency and prioritize their own above all. This strict draft and develop plan has netted them a fantastic core of offensive playmakers. A.J. Green and Tyler Boyd may be the best receiver duo in the NFL. Joe Mixon and Giovani Bernard are a dynamic duo in the backfield. Add in John Ross and a bevy of serviceable tight ends and this offensive attack is dangerous.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, their biggest weakness is at the most important position.

&amp;#x200B;

Andy Dalton’s skill-set will never be able to take full advantage of the wealth he has at his disposal. The Bengals just wasted an opportunity to move on from Dalton as a new coaching staff moved in.

&amp;#x200B;

This team has the pieces to be an intimidating force in the AFC North. But as long as Dalton is behind center, they’ll be a forgotten entity.

&amp;#x200B;

# Cleveland Browns

**It will be impossible to live up to the hype**

&amp;#x200B;

John Dorsey and Co. have been busy this offseason. They’ve watched big names leave like Kevin Zeitler, Jabrill Peppers and Jamie Collins. More importantly, Cleveland has ushered new players in like Odell Beckham, Olivier Vernon, Sheldon Richardson and Kareem Hunt.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s a reloaded roster that already had solid core talent. Especially after Baker Mayfield’s incredible rookie season, the hype surrounding this team has (understandably) reached nuclear levels.

&amp;#x200B;

With all of the conversation surrounding the Browns already this offseason with more to come, it’s going to take a lot for this team to satisfy expectations.

&amp;#x200B;

Usually the “winner of the offseason” isn’t a title that ages well into the season. But, last season the Rams reached the Super Bowl after adding huge names in free agency. That only adds fuel to the fire in Cleveland that this load up on talent could produce big result

&amp;#x200B;

It’s possible this team is dominant. But hype of a Super Bowl run could lead fans disappointed after a playoff appearance. Expectations are huge in sports. The expectations set in Cleveland are nearing unreachable levels.

&amp;#x200B;

# Dallas Cowboys

**Dallas isn't going anywhere with Jason Garrett as head coach**

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like Jason Garrett would have to go 0-16 and get caught snorting cocaine Chris Foerster-style for Jerry Jones to fire him. Even then, it wouldn’t be too surprising if Jones just put him on the proverbial “hot seat”. Suffice it to say Jason Garrett will probably be is Dallas for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

As long as he is, this team isn’t going all the way. He’s the head coach version of the Dalton-scale.

&amp;#x200B;

Garrett is by no means a bad coach. He’s brought the Cowboys two division championships in the past three years. But, his conservative style isn’t going to shock teams like the Patriots and Rams who are constantly evolving with their innovative attacks.

&amp;#x200B;

The Boys will compete every season. However, if Jerry Jones’ goal is to bring the Lombari to Jerry World, he’ll have to look elsewhere at head coach.

&amp;#x200B;

# Denver Broncos

**Joe Flacco will be Case Keenum 2.0**

&amp;#x200B;

This is definitely the least spicy take of the list. But, the Broncos brought Flacco in for a reason. They believe he’ll be an upgrade from Keenum. Upgrade? No. Downgrade? No. I’ll take the push.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point in his career, Joe Flacco is basically the name-brand Case Keenum. He has the flashy Super Bowl win. He had (not anymore) heated debates held around him being elite. He even (somehow) got the mega-contract from the Ravens. As a player, however, Flacco is Keenum and vice versa.

&amp;#x200B;

The Broncos learned from their mistake last year of not having a young stud waiting behind Keenum if all went south. This year, Drew Lock will be breathing down Joe Flacco’s neck similar to how Lamar Jackson was last season. It’s not an enviable position Flacco is in, but that’s what happens you’ve reached the point in your career when you’re only “kind of” wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

# Detroit Lions

**Matthew Stafford is the NFL’s most average quarterback**

&amp;#x200B;

Since the introduction of the “Dalton Scale” (thanks ""Around the NFL"") the debate of who is a franchise quarterback and who isn’t has been a compelling one. But, that’s not what this is about. This is more focused on the most average. The 16th best quarterback in the NFL to be exact.

&amp;#x200B;

That player is Matthew Stafford.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this isn’t to condemn Stafford. He’s a really talented player who is without a doubt a franchise quarterback. It more speaks to the insane wealth of quarterbacks in the NFL today.

&amp;#x200B;

I won’t go into depth about the 15 quarterbacks ahead of Stafford. But, instead explain why I think Stafford is ranked here.

&amp;#x200B;

Matt “Stat-Pad” Stafford has appeared in the playoffs three times and lost in the first round each time. Pretty average. He’s thrown for an average of 23 touchdowns per year. Very average. He’s won an average of seven games per season. Definition of average.

&amp;#x200B;

Average isn’t always bad. Also, before you come screaming in with how I’m underrating Stafford, take a second and assess the quarterbacks currently in the NFL. You might be surprised with how many great ones there are.

&amp;#x200B;

# Green Bay Packers

**Aaron Rodgers is 35 years old**

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn’t feel like Rodgers is the sixth oldest starter in the league but that’s where he stands. That’s saying something too because the crop of quarterbacks playing far past when most expected is a surprisingly large number.

&amp;#x200B;

He’s accomplished a lot in his time in the league. However, most of it has been individual awards. Apart from a Super Bowl appearance (and victory) Rodgers has two MVPs, two First-Team All-Pros and seven Pro Bowls.

&amp;#x200B;

For a quarterback who many consider the most talented of his time, his postseason resume isn’t as extensive as you’d expect. Eight playoff appearance in 11 years as a starter is really solid. But, he’s reached the Conference Championship just three times.

&amp;#x200B;

There aren’t many teams who have been carried more by a single player than the Packers. But team success is important for a quarterbacks legacy. At 35, it feels like Rodgers’ time is starting to run out.

&amp;#x200B;

# Houston Texans

**Deshaun Watson will be running for his life again**

&amp;#x200B;

The Texans’ offensive line gave up 13 more sacks than any defense combined for in 2018. Watson was taken to the ground 65 times. That’s also more than any quarterback since Texans’ passer David Carr in 2005. It is absolutely unbelievable Deshaun Watson made it through 2018 without major injury.

&amp;#x200B;

So, looking forward to 2019 does Watson have reason for hope? Tentatively. Houston added two rookie starters on the offensive line in the offseason, both at tackle. They settled for Tytus Howard in the first round after Andre Dillard was sniped a pick before them. In the second round they took Max Scharping out of Northern Illinois.

&amp;#x200B;

Howard started 34 games while attending Alabama State. 23 of those starts were at right tackle and only 11 were at left tackle. He’s projected as a left tackle in the NFL mostly due to his athleticism. But boy is he a raw prospect. Max Scharping also needs improvement in his technique as he mans the right side

&amp;#x200B;

The Texans invested valuable capital in the offensive line through the draft. But, two projects at tackle likely won’t cure their woes this season.

&amp;#x200B;

# Indianapolis Colts

**Indianapolis missed an opportunity to add a featured back in the offseason**

&amp;#x200B;

The Colts’ offensive line blossomed into a unit every NFL quarterback wish he had protecting him. Not only did they hold Andrew Luck to just 21 sacks, but they asserted their dominance in the run-game.

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of running... Marlon Mack is a good player. He’s an exciting, splashy back with good power and speed. But, the Colts line made Mack look good in 2018, not the other way around. This makes you wonder what a real, three-down featured back could do behind this line.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m not saying they should have signed Le’Veon Bell. They were right to pass on him. But, the draft offered a few low-cost backs that could have brought Indianapolis’ rushing attack to a new level. Miles Sanders in the second round. David Montgomery in the third round. Damien Harris in the third round.

&amp;#x200B;

The duo of Marlon Mack and Nyheim Hines is a solid one-two punch. But, it would have been fun to see a true potential star running behind the Colts’ line.

&amp;#x200B;

# Jacksonville Jaguars

**Jacksonville’s offensive core is among the weakest in the league**

&amp;#x200B;

The main attraction in Jacksonville is their star-studded defense. Not many are up to date on their offense. Allow me to refresh your memory. It stinks.

&amp;#x200B;

Leonard Fournette’s nagging injuries are well-documented. Even when he’s on the field, his 3.7 career YPC isn’t scaring anyone. At wide receiver is a group full of budding star... ters. Marqise Lee, Dede Westbrook, Keelan Cole, D.J. Chark and Chris Conley may illustrate the smallest difference between a team’s #1 WR and #5 WR. That’s not a good thing. Former Cowboy Geoff Swaim and rookie Josh Oliver tentatively hold down the tight end position.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s a stark contrast from the wealth of options new Jaguar quarterback Nick Foles had in Philly.

&amp;#x200B;

Foles will have to do a lot with very little if he hopes to be an upgrade from Blake Bortles.

&amp;#x200B;

# Kansas City Chiefs

**Kansas City will struggle to repeat as division champs**

&amp;#x200B;

Kansas City burst onto the scene in 2018 as Patrick Mahomes helped this offense reach its full potential. Their offense was firing on all cylinders. They won their division and a playoff game in the inaugural season of the Mahomes-era.

&amp;#x200B;

However, thanks to their porous defense, it took Mahomes throwing for 5,000 yards ad 50 touchdowns to win even 12 games. That’s not going to happen again. Only three quarterbacks in NFL history have thrown 50 touchdowns in a single season. Odds are it won’t happen again in Mahomes’ entire career.

&amp;#x200B;

Their defense made some additions, but most were just replacing losses they sustained. Dee Ford, Justin Houston and Eric Berry left. Frank Clark and Tyrann Mathieu arrived. The biggest difference, however, could be new defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo.

&amp;#x200B;

Even still, factoring in a Mahomes regression plus an improved defense, Kansas City could break even and win 12 games again next season. That may not be enough to beat out the Chargers who also won 12 in 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

# Los Angeles Chargers

**Joey Bosa’s health will deicide if this defense is elite or not**

&amp;#x200B;

It’s well known that quarterback is the most important position in the NFL. But what about the second most important? That honor goes to edge rushers.

&amp;#x200B;

Players like Khalil Mack, Von Miller, Cameron Jordan, Demarcus Lawrence and Myles Garrett are each the most important player on their team’s defense. That goes for Joey Bosa as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Bosa has recorded 28.5 sacks in 35 career games. Unfortunately, that’s out of a possible 48 games in three seasons. He missed nine in 2018 due to a foot injury. Having Bosa healthy for a full 16 games is huge for this defense.

&amp;#x200B;

He’s one of the NFL’s top defensive ends. His ability to pressure the quarterback and slow down the run game frees up other players. Los Angeles has a stacked roster, but being able to rush the passer is vital for an elite defense. All of the top defenses from 2018 had elite pass rushing presences.

&amp;#x200B;

Mack for Chicago, Suggs for Baltimore, Campbell for Jacksonville, Watt for Houston, Lawrence for Dallas, Flowers for New England, Hunter for Minnesota and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

With Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram, the Chargers have an elite pas rushing duo. The only thing that could derail that, and L.A.’s defense, is an absent Joey Bosa.

&amp;#x200B;

# Los Angeles Rams

**We’ve seen the best Jared Goff has to offer**

&amp;#x200B;

Jared Goff is a good quarterback. Beyond that assessment, it’s fairly difficult to say exactly how good of a player Goff really is. But, one thing is for certain: He has limitations.

&amp;#x200B;

Goff and the Rams came up significantly short in Super Bowl 53. While it certainly took a team effort to only score three points, Goff’s personal shortcomings were on full display. His inability to read defensive adjustments was exploited by the intelligent Patriots defense. It magnified a bigger issue that’s been known for a while: Sean McVay is a big reason why Goff has been so successful.

&amp;#x200B;

A head coach can only do so much from the sideline on game day. It’s up to Goff to progress in the mental aspect of the game. This isn’t to say he can’t. Goff is still only 24 years old. But, it’s legitimate to ask if we’ve already seen the best from Jared Goff.

&amp;#x200B;

Players who are highly dependent on a system can only go so far. The Rams’ system may outgrow Jared Goff sooner rather than later.

&amp;#x200B;

# Miami Dolphins

**Josh Rosen is in no better position to succeed in Miami than he was in Arizona**

&amp;#x200B;

You can never judge a quarterback after just one season in the NFL. That is especially true for new Dolphin Josh Rosen. To put it simply: Rosen was set up to fail in Arizona as a rookie.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s difficult enough to acclimate to the NFL when the situation is right. The situation in Arizona could not have been more wrong. He played behind a horrendous offensive line that gave him about two seconds to get rid of the ball. His offense was orchestrated by Mike McCoy who didn’t have an inkling of how to use their playmakers. His head coach was defensive minded and wound up getting fired after 16 games. It was a certified disaster.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, Josh Rosen is in Miami with hopes of a new start. Unfortunately for him, the location is new, but the situation isn’t.

&amp;#x200B;

Miami’s offense has a lot of the same issues as Arizona’s. A lack of reliable playmakers on offense, a depleted offensive line (outside of Laremy Tunsil) and another rookie defensive head coach. His offensive coordinator, Chad O’Shea, is also in the first coordinator gig of his career.

&amp;#x200B;

As well as Rosen has handled the ridiculous situation he’s been put in, it might not be getting better anytime soon.

&amp;#x200B;

# Minnesota Vikings

**Minnesota isn't going anywhere with Kirk Cousins at quarterback**

&amp;#x200B;

In 2018, Minnesota had a top-5 defense in yards allowed. They had a top-10 defense in points allow. They had a quarterback who threw for 30 touchdowns. They had two 1,000 yard receivers. Yet, they missed the playoffs after winning just eight games. What’s missing?

&amp;#x200B;

To put it simply: Being competitive against competitive teams.

&amp;#x200B;

When matching up against average to below-average defenses, Kirk Cousins doesn’t have a problem. In eight games against bottom-half defenses, Cousins threw 18 TDs to 4 INT. However, in eight games against top-half defenses, Cousins threw 12 TDs to 6 INTs.

&amp;#x200B;

The Vikings only won three games out of their eight matchups against defenses that rank in the top-half of the league.

&amp;#x200B;

Losing is a team result. But, there’s a pattern here of Kirk Cousins not playing well when tested. It’s a trait that makes it difficult to get a team past the first 17 weeks of the NFL season.

&amp;#x200B;

# New England Patriots

**New England’s lack of offensive weapons for Brady will begin to show through**

&amp;#x200B;

People have been ridiculing the Patriots’ lack of on-paper offensive talent for years. Belicheck and Brady haven’t had a problem operating without big-name stars for a long time. Mainly because they’ve had one big name making it all work: Rob Gronkowski.

&amp;#x200B;

With the Hall of Fame tight end now permanently out of the picture, the post-Gronk era begins in Foxborough.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s now the indestructible Julian Edelman, rookie N’Keal Harry, broken Demaryius Thomas and journey-man Dontrelle Inman as the top pass-catchers for Tom.

&amp;#x200B;

If Brady is able to sustain the Patriots’ level of success it might be some of his greatest work ever. If not, we can’t say we’ll be surprised given the surrounding talent.

&amp;#x200B;

# New Orleans Saints

**The pressure is on to reach the Super Bowl**

&amp;#x200B;

Stop me if you’ve heard this before: Drew Brees is nearing the end of his career. Well, he's 40 now and it only gets more true every year.

&amp;#x200B;

This team is more loaded than it’s been in a long time. There are virtually no holes on New Orleans’ roster. If you want to get picky you could say Ted Ginn Jr. isn’t a great #2 wideout. Or that Eli Apple doesn’t stack up against other team’s #2 cornerbacks. But, reality is, even at the weakest points of this depth chart, the Saints are a step above a vast majority of the league.

&amp;#x200B;

The Super Bowl window couldn’t be more wide open. But, it’s only open as long as Drew Brees is playing at an elite level.

&amp;#x200B;

He showed signs of slowing down at the end of 2018. But nothing drastic enough to worry about their 2019 prospects. The pressure is on to make a deep playoff run and take advantage of the “Super-Team” New Orleans finds in front of them.

&amp;#x200B;

# New York Giants

**The coaching staff will play Eli for way longer than they should**

&amp;#x200B;

Despite picking Daniel Jones 6th overall, it doesn’t feel like the Giants will be handing him the reins anytime soon. It usually takes an injury or poor play for a rookie to supplant a veteran mid-season. If there’s two things Eli Manning is, it’s durable and consistent.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s going to take the Giants understanding that they’re not going anywhere significant with Eli Manning under center. NFL teams don’t make drastic quarterback changes when things are fine and that’s exactly what Big Blue has been the past couple seasons.

&amp;#x200B;

It wouldn’t make sense for New York to play Eli all season just because he’s under contract. But, as of now, it feels like that’s inevitable.

&amp;#x200B;

# New York Jets

**Le’Veon Bell’s days of being an elite running back are over**

&amp;#x200B;

Le’Veon Bell just cannot stay away from controversy. After executing the most dramatic hold-out in recent memory, he’s again the subject of an intra-team squabble. This time it wasn’t his fault. Adam Gase reportedly didn’t want to spend big money on a running back in free agency.

&amp;#x200B;

While trying not to be too over-reactionary, this little story can’t make Bell happy. He’s secured the bag, but hasn’t secured respect in New York yet.

&amp;#x200B;

This isn’t to say Bell will suddenly become a bad player with with Gang Green. It’s more a “compare and contrast” situation between the Steelers and Jets. The comparisons are very few and far between.

&amp;#x200B;

In Pittsburgh, Bell ran behind a loaded offensive line. He had a Hall of Fame receiver keeping teams from stacking the box. He also had a Hall of Fame quarterback opening up the offense. The circumstance in New York couldn’t be any different.

&amp;#x200B;

The Steelers have had long-standing success with running backs in their system. Now, Bell will have to prove himself outside of that environment.

&amp;#x200B;

# Oakland Raiders

**The Raiders defense is in store for another last place finish in sacks**

&amp;#x200B;

One of the favorite statistics to emerge from the 2018 season is the Raiders’ entire defense combining for less sacks than seven players managed individually. 13 sacks over 16 games is good enough for 17 less than the 31st team. Pretty mind-blowing.

&amp;#x200B;

The question is: Did they do enough to not repeat at 32nd in the league in 2019. My answer: I’m skeptical.

&amp;#x200B;

Oakland’s only big addition along the defensive line was with the fourth overall pick Clelin Ferrell. As far as I know, Ferrell could be the new Khalil Mack. But, if he’s literally anything less, this team will be back in the cellar for sack production.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s fun to crap on Gruden’s Raiders. However, this seems more realistic than just hate.

&amp;#x200B;

# Philadelphia Eagles

**Losing Nick Foles will prove to be disastrous**

&amp;#x200B;

I’ll start off by saying it was never feasible to keep Foles long-term. He was headed out sooner or later and it ended up happening for $50 million guaranteed. That’s a number even Howie Roseman could have never made magically appear.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s no secret that Nick Foles has been the NFL’s most valuable backup over the past couple seasons. He’s given Philadelphia postseason relevancy and, most of all, the team’s first Super Bowl title. Carson Wentz’s injury history is extensive enough to doubt he can make it through a season. Without Foles waiting in the wings, the Eagles' season could be kaput after an injury to Wentz.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s as simple as this: The Eagles lost their second most valuable player. That’s a significant concern.

&amp;#x200B;

# Pittsburgh Steelers

**Antonio Brown’s absence will be a big blow to this offense**

&amp;#x200B;

The feeling among NFL fans seems to be one of “good riddance” about Antonio Brown leaving Pittsburgh. But, we need to pump the breaks on this being just another receiver walking out of the door for the Steelers.

&amp;#x200B;

Pittsburgh has lost it’s fair share of star wideouts in their prime. Most recently it was Mike Wallace and Emmanuel Sanders. While Brown is no longer in his prime, his 30’s will be far better than most other wideout’s 20s.

&amp;#x200B;

Ben Roethlisberger and Co. are losing an elite player who opened up every level of the offense. This team looks a lot different without Brown on the field. It’s too early to label Pittsburgh’s new #1, Smith-Schuster, a star or “in over his head”. But, one thing is for certain: It will be a group effort to replace the NFL's biggest diva this season.

&amp;#x200B;

# San Francisco 49ers

**San Francisco’s poor secondary could neutralize all the work done on the front four**

&amp;#x200B;

The 49ers’ defensive front looks awesome. DeForest Buckner, Dee Ford and Nick Bosa star as Arik Armstead and Solomon Thomas provide support. That’s five first round picks.

&amp;#x200B;

However, as dominating as that unit may be, the secondary is looking like the opposite. It may not matter if there is pressure on the quarterback in three seconds if the ball is already gone after two. Very little was done to improve this poor group in the offseason. Jason Verrett was added but with his extensive injury history, he can’t be counted on as a reliable member.

&amp;#x200B;

Elsewhere at defensive back, Richard Sherman finally began to show signs of age. Ahkello Witherspoon didn’t take the step many hoped he would and was a liability most of the season. Jimmie Ward and Jaquiski Tartt have injury history and have plateaued as below-average safeties.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s an uninspiring group. Wideouts should be looking forward to facing San Francisco’s defense in 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

# Seattle Seahawks

**Selecting Rashaad Penny in the first round was a massive mistake**

&amp;#x200B;

It’s no secret that when Seattle took running back Rashaad Penny in the first round of 2018 many were perplexed. Then, after the season, that feeling of confusion turned into frustration.

&amp;#x200B;

Penny not only failed to win the job, but he only had the third most rushing attempts on the team (behind Chris Carson and Mike Davis). Penny already seems like the odd man out after Carson’s breakout season and with receiving specialists C.J. Prosise and J.D. McKissic on the roster. He’s definitely the most highly invested-in backup RB in the NFL.

&amp;#x200B;

By taking Penny 27th overall, Seattle missed on the chance to add players like Darius Leonard, Braden Smith, Will Hernandez, Donte Jackson and Jessie Bates. It was an odd move at the time and looks no better now.

&amp;#x200B;

# Tampa Bay Buccaneers

**Tampa Bay's secondary will doom this team like it did in 2018**

&amp;#x200B;

It’s tough to win games when your defense gives up 29 points, which is exactly how many Tampa Bay yielded per game in 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

Frankly, their entire defense was a mess and on pace for record setting futility by a defensive unit in NFL history. But, the secondary was the most obvious weakness.

&amp;#x200B;

They enter 2019 with the same group plus a couple rookies. Day three picks Sean Bunting and Jamel Dean will join Vernon Hargreaves and Carlton Davis to form the most no-name corner group in the NFL. At safety, it’s up-and-comer Justin Evans and sophomore Jordan Whitehead. Tampa Bay’s four starters last year had a combined three years of starting experience between them entering the season. It’s an aggressively young corps without a player to hang their hat on.

&amp;#x200B;

That unproven youth doesn’t bode well for hopes of an improved group in 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

# Tennessee Titans

**Marcus Mariota is not the answer at quarterback**

&amp;#x200B;

The Tennessee Titans have been in purgatory for what seems like decades. They’ve won three playoff games this century. The most recent victory required Mariota to miraculously complete a pass to himself for a touchdown. None of the three playoff wins have been by more than three points.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, Mariota can only answer for the past four seasons in Tennessee. But even in that small sample size, he’s never completed a 16-game season and has forced his backup to start meaningful games. In the games Mariota has participated in, he’s failed to pop off the screen the way you’d expect a former second overall pick to.

&amp;#x200B;

Mariota hasn’t thrown for more than two touchdowns in a game since 2016. You might think that’s a product of his supporting cast. But, Tennessee has drafted a top-5 receiver, 2nd round running back, had a top-10 tight end and a really solid offensive line.

&amp;#x200B;

What’s missing is a quarterback and the Titans might have one. But, his name isn’t Marcus Mariota.

&amp;#x200B;

# Washington Redskins

**There’s a silver lining to losing Reuben Foster for the season**

&amp;#x200B;

Any injury, especially a season-ending one in May, is heartbreaking. It can slow down a team’s season before it’s even begun and leave the player in the unfortunate position of not being able to contribute.

&amp;#x200B;

With all the negativity, I’ll try to end on a bright note. While the loss of Foster is a big one, it could lift a weight off the shoulders of players and coaches to not have to endure potential questions about Foster’s questionable past during the season.

&amp;#x200B;

An NFL season is as mental as it is physical and we’ve seen many times before teams collapse because of happenings off the field.

&amp;#x200B;

Without Reuben Foster on the field this season, Washington can hopefully skip some of the unnecessary commentary about Foster’s history. It will also allow another Foster (Mason) to step into a bigger role after a nice 2018 season. .",nfl,1304

SomeGuyInSanJoseCa,2019-05-22 02:44:22+00:00,"Have you ever wondered what the hiring process was 20 years ago compared to today? Probably not, but I'll tell you anyway.","I have searched tech jobs twice in my life.  Once as a new grad in 1999, and just now.  For those that are just curious, or for those that are older and am curious about the current recruitment process, let me explain what I saw.

1999:

Jobs were super easy to get.  It was a weird time when non-tech folks were in charge of tech folks.  Also, the amount of technology used wasn't as massive and varied as it is now.  No one asked for 12 years of Python Experience with Computer Vision with Jenkins within a Docker container or whatever because that shit didn't exist back then.  It was a much simpler time.  It was kind of Development of System Admin as the major pillars back then. 

This meant that often times, it was behavioral and simple questions, as many hiring managers were just general people managers and not Engineering managers.  

In terms of tech questioning, whiteboarding of useless problems was the only way to test really.  But it wasn't that complicated.  And if you were decent, and communicated well, you got the job.  I think I ended up with 10 offers out of 10 second round interviews (I got rejected by one, but another one gave me two offers).  But since I just finished undergrad, silly algo / data structure problems were all I knew, it was super easy for me.  Sure, the first time I saw vi I was scared and had to ask a colleague what this was, but I could traverse a graph on whiteboard like a motherfucker.

Recruiting was also different.  It was put your resume in a resume database and kind of wait.  job fairs were the best way to do that.  The massive recruiting teams that large employers have now were definitely not at today's scale. This meant that you got fewer requests for jobs, but you also weren't competing against 100 other people for that one position.  Essentially, if you were contacted, there was a much better chance you were getting the job due to limited HR resources.  It saved a lot of time.

Also, there were no tiered awesome companies with great pay.  It was pretty standard for a new grad.  I got $62K and a few piddly stock options at the time at the most awesome company ever, a company that would never run out of ideas and dominate the industry forever.  That company was Sun Microsystems.  So, yeah, don't count on me for any gambling advice.  Pretty much ever company was the within $10K of that, with varying degrees of stock options. 

All that being said, the fallout of the dot-com bust (one year later) was dramatic.  All those people who were hired with limited credentials and skills suddenly got canned and things got tight.  Suddenly, knowing HTML didn't make you a coder anymore.  I know a lot of people who were plain screwed.  There were no bootcamps back then, but equivalent were the people that learned to code with the ""Learn Java in 21 Days"" books were assed out at the end of the day.  A lot of them went it to Real Estate, so, yeah, you can put two and two together on what the next downturn was.


2019:

First thing first.  Holy fucking shit job searches are annoying.  You need to match all these random technologies.  Then, even if you have that, you have to memorize all those leetcode tricks (that's right, not skills, but tricks).  Sure, I know loops and trees and the like, but dang, I didn't remember the trick to get the consecutive subset of numbers to equal a passed in sum efficiently (mine was inefficient) - so yeah, even though I matched pretty darn well with the job requirements, I did not get that coding parlor trick, so I'm out.  This was for a partner engineering position BTW, which in no way shape or form would require any sort of algorithmic knowledge. 

In my undergrad days, I would say I memorized 80% of those tricks out there.  Today, I know about 40%.  So, I was immediately knocked out of like 60% of interviews.  I didn't realize that the leetcode monkey dance would be so prevalent.  Next job search, I know what to study for - this last one I was ill-prepared.  Anyway, I think most people felt the algo / data structures problems were outdated 20 years ago - but man, they are even worse now.  But knowing the trick basically got me an in as well.  So yeah, it's completely fucking random whether I impress people or not.  One company thinks I'm an idiot and nother thought I was God because of the random selection of leetcode-esqe questions.  

On the opposite end - holy fucking shit does this pay well.  MY. FUCKING. GOD.  5 years ago, those that got $300K were lucky to jump in the right company at the right time with the right options, were a super genius, someone who is some major thought leader, or some Senior Director.  Now a schmuck like me can get near $300K.  This is crazy.  I joined a company for $180K in 2017 in total. compensation, and I was ecstatic.  In 2012, I think I was rightly paid at $120K or something like that.  Now I just accepted an offer for $280K.  This is nice, but also a bit scary.  I've been through 2 different downturns.  What's going to happen if there's another downturn and these crazy salaries whither away?

Let me put it another way.  For the early to mid 2010s, my wife and I were paid the same though she's way smarter than me.  But since she does supply chain and not tech, she's gotten about a 30% increase in pay in the last 4 years (pretty good), and my pay has roughly doubled. 

I'm also amazed that some companies out there think that it is still 2015 and offer those salaries.  Most non-tech companies are completely flabbergasted in terms of my desired salary.  Many of them came back later with a substantial increase because they couldn't find anyone qualified, but I still had to say it wasn't enough.  

Recruiting is also way different.  LinkedIn is awesome, because I know how Yakov Smirnoff feels when he talks about Soviet Russia.  On LinkedIn...Jobs come to you!  Of course, since it is LinkedIn, you got to wade through all these useless intros.  It's a full time job.  I think the first week I said I was actively looking, I got 30 pings.  Everyone wanted a half hour conversation.  Many of them didn't bother reading my requirements.  No, I am not a front-end engineer and no I don't want to move to Seattle - why do you want to talk?  Many just plain ghosted me after I replied with something like, ""I am interested and I would like to know more.""  Like, what did you want, me to show a picture of myself jerking off to Tim Cook or something or in order to get a reply back from you?

Most recruiters who do talk to you basically tell you are God's gift to employers, then either say something like, you were not a match to the job I said you were a match to, or send me to another person who grills me.  It's a huge bi-polar emotional rollercoaster of validation and rejection.  I was mentally drained from all this.  Like my ex-girlfriend is God of job applications or something.

Also, the pillars are way different.  You don't have simple pillars like Development or System Admin, it gets way more fragmented.  You have DevOps/SRE, you got Web Development, ML/AI/Data Science, and way more high level pillars.  This is cool in that you can be more sure of what you want, but not cool in that once you are in one, it takes some effort to get out. 

In terms of those pillars - DevOps/SRE is the hottest thing out there right now. I actually just got a Masters in CS with a specialization in ML and some minor ML experience.  No one gives a flying fuck. But because I can spell Kubernetes, I got DevOps / SRE requests left and right (this is the job I essentially took BTW)

Anyway, 2019 is similar and different in many ways.  But damn, I do not want to go through this job search again.  FUCK. THAT.

...............

Anyway, for us old farts who walked uphill both ways in the snow, I wanted to share a few tricks along the way and would totally do my job search differently.  Here's what I l learned. 

1) Leetcode algo / data structure memorization is key.  Sure, they don't know if you are older, but it's the easiest way to have age discrimination.  Very few 41 year olds are going to remember what they did in college at age 20 - the perfect way to filter out the gray hairs and those with a family.

2) I always ask for salary.  Weed out those that say, ""it depends.""  Depends on what?  My experience?  The exact same experience that you can see on LinkedIn as we are talking right now?

3) Ask a question that only a hiring manager can answer.  If the recruiter can't do that, the recruiter is just gathering resumes and has no idea if you ""perfect for the job"" as he or she states.  Time is limited with the relentless amount of pings you'll get - this is a great way to make sure that they are serious about you being a candidate.

4) Ensure that you are the only person interviewing for that position if possible.  I got a semi-offer from a company because they loved me, and wanted me to wait for another rec to open, but they hired someone with Azure experience and explicitly saying Azure experience is not a requirement.  I wasn't going to wait and it was a complete waste of my time.  I found that there are companies that have like 5 people interview for one position, and those that interview one at a time and will fill it if you are good.  The latter is the key because you are the only variable.  Ask for flexibility in terms of interviewing.  If they are interviewing a whole bunch of candidates, they want you in a 3 day window.  If they are just checking you out exclusively, they'll be really flexible.

...............

Anyway, enough my pointless rant.  Now you little fucking whippersnappers can get off my lawn!",cscareerquestions,1394

Oh yeah… and then there’s [this second place finisher from 2007 that I have to share](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfjHJneVonE), there’s [the song that brought us Epic Sax Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHXDMe6QV-U), there’s [the sequel to Epic Sax Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93FLcVGDacs), there’s [the time that a turkey sang on stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps3kxGo_gro), and there’s [quite possibly the worst voice crack of all-time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrtNGikEWcU). 2017 was a really fun and great year for the contest.

The Eurovision Song Contest is not only fun, but it can predict the upcoming season in the NFL. By analyzing and looking at trends from the contest, we can predict what will happen in the 2019 season. No, the thread was not perfect last year, but it got a lot of things surprisingly right. Last year, [I made this thread](https://en.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/8jemsy/oc_jaguargator9s_weird_stat_thread_eurovision/?st=jvtplcqc&amp;sh=154a122e) based on the results of 2018, and the following things happened that were correctly predicted:

- The Colts will not only make the playoffs, but will beat the Titans in week 17

- The Ravens will make the playoffs

- The Browns will win their final home game of the season, defeating the Cincinnati Bengals on 12/23

- Not only will the Cowboys win the NFC East, but they’ll make it to the divisional round

- The Vikings will defeat the Lions at home in week 9

- In perhaps the craziest prediction that was actually correct, the Green Bay Packers will tie a game. That’s right- I correctly predicted off of the Weird Stat Thread from Eurovision that Green Bay ties a game

- The Cardinals will finish in last place

- The Seahawks make the playoffs

- The Patriots represent the AFC in the Super Bowl (which is pretty much like a free space in Bingo at this point)

With all of that being said, it’s time to take a look at the 2019 competition and see what weird trends we can draw from that. How will this year’s Eurovision Song Contest impact the upcoming NFL season?

Albania has sent a song in the Albanian language five times to the competition (I’m excluding songs that were in both English and Albanian; they have to be strictly in Albanian). All five times, the Colts made the playoffs AND won in week 17.

Year | Albania Song | Language | Colts Placement | Colts Week 17
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2006 | Zjarr e ftohte | Albanian | Won Super Bowl XLI | Defeated Miami 27-22
2008 | Zemren e lame peng | Albanian | Lost wild card round | Defeated Tennessee 23-0
2012 | Suus | Albanian | Lost wild card round | Defeated Houston 28-16
2013 | Identitet | Albanian | Lost divisional round | Defeated Jacksonville 30-10
2018 | Mall | Albanian | Lost divisional round | Defeated Tennessee 33-17

This year, Albania sent the song “Ktheju tokes,” which is an Albanian song in their native language. Good news for the Colts- they’ll make the playoffs, and they’ll win their week 17 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Austria has sent a song with a one-word title five times to the competition. All five times, the Giants finished the season with a record below .500.

Year | Austria Song | Words in Title | Giants Record
--- | --- | --- | ---
1971 | Musik | 1 | 4-10
1982 | Sonntag | 1 | 4-5
1983 | Hurricane | 1 | 3-12-1
1999 | Reflection | 1 | 7-9
2013 | Shine | 1 | 7-9

This year, Austria sent the song “Limits” to the competition, which has one word in its title. That’s bad news for the Giants, as history shows that they’ll finish with a losing record because of that.

Additionally, when Austria sends a song with a one-word title to the competition, the Super Bowl champion is from a city that had never previously won a Super Bowl.

Year | Austria Song | Words in Title | Super Bowl | Super Bowl Champion | City’s Super Bowl Titles Before the Win
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1971 | Musik | 1 | VI | Dallas | 0
1982 | Sonntag | 1 | XVII | Washington | 0
1983 | Hurricane | 1 | XVIII | Los Angeles | 0
1999 | Reflection | 1 | XXXIV | St. Louis | 0
2013 | Shine | 1 | XLVIII | Seattle | 0

Note that it’s about the city’s first title, not the team’s. Even though the Raiders won Super Bowl XI and Super Bowl XV prior to winning Super Bowl XVIII, that was in Oakland, as only during Super Bowl XVIII did the city of Los Angeles experience its first title. This means that, since Austria sent a one-word song to the contest this year, the winner of the Super Bowl will be either the Bills, Jaguars, Titans, Texans, Bengals, Browns, Lions, Panthers, Falcons, Vikings, or Cardinals. Sorry, Chargers- because you’re in Los Angeles now, even though you’ve never won a Super Bowl, you’re not eligible for this list.

On top of that, let’s keep this stat going further. When Austria sends a song with one word to the competition, the Minnesota Vikings wind up winning their final regular season game of the season (which, this year, is in week 17).

Year | Austria Song | Words in Title | Week 17 Result
--- | --- | --- | ---
1971 | Musik | 1 | Win 27-10 vs. Chicago
1982 | Sonntag | 1 | Win 31-27 vs. Dallas
1983 | Hurricane | 1 | Win 20-14 vs. Cincinnati
1999 | Reflection | 1 | Win 24-17 vs. Detroit
2013 | Shine | 1 | Win 14-13 vs. Detroit

Because Austria sent “Limits” to Eurovision, the Vikings will win their week 17 game this season. This comes at home against the Bears.

Belarus has qualified for the finals of Eurovision five times. All five times, both the Miami Dolphins and Jacksonville Jaguars lost their final regular season game of the season.

Year | Belarus Song | Did They Qualify? | Dolphins Week 17 Result | Jaguars Week 17 Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2007 | Work Your Magic | Yes | Lost 38-25 vs. Cincinnati | Lost 42-28 vs. Houston
2010 | Butterflies | Yes | Lost 38-7 vs. New England | Lost 34-17 vs. Houston
2013 | Solayoh | Yes | Lost 20-7 vs. NY Jets | Lost 30-10 vs. Indianapolis
2014 | Cheesecake | Yes | Lost 37-24 vs. NY Jets | Lost 23-17 vs. Houston
2017 | Story of My Life | Yes | Lost 22-16 vs. Buffalo | Lost 15-10 vs. Tennessee

This year, Belarus qualified for the final with the song “Like It” by ZENA. This means that, if history repeats itself, the Jaguars will lose their week 17 game to the Colts, while the Dolphins will lose their week 17 game to the Patriots.

Note that also during all five of these years, the Patriots won the AFC East and made it to at least the divisional round of the playoffs. However, I feel like that’s cheating at this point if I did that, since Belarus has only competed since 2004, and since the Patriots win the AFC East and get out of the divisional round with regularity. So I’m not going to map out the full stats with that.

---

Belgium has sent a song starting with the letter “W” four times. All four times, the Lions lost their final regular season game, and the Giants won their final regular season game while finishing with a winning record (that part completely contradicts a previous stat).

Year | Belgium Song | First Letter of Song Title | Lions Week 17 Result | Giants Record | Giants Week 17 Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1963 | Warrom? | W | Lost 24-14 vs. Chicago | 11-3 | Win 33-17 vs. Pittsburgh
2011 | With Love Baby | W | Lost 45-41 vs. Green Bay | 9-7 | Win 31-14 vs. Dallas
2012 | Would You? | W | Lost 26-24 vs. Chicago | 9-7 | Win 42-7 vs. Philadelphia
2016 | What’s the Pressure | W | Lost 31-24 vs. Green Bay | 11-5 | Win 19-10 vs. Washington

This year, Belgium’s song that they sent to the competition was “Wake Up” by Eliot. The performance of this song was so bad that it didn’t qualify for the finals; Eliot sounded half asleep during the song. However, they still sent a song with the letter “W”, so expect the Lions to lose to the Packers in week 17, and expect the Giants to defeat the Eagles in week 17.

Sticking with that stat, all four times that Belgium has sent a song starting with the letter “W,” not only do the Patriots win their division, but they also manage to win a game in the postseason.

Year | Belgium Song | First Letter of Song Title | Patriots Placement in Division | Playoff Games Won
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1963 | Warrom? | W | 1st | Divisional Round vs. Buffalo
2011 | With Love Baby | W | 1st | Divisional Round vs. Denver, AFC Championship vs. Baltimore
2012 | Would You? | W | 1st | Divisional Round vs. Houston
2016 | What’s the Pressure | W | 1st | Divisional Round vs. Houston, AFC Championship vs. Pittsburgh, Super Bowl LII vs. Atlanta

Basically, don’t expect the Patriots run of dominance to end anytime soon if Belgium’s weird stat has to say anything about it.

---

Croatia has sent a dual-language song to the competition four times. All four times, not only did the #1 seed in the AFC wind up making it to the Super Bowl, but the AFC representative came out of the AFC East.

Year | Croatia Song | Languages of Song | #1 Seed | Division of #1 Seed | Super Bowl Made
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1993 | Don’t Ever Cry | Croatian &amp; English | Buffalo Bills | AFC East | XXVIII
2003 | Vise nisam tvjoa | Croatian &amp; English | New England Patriots | AFC East | XXXVIII
2007 | Vjerujem u ljubav | Croatian &amp; English | New England Patriots | AFC East | XLII
2017 | My Friend | English &amp; Italian | New England Patriots | AFC East | LII

This year, Croatia sent the song “The Dream” by Roko, which was sung in both English and Croatian. Because of this, expect an AFC East team to get the #1 seed and represent the conference in the Super Bowl. In all likelihood, that would be the New England Patriots.

---

Croatia has sent a dual-language song to the competition four times. All four times, the Tennessee Titans made the playoffs and won their final regular season game of the season.

Year | Croatia Song | Languages of Song | Titans Postseason Result | Titans Week 17 Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1993 | Don’t Ever Cry | Croatian &amp; English | Lost Divisional Round vs. Kansas City | Won 24-0 vs. NY Jets
2003 | Vise nisam tvjoa | Croatian &amp; English | Lost Divisional Round vs. New England | Won 33-13 vs. Tampa Bay
2007 | Vjerujem u ljubav | Croatian &amp; English | Lost Wild Card Round vs. San Diego | Won 16-10 vs. Indianapolis
2017 | My Friend | English &amp; Italian | Lost Divisional Round vs. New England | Won 15-10 vs. Jacksonville

Because “The Dream” was sung in both English and Croatian, the Titans will not only make the playoffs, but will win their week 17 game against the Houston Texans in the process.

---

Who wants another “Patriots will be good again” stat? Well, here we go. All four times that Croatia sends a dual-language song to the competition, the Patriots win their final road game AND their final three home games of the regular season.

Year | Croatia Song | Languages of Song | Final Road Game Result | Final 3 Home Games Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1993 | Don’t Ever Cry | Croatian &amp; English | Win 20-17 vs. Cleveland | Wins vs. Cincinnati, Indianapolis &amp; Miami
2003 | Vise nisam tvjoa | Croatian &amp; English | Win 21-16 vs. NY Jets | Wins vs. Miami, Jacksonville &amp; Buffalo
2007 | Vjerujem u ljubav | Croatian &amp; English | Win 38-35 vs. NY Giants | Wins vs. Pittsburgh, NY Jets &amp; Miami
2017 | My Friend | English &amp; Italian | Win 27-24 vs. Pittsburgh | Wins vs. Miami, Buffalo &amp; NY Jets

Since Croatia sent a dual-language song to the competition, expect the Patriots to win their final road game of the season (week 15 against Buffalo), and their final three home games of the season (week 14 against Kansas City, week 16 against Buffalo, week 17 against Miami).

---

Cyprus has sent an English song with one word in its title to the competition four times. All four times, it turns out to be a pretty good year for the state of Pennsylvania; the Steelers finish with a winning record, and the Eagles make the playoffs

Year | Cyprus Song | Language of Song | Words in Title | Steelers Record | Eagles Playoff Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2002 | Gimme | English | 1 | 10-5-1 | Lost in NFC Championship
2009 | Firefly | English | 1 | 9-7 | Lost in Wild Card Round
2017 | Gravity | English | 1 | 13-3 | Won Super Bowl LII
2018 | Fuego | English | 1 | 9-6-1 | Lost in Divisional Round

Yes, “Fuego” was an English-language song. This year, Cyprus sent the song “Replay,” which was a shameless carbon copy of “Fuego” but ten thousand times worse with awful vocals; this song was entirely in the English language. This means that Pittsburgh will have a winning record, and Philadelphia will, once again, make the playoffs.

---

Denmark has sent an artist starting with the letter “L” to the competition four times. All four times, both Kansas City and Washington finish the season with winning records, while the Cardinals finish the season with a losing record. Additionally, all four times, the Chiefs made the playoffs, but didn’t win a single playoff game.

Year | Denmark Artist | First Letter of First Name | Kansas City Record | Kansas City Playoff Result | Washington Record | Cardinals Record
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1986 | Lise Haavik | L | 10-6 | Lost Wild Card Round | 12-4 | 4-11-1
1990 | Lonnie Devantier | L | 11-5 | Lost Wild Card Round | 10-6 | 5-11
1992 | Lotte Feder | L | 10-6 | Lost Wild Card Round | 9-7 | 4-12
2016 | Lighthouse X | L | 12-4 | Lost Divisional Round (got a bye) | 8-7-1 | 7-8-1

I used the Cardinals instead of the city name for this one because in 1986, the Cardinals were in St. Louis, in 1990 and 1992, they were the Phoenix Cardinals, and in 2016, they were the Arizona Cardinals. This year, the artist that Denmark sent was Leonora with the song “Love Is Forever,” which is like every generic coffee shop song rolled up into one. This means that the Chiefs will make the playoffs but won’t win a game, Washington finishes with a winning record, and Arizona finishes with a losing record.

---

Finland has sent a song starting with the letter “L” to the competition five times. All five times, the Minnesota Vikings finished ahead of the Chicago Bears in the standings.

Year | Finland Song | First Letter of Title | Vikings Record | Bears Record
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1964 | Laiskotellen | L | 8-5-1 (third in conference) | 5-9 (sixth in conference)
1977 | Lapponia | L | 9-5 (won division) | 9-5 (second place)
1989 | La dolce vita | L | 10-6 (won division) | 6-10 (fourth place)
2007 | Leave Me Alone | L | 8-8 (second place) | 7-9 (fourth place)
2009 | Lose Control | L | 12-4 (won division) | 7-9 (third place)

This year, Finland sent the song “Look Away” by Darude, the same guy that made “Sandstorm.” The song didn’t qualify, and finished last in the semifinal it was in (it’s not a good song), but that’s good news for the Vikings, as if the weird stat holds up, they will finish ahead of the Bears in the standings.

---

France has sent a song in French and English to the competition five times. All five times, the Patriots won the AFC East and won a home playoff game; however, we’d be here all night if I did that for every single stat. All five times, the Seahawks finished the season with a winning record, and the Raiders lost their week 17 game.

Year | French Song | Languages of Song | Seahawks Record | Raiders Week 17 Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2001 | Je n’ai que mon ame | English &amp; French | 9-7 | Lost 24-22 vs. NY Jets
2007 | L’amour a la francaise | English &amp; French | 10-6 | Lost 30-17 vs. San Diego
2012 | Echo (You and I) | English &amp; French | 11-5 | Lost 24-21 vs. San Diego
2016 | J’ai cherche | English &amp; French | 10-5-1 | Lost 24-6 vs. Denver
2017 | Requiem | English &amp; French | 9-7 | Lost 30-10 vs. LA Chargers

This year, the French song was “Roi,” which was sung in both French and English. This means that the Seahawks will finish the season with a winning record, and the Raiders will lose their final regular season game of the year, which comes on the road against the Denver Broncos.

---

Greece has sent a solo artist whose first name starts with the letter “K” to the competition five times. All five times, the Miami Dolphins and Dallas Cowboys finished with a winning record, while the Cincinnati Bengals finished with a losing record.

Year | Greece Artist | First Letter of First Name | Dolphins Record | Cowboys Record | Bengals Record
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1983 | Kristi Stassinopoulou | K | 12-4 | 12-4 | 7-9
1992 | Kleopatra | K | 11-5 | 13-3 | 5-11
1993 | Katy Garbi | K | 9-7 | 12-4 | 3-13
1994 | Kostas Bigalis | K | 10-6 | 12-4 | 3-13
2008 | Kalomira | K | 11-5 | 9-7 | 4-11-1

This year, the artist representing Greece in the contest was Katerine Duska with the song “Better Love.” This is a good sign for the Dolphins and Cowboys, but a bad sign for the Bengals.

---

Ireland has sent an artist whose first name starts with the letter “S” to the competition four times. All four times, the Dallas Cowboys won exactly one playoff game, while the New York Jets finished second in their division.

Year | Ireland Artist | First Letter of First Name | Cowboys Playoff Games Won | Jets Placement in Division
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1967 | Sean Dunphy | S | Conference Championship vs. Cleveland | 2nd 
1972 | Sandie Jones | S | Divisional Round vs. San Francisco | 2nd 
1981 | Sheeba | S | Divisional Round vs. Tampa Bay | 2nd 
2009 | Sinead Mulvey | S | Wild Card Round vs. Minnesota | 2nd

This year, the Ireland artist was Sarah McTernan with the song “22.” Good news for the Cowboys, and I guess for the Jets as well. The Cowboys will make the playoffs and win a game (but lose in the round immediately after that), and the Jets will finish second in the AFC East. Based on all of these stats, the AFC East might be stacked this year.

---

Malta has sent an artist whose first name starts with the letter “M” to the competition four times. All four times, the Broncos finished ahead of the Raiders in the AFC West, the Bengals finished the season with a losing record, and the Pittsburgh Steelers won their division.

Year | Malta Artist | First Letter of First Name | Broncos Placement in AFC West | Raiders Placement in AFC West | Bengals Record | Steelers Placement in Division
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1992 | Mary Spiteri | M | 3rd place (8-8) | 4th place (7-9) | 1st place (11-5)
1995 | Mike Spiteri | M | 4th place (8-8) | 5th place (8-8) | 1st place (11-5)
1996 | Miriam Christine | M | 1st place (13-3) | 4th place (7-9) | 1st place (10-6)
2008 | Morena | M | 2nd place (8-8) | 3rd place (5-11) | 1st place (12-4)

Note that in 1990, Mary Rose Mallia was supposed to represent Malta with the song “Our Little World of Yesterday,” but they never entered the song, because Eurovision rules at the time only allowed 22 countries to compete. This year, Malta’s artist was Michela Pace with the song “Chameleon,” which was maybe one of five fun songs at the final (seriously- this was not a good year for the competition). This means that Pittsburgh will win the AFC North, and the Broncos will finish ahead of the Raiders in the division.

---

Netherlands has sent a song starting with the letter “A” four times. All four times, the Chiefs win their final regular season game of the year, while the Saints lose their final regular season game of the year

Year | Netherlands Song | First Letter of Title | Chiefs Week 17 Result | Saints Week 17 Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1972 | Als het om de liefde gaat | A | Win 17-14 vs. Atlanta | Lost 30-20 vs. Green Bay
1980 | Amsterdam | A | Win 38-28 vs. Baltimore Colts | Lost 38-27 vs. New England
1986 | Alles heft ritme | A | Win 24-19 vs. Pittsburgh | Lost 33-17 vs. Minnesota
2006 | Amambanda | A | Win 35-30 vs. Jacksonville | Lost 31-21 vs. Carolina

This year, the Netherlands sent the song “Arcade,” which ended up winning the competition (it’s a good song, but personally, it lacked some winner quality that I can’t quite put my finger on; however, this was a pretty weak year for the contest, so I don’t have too many complaints). This means that the Chiefs will win their week 17 game against the Chargers, and the Saints will lose their week 17 game against the Panthers.

---

Slovenia has sent a song starting with the letter “S” four times. All four times, the Colts have made it to the playoffs, while the Texans and Lions have finished with a losing record AND lost their week 17 games.

Year | Slovenia Song | First Letter of Title | Colts Postseason Result | Texans Record | Texans Week 17 Result | Lions Record | Lions Week 17 Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2002 | Samo ljubezen | S | Lost Wild Card Round | 4-12 | Lost 13-3 vs. Tennessee | 3-13 | Lost 38-36 vs. Minnesota
2004 | Stay Forever | S | Lost Divisional Round | 7-9 | Lost 22-14 vs. Cleveland | 6-10 | Lost 24-19 vs. Tennessee
2005 | Stop | S | Lost Divisional Round | 2-14 | Lost 20-17 vs. San Francisco | 5-11 | Lost 35-21 vs. Pittsburgh
2013 | Straight into Love | S | Lost Divisional Round | 2-14 | Lost 16-10 vs. Tennessee | 7-9 | Lost 14-13 vs. Minnesota

This year, Slovenia sent the song “Sebi”, which featured an incredibly creepy performance that still makes me uncomfortable even after sleeping on it for a day. Because of this, the Colts will make the playoffs, while the Texans will lose their week 17 game to the Titans, and the Lions will lose their week 17 game to the Packers.

---

Spain has sent an artist starting with the letter “M” five times. All five times, the Minnesota Vikings made it to the playoffs

Year | Spain Artist | First Letter of First Name | Vikings Playoff Result
--- | --- | --- | ---
1968 | Massiel | M | Lost Conference Championship
1977 | Micky | M | Lost NFC Championship
1997 | Marcos Llunas | M | Lost Divisional Round
1998 | Mikel Herzog | M | Lost NFC Championship
2017 | Manel Navarro | M | Lost NFC Championship

This year, Spain sent an artist named Miki to perform the song “La venda.” Spain’s been garbage at Eurovision lately, finishing outside the top 20 in each of the past five competitions. However, because the artist’s name is Miki, the advantage goes to the Vikings, as they will make the playoffs if history holds up.

---

And finally, the United Kingdom has sent one artist starting with the letter “M” four times. All four times, both the Jets and the Bears finished the season with a losing record, while the Bears also finish behind the Packers in the division standings.

Year | United Kingdom Artist | First Letter of First Name | Jets Record | Bears Record | Packers Placement | Bears Placement
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1964 | Matt Monro | M | 5-8-1 | 5-9 | 2nd place | 6th place
1970 | Mary Hopkin | M | 4-10 | 6-8 | 3rd place | 4th place
1992 | Michael Ball | M | 4-12 | 5-11 | 2nd place | 4th place
2014 | Molly | M | 4-12 | 5-11 | 1st place | 4th place

Note that in 1977, the United Kingdom sent Mike Moran to sing “Rock Bottom,” but sent Lynsey de Paul alongside him; this stat only focuses on the UK sending one artist.

---

**What Does This Mean?**

It can be tough to keep track of all of that, so what do all of these stats mean when put together? Let’s go division by division. Note that if two stats contradict each other, I’m going to exclude them from the list.

**AFC East:** Patriots win the AFC East, win a playoff game, beat the Chiefs in week 14, the Bills in week 16, and the Dolphins in week 17. Dolphins finish the season with a winning record. 

**AFC North:** Steelers finish with a winning record and win the AFC North. Bengals finish with a losing record.

**AFC South:** Colts make the playoffs and beat the Jaguars in week 17. Titans make the playoffs and beat the Texans in week 17. Texans finish with a losing record

**AFC West:** Chiefs make the playoffs but fail to win a playoff game. Broncos beat the Raiders in week 17. Broncos finish ahead of the Raiders in the standings. Chiefs beat the Chargers in week 17

**NFC East:** NY Giants beat Philadelphia in week 17. Philadelphia makes the playoffs. Washington finishes with a winning record. Dallas makes the playoffs with a winning record and win exactly one game in the playoffs.

**NFC North:** Vikings make the playoffs, beat the Bears in week 17, and finish ahead of the Bears in the standings. Packers beat the Lions in week 17. Bears finish with a losing record. Lions finish with a losing record.

**NFC South:** Panthers beat the Saints in week 17

**NFC West:** Cardinals finish with a losing record. Seahawks finish with a winning record.

**General:** A city that has never won the Super Bowl before will win Super Bowl LIV (BUF, HOU, JAX, TEN, CIN, CLE, ATL, CAR, DET, MIN, or ARZ). The #1 seed in the AFC will come out of the AFC East and make the Super Bowl.

*- note that the Jets can’t finish second in the AFC East if the Patriots win the division and the Dolphins finish the season with a winning record due to the United Kingdom stat

---

Will these stats be right? I don’t know. I correctly predicted last year that the Packers would tie a game based off of this, so that has to count for something. However, regardless of what winds up happening with these stats when the 2019 season plays out, I’ll leave you with [my favorite song from the 2019 contest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5arNtTYK1s).

SymbaSweet,2019-05-02 11:36:22+00:00,Entitled Mom stalks me through the grocery store for my bag,"So, this happened a couple days ago and the more I think about it the more disturbed I get.

For some backstory: I'm a huge musical theater nerd and a few years ago I got to see Phantom of the Opera in Seattle, and as a souvenir I bought a tote bag with the play's logo printed all over it that I am still very fond of. Now the show is playing in a theater in my area and there's been a lot of local buzz about it. I went to see it this weekend and decided to carry my Phantom tote for a while since my love of the show has been bolstered and the bag is a great conversation starter for other theater nerds I may meet in public who recognize the show that my bag references. 

Now let's set the stage: a couple days ago I went to the grocery store near my apartment to stock up on some pretty standard foodstuffs, and when I walked in I saw a cashier I'm friendly with working the self checkout kiosk so I stopped to talk to him a few minutes. My bag was hanging over my shoulder, within clear view of the doors. After a couple minutes into my chat I felt a tap on my shoulder, so I turned around to address whoever was trying to get my attention and found a relatively normal looking woman (average size, normal clothing, normal hairstyle). Nothing to indicate this woman was a Karen type in any way.

EM: Is that the Phantom of the Opera on your bag?

Me: (happy to chat about one of my favorite musicals) Yeah! Do you like the show?

EM: It's fine, I took my daughter last weekend to see it at [local theater]. She loves musicals. 

Me: Me too! I thought it was a really great show! The cast did a really great job and-

EM: (cutting me off) Did you buy that bag there? I didn't see that bag at any of the booths.

Me: Actually, I got this in Seattle when I saw the show a few years ago.

EM: Oh. Because there really weren't any souvenirs at the show my daughter liked. She would LOVE that bag. (Looks at me expectantly.)

Me: Um... (realizing what she wants) I'm sorry your daughter didn't find any keepsakes she wanted?

EM: She was SO disappointed she didn't have anything to remember the show by. She would LOVE your bag. LOVE it.

Me: Well, I know I LOVE this bag. I hope the next time your daughter sees a show she finds a souvenir she likes. (I'm pretty nervous at this point because I'm very non-confrontational and I've read plenty on this subreddit to know entitled parents like causing scenes. I gripped my bag very tightly, trying to hold it against my body with my elbow and with both hands tightly on the straps). I've got to go do my shopping now. Excuse me. 

(To my pleasant surprise, she didn't say anything else so I really thought I'd gotten away without any crazy happening. I grabbed a basket and went to the cereal aisle. As I'm putting cheerios into my basket EM also enters the aisle. She doesn't have a cart or a basket, and she doesn't try to approach me again. Instead she just stares at me. I decide to try and ignore her and go about business as usual, grabbing the things on my shopping list. Every aisle I go to she follows me into. Every. Single. One. Just staring at me. I'm certain she was just waiting for me to let my guard down.)

(I go through self checkout and she hangs by the discount bread rack nearby, still watching. Knowing she's probably not going to give this up when I leave the store I flag down my acquaintance working the self checkout kiosk and tell him I'm pretty sure that EM is going to follow me to my car. He's wary of her and walks me and my purchases out to the parking lot and doesn't leave until my bags are loaded and I'm in my car with my doors locked. I was still keeping an eye on EM and sure enough she left the store when I did, watching me as I got to my car. I saw her get into her own car, still watching me. My acquaintance who walked me out went back to the store, and I was left alone in my vehicle caught in an awkward staring match with EM, also in her car. She didn't even try to hide the fact she was watching me.)

(It dawned on me that EM was likely to follow me home, so instead of taking my usual exit that would take me back to my apartment I drove over to the exit that turned off onto the more major street. EM followed me like I expected. I sat there for a couple minutes at least, waiting.)

(See, there's an intersection at the corner of the grocery store with really long light times, so cars end up lining up a fair amount. I waited until the last possible second until that light turned green and unleashed a wave of cars, turning right just before they hit, leaving EM stranded to wait for them to pass if she wanted to follow me. I drove up the street and got on the highway, then took the exit for the next neighborhood over and took the back way to my apartment. My car is pretty noticeable - it's bright orange - and I didn't want to take any chances that EM may recognize my car by going back the way I came. It seems I successfully ditched her, because no one has come banging on my door demanding I give them my Phantom tote. Needless to say I will be leaving that bag at home from now on.)

TL;DR: Entitled mom stalked me through a grocery store and almost followed me home because I didn't want to give her my tote that she wanted for her daughter.",entitledparents,8701

We decided to drive up last Friday to visit Vancouver, since neither of us had been to Canada before. We got really lucky, because the weather was perfect that day.

When we finally crossed the border and drove for about 40 minutes, it was interesting to be in British Columbia. I thought Canada would be like the U.S. just more polite, but to my pleasant surprise Canada actually felt like visiting a truly foreign country (where everyone happens to speak english). Your roads are nicer, your streets are cleaner, you buildings were cozier and well maintained, and everyone we met was super friendly. 

Anyway, my jaw dropped when we crossed the bridge over the river. You could see the skyline; tons of sleek, glass skyscrapers, cranes over the harbor, seagulls flying against the wind, all with a backdrop of towering mountains. I almost crashed steering into the oncoming lane because I was distracted by the view.

We went to eat some place, went to try Tim Hortons, and just a few hours before the sun was suppose to set we decided to drive downtown and see Stanley Park. As we did so it felt like anywhere you turned you'd see one of 3 things; beautiful houses/skyscrapers, mountains, or waterfront. 

We got lucky and were able to snag a parking meter downtown, walked to the marina and stanley park, and watched the sunset from what I think was either second or third beach but I'm not sure. It was so calming to just see all the cargo boats resting in the harbor and the orange sun behind them. Then when it was dark we walked back downtown and got some Pho before driving home.

I'm so fucking jealous of Canada. Like, I thought Portland and Seattle were nice, but Vancouver actually felt like a dream. It's not fair you guys have such a beautiful city. 

Anyway, just wanted to send some love your way. &lt;3 It was the first time I've ever been to Canada before, and it was a wonderful time.",vancouver,1954

Her mother is wonderful, but her dad is a screwball. She knows how I feel and is thankfully very understanding and keeps him and my interactions to a minimum.

However, last week I moved into my first apartment in Seattle and my girlfriend brought her parents over for dinner. When I served plates of salmon and potatoes that I was very proud of, her father proclaimed after barely taking a bite that it was “tasteless and embarrassing”. He then demanded some hot sauce.

I happen to be sort of an odd collector and like to keep the extremes of different things. I have Black Insomnia Coffee (The world’s strongest coffee), Spirytus Rektyfikowany (96% alcohol), and most importantly Mad Dog 357, which is the strongest hot sauce you can buy. The Scoville scale rates food spiciness, and for reference The Carolina Reaper is 1.56 million SHU. The Mad Dog is 9 million SHU!

So here is the proceeding conversation:

Me: “Sorry the only one I have is way too hot”

Dickhead: “I’m not like you, I can handle it. Bring it here.”

Me: “No, I mean it’s actually – “

Dickhead: “Just bring me the fucking sauce so I can stomach this food.”

Me: \*malicious compliance activated\* “Sure! I’ll get it for you.”

Dickhead then douses one of his potatoes in it and smugly takes a bite. The kick hits him almost immediately and without saying anything he gets up to go into the fridge. It is very clear he is in pain but is trying to hide it. 

GF: \*she understood what was going on\* Are you alright dad?

He was obviously looking for milk in the fridge and here is the kicker: I’m lactose intolerant! There is no milk in my apartment. Without saying anything he collected his belongings and left.

GF and I had a good laugh explaining what had happened to her mom, and we enjoyed the good food I made in peace.",MaliciousCompliance,17183

As a child, I grew up constantly hearing of harrowing personal accounts from family friends who were carjacked and robbed at gun point. The government would run advertisements on television advising people to not stop for traffic lights at night unless absolutely necessary. The flats we lived in had 3 levels of security - a spiked metal fence for the complex, steel reinforced doors for the unit, and another layer of steel reinforced doors to go upstairs where the bedrooms were.

The straw that broke the camel's back was when one of our close family friends who was the founder of a Chinese-language newspaper was fatally shot in his own home during an intrusion.

My mother decided to take a leap of faith and bring me and my sister to the United States on an H-1B visa paying a meager wage. We were evicted from my aunt's house after 3 months, and another relative took us in until my mother could afford our own apartment.

9 years in the Marine Corps and an MBA later, I decided to tackle an issue that I am deeply passionate about and started a company that develops AI software to automatically identify gun threats.

coole106,2019-04-11 16:06:57+00:00,Living within a budget is incredibly liberating,"I have been living by a strict budget for the last few months, and I must say, it is very liberating.

&amp;#x200B;

A little background: I am 28 and married with a 1 1/2 year old. My wife used to work, but now she stays home with the child, so she brings in no income. Almost 2 years ago, we moved from Seattle to a much lower cost of living area in Arizona. We sold our house in Seattle and made a ton of money on it and moved to Arizona to live near family and so that I could go to work for the family company. My salary roughly stayed the same, but my wife's went away completely. We rented a place from my parents for a while, but last Spring we bought a house and spent about 6 months renovating. We had a good chunk of money from selling our house and from a 401k loan, and we used that money as a down payment and for renovations. Our attitude was that it would be very difficult to do renovations while living in the house, so we wanted to get everything done before moving in. At the time, we weren't living on a budget, so we didn't have a good idea of what we were spending vs saving. The cost of living is much lower where we are now, but we had the baby which meant one more set of expenses. Also, my wife's body had changed some from the pregnancy and she was feeling bored from no longer having a job, so she was doing a lot of shopping, especially for clothing. By November, our money ran out completely. We even blew through our emergency fund. And we still had a little over $1000 owed to the contractor. We had more credit card debt than cash, and I had never in my life paid any interest on any of my credit cards. We got lucky over the next month that I'd get a paycheck right before one of the credit card payment was due. However, even though my wife and I tried to cut back, we still were spending more than I was making. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mid-December, I knew that a change was needed. I created a budget. I had tried it before, but it had been too difficult to predict everything for the month and it only ever lasted a couple of months. This time, I tried something different. I have all of my monthly, automatic expenses listed first. Those are predictable, so that was easy. In this category I even added things that happen less than once a month, but I divide by the number of months and use that number. For instance, I take my Prime membership fee and divide by 12, and put that number in each month. Then, I added categories that are more variable but I have to spend money on every month. To this I added groceries and utilities. For these, instead of putting a ""limit"", I tried to predict what it was likely to be. Then, I added a line for what I want to save/invest every month. It would go towards my emergency fund first until that was full, then go towards paying off the 401k loan, and then towards other investing. Last, I took what was left and set that aside for what my wife and I call ""discretionary"". True discretionary spending is part of that. That includes eating at restaurants, buying alcohol, buying decorations or clothing, etc. It also includes more irregular spending that isn't a consistent amount and doesn't happen in consistent intervals, such as Dr. visits. I track my budget using spreadsheets, and tally up my spending using Mint.com.

&amp;#x200B;

We've only been doing this for a few months now, but I feel so much more free now than when I wasn't on a budget. We bought a couch and a Peloton using interest free financing. The money to pay those bills comes out of discretionary, which forces us to spend a little less on other things. Without a budget, I would have said ""Hell no!"" to both. My wife and I can confidently buy things that we really want or need without feeling like we're spending too much. Many people think of a budget and think that it will make them feel restricted. However, I find that it's the exact opposite. We stop and think about things before making purchases now, and decide whether it's really worth it. We eat out a whole lot less, because we were able to see how much that was setting us back. However, when we do decide to spend our money, we do it confidently and without any guilt. It really is great, and I don't ever plan on stopping.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Due to major life changes, my wife and I completely ran out of money. I started budgeting, and now we feel so much more free than before.",personalfinance,1583

DanielFree,2019-04-08 16:30:50+00:00,"7 years of van dwelling; 7 lessons, facts, and observations","Note: I had a former Reddit profile that I deleted a couple years ago. I wasn’t expecting the traffic, attention, and inquiries to my website and videos; all of which kind of defeated the purpose of breaking away from the rat race. I bought my 1990 Chevy G20 Van in 2012 and have lived in it since. It had 155,000 miles on it then; today it has close to 240,000 and runs like new. Basically I spend $1,000 per year on repairs and maintenance to keep it running perfectly; all work done by the same mechanic. I make at least $1,500 per month from my content marketing and paralegal/doc prep endeavors, which is more than enough to live comfortably and with extras. Now for those just now getting into van dwelling, here are 7 things I’ve learned over the years.

&amp;#x200B;

Big City Dwelling Sucks

&amp;#x200B;

I’m currently on BLM land in Nevada and been in the same spot for a few weeks. BLM typically allows 14 day stays, but I’ve never seen a ranger or cop enforce this in California, Nevada, Arizona, Oregon, or any other state with BLM land. A five gallon gas can for generator and in the winter, two 20-pound propane cylinders (yes I’ve ran a standard Mr. Heater in my van for seven years while sleeping and am still alive), is more than enough when you have solar to get you through a month with adequate power and heat.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve “lived” in several cities, including San Diego, various Orange County cities, Oceanside, Las Vegas, Pueblo, CO; Evergreen, CO; Phoenix, Tucson, Eugene, OR; Seattle, and Butte, Montana, and Casper, WY. The smaller the city, the better. But one, its terrible driving in traffic. There’s also the possibility of both cops and homeless people knocking on your windows at night. There was a time in Oceanside that some overprivileged punk knocked on my windows and asked me if I had drugs to sell??? Orange County, particularly Huntington Beach and Costa Mesa, are places I would avoid. Both are annoying with few places to park. There's NOWHERE to park in Irvine. Plus you can’t run a generator when necessary in cities. 

&amp;#x200B;

I prefer living at truck stops: Love’s, Petro/TA, Flying J’s, etc. You’re SUPPOSED to be at those places and you fit right in. BLM land is also preferred. Plus I use Love’s rewards and get yearly access to their Wifi, which works outside well, for like $60 per year and can use it at all locations.

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of Truck Stops

&amp;#x200B;

Once upon a time, there were truck stops called Pilot Flying J’s. Today there are Pilots and there are Flying J’s. Pilots ARE NOT truck stops. They are gas stations and typically do not allow overnight parking. The one’s near cities, expect rude employees that will come knocking on your van a few hours after you park (particularly in Las Vegas). Stick to Flying J’s. Petro and TA are apparently the same company now. Petro is always welcoming and cool (I stayed at the one near Kingman, AZ for like a week last year). TA is fine as long as its in the middle of nowhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Walmart Myth

&amp;#x200B;

I haven’t parked at a Walmart overnight in over two years. Its just too hit-and-miss. Its best to find an industrial area and park on the street if you’re forced to stay in a city (just make sure there are no ""sleeping in cars"" laws). There was one day about three years ago in Colorado Springs when cops were called and cleared out all the RVs and vans parked at a Walmart there. It also happened in Henderson, NV. Its just not worth the BS. The only Walmart I always park at is Flagstaff, AZ. 

&amp;#x200B;

Rest Stops are awesome

&amp;#x200B;

These are the go-to spots when you just don’t feel like driving. Some have signs that say 8 hour parking, especially in California. Don’t worry about it. I’ve stayed at rest stops for week-long intervals without issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

Loneliness Hurts

&amp;#x200B;

Its the trade off. In 2011, my monthly living expenses were over $2,800 in a condo and car payment. If I’m driving around a lot and/or in the summer (when AC/generator is needed more), my expenses have been no higher than $1,100 per month, with gas and food being the biggest expenses. If I’m camping out somewhere, expenses are less than $700 per month. I just figure $85 per month for van maintenance, which add up to about $1,000 per year. Then I go to my mechanic whenever I’m in that particular city. Gym membership, insurance, storage, mailbox, phone/internet are the only other monthly expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve met a lot of people over the years. Had/have a relationship with a woman who van dwells too. Funny we met at a rest stop in Oklahoma. Whenever we cross paths, we hang out, do our thing. But she hangs around the southern states; I hang out west. Haven’t seen her since early 2018. There are few women solo vandwelling and frankly, those are the only women who will talk to a guy living in a van. Otherwise I don’t use social media or talk to many people, so lots of exploring, reading and writing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Wind Sucks

&amp;#x200B;

Those with tall vans know this too well. Its particularly bad when driving through mountain ranges with gusty winds. Your van will be thrown around like a rag doll. Hands on 10 and 2, and hold on tight. Driving through Colorado on I-70 is a pain too. Going up those steep inclines, the van won't go much faster than 25 mph.

&amp;#x200B;

Can’t go back to the old life

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve tried. Last year, I rented a place in Palm Springs because it was so hot and I didn’t feel like driving 250+ miles to the nearest mountains for cooler weather. But I found myself hanging around one room and never bought any furniture. I stayed there for two months and got back on the road. Guess I am what I am now.",vandwellers,1043

&amp;#x200B;

It's your humble IT deity back with another tale as requested.

&amp;#x200B;

This tale takes place when I was with large company with remote offices around the world.  We did game testing and ran call centers.  While some of my most interesting things came out of the game testing, the remote offices were... special.  Some of them were merely on corporate campuses, such as our offices in Microsoft.  

&amp;#x200B;

Others were more remote.  Our Hyderabad office took so long to set up we had a betting pool on when the PM would be making it back.  Others, like our London office, were so random that we strongly considered firing everyone in IT there and just using trained mice.

&amp;#x200B;

Fargo... Fargo, held a special place for all of us though.

&amp;#x200B;

As a general rule, we tried to have as few ""pets"" as possible.  Pets being systems that were extremely unique and requiring lots of attention.  The opposite of that would be herd systems.  If a machine in the herd dies, you just chop up its carcass and spin up another.  You do that with the family dog and people tend to get upset.  (The analogy breaks down here but I trust you get my point.)

&amp;#x200B;

This particular pet was the badge reader system that was nothing like our other standardized systems.

&amp;#x200B;

Every now and then it just needed a good shove.  Facilities saw nothing wrong with this as they had their people there to always reboot the machine.  We in IT felt somewhat differently though.

&amp;#x200B;

The inevitable event happened.

&amp;#x200B;

It wanted a reboot but none of the people there felt comfortable touching the system and no amount of cajoling, pleading, and outright threatening could get anyone to simply push the button.

&amp;#x200B;

It was then I came into the office that day as others had started their shifts around 6AM.

&amp;#x200B;

Your cast:

DJ - DadJoke, an older systems admin but one of my juniors.  A pretty good guy.

G - Genghis, my manager, one of the coolest managers I've ever had and would work for again in a heatbeat.

Me - your humble IT Deity

&amp;#x200B;

DJ - Fargo is down hard with no one able to get in.

G - This is getting a lot of attention, we might have to send someone out there.

Me - Did anyone look to see if there's iLO or something like that we can use to just bounce the box?

DJ - Nope, this is running on just a desktop with a cheap UPS, not a managed PDU.

G - u/unfeignedship you up for a quick trip.

Me - Seattle to Fargo isn't a quick trip... you're not still pissed about when I said you had a Cmdr Riker haircut are you...

G - Nah, your pay cut made up for that.  But if we can't get people in the office they can't do payroll which would be a big deal and we incur fees every time we call the office management to unlock the door.

Me - Did anyone scan the box from the utility box on-site to see if there's anything we can do?

DJ - RPC crashed, so no RDP.

Me - Yes, but did you scan it?

G - We can check if remote desktop is working...

&amp;#x200B;

I quickly drop nmap on the utility box and see that it's running Windows 2000 and even better an older version of SQL 2005.

Prior to SQL 2005 SP4 there was an extended procedure called *xp\_cmdshell* that was one of the easiest ways to compromise a server running SQL.  It allowed you to execute command line tasks in the context that SQL server was running.  So if it was running as System, then you could add users to the machine or all sorts of nastiness.

&amp;#x200B;

I quickly check if we have the sa account for this box and we do.

&amp;#x200B;

Ten minutes later...

*EXEC master..xp\_cmdshell 'shutdown -t0 -r -f'*

&amp;#x200B;

Me - I just rebooted the server.

DJ/G - How?!

&amp;#x200B;

And that's how I used a SQL vulnerability to save a long and boring flight.

pancreasss,2019-04-01 17:12:11+00:00,"Abusive spouse attempts to commit bigamy after putting me through hell, revenge commences. (OC from Nuclear Revenge)","TL;DR at end.

I’m the same person who wrote about destroying my DS ex’s world after he mentally/emotionally abused them, was chronically unfaithful, cheated while they were across the world, and then publicly dumped them on Facebook.

This is about the spouse that I married on that fateful visit by DS.

Now, when I met Cunt Face (hereto known as CF), he was ideal. He was what I thought I needed. I believed I loved him and that the fairytale was real. We met by random chance, both many hours from our homes - me whilst running away from a situation at home, he while a planned trip abroad. 

I ended up in Europe within a month and we married about 10 months later. All good, right? Well... it was. Until I started racking up multiple university degrees with honours and he began to realise that not only was I significantly younger (about 17 years), thinner (a big issue in his mind, not in mind at all), and (according to him) better looking - I was now significantly better educated. He was always a bit insecure, but the degrees seemed to really push him over the edge.

While I was waiting for my spousal visa, things were falling apart. We both kind of gave up but decided to resolve to save our relationship. I moved and found that nothing he had promised to prepare had happened. The home situation was a mess. We were living with his quite elderly widower father and he was meant to be taking care of him and the household. None of this was happening. Instead, both CF and his disgusting sister (now known as Ugly Fuck or UF) were essentially living as leeches off of their 80-something father.

I tried to make things work. But within a week and a half of me landing, he threw an iPad at my head and punched the wall next to my head whilst screaming that he could have me deported at will. Okay. Well, fine. I made a promise. I kept trying. It got worse. I took months of emotional abuse, insults, threats, cursing, and everything else short of him actually laying hands on me.

Six months later, he randomly disappeared for two weeks to visit Seattle without mentioning it to me. I left. I started over with nothing much to my name but a job and a bit of money thousands of kilometres from anyone I knew. He expected me to run home. I didn’t falter. I blossomed.

About a year later, I met my present partner who has been the truest and most loyal partner I could’ve wished for. Truly, if I had to do it all again I would if I knew my partner would be on the other side.

Now for my revenge. 

I happened to find out that he had a new girlfriend that seemed very serious and noticed she had mentioned wedding planning on social media. (You have to keep tabs on your abusers, especially when your safety is at risk.) Now, she’s welcome to him - the only issue is, due to draconian divorce laws in my current country, we were not divorced yet. He planned on marrying her in another country. 

When we met, he told me he had never been married. I later found out he was indeed divorced. I was willing to bet he fed her the same exact lie.

So, I sent her a message. My suspicions were confirmed. He told her he had NEVER been married. I was wife number *two*. She didn’t want to believe it until I sent her a photo of our marriage license as well as a few wedding photos.

I did feel really badly about doing that to her because I could tell how hurt she was, but I knew it was better for her to know the truth than to inadvertently marry him the *next month* in Seattle as they had planned. She had children. She had a violent ex husband. She and I actually ended the conversation on a positive note with her thanking me and me apologising and explaining why I felt I had to tell her.

And then the fallout.

My phone started blowing the fuck up. Unknown number. In the evening. Hmmm. Wonder who that might be?

I was out enjoying a lovely dinner with my partner and answered a call on speaker. In came the usual threats to my person and security, blah blah blah. I could only laugh. He didn’t know where I was, nor was he getting past my partner. I could finally relax knowing I was safe, after months of night terrors.

And then...

“I HAVE LOST THE LOVE OF MY LIFE BECAUSE OF YOU! SHE HAS LEFT ME AND THROWN ALL OF MY THINGS OUT OF HER HOME!”

People, I lost it. I could. Not. Stop. Laughing. It was poetic. 

He sent a similar email to my mother laced with blatant lies about me (as if she didn’t know the play by play as it was happening and as if she’d believe a word he had to say anyway). 

After I got done laughing, I hung up on him and had my number changed. 

Then... I remembered his sister (UF) was living at the same home.

UF has a disabled daughter that lives 200km away that she claims benefits for, including an apartment and money allowances. She then sublets the handicap accessible apartment to her boyfriend illegally whilst leeching off of her father. She’s also a thief (caught on hidden camera literally taking notes out of CF’s wallet). CF and UF absolutely despise each other and are only both living there in hopes of driving the other out in order to get the house as inheritance.

Now, if UF got reported to the council for fraud and they did minimal investigation, they’d see she was falsely claiming benefits for an adult daughter who lived far away and had her own benefits (deserved) from another council. She would lose her apartment and possibly face jail time. If she lost her apartment, it was certain she would NEVER leave the father’s home. It was CF’s worst nightmare.

So, I made it happen.

Besides, how dare UF claim money she isn’t entitled to simply due to her being too lazy to work? She was a neglectful mother when she was actually caring for her kid (leaving her kid in a wheelchair with a jam sandwich and running to the pub the moment benefit money came in), now she was lying and keeping a rare accessible apartment from someone who truly needs it.

That more than justified it. 

But the thought of both of them being stuck in the same house, fighting all day and night, both too lazy to leave and too stubborn to give up the inheritance they fantasise about? That’s a lovely thought to me.

What makes it better? Knowing he cried his eyes out over his lost fiancée in that very same house, soaking in his miserable existence. 

Sorry it was long!

TL;DR: Husband turned into controlling, abusive, insecure asshole. Endured 6 months of abuse before escape. Found out he was planning to marry again before we were divorced by marrying in a different country, so told his “fiancée” the truth and got him dumped. Reported his hated sister to council for benefits fraud so they are both stuck living together in same household waiting on father to die for inheritance.

JaguarGator9,2019-03-26 11:49:59+00:00,"[OC] How concerning is it if a QB has a bad game in their final season of college? Why ""9 points scored"" is a magic number for draft-eligible QBs","Every year, I ask the question of whether or not there’s a way to weed out prospects of the NFL Draft based on a magic number. This is a number that, while not guaranteeing success, is designed to all but guarantee someone’s failure in the league. And I’ve done this in the past few years. It started with [the 58.5% magic number for QBs](https://en.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/65zs0w/oc_why_585_is_the_magic_number_for_qbs_in_the_nfl/?st=jtonn9nz&amp;sh=406c7528), which states that any QB that completed 58.5% of their passes or less, then their odds of succeeding in the NFL were fairly slim. I did it last year with [QBs that averaged 7.3 yards per attempt or less[(https://en.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/87hr26/oc_why_73_ypa_is_the_magic_number_for_qbs_in_the/?st=jtonofkc&amp;sh=5e48ec87), which states that any QB that fell below this threshold had a slim chance of succeeding in the NFL.

This year, I’m continuing on that analysis, and I’ve found some magic numbers not just for QBs, but this year, for wide receivers. The goal is to do one post a week, every Tuesday morning leading up to the draft, where I break down one of these numbers. And the premise for this one is bad games.

As Daniel Powter once said, [“you had a bad day.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH476CxJxfg). As Hannah Montana once said, [“everybody makes mistakes”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t93u0qg5q_M), and nobody’s perfect. To expect a QB to be great for every single game in college is somewhat unreasonable. Obviously, if a QB has a bunch of bad games, odds are, they’re just bad. Tom Jackson always said on NFL Primetime that once is an accident, twice is a trend, and three times is a problem.

But what if a QB has a game that’s so horribly bad? What about a QB having a game where the offense is unable to score anything, and a game where the offense gets held without a touchdown? Is that a sign for concern in the NFL? That’s what this magic number is going to be taking a look at.

**Part I: The Formula**

I looked at every QB to get drafted since the 2001 NFL Draft. Why did I set the cutoff at this date? It wasn’t because of some arbitrary cutoff or because there was a guy in 2000 that disproved this point completely. It was because College Reference (which is what I used for game logs of these quarterbacks) does not have any game logs for college prior to the 2000 season. This means I have no way of knowing if a QB played in that game or not; maybe they were hurt or suspended. 

As an example to prove this point, in 2009, Oklahoma had a game against Nebraska where they lost 10-3. However, I know that Sam Bradford didn’t play in that game, because he was injured for practically that entire season, and [his game log does not show that game](https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/sam-bradford-1/gamelog/2009/). If this game took place in 1999 and not 2009, however, I would have no idea of whether or not he played. I tried going beyond this and finding game logs of quarterbacks from other websites from prior to 2000, but the data was spotty at best. However, there is a fairly large sample size here, so this shouldn’t be too much of an issue.

With all of that being said, the number that I settled upon was 9 points. Simply put, if a team scored 9 points or less in a game against an unranked opponent, I took a look at the QB and put them on the list. If this occurred, then in all likelihood, that QB will not be good in the NFL.

I took a look at a few things when creating the list:

- I only took a look at a QB during their final season in college. If a QB’s team had a stinker of a game when that QB was a junior, but didn’t have one as a senior, then I didn’t take a look at it. It had to be that player’s final season

- The QB had to start the game. I’m not holding a QB accountable for a team’s poor offensive performance if that QB wasn’t playing for most of the game anyway.

- The 9 points or less had to occur against an unranked opponent. They had to be ranked outside the AP Top 25 at the time of the game. I’m not holding an offense accountable if they lay an egg against Alabama, where practically every single player on their starting defense will go to the NFL. If they lay an egg against Wyoming, however, that’s a different story (no offense, Cowboys)

- I only looked at QBs at the FBS (I-A) level, just because the further back you go with stats at the FCS (I-AA) level and lower, the less you’re able to find, especially when it comes to game logs

- And finally, the QB had to throw more than 1 pass in the game to qualify. The reason for this comes in the 2017 Gasparilla Bowl with Florida International starting quarterback Alex McGough. In that game, FIU scored just 3 points against an unranked Temple. However, McGough went 1-for-1 and then broke his collarbone, not playing the rest of the way. It would be cruel to hold that against him, since any reasonable person can see that FIU scoring only 3 points is not McGough’s fault. Therefore, the “had to throw multiple passes” rule was put in place.

So, with that being said, what 21st century QBs fit this criteria?

**Part II: The Historic List**

Again, I’m only looking at teams to score less than 10 points in any game during a starting QB’s final season against an unranked opponent. If a QB from 2017 or 2018 is on the list, I’m only going to say that the pick was a bust if that player is no longer on the team, since it takes three years to truly evaluate a draft and a pick.

**Part III: The Ben Roethlisberger Exception**

~~Ben Roethlisberger is a bust and a horrible teammate that drove away Antonio Brown and nobody attended his 21st birthday party. Thanks for listening to my TED Talk.~~

Obviously, there’s one name that stands out on this list because he clearly does not belong, and it’s Ben Roethlisberger. Everyone else on that list that the jury is out on was either a massive bust, never played a snap, or never reached a status higher than a backup. There’s nobody that you could really argue was any good on that list… except for Roethlisberger, who’s going to be a Hall of Fame quarterback, is 6th all-time in passing yards, and won two Super Bowls and made it to a third. Yet, he’s on this list with guys like JP Losman, Casey Bramlet, DeShone Kizer, and Mike Teel. Something’s not adding up.

And it turns out, there’s a reason for that. In 2003, Miami (OH) started the season against an unranked Iowa team, with the Hawkeyes defeating the RedHawks 21-3. It was an awful game for Ben Roethlisberger; even though he completed 64.3% of his passes, he failed to throw a touchdown pass, and threw four interceptions in the process. This definitely meets the criteria for a game on this list.

But that unranked Iowa team was good… really good. The following week against Buffalo, they allowed just seven points. By the third week of the season, they were ranked inside the top 25, which is something that would last the rest of the season. Against a ranked Arizona State team, they allowed just two points, and held the Sun Devils and an offense led by Andrew Walter (a QB who would later get drafted by the Oakland Raiders in the third round in 2005) to just 184 yards. That Iowa team, as we later found out, deserved to be ranked, and as established in the criteria, a performance like that against a ranked opponent doesn’t count.

When all was said and done at the end of the 2003 season, the Hawkeyes were ranked 8th overall. They were a top 10 team. Of all the QBs on this list, Roethlisberger is the **only one** to play against a team that would end up finishing the season inside the top 10. Here’s a revised list where it shows the final ranking of each team.

Year of Draft | QB | School | Lowest Total | Opponent’s Final Ranking at End of Season
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2018 | Josh Allen | Wyoming | 3 points (vs. Iowa) | Unranked
2018 | Mike White | Western Kentucky | 7 points (vs. Illinois) | Unranked
2018 | Luke Falk | Washington State | 3 points (vs. California) | #19
2018 | Logan Woodside | Toledo | 0 points (vs. Appalachian State) | Unranked
2017 | DeShone Kizer | Notre Dame | 3 points (vs. NC State) | Unranked
2016 | Kevin Hogan | Stanford | 6 points (vs. Northwestern) | #23
2015 | Trevor Siemian | Northwestern | 7 points (vs. Iowa) | Unranked
2013 | Mike Glennon | NC State | 6 points (vs. Virginia) | Unranked
2010 | Dan LeFevour | Central Michigan | 6 points (vs. Arizona) | Unranked
2010 | Joe Webb | UAB | 7 points (vs. Marshall) | Unranked
2010 | Zac Robinson | Oklahoma State | 0 points (vs. Oklahoma) | Unranked
2009 | Mike Teel | Rutgers | 7 points (vs. Fresno State) | Unranked
2008 | Chad Henne | Michigan | 7 points (vs. Oregon) | #23
2008 | Kevin O’Connell | San Diego State | 7 points (vs. Utah) | Unranked
2007 | Trent Edwards | Stanford | 0 points (vs. UCLA) | Unranked
2006 | Charlie Whitehurst | Clemson | 9 points (vs. Georgia Tech) | Unranked
2006 | Brad Smith | Missouri | 3 points (vs. Kansas) | Unranked
2005 | Dan Orlovsky | Connecticut | 7 points (vs. Boston College) | #21
2005 | James Kilian | Tulsa | 0 points (vs. Navy) | #24
**2004** | **Ben Roethlisberger** | **Miami (OH)** | **3 points (vs. Iowa)** | **#8**
2004 | JP Losman | Tulane | 9 points (vs. Memphis) | Unranked
2004 | Luke McCown | Louisiana Tech | 6 points (vs. Fresno State) | Unranked
2004 | Jim Sorgi | Wisconsin | 5 points (vs. UNLV) | Unranked
2004 | Cody Pickett | Washington | 7 points (vs. California) | Unranked
2004 | Matt Mauck | LSU | 7 points (vs. Florida) | #24
2002 | Patrick Ramsey | Tulane | 6 points (vs. Southern Mississippi) | Unranked
2002 | Jeff Kelly | Southern Mississippi | 3 points (vs. UAB) | Unranked
2002 | Ronald Curry | North Carolina | 7 points (vs. Maryland) | #11
2001 | Sage Rosenfels | Iowa State | 7 points (vs. Texas A&amp;M) | Unranked
2001 | Josh Booty | LSU | 3 points (vs. Arkansas) | Unranked

To summarize, if we change the criteria and add in the caveat that if the unranked opponent finished the season inside the top 10, then not only does it eliminate Ben Roethlisberger from the list, but it keeps every other QB on there. Ben Roethlisberger is only on the list because the preseason voters grossly underestimated how the Hawkeyes would do that season.

**Part IV: The Analysis**

If we use the Ben Roethlisberger Exception here, and we exclude the three QBs drafted in 2018 that are still on the roster since the jury is still out on them (Josh Allen with Buffalo, Mike White with Dallas, Danny Etling with New England), there are 28 quarterbacks since the 2001 NFL Draft that meet this bad game criteria. I’d hesitate to call any of those 28 quarterbacks good. While some guys, such as Chad Henne, Sage Rosenfels, and Trevor Siemian were serviceable to an extent, but none of these guys are starter quality.

If you’re just looking at guys taken in the first two rounds of the draft, you’ve got Patrick Ramsey, JP Losman, Chad Henne, and DeShone Kizer. Of the 28 quarterbacks, 10 of them were taken in the seventh round, with 6 of them being taken in the sixth round. One could easily make the argument that the best case scenario when it comes to taking a QB in the sixth and seventh round, unless you’re the Patriots and have voodoo magic powers, is that they become a serviceable backup. However, of those 16 guys, only two of them are QBs that I’d consider to be serviceable backups- Trevor Siemian (round 7 in 2015) and Jim Sorgi (round 6 in 2004).

**Part V: Who to Avoid**

With all of that being said, what QBs at the FBS level meet this criteria? Which ones had horrific games this year against unranked opponents to the point that they are in trouble if this list holds up? For the purposes of this, we’re using the Ben Roethlisberger Exception (where if the opponent in question finished inside the top 10 when the season ended, it doesn’t count), just to be consistent across the board.

QB | School | Game That Meets Criteria
--- | --- | ---
Daniel Jones | Duke | 7 points vs. Wake Forest
Jarrett Stidham | Auburn | 9 points vs. Mississippi State
Clayton Thorson | Northwestern | 7 points vs. Duke
Nick Fitzgerald | Mississippi State | 7 points vs. Kentucky
Brent Stockstill | Middle Tennessee State | 7 points vs. Vanderbilt
Kyle Kempt | Iowa State | 3 points vs. Iowa
Malik Rosier | Miami (FL) | 3 points vs. Wisconsin
Justice Hansen | Arkansas State | 9 points vs. Appalachian State
Christian Chapman | San Diego State | 0 points vs. Ohio*
Gus Ragland | Miami (OH) | 0 points vs. Cincinnati
AJ Erdely | UAB | 3 points vs. Middle Tennessee State

*- Chapman only went 1-for-2 this game

I looked at every QB who [was in this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bu7VCs3ld5efCR3fDjj_vM09KjYbY_SBDkdJHRJPOew/edit?usp=sharing), which is what I use to know who’s in the draft. Some of these guys will likely not get drafted. However, others are projected to go quite high in the draft. There are people that have Daniel Jones of Duke going to the Giants in the first round, yet, he fits this criteria where there are no success stories since start of the 21st century.

**Part VI: Conclusion**

If a QB has a really bad game for his offense where the team struggles to move the ball down the field against an unranked opponent, then it’s probably not the best idea to draft said quarterback. Ben Roethlisberger is the only exception to this rule, but that was a very unique exception where Iowa was one of the best teams in the country and didn’t get the recognition at the start of the season that they deserved. If you include the Ben Roethlisberger Exception in the equation, where opponents that ended up finishing inside the top 10 at the end of the season are discarded from the sample size, then not a single quarterback on the list was a success story at the starter level. There’s a few serviceable backups here and there, but there’s nobody that was even halfway decent as a starting option.

**TL;DR:** Don’t draft QBs that had games where their offense sputtered against unranked opponents

 About this time in 2017 I became another statistic of Seattles rising homeless population, after an illness left me without my job, I was evicted from my fancy Ballard apartment. Myself, my giant Malamute and my little chihuahua mix took up residence near the Target by Pikes Place. I panhandled, and dumpster dived, to survive. My sign simply asked for help getting home to Texas and for food for my dogs. Thankfully my two pups never went without a meal (especially thankful for Seattle dog's of the homeless charity for that)

I made it back to Texas. Im now a mother, in a stable relationship, living in my own home, working, healthy, still with my dogs.

Please dont lose hope or assume all of Seattles homeless are drug addicted criminals. I was drug free, alcohol free, just trying to live. And I made it out. But I wouldn't have been able to if so many kind strangers on the street hadnt been willing to help.  ",Seattle,1192

pancreasss,2019-03-24 20:11:56+00:00,"Trying to commit bigamy? Think again, motherfucker. (Abusive spouse follow up)","I’m the same person who wrote about destroying my DS ex’s world after he mentally/emotionally abused her, was chronically unfaithful, cheated while she was across the world, and then publicly dumped her on Facebook.

This is about the spouse that I married on that fateful visit by DS.

Now, when I met Cunt Face (hereto known as CF), he was ideal. He was what I thought I needed. I believed I loved him and that the fairytale was real. We met by random chance, both many hours from our homes - me whilst running away from a situation at home, he while a planned trip abroad. 

I ended up in Europe within a month and we married about 10 months later. All good, right? Well... it was. Until I started racking up multiple university degrees with honours and he began to realise that not only was I significantly younger (about 17 years), thinner (a big issue in his mind, not in mind at all), and (according to him) better looking - I was now significantly better educated. He was always a bit insecure, but the degrees seemed to really push him over the edge.

While I was waiting for my spousal visa, things were falling apart. We both kind of gave up but decided to resolve to save our relationship. I moved and found that nothing he had promised to prepare had happened. The home situation was a mess. We were living with his quite elderly widower father and he was meant to be taking care of him and the household. None of this was happening. Instead, both CF and his disgusting sister (now known as Ugly Fuck or UF) were essentially living as leeches off of their 80-something father.

I tried to make things work. But within a week and a half of me landing, he threw an iPad at my head and punched the wall next to my head whilst screaming that he could have me deported at will. Okay. Well, fine. I made a promise. I kept trying. It got worse. I took months of emotional abuse, insults, threats, cursing, and everything else short of him actually laying hands on me.

Six months later, he randomly disappeared for two weeks to visit Seattle without mentioning it to me. I left. I started over with nothing much to my name but a job and a bit of money thousands of kilometres from anyone I knew. He expected me to run home. I didn’t falter. I blossomed.

About a year later, I met my present partner who has been the truest and most loyal partner I could’ve wished for. Truly, if I had to do it all again I would if I knew my partner would be on the other side.

Now for my revenge. 

I happened to find out that he had a new girlfriend that seemed very serious and noticed she had mentioned wedding planning on social media. (You have to keep tabs on your abusers, especially when your safety is at risk.) Now, she’s welcome to him - the only issue is, due to draconian divorce laws in my current country, we were not divorced yet. He planned on marrying her in another country. 

When we met, he told me he had never been married. I later found out he was indeed divorced. I was willing to bet he fed her the same exact lie.

So, I sent her a message. My suspicions were confirmed. He told her he had NEVER been married. I was wife number *two*. She didn’t want to believe it until I sent her a photo of our marriage license as well as a few wedding photos.

I did feel really badly about doing that to her because I could tell how hurt she was, but I knew it was better for her to know the truth than to inadvertently marry him the *next month* in Seattle as they had planned. She had children. She had a violent ex husband. She and I actually ended the conversation on a positive note with her thanking me and me apologising and explaining why I felt I had to tell her.

And then the fallout.

My phone started blowing the fuck up. Unknown number. In the evening. Hmmm. Wonder who that might be?

I was out enjoying a lovely dinner with my partner and answered a call on speaker. In came the usual threats to my person and security, blah blah blah. I could only laugh. He didn’t know where I was, nor was he getting past my partner. I could finally relax knowing I was safe, after months of night terrors.

And then...

“I HAVE LOST THE LOVE OF MY LIFE BECAUSE OF YOU! SHE HAS LEFT ME AND THROWN ALL OF MY THINGS OUT OF HER HOME!”

People, I lost it. I could. Not. Stop. Laughing. It was poetic. 

He sent a similar email to my mother laced with blatant lies about me (as if she didn’t know the play by play as it was happening and as if she’d believe a word he had to say anyway). 

After I got done laughing, I hung up on him and had my number changed. 

Then... I remembered his sister (UC) was living at the same home.

UC has a disabled daughter that lives 200km away that she claims benefits for, including an apartment and money allowances. She then sublets the handicap accessible apartment to her boyfriend illegally whilst leeching off of her father. She’s also a thief (caught on hidden camera literally taking notes out of CF’s wallet). CF and UC absolutely despise each other and are only both living there in hopes of driving the other out in order to get the house as inheritance.

Now, if UC got reported to the council for fraud and they did minimal investigation, they’d see she was falsely claiming benefits for an adult daughter who lived far away and had her own benefits (deserved) from another council. She would lose her apartment and possibly face jail time. If she lost her apartment, it was certain she would NEVER leave the father’s home. It was UC’s worst nightmare.

So, I made it happen.

Besides, how dare UC claim money she isn’t entitled to simply due to her being too lazy to work? She was a neglectful mother when she was actually caring for her kid (leaving her kid in a wheelchair with a jam sandwich and running to the pub the moment benefit money came in), now she was lying and keeping a rare accessible apartment from someone who truly needs it.

That more than justified it. 

But the thought of both of them being stuck in the same house, fighting all day and night, both too lazy to leave and too stubborn to give up the inheritance they fantasise about? That’s a lovely thought to me.

What makes it better? Knowing he cried his eyes out over his lost fiancée in that very same house, soaking in his miserable existence.

This is the story of one narrowly missed Darwin Award.

Way back in the days of 2003 I worked a RV dealership chain as their sole systems admin.  This date is relevant to the story. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bob: A service desk manager (who really should have known better)

Mark: A service desk with newly found respect, bordering on worshipful awe, for your humble IT deity

Me: Said humble IT deity.

&amp;#x200B;

I was hanging out in my usual spot, our main office in a place south of Seattle.  Reading up on my hero, the BOFH, and his sidekick, PFY.  When my phone rings with the Island shop ringtone.  (I had different ringtones for different shops so I knew which ones to lob off to my PFY assistant.)

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Hi, this is u/unfeignedship , how can I help you?

Bob: Hey, it's Bob in $location.  Got a quick question.  How much water can my computer have inside of it before I shouldn't turn it on?

Me: ...what?

Bob: You know the fish tank over my desk right?  Well it started leaking over the weekend...

&amp;#x200B;

(At this point it should be noted that our intrepid IT deity was well aware of the tendency for this level of user to call the monitor the computer and the computer the modem.  The IT deity also understood that CRT monitors have obscenely high charges stored within them due to the CRT acting as a massive capacitor requiring special discharge equipment.  What happens is what is frequently referred to euphemistically as a ""physics demonstration"".)

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Bob don't-

Bob: One sec, let me see if it will turn on.

Me: **NOOOOOOO!**  

&amp;#x200B;

At this moment, fate, which had been kind to Bob, by not burning down his office and building decided that Bob needed a lesson, or perhaps should serve as one, and let many coulombs of electrons find a quicker exit to ground that his usual circuit provided.  To this day I don't know why the electrons choose that path, but choose it they did and when they went, they brought a moment of light, magic smoke, and a hell of a bang with them.

In short, a short, provided by a bag of salty water named Bob.

The lights in the shop flickered and the loud bang in the office brought people running.

There was a distinct sound of Bob hitting the floor and the phone handset following him.

(It does trouble the author, our IT deity, that he's heard that sound enough to recognize it.)

  

Me: BOB! Are you okay?

&amp;#x200B;

I hear people entering the office and trying to wake Bob, one of them, Mark, picks up the phone.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Hey, Bob are you okay?

Mark: Who's this?  Bob's on his ass out cold.

Me: It's u/UnfeignedShip in IT.

Mark: Bob's computer exploded... did you do that?

Me: ...maybe.

And thus that's the story of how I made every shop tech and service manager in a dealership chain fear the awesomeness that is I.

I went from min wage to six figures in a year.","There’s a software development bootcamp in Seattle that is tuition free and will guarantee you an internship. You will think this is a scam. I thought so too at first, it’s just to good to be true. But it is. Google Ada Developers Academy and you can read all the testimonials. 

The way it works is companies in the area who are desperate to hire women and minorities (to raise their ratios) sponsor the bootcamp to secure an intern. You can get a loan (regardless of your credit score) backed by Ada for the duration of 6 month class portion for $2,200 a month to live on. Then for the 5 month internship duration they pay you $2,200 a month (equivalent to min wage here). Then you graduate an 98% get a job as software developer. Average salary for last cohort was $115k. Then you start to pay back the loan with a low rate over 4 years. 

Now, the first hard part is getting in. They have like a 10% acceptance rate. But you can do this. And you can pm me for application tips. It is a requisite that you don’t have studies in computer science or previous experience as a developer. They want women and non binary people that truly could not get into the field by themselves. A lot of my classmates did not have any graduate studies, they don’t care about your cv. Just your aptitude and attitude. They measure that with a set of questions you will have to answer based on a huge excel sheet and 4 essays you will write.

The second hard part is getting through it. There are no grades or pass/fail sort of things but you will feel the pressure to keep up with everyone else and the pace is incredibly fast. You will probably cry at some point. You will doubt yourself. But you’ll get through it. Then you will graduate and get that job paying 100k plus 25k bonus. Did you think you were in the clear now? Well now you will feel like an impostor every single day and continue to doubt yourself. But you will keep working hard. You will outwork and outstudy your colleagues who have CS studies and feel entitled to their jobs. Then a year in just as you start feeling like you might be not an impostor, you will get promoted and now you  make 120k + 35k bonus. And on an on. 

It is crazy. But it’s been my life. And although now I am in therapy to overcome my impostor syndrome, at least I can pay for my therapy 🤷‍♀️

Seriously, I’d like to give back and offer any advice I can to any woman out there who knows how to work and study hard and they just need someone to give her a chance. ",povertyfinance,2417

Anyway. I was living in Seattle with my parents in one of those town house complexes (one of those places that's basically just a bunch of houses connected to one another in a row) and my neighbors were good people for the most part. Except for one family. The dad was cool and actually had a head on his shoulders (thank fucking god) the mom and the son however.... 

You all know the lingo. Em = entitled mom. ek = entitled kid. ad = awesome dad. Dad = my dad. me = the goober telling this tale. 

The son is a piece of work he bullied me relentlessly and constantly bugged me and my sister when we were playing. Today my sister was at a friend's so I was playing by myself in the complexes playground when ek shows up. Hes around 13 at the time and hes just coming into puberty I guess and decided to attempt to work his way closer to me. This is where it might get triggering... and honestly this is hard to talk about. This kid tries calling a truce with me and asks to play with me. Swearing on every higher power that he means well. Me being a stupid kid believes him because I just want an excuse to not be bullied. We start monkeying around on the play set that's there and he brings up the idea of a game. Again me being a stupid kid get curious at the idea of a game despite being weary of his past actions. 

A little background about the area surrounding my complex. There's a small wooded area to behind the play area. With three busy streets framing the whole area. Honestly that's the most trees I've ever seen in that concrete jungle. This is the area he proposed his ""game"". We go back to these woods and go I to the thickest part of the trees and he tells me to close my eyes and open my mouth after telling me to get on my knees. 

Yeah..... he did what you think he did. And I bit it.... #HARD! 

Being a kid I didn't like what was suddenly in my mouth and decided to bite it not knowing what had just happened. He screamed and punched my right in the top of the head and knocked me out. I remember being picked up by my dad and brought home and he was PISSED. I had blood going down the side of my head and I was confused about what was happening (info he gave me later) the rest of the story is from information that dad told me. He apparently finished cooking dinner and was calling for me. Knowing I had a history of climbing the nearby trees because again stupid kid he went looking for me and found me bleeding and unconscious. He managed to wake me up and asked .e what happened, to which all i could say was ek's name. 

He brought me home and stormed over to the kids house banging on the door furious that his only son had been hurt not knowing what to expect. This is how the conversation went according to dad. 

Em. What the fuck do you want? I'm tending to my son hes hurt so this had better be good.

Dad. You damn fucking right this is good and I want an explanation as to why my 7 year old was bleeding and unconscious in the woods and saying that your son did it? 

Em clearly pissed to. What in the absolute fuck are you talking about. That animal bit my sons penis! I'd say he got what he deserved! 

Dad growing even more angry and yelling. WHAT IN THE HELL WAS YOUR 13 YEAR OLDS SONS PENIS DOING IN MY 7 YEAR OLDS MOUTH?! 

 Em. Shouldn't I be asking you that you piece of shit? We all watch that little weirdo you call a son playing by himself or with that little shit he calls a sister. We all know that this is something that fucking child would do! 

I'm still confused as to how someone can be this stupid.... 

Me dad was so furious he told her he will be back when hes less pissed so he doesn't cold cock her and end up regretting it and goes home to tend to me. 

An hour later after dad found out I'm fine and don't need to go to the hospital the ad shows up at our door. Hes wondering why his wife is furious and why my dad needed to poof before he knocked a bitch out. He explained what happened and the rest I heard from the living room.

Ad. Why was my Don's penis in your sons mouth?.... that doesn't make sense....

Dad. My thoughts exactly but your wife thinks that it's my 7 year olds fault this happened. Again... 7 YEARS OLD! What 7 year old is thinking about trying that shit?! 

Ad. I think I need to go home and have a chat with my wife and son.

Ad went home and had a screaming match with his wife for 5 hours. Wr could hear it over my Nickelodeon shows 4 houses down. He comes back asking we don't press charges against his son. My dad agrees so long as the kid never bothers me again. Ad agrees and goes home. 

We moved a month later but the family got a divorce and the dad kept the boy. Anyway that's my ep story. And holy fick does that feel good to get off my chest... ",entitledparents,4197

udidubbun,2019-03-09 04:11:44+00:00,"Car rental, but still a front desk DNR smackdown.","Many years ago (late 1990s), I worked in a reservation call center for one of the big rental companies, and our office was in the back of the building near our local airport (Large West Coast city, USA).  


Because we are in the same building as our busiest rental-counter location, we get all of the good pissed-off custy stories as they happened...  


Background info: The world headquarters of a large multi-national company had an EXCELLENT local corporate rate set up with us, because they had a LOT of folks coming in to town to meet at the mothership (corporate HQ) - including a fuckton of people coming in to interview, both new-to-be-hired, lateral promotions and the like. The client company had an in-house travel service, and we gave them their own dedicated line to call in reservations on. We had a great relationship with them, and because we talked so often, an agent could EASILY book 5-10 reservations in under 10 minutes - which was great for our talktimes AND commissions. The head honcho of the Client Company's travel team was a serious go-getter, and all-around cool guy who watched out for his people under him, AND us - we'll call him Tim. His physical office was less than a mile from mine, and Tim and my department head often had lunch together.

&amp;#x200B;

Their monthly rental tab ran to 40K+ USD per month, so they got really special rates, got bumped up whenever possible, and basically treated like they were made of gold (and everyone was always super cool - they knew they had it good and were chill).  


One day, my favorite front desk manager came back to talk story (he was a Samoan guy that grew up in Hawaii) about the latest a-hole customer...  


Apparently, this dude that came in was an employee of our favorite client company, and had been booked for a Lincoln town car. Big, plush, comfortable ride - and the nicest thing in the fleet at the time. He had been told what he was getting, but INSISTED that he was booked for a Porsche - which my company didn't even have in our market - Seattle, Los Angeles and the Bay Area only.  


This set this lovely customer OFF - my Hawaiian buddy said that he was missing the bright red mustache and cowboy hat, but was otherwise a perfect doppelganger of Yosemite Sam. Well, Yosemite Sam decided to have a full-on meltdown in the lobby - with the usual shouts of ""don't you know \*\*WHO\*\* I AM?"" and other things we all love to hear, and eventually making the incredibly nice Latina counter agent cry, and find my buddy for back-up.  


After hearing her side of the story, Hawaiian Buddy (HB) went out to deal with YS, and it went like this.  


HB: ""My counter agent tells me you're not happy - how can I help?""  


YS: ""You can fire the little disrespectful bitch!""  


HB:  ""Excuse me? WHAT?""

&amp;#x200B;

YS: ""I was PROMISED a Porsche! That little whore says you don't have one for me!""

&amp;#x200B;

HB: ""That's right - we don't have Porches for ANYONE, since we don't carry them in this market ::checks rez info:: let's see what you were booked for - looks like you were booked a Lincoln Town Car, and it was booked for you by Tim, at your company's travel department...""  


YS: ""Well, that dumb faggot musta fucked up my rental! I DEMAND you get me a Porsche - or else I am NEVER renting from your company again!""

&amp;#x200B;

Hawaiian Buddy said that, at this point, he was COMPLETELY done with this guy, and it was time to drop the hammer.

&amp;#x200B;

HB: ""You'll NEVER rent from us again? I can help you with that! ::types on keyboard:: Congratulations! You are now on Big Car Rental's GLOBAL 'DO NOT Rent' list - you won't be able to rent one of our cars anywhere on the planet. Oh, and by the way - due to the corporate rate your company has set up with us, you being added to the DNR list automatically sends reports to Client Company's HR office, and the local travel office.  


Have a GREAT day, dick!""

&amp;#x200B;

Hawaiian Buddy said that Yosemite Sam gaped at him like a goldfish for a few moments, and then went outside to grab a cab, with his shoulders slumped.  


Our supervisor had lunch with Tim a few days later, mostly to find out what happened... Dude came into town to get interviewed for a big corporate promotion, with lots of zeroes on his paycheck, relocation to my fair city, company car, huge housing allotment... the works.  


All taken off the table. Offer rescinded. Extensive notes added to his HR folder, and apparently got reviewed and then fired. I guess he had pissed off some other counter agents at a few hotels and car rentals on the company's time before.  

Play asshole games, win asshole prizes!

-------------------------

If you ever want to witness a person receiving the shock of their life, try showing them a bomb during a plane flight.

I watched the stewardess’s face change so fundamentally that I knew she’d never bounce back the same way. 

It only took once glimpse to have this effect, and that’s all I offered her. My copper wire and road flare deception looked real enough, and the shock of the situation drove it firmly home for the poor woman.

I closed the briefcase before she could take in every detail. 

She didn’t see how much of the case I was concealing, or how much I had hidden below the flares. And if all went according to plan, no one ever would. 

Her face had gone paper white. And for the rest of her life, I hope she was remembered for just how cool she remained during an impossible situation. 

“What do you want from us?” she asked in a stark, businesslike tone. 

I tried to swallow, but my throat was too dry. “Two hundred thousand dollars in unmarked, non-sequential bills. Four parachutes will be waiting for us in Seattle. When we arrive, the plane gets enough fuel to fly to Mexico City.” 

She nodded, then got up to leave. 

“Oh, one more thing,” I added quietly. 

She froze. 

“Another bourbon, please. I’m parched.”

She quickly (but not nervously) turned around and headed for the cockpit. 

That’s when I discovered that waiting patiently is the most nerve-racking thing a person can do in a stressful situation. 

Everyone around me was peaceful. Most were families. Nearly all of them were certainly traveling for Thanksgiving the next day. They were either talking quietly or napping. Each person was pleasant and relaxed.

The paranoia started bouncing around in my head then. How could I be the only one who understood that the entire plane had been taken hostage? I felt so fucking alone, because they were in one world while I was in another at the back of the plane, and it was getting way too hot when no one else noticed, hot just like in Saigon during the summer when the plane we were flying came in too low for the landing but we realized too late and all I could do was be grateful that I was in the back of the cabin with the ground coming up too fast in the heat-

I gasped quietly as the overhead speaker crackled to life. I quickly wiped the tears away as the captain spoke.

“Ladies and gentlemen, please be advised that our plans to land in Seattle have been changed.”

I forced myself to be calm. The only way that I could deal with the flashbacks was to force them deeper inside, and I had gotten quite good at it. I did not understand at the time just how profoundly I was damaging myself.

“Due to a minor technical difficulty, our arrival time will be delayed for a few minutes. We apologize, and thank you for choosing Northwest Orient.” The captain signed off without another word.

The crowd murmured quietly. I saw the girl in the blue dress lay her head down on her mother’s lap. Mom gently brushed her untamable frizz, and I found myself thinking of jasmine and flour. 

*I* was causing this. *I* was the reason that these families had now become negotiable hostages. My head spun, and I suddenly wanted out.

No.

*I* was not the reason for this horror. This was squarely the responsibility of a few soulless men who saw my wife as a financial transaction instead of a human being.

‘Well,’ I thought as I pulled a pair of sunglasses from deep inside the briefcase, ‘a hell of a transaction is what they’re about to get.’

The stewardess (I later found out that her name was Florence) came back and sat down next to me. She informed me that everything had been relayed to the appropriate people, and that preparations were being made.

I nodded, then handed her a five-dollar bill. She looked at it like I was offering a particularly large beetle. “What’s that?” she cringed.

I gazed at her in confusion. “I got two drinks.”

That’s when I realized that I wasn’t a customer to her. Not anymore. I was a monster, and monsters don’t play by the rules of normal people. Why wouldn’t I just steal my drinks, given how horrible a person I clearly was?

She took the bill incredulously, and even tried to give me change.

Florence thought I wanted every penny I could steal.

I finished the bourbon in a single gulp.

The next hour was a painful wait. Florence was the consummate professional, keeping me abreast of the situation as she moved back and forth between the pilot and me. A nervous energy buzzed through the passengers.

I watched the landscape below as we circled around Seattle. The sun sets pretty early that time of year, and it wasn’t long before twinkling city lights were the only challenges to the Pacific Northwest darkness.

“We’re ready,” Florence announced as she shattered my thoughts. The flashbacks had been dormant for the moment, but I had learned to accept that they were around every corner and always would be.

I took a deep breath. “Good. Let’s land this plane.”

It was surreal watching the everyone bow to my wishes. All of the window shades were pulled down to hide what was going on inside. We pulled to a far-off, brightly-lit section of the airport so that I *could* see what was happening outside. 

The passengers’ murmurs were shifting toward panic. 

“Why is that truck refueling us?”

“Can we get off?”

“I want to go home!”

I closed my eyes, but the images I found there were worse, so I opened them and focused my attention outside.

My heart stopped. The truck had quit refueling.

Florence sat down next to me. I forced my breathing under control. 

“There’s a problem getting the fuel in. Northwest Orient has requested permission to try a different truck.”

Perhaps they were calling my bluff. If so, there was no card I had left to play.

“That’s fine,” I offered in a voice far too calm for how I felt. 

When the second truck had the same issue, I had basically given up. They were clearly testing my limits. They wanted to see if I was real. Sure, it put a few dozen airline passengers at risk. But would the man sitting atop a huge corporation love $200,000 more than a human being?

*“Please,” my wife had said. “Trust me,” I offered back.*

Yes, these people would certainly roll the dice with a handful of lives when enough money was on the table.

I wondered if they would let me out of prison long enough to say goodbye to my wife before she died.

I knew, of course, that they wouldn’t.

When Florence sat down next to me once more, I was mentally preparing to surrender. 

“A Northwest Orient representative has just delivered the money and parachutes,” she explained calmly. “It’s all on board awaiting your inspection. We would like to know if the passengers are free to go home.”

My controlled exterior masked an internal storm. What was real? When the passengers left the plane, nearly all of my bargaining chips would go out with them. 

I checked the money and parachutes. They were genuine. There was nothing left to do except *decide.*

I looked down the aisle at the girl in the blue dress. She had her arms wrapped around her mother, but she was staring at me. 

The look on her face was one of pure horror.

I nodded. “Let them go.”

Florence signaled in the direction of the cockpit, and the passengers came to life. Only she and I remained still. 

“I’m letting you go, too,” I explained softly. 

Florence looked gravely back at me. “I understand that, Mr. Cooper. But you’re not letting everyone go, and some of my friends are staying behind as your hostages.”

I nodded curtly, but said nothing. 

“So could you explain something to me?” She drew a deep breath. “Why are you keeping five people on the plane, despite requesting only four parachutes?”

Calmly, I took out a cigarette, lit it, and blew a soft stream of smoke into the air above my head.

“Do me a favor, Florence. Just make sure that everyone does *exactly* what I say.”",nosleep,1445

***

#**1. NBA Basketball 101**

**Scoring ‘Baskets’.** Putting the ball through the hoop either awards you 1, 2, or 3 points depending on the circumstance. 2-point shots are the most common, and the default for any shot, lay-up, or dunk. The shot is worth 3-points if it enters the basket from beyond the aptly-named 3-point line, also called ‘the arc’ (e.g. ‘from beyond the arc’ or ‘from downtown’). Common types of standard shots include the ‘jump shot’, when a player’s feet leave the ground as the ball leaves his hands, and the ‘step back’, when a player quickly steps backwards, away from the defender just before shooting. The only 1-point baskets are free throws – open, uncontested shots awarded to players who have been fouled, or whose team has amassed a certain number of fouls in a quarter.

**Fouls &amp; Violations.** The penalties of the NBA come in a wide variety of obscure forms, but the ones you’re going to see the most are:

•	Personal Fouls – When an opposing player hits, pushes, shoves, holds, or illegally obstructs another player. If the fouled player was shooting the ball, and the ball went in, they’re awarded one free throw (i.e. they get 2 points for the basket, or 3 if it was a 3-pointer, and have an opportunity to make it a 3-point or 4-point play, respectively, by scoring a free-throw). If the fouled player was shooting the ball while fouled and missed, they are awarded either 2 free throws for a missed 2-pointer, or 3 free throws for a missed 3-pointer.

•	Charging – You can’t plow into a defending player.

•	Blocking – You can’t plow into an offensive player.

•	Traveling – You can’t move while holding the ball and not dribbling it.

•	Carrying – You can’t hold the ball from underneath between dribbles.

•	Goaltending – Imagine a shot ball as traveling in an arc through the air. Once it reaches the apex of that arc and begins to fall downward toward the basket, it can no longer be blocked, or touched, by any player.

•	3-Second Violation – In general, you cannot stand in the ‘key’ or ‘lane’ – the painted rectangle just under the basket – for more than 3 seconds. There are a variety of exceptions, but in general this prevents a player from standing under the basket for a substantial period of time.

There are others that are less common and less important. Understand that many of these fouls and violations are, to some degree, subjective, and that the referees who determine whether they’ve taken place are imperfect. Mistakes are made. Calls are made that shouldn’t have been, and calls aren’t made that should’ve been. It’s part of the game. Get used to it.

**Assists.** Assists are a stat awarded to players who pass the ball to a player who then promptly scores. This stat reflects a player’s passing ability, their unselfishness, and their ‘vision’ – their ability to know where other players are on the court and to get the ball to them at the right time to guarantee a score. [Here’s a montage of some beautiful assists.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=032N4hay1QY) 

**Rebounds.** Also called ‘boards’, rebounds are when a player grabs a missed shot – often as it falls away from the hoop or backboard. Offensive rebounds are those rebounds secured from the opposing team’s basket, i.e. your team missed a shot, but you’ve retained the ball. Defensive rebounds are those secured from your own team’s basket, i.e. the opposing team missed a shot and you have reclaimed possession for your team.

[Here’s a game from Psychotic Ambassador to North Korea Dennis Rodman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF6qOsgb1cs), whose hands seemed to be magnetically attracted to any ball that fell from the rim any time he was in a game.

**Blocks.** Any time a player attempts a shot, layup, or dunk, and another player interrupts the ball from going into the basket, that is a block. Goaltending fouls generally occur as a result of mistimed blocks. [Here are some of last season’s best blocks.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGVtoBqv4-Q) Blocking is one of two purely defensive stats, along with…

**Steals.** This one’s pretty simple. If you manage to take possession of the ball away from a player on the opposing team, you have recorded a steal. But hey, [let’s montage it anyway.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW9X5h-cFC0)

**Screens.** When one player takes a firm stance on the court and stops players from the opposing team from getting around them, they have ‘set a screen’ or ‘set a pick’. This is often done by offensive players assisting the ballhandler by slowing down and rerouting defenders, allowing their teammates the time and space to score. The ‘pick and roll’ is a common type of 2-player offensive play designed to allow an offensive player to escape defenders via the use of a screen. A ‘switch’ is when defenders must reassign which defensive players are guarding which offensive players often as a result of screens and similar offensive adjustments. Forcing ‘mismatches’ and ‘bad switches’ can be a crucial offensive tactic in generating poor defense and better scoring opportunities. [Here’s a compilation of some ‘brick wall’ screens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcAW6g6BNao), i.e. clips of people setting such firm screens that other players smack off of them like they’re a wall.

**Cutting/Driving/Finishing.** This is the term for when an offensive player runs toward the basket to attempt a dunk or lay-up. It is often preceded by a screen or by fancy dribbling (like ‘a crossover’) intended to disrupt the defender’s ability to run alongside them. Here, [watch Kyrie put on a driving showcase.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOiyFW1Vcs0)

**Posting Up.** Playing in ‘the post’ is when an offensive player is between the 3-point line and the basket, often nearer the basket or in ‘the paint’, with their back or shoulder facing the basket and a defender pressed against them. This was a very common circumstance in the NBA for a long time, but as the value of shots taken from this middle area has decreased in the current strategic ‘meta’, ‘posting up’ is considered less valuable than either driving to the basket directly for a lay-up or dunk, or passing to the arc for a more valuable 3-point attempt. [The best highlight reel for post play I could find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcULJMJFuNs) is from 2014. See what I mean?

***

#**2. Positions &amp; Player Types**

There are five standard positions in most basketball: the Point Guard and Shooting Guard, the Small Forward and the Power Forward, and the Center. The two Guards are generally the smallest players on the floor and the best at shooting from range. The two Forwards are generally larger and better at playing nearer to the basket. The Center is generally the largest player on the team and assigned to work very close to the basket. In the modern NBA, these positions are becoming increasingly obsolete as more players fill liminal, hybrid roles.

**Point Guards – The De-Facto On-Court Leader**

The ‘floor general’, on most teams, the Point Guard starts each offensive possession with the ball, making the first pass or the first shot. They are often referred to as ‘primary ballhandlers’ for their job in controlling the ball at the start of a play. For a Point Guard, their intelligence, ability to read a defense, and their leadership are as important as their tangible, physical skills, and many of the best PGs are renowned as much for their ‘basketball IQ’ as they are for their jump shots or driving ability.
Stephen Curry and Kyrie Irving fill fairly traditional PG roles for the Warriors and Celtics, respectively. Notice how nearly every possession for each team begins with Steph or Kyrie scoping out the defense, directing their teammates, and initiating a play.
Shooting Guard – The Flashy Shooter and Driver

A role that increasingly steps on the toes of the Point Guard and the Small Forward, the Shooting Guard is traditionally a sharpshooter and an independent playmaker – a player who roams the 3-point line waiting for a chance at a 3-point shot, or hoping to be defended in isolation (‘iso ball’ is the name for 1-on-1 play) where they often excel at drop-stepping or cross-overs to push away the defender for an open shot, or to beat them to a drive to the basket.
Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant were both archetypal SGs, tremendous long-range shooters who also had the skill to blow by defenders and drive to the rim. In today’s game, James Harden exemplifies the Shooting Guard role.

**Small Forward – The All-Around Problem-Solver**

The ‘middle’ role on the court, between the two Guards and the Power Forward and Center, the Small Forward is a role often assigned to players of general, all-around skill and athleticism, jacks of all trades who are not big and powerful enough to take on around-the-rim roles, but who aren’t small and agile enough to be Guards. Small Forwards should ideally be capable of performing essentially every role on the court as-needed, and depending on the team, the coach, and the play, can fulfill a wide range of functions.
Unsurprisingly, the two players widely-regarded as the best in the NBA today – LeBron James and Kevin Durant – are both Small Forwards, as they are each capable of doing just about anything – shooting 3’s, driving to the basket, setting screens, defending, and everything in-between.

**Power Forward &amp; Center – The Rim-Protector and Two-Hand Dunker**

These two positions have gravitated together to such a degree that distinguishing between them is, in my opinion, not valuable. Often when sports journalists discuss the best Power Forwards or best Centers in the NBA, they stumble over the comparisons, being unsure exactly who should be counted as which position. Power Forwards and Centers are the biggest players on the court (the two positions, combined, are referred to as ‘Bigs’), and as such, are generally the most talented rebounders and shot blockers by sheer virtue of their strength and height. Traditionally, PFs played slightly farther away from the basket than true Centers, playing in the post and taking mid-range shots. As this type of play vanishes in the NBA, their role has become all-but identical to that of the Center.

Great historical Centers include Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell (once upon a time, the Center was more like today’s Point Guard in serving as the de-facto team leader) as well as Shaquille O’Neal, who is perhaps to this day the most archetypal Center of all time. Great Point Guards include Tim Duncan and Dirk Nowitzki – both of whom were capable of playing at greater range than most Centers are. In today’s game, great Bigs include Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid.

#**3. A Brief History of the NBA**

**1946-1959: The Early League**

The Basketball Association of America was founded in 1946 by a bunch of dudes who owned hockey arenas when they realized that basketball teams could make them some cash when their arenas were sitting around empty. The BAA absorbed two other leagues – the ABL and the NBL – by 1950, when it became the NBA. The game was substantially different back then – there was no 3-point line or shot-clock (explained later in the next paragraph) – and things like player training, nutrition, travel, and salary were basically non-existent. Stories abound about players who drank and smoked excessively, who had to hitchhike to games in rural places like Fort Wayne and Rochester where teams were located, and retiring because they got jobs that paid them too much to justify playing (can you imagine that happening today?).

The first non-white player, Wataru Misaka, played in 1947, and the first black players joined the league in 1950. The shot-clock was introduced in 1954 (the shot-clock can be seen ticking down in the corner of the screen during any NBA game – it allows the offensive team only 24 seconds to attempt a shot, which resets if the ball touches the rim – preventing one team from simply holding onto the ball the entire game, which is exactly what some teams were doing in the early 50’s, famously once resulting in a final score of 19-18).

The Minneapolis Lakers (now Los Angeles) won five titles in ’49, ’50, ’52, ’53, and ’54 under legendary coach John Kundla and headlined by the first basketball star in history, George Mikan, nicknamed “Mr. Basketball”.

**1960-1969: Russell’s Celtics Dynasty**

Bill Russell, the winningest American sportsman in history, joined the Boston Celtics and their star guard Bob Cousy and soon-to-be-legendary coach Red Auerbach in 1957. Between 1957 and 1969, the Celtics would win the NBA Championship a staggering 11 of 13 times, including 8 straight from ’59 through ’66. The NBA has never seen anything like it again, and likely never will. Bill Russell was a defensive monster (in an era before most defensive stats were tracked) and selflessly devoted to winning above all else. Russell was not just the star of the team, but also the coach for the ’68 and ’69 championships as well. Player-coaches are not something we’re going to see again, but Russell got two titles doing both jobs.

During the Celtics’ reign, they would beat Elgin Baylor and Jerry West’s Lakers in ’62, and ’63, Wilt Chamberlain’s Warriors in ’64, then Baylor and West’s Lakers again in ’65, ’66, and ’68. Wilt teamed up with Baylor and West for the ’69 finals, during which West averaged over 37-points per game against the Celtics, now led by a 35-year old player-coach Bill Russell.

And the Celtics still won. Bill Russel’s Celtics were incredible. In any other era, Baylor and West would’ve won several titles (Wilt is less certain: he seemed to care a lot more about his stats, which were admittedly absolutely preposterous, including a 100-point game, than winning).

**1970-1979: The ABA and Over-Expansion**

Understanding the NBA in the 1970’s can be a little difficult. There was a lot going on. During the early-to-mid ‘70s, the ABA gave the NBA a run for its money by offering a more exciting, fast-paced, player-centric game with a multi-colored ball, a 3-point line, a dunk contest, and flashy players with cool nicknames like Julius “Dr. J” Erving. Meanwhile, the NBA went from 9 teams in 1966 to 18 teams in 1974 and was thoroughly diluted with talent. The 70’s are largely remembered as an era when basketball was not especially popular, strangled by racism both internally and by the potential audience, with TV networks offering very little to the league that was increasingly known for losing out to sitcom reruns and hit by multiple drug scandals (NBA players were just famous enough to have as much cocaine as they wanted, but not quite famous enough to get away with it).

The great players of the 1970’s besides Dr. J (who would eventually join the NBA when the ABA merged into it by the end of the decade) include Kareem Abdul-Jabaar (statistically one of the three greatest players of all time), Rick Barry (who shot his free-throws grandma-style, underhanded), Elvin Hayes, Knicks hero Walt ‘Clyde’ Frazier, 3x MVP Moses Malone, George ‘The Iceman’ Gervin, and ‘Pistol’ Pete Maravich (who was born a few minutes away from where I was born, and my name is also Pete – please clap).
The 70’s are the only decade in NBA history where we really can’t talk about anything resembling a dynasty. The talent was so dispersed by the rapid expansion that no team even managed to win back-to-back titles the entire decade, and only the Knicks (’70 and ’73) and Celtics (’74 and ’76) won 2.

Then, in 1979, the 3-point line was added to the NBA the same year that two rookies joined the league – a scrawny white farm boy named Larry Bird joined the Boston Celtics, and a charismatic, wide-smiling showman joined the Lakers. His name was Earvin Johnson – but everyone called him Magic.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tMmaXRSeL4

**1980-1990: The Bird-Magic Rivalry**

If it weren’t for Larry Bird, Magic’s Lakers would’ve dominated the 80’s like the Minneapolis Lakers dominated the 50’s. If it weren’t for Magic Johnson, Bird’s Celtics would’ve done to this decade what Russell’s had done to the 60’s. Luckily for all of us, instead of domination, the 80’s were fierce competition – and that competition sparked a huge upturn in broadcast numbers and ticket sales. These two players, who had played against each other in the ’79 NCAA College Championship Game, would, through their rivalry (first a genuine spite, and later a genuine friendship), reinvigorate a shoddy league and set the stage for the modern NBA. From here on, from Magic and Bird on, the NBA is the league as we know it today – superteams, corporate sponsorships, 3-pointers, flashy dunks – the NBA we know and love was born between Magic and Bird.

The Lakers, with young superstar Magic and veteran leader Kareem, won the ’80, ’82, ’85, ’87, and ’88 championships under legendary coach Pat Riley. The Celtics won the ’81, 84, and ’86 titles, with Bird leading a remarkable team of the likes of Kevin McHale and Robert Parish. During the battle between these two juggernauts (three of those NBA finals were Celtics-Lakers), Moses Malone got to three championship series – one loss with the 76ers, one win with the 76ers, and one more loss with the Rockets – and Hakeem Olajuwon’s Rockets, a team that would’ve been amazing in any other era, got to, and lost, one finals series against Boston. With these exceptions, the ’80 to ’87 era was dominated by Boston and Los Angeles.

In ’88, Magic’s Lakers won their last title against Isiah Thomas’ Bad Boy Pistons – who would go on to beat them in ’89 and then beat the Portland Trail Blazers and Clyde Drexler in ’90. The Pistons three straight finals and two straight titles are something of a forgotten bridge between the famous Bird-Magic ‘80s and the even more famous era that was to follow…

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkySfD_uZbY

**1991-1998: Michael Jordan**

Drafted into the league from the University of North Carolina in 1984, Michael Jordan grew up while Bird and Magic were still sharing the crown, on a Bulls team that just wasn’t quite up to snuff. But as Magic and Bird aged and the Lakers and Celtics faded, and Isiah Thomas’ Pistons took the crown, the Bulls and their now-prime Michael Jordan were ready. Under the leadership of coach Phil Jackson, the Bulls ousted the Pistons to face Magic in his last finals appearance in 1991, and won in 5 games. The next year, Michael’s Bulls beat Portland. The year after that, they beat the Suns. Michael Jordan was the greatest player the league had seen in decades, maybe ever… and at the height of all that, after three straight titles… his father was murdered, and he was faced with a personal crisis that culminated in his retirement from the NBA to play for a minor-league baseball team (If it sounds like there has to be a larger story there – there is, but we don’t have time to get into that here).

While Michael was gone, Hakeem Olajuwon’s Rockets (remember them from the 80’s?) came back to win back-to-back titles in ’94 and ’95. Hakeem caught a break… or so he thought.

“I’m back.”

With those two words, Jordan came out of retirement, and immediately led the Bulls to a regular-seasons record of 72-10, the best in history to that point, followed by another threepeat, winning the ’96 title over Seattle, and the ’97 and ’98 titles over Karl ‘The Mailman’ Malone and John Stockton’s Utah Jazz. Two threepeats, 6 titles, an undefeated record in the finals, and now, at last… Jordan would retire again, this time for good.

…wait, he came back AGAIN? And played for a terrible team that missed the playoffs? Okay, we’re going to pretend that didn’t happen. Jordan retired for good as far as anyone is concerned. And so in 1999, after years of the leadership of epic players like Bird, Magic, Thomas, Olajuwon, and Jordan, the league was opened up for new blood.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAr6oAKieHk

**1999-2010: NBA in the New Millennium**

From ’99 through ’10, coach Gregg Popovich’s San Antonio Spurs won 4 titles, and coach Phil Jackson’s (remember him?) Lakers won 5 titles. That probably makes it sound like this was another of the NBA’s great rivalries, but it really wasn’t – at least, not in the same way as the Lakers-Celtics, for example. The Spurs and Lakers are both in the Western Conference, meaning that the two teams could never play against one another in the finals. Popovich’s Spurs were championed by legendary Power Forward Tim Duncan, while Jackson’s Lakers road the wave of devastating Shooting Guard Kobe Bryant. Besides the hiccup of the ’04 Pistons, the ’06 Heat (coached by Pat Riley – remember him, too?), and the ’08 Celtics, the Spurs and the Lakers dominated this decade.

I imagine many of the people looking to get into the NBA grew up with the ’99-’10 NBA happening in the background. It might stand out as odd to you that the Shaq-Kobe Lakers duo was such a cultural phenomenon even outside of the basketball world, while Tim Duncans Spurs seemed to slip under the radar. The Spurs played a very clean, unselfish, systematic style of basketball, and Tim Duncan had the exact opposite of a superstar personality, creating a very professional and undramatic dynasty compared to those led by spotlight-lit stars like Kobe or Shaq – or even Allen Iverson, who I distinctly remember as a non-basketball-fan growing up, even though his team never managed to win a finals (they made it, but lost, in ’01).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juBiQUjwx7c

**2011-2016: LeBron James**

Best to just come out with it from the very start. LeBron James has been in every NBA Finals game since 2011. His Miami Heat made the Finals every year from ’11 – ’14, and when he returned to his hometown of Cleveland, his Cavaliers made the finals every year from ’15 – ’18. Were the Heat in the Finals the year before LeBron arrived? Nope. Were the Cavaliers in the Finals the year before LeBron arrived? They weren’t even in the playoffs. LeBron James is a phenomenon.

LeBron, a son of Akron, Ohio, not far from Cleveland, was drafted by his hometown Cavaliers straight out of high school in 2003. Though he managed to drag them to one Finals in ’07, Popovich and Duncan’s Spurs swept them 4-0, and by 2010, it became clear that LeBron’s talents were being wasted in Cleveland. Most NBA fans wanted him to stay there, to be loyal to his home team, and to hold out through some bad years and help them see a championship. But in what was dubbed ‘The Decision’, he chose to leave and join superstars Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh on the Miami Heat. The very next season, he made it to the Finals.

The year, 2011, they lost to Dirk Nowitzki (a Power Forward who can shoot 3-pointers, a unique and remarkable player) and the Dallas Mavericks, before winning the ’12 and ’13 titles against the Oklahoma City Thunder (spearheaded by an incredible trio of Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook) and Popovich’s eternal Spurs, who proceeded to best them in ’14.

Remember Jordan’s “I’m Back”? In 2014, LeBron announced he was returning to Cleveland. The team had developed while he was away. They acquired Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, and Kevin Love, and were ready for the King’s guidance. His first year back, they made the finals, and like his first year in Miami, they lost – this time to the Golden State Warriors, led by Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, perhaps the two single greatest shooters in the history of the NBA, as well as superstar Andre Iguodala and defensive machine Draymond Green.

The next year, 2016, the Cavaliers met the Warriors in the Finals again – this Warriors team having beaten Jordan’s Bull’s record of regular season wins, going 73-9 – and the Cavaliers came back from being down 3-1 in the series to win the title, LeBron hoisting his third Championship trophy, and his first with Cleveland, breaking the city’s half-century-long title drought. That win is one of the most legendary in the history of the NBA, and really, in the history of American sports.
And then something happened.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vre_nWbPxk

**2016-Present: Golden State Dominance**

The Golden State Warriors had made it to the 2016 titles by beating the Oklahoma City Thunder, who were led by Kevin Durant, widely regarded as the second-best player in the league after LeBron.

And the Warriors signed Durant. This team, already featuring the deadliest pair of shooters in NBA history, the league’s Defensive Player of the Year, having gone to back-to-back titles, having just gone 73-9 in the regular season… signed the league’s second-best player. It shook the entire league. Kevin Durant is the greatest villain in the NBA to this day – nobody else comes close. Many regard this as having destroyed all parity in the league.

In 2017 and 2018, the Warriors and Cavaliers faced off in the Finals two more times – marking the first time the same two teams have played in four straight finals – but this time, the Warriors won 4-1 and 4-0. LeBron, despite seemingly never aging and playing as well as he ever has even into his mid-30’s, despite carrying an increasingly-mediocre Cavaliers team to the Finals year after year… simply couldn’t do anything against a Warriors team with not just Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, with not just Draymond Green, but with Kevin Durant as well. Even the Houston Rockets, who in the 2017-2018 season built and designed themselves specifically to defeat the Warriors, whose whole philosophy and strategy was designed around killing the Warriors, who ended this season with a better record and home court advantage over the Warriors, fell in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals against them.

The Warriors sit on top of the whole league right now in a way that no team has in a very long time. It’s hard to imagine who could beat them.
This offseason, LeBron finally left Cleveland for the second time to join the Los Angeles Lakers. They’re a very young and untested team mixed in with some veteran talent. The Rockets got a little bit worse. The team that would’ve won in the East last year, if not for LeBron, the Celtics, got a little bit better. And what did the Warriors do? The Warriors signed a played named DeMarcus ‘Boogie’ Cousins, one of the most dominant Bigs in the NBA today. He’s coming off a devastating injury and it’s unclear when he’ll be able to play, and whether he’ll be his old self, but there is no indication whatsoever that the Warriors have gotten anything but even better than before. Can anyone possibly threaten them?

Everyone outside of the Bay Area is hoping so. But none of us are feeling very confident about it.

So that’s where we are now.

#**4. Team-by-Team Breakdowns**

I’m going to provide brief summaries of each team in the NBA. These are intended to provide you with the bare basics necessary to have some idea of who they are – what kind of history they’ve had, what their last few seasons have been like, what the expectations are for this season, what we’ll all be watching for, and what particularly notable players have been, or currently are, on their rosters. Stuff will be left out. Important things will be forgotten. People in the comments will be telling me how I left out incredibly vital things that are essential to understanding their favorite team. I know. These are meant to be a primer for new fans, just to get your footing in understanding where a team is coming from and where they're going. I recommend the team's wikipedia pages to learn more.

***

**Atlanta Hawks**

**Hallmarks:** Bob Petit in the ‘50s and ‘60s, Dominique Wilkins in the ’80s and ‘90s; ’58 Champions

**This Year:** Bottom 10

One of the oldest teams in the league, dating back to the Buffalo Bisons in 1946, they won their only NBA Championship in 1958 and haven’t made it back to the finals since ’61, which was before they moved to Atlanta. They have sparsely even managed to make it to the playoffs since then – every time they get the ball rolling and make a playoff break, something seems to fall apart. Dominique Wilkins was one of the great, fun-to-watch dunkers of the ‘80s and his statue sits outside of their arena today. The Hawks had some good fortunes in the late 90’s, and again between ’08 and ’10, but never quite enough to propel them to another Finals. In 2015, finally, it looked like their luck was turning around, having a 17-0 month in January, and even advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals… where LeBron was waiting for them. In 2016, they lost in the first round of the playoffs, and in 2017, they slipped back substantially, as seems to be their curse. They drafted Luka Doncic with the third overall pick in this year’s draft, who they traded for a 2019 first-round pick to the Mavericks for Trae Young. The way that whole thing played out was… controversial.

This year, keep an eye out for Trae Young, who should at the very least be exciting to watch. 41-year old Vince Carter might well be in his final season on their bench. It’s very unlikely that the Hawks will find a lot of success this year, but even if Young and their youthful roster show signs of promise, it will be all the success the Hawks could really hope for. At least the expectations are low. 

***

**Boston Celtics**

**Hallmarks:** 17 NBA Championships, from ’57 through ’08; Bill Russell and Larry Bird.

**This Year:** ECF Contenders

The Boston Celtics are the most successful team in NBA history. They have won 23.9% of all NBA championships in history, and their leaders have won 10 MVPs. Since 1986, they have only managed to win one Championship, the 2008 title. The Celtics have made it to the last four straight playoffs – losing in the first round on ’15 and ’16, and losing in the Eastern Conference Finals to LeBron’s Cavaliers back-to-back in ’17 and ’18. Many commentators speculate that if their last season hadn’t been weakened by injuries to stars Gordon Hayward and superstar Point Guard Kyrie Irving, the Celtics could’ve beaten LeBron and gone to the Finals last year. This year, LeBron has moved to the West, and under the guidance of their incredibly talented coach Brad Stevens and assuming healthy years for their stars and continued growth for their young stars Tatum and Brown, the Celtics have the clearest path to the Finals of any team in the East.

This year, watch the Celtics as closely as any other team. If they stay healthy, the combined power of their all-star lineup, their incredibly deep bench, their all-NBA coach, and the weakened Eastern Conference should make them the clear favorites to face off against Golden State in the Finals. Whether they could beat them is an entirely different question.

***

**Brooklyn Nets**

**Hallmarks:** ABA Champions ’74, ’76, Eastern Conference Title ’02, ’03. Jason Kidd &amp; Dr. J.

**This Year:** Bottom 10

Formerly of New Jersey, the Nets were an ABA team that merged in 1976, bringing Julius Erving into the NBA as the reigning ABA Champs. Though the Nets had a strong streak in the early 00’s under the guidance of Jason Kidd, they never managed to secure an NBA title. Currently in a rebuilding process, they’ve let go of briefly-superstar Jeremy Lin and picked up the likes of Shabazz Napier and Ed Davis from the Blazers on short contracts. It’s been rough going for the Nets, who foolishly gave away their own first-rounders for three straight years, and at last, now, the light might be beginning to peak over the horizon. They have a lot of money in their pockets (and will have even more after this season), and their Brooklyn home attracts superstars far more than a team of their stature normally could. Finally under strong, smart leadership, though the Nets are very unlikely to see any success this year, everything is set up for them to come into next season looking dramatically better.

This year, just enjoy watching some of their young players and one-year contracts, hope for some fun games, and desperately try to make yourselves look like the kind of team that a superstar will want to come to next season.

***

**Charlotte Hornets**

**Hallmarks:** Alonzo Mourning in the early 90’s

**This Year:** Middle-of-the-Pack

The Charlotte Hornets joined as an expansion team in 1988, then moved to New Orleans and became the New Orleans Hornets. Then in 2004, another expansion team started in Charlotte – the Bobcats – until the New Orleans Hornets renamed themselves the Pelicans in 2013, after which the Charlotte Bobcats became the Charlotte Hornets again.
Did you catch all that?

TL;DR the Charlotte Hornets organization as we know it today has only existed since 2004, but they own the rights to the history of the Hornets team from 1988 until 2002 when it moved to New Orleans. So, while the early-90’s Mourning/Johnsons/Curry-era Hornets were a pretty good team… they really have nothing to do with the current Hornets organization. Today’s Hornets, owned by Michael Jordan since 2010, have made three playoffs – each time losing in the first round – and have finished the last two seasons with identical 36-46 records. They are the definition of mediocrity – good enough, maybe, to crack one of the lowest playoff seeds in a year when the conference is weak, but never good enough to do anything with it, and never bad enough to secure a #1 draft pick.

This year, expect much of the same thing. Kemba Walker is talented and entertaining, and this could be his last year in Charlotte. Spurs vet Tony Parker is here to provide guidance and support if things get too dark. You might get to see the first round of the playoffs. Or next year might be the start of a true tanking. It’s all up in the air for the Hornets.

***

**Chicago Bulls**

**Hallmarks:** Michael Jordan and the two 90’s threepeats; the brief spark of light that was Derrick Rose.

**This Year:** Middle-of-the-Pack

The Bulls were a mediocre team until they were the greatest team. Jordan won them their only 6 conference titles and their only 6 championships. Since then, mediocrity has returned to Chicago. Derrick Rose’s ’10-’11 bizzaro-world MVP made it seem like the Bulls might have had another Jordan on their hands, but alas, things are not always as they seem. The Bulls in recent years have been back down toward the bottom of the league, but with rebuilding thoroughly underway and a young and promising roster, it’s not all frowns for the Windy City. LaVine and Markkanen both look very promising (Lauri’s injury was announced as I was typing this – my bad, Chicago), and their draft pick Wendell Carter Jr. is poised to be one of the most exciting rookies to watch this year. It’s not impossible that this is the year the Bulls’ fall comes to a halt and they start turning the plane around and squeeze into the 8th Seed. But it’s also not impossible that the pieces just aren’t in place yet.

This year, watch their young players putting on a fast, exciting show – particularly Wendell Carter Jr., who’s poised to be a Rookie of the Year candidate if anyone is.

***

**Cleveland Cavaliers**

**Hallmarks:** LeBron James, and then again, LeBron James; Incredible 2016 Championship

**This Year:** Middle-of-the-Pack

The Cavaliers joined the league in 1970 and lost the first 15 games they ever played. They made the ECF in 1976, and it was all downhill from there. The Cavaliers were a mediocre-to-bad team until they drafted a kid from Akron named LeBron James, and even in his first few years, they struggled. He got them to one Finals in 2007, but it otherwise took him until his 13th season to manage a Championship in Cleveland. It’s hard to win there. It’s always been hard to win there. And now that the King is gone… there’s no reason to think it’s gotten anything but much harder again. Were the Cavaliers really a bad team that just had the greatest player in the world on their roster last year, or do they, now led by Kevin Love, actually have a real team on their hands?

This year, the Cavaliers will be one of the biggest questions, and one of the most-watched and curious teams in the league. For all we know, Love is going to carry the Cavaliers to some amount of success and even crack the playoffs. If the Cavaliers made the 6th Seed, even, I don’t think we’d be shocked. And if they were one of the 5 worst teams in the NBA, we wouldn’t be shocked either. It’s going to be interesting, that’s for sure.

***

**Dallas Mavericks**

**Hallmarks:** Jason Kidd and Steve Nash (neither in their prime), Dirk Nowitzki; 2011 NBA Championship

**This Year:** Bottom 10

The Mavericks joined the NBA in 1980 and had bad luck, drafting quality players like Detlef Schrempf (no, I didn’t just make that name up) and Mark Aguirre only to see them reach their potential once they were no longer on their roster. They drafted Jason Kidd, who had two separate tenures on the team, but who saw his best years – again – while not playing for the Mavs. Their franchise’s true hero is German-born three-point-shooting-Center Dirk Nowitzki, a strange player with a strange life who took the NBA by absolute storm for a few years and won them their sole NBA Title. That 2011 Championship, as the years go on and every title since has been won by either LeBron or Golden State, is looking increasingly prestigious and remarkable. This offseason, they traded for #3-but-projected-by-many-#1 draft pick Luka Doncic, who has just come off from winning virtually everything you can win in professional European basketball at the ripe age of 19. In what is likely Dirk’s last year, the team’s hopes rest on his shoulders – but you couldn’t ask for better shoulders to rest your hopes on.

This year, watch Luka. The Mavs are unlikely to see a lot of success – the team just doesn’t have enough talent in enough places – but it’s not an uncommon opinion to project that Luka Doncic is going to do things that very few NBA rookies have ever done before. He has played and succeeded at very high levels of professional basketball, playing with and against adults and veterans. He’s no high schooler or even an NCAA senior. He’s a whole different monster.

Growing up with asthma was always a little hard, but having a dad that smoked two packs a day made it even harder. 


Mom would always chastise him for the bad habit and he would always claim that he would go cold turkey. It was a cycle with him. One week on, the next week off. 

Eventually it made her just leave altogether and I only saw her on weekends. 

It made it even harder since we lived in a rundown trailer park east of Seattle, so when he did decide to light one up that meant finding clean air was nearly impossible unless I wanted to go outside and freeze to death in the early morning air. 

He smoked so much that it literally made the wallpaper peel and then turn a sickly yellow and brown. 

In fact, had I not developed lung cancer I think he would have kept smoking til the day one of us died. 

But when I got the diagnosis and the doctor asked me if anyone in the family smoked, I saw his face go white as a sheet. 

I hate to say it, but for me cancer was actually a golden ticket to a better life with dad. 

His guilt drove him to buy me whatever I wanted and I took full advantage of it. 

New phone, new shoes, new iPod, you name it I got it. 

I didn’t care what he had to go through, I figured my pain was reason enough for my selfishness. 

It went on like that for five months as I took my rounds of chemo and plugged him for every penny he had left. Even after the cancer was mostly gone, he still wanted to make up for all the mistakes he had made along the way. 

That all changed in August though when he filed for bankruptcy and I found myself on a bus to stay with Mom. 

As much as I hated my dad, I also didn’t want to leave him. Something had changed in those few months, something I didn’t realize I would miss until it was gone. 

Mom was staying with Aunt Beatrice in Seattle in a sleazy apartment downtown, and the first thing that I noticed when I got there was the overwhelming smell of cigarette smoke. 

I started coughing profusely the minute I got inside the small cramped space, and it felt like the walls were closing in. 

“Oh for Christ’s sake, it ain’t that bad!” Aunt Bea snapped. 

I went to the toilet and vomited, trying to keep my head from spinning any more. 

Mom came in a few minutes later to check on me and rubbed my back gently. 

“I’m sorry sweetie… it’s only until your mom gets a job, then we can get out of here,” she told me. 

I gave her a weak smile and told her I could handle it. 

The next few weeks showed me that I was wrong about that. If I thought Dad’s addiction was bad, Aunt Bea had him beat by ten miles. There wasn’t a moment that lady didn’t have a cigarette in her hand. 

It got so bad that I couldn’t even make it to school I was so sick. 

I hated that woman. 

Mom taught me never to wish ill will on anyone, but if any body deserved it; Aunt Bea sure as hell did. 

One particular humid day, I tried to get up early and cook Mom some pancakes and Bea was standing on the balcony on her fifth cigarette. 

It wasn’t even a quarter to six. 
“That’s going to rot your teeth out,” I told her as I searched for the pots and pans. 

Bea whipped around and flared her nostrils at me. 

“Why don’t you learn to keep your mouth shut? I ought to give you a piece of my mind!” she snarled. 

“Are you sure you can afford to spare that much? You might wind up brain dead!” I snapped back. 

I instantly regretted the words and Bea slapped me across the face. 

She took out her cigarette from her mouth while it was still warm and maliciously dug it against the front of my arm. I cried in pain as she held it there until it had burnt out and then she shoved me back across the room. 


“You need to watch your mouth. If it wasn’t for me you and your mom would be out on the streets!” 

She stormed off to her room and I crawled up against the wall and curled into a ball. 

I shook and cried for a moment longer as I stared up at the brown stained walls, wishing that life could be different for me. 

That was when I saw something move there amid the cascade of stains and dried paint. 

It shimmered and slid across the wall, like some kind of wet sploshy oil moving across the borders of the old peeling frames. 

I stared at it for a moment longer, rubbing my eyes and trying to make sense of the phenomenon. When I let my vision adjust, the swirling colors had stopped altogether and I found myself staring at the same old dull texture like nothing had happened.   

My mom entered the room a moment later wearing a shabby dress and placing earrings on as she hastily got ready to go. 

“Aunt Bea got me an interview at that little diner on South Palm. Wish me luck hun!” she squealed with delight. 

I don’t even know if she noticed I was just standing there in a fog. 

Bea came out next, glaring at me to be quiet about our earlier little encounter and following Mom out the apartment without a single word. 

Once they were gone, I turned my attention back toward the wall; still trying to make sense of what I had seen. 

I moved the couch gently out of the way so that I could touch the texture, noticing that the spot where I had seen the colors moving was wet like it had recently been painted. 

As I moved my hand across the wall, I felt something slide against my fingers and I recoiled in surprise, a grey slime dripping from my palm. 

I shook it away and stood up, realizing that the same abnormal behavior I had seen on the wall was happening again and this time with greater intensity.  

The pool of brown, dark and blotchy colors slid down off the wall and onto the floor, forming a large gelatinous mass near the couch as I scrambled away. 

I held my breath, nearly having an asthma attack as the sludge grew larger still, slithering it’s way toward me and then stopping midway through the living room. 

I found myself frozen against the wall, looking down at the endless black hole that was now straight in front of me and then watching as something pulled itself out of the slime. 

It moved up through the air, a menagerie of unformed shapes and colors searching for structure as I saw it reach nearly seven feet tall, bulky and uncontrolled. 

As the form took shape, I saw arms stretching out and an empty rib cage, an ethereal skeleton from the darkness. 

I ran toward the door, desperate to escape. Delirious and scared, I reached for the handle as I heard a voice whisper my name. 

The half made face was staring at me with no eyes, it’s jaw and mouth nothing but further pools of slime spilling out onto the floor. 

I screamed. I opened the door and made my way downstairs, trying to escape it. 

As I made my out to the streets below, I stopped in my tracks and thought of Mom. 
If she came home with that… thing in the apartment, she would be done for. 

I did the only thing I thought made sense and asked the super to call the police. I stayed in the apartment lobby until the police arrived alongside Beatrice and Mom. 

“Julie! What’s going on??” Mom asked frantically. 

I lied and told them that someone had broken into the apartment. We waited downstairs as the police checked the third floor. But less than thirty minutes later than returned and told us that nothing was out of place nor was there any indication of forced entry. They left and gave me a soft warning not to make a false claim like that again. 

Once we were alone in the apartment Beatrice snubbed her nose at me and remarked, “Figures a brat like you would pull a stunt like this.” 

I turned to mom for support but she was just as furious. “I was in the middle of an interview Julie! You can’t be doing things like this! I’m not like your dad and you can’t just have me at your beck and call!” 

That stung more than the cigarette burn had. 

I went to my room and slumped on my bed. I wanted to cry, but I was so out of breath I was sure if i did I would have to have a breathing treatment. 

Instead I just stayed in bed and stared at the walls, trying to decide if I was going crazy or not. 

That night I found out. 

I didn’t even bother to try to go to sleep. 

I just stared at the walls, trying to determine what this monster wanted with me. 
Once it was so dark that I could hardly see the hand in front of my face I decided to muster up the courage to confront the demon. 

“Show yourself,” I whispered cautiously to the wall. 

This time it wasted no effort to step out from the dark stains near my closet. 

It had the shape and structure of a tall sickly man, but in the darkness I couldn’t see anything else. Only that it was filled with shimmering holes in its body, and when it spoke it sounded like a rasp. 

“You have something… something that does not belong to you…” it answered as it lurched forward toward me. 

I tried not to shiver as I pulled my blankets over my trembling body. 

“I… I don’t have anything! But whatever it is you can have it!!” I told the being. 

“Are you certain?” it asked as its mouth opened wider than I thought possible. 

“Sometimes the things we do not want… are the things that are most valuable to us.” 

I looked at it’s strange unformed body, it’s peculiar stance and deadly eyes and realized that there was something familiar about it. 

It reminded me of the sickness I had carried for half a year. Whatever this being was, I knew that it’s reason for being here was more than to frighten. 

“Are you… are you asking me what I really want?” I mouthed, trying to make sense of the riddles it spoke. 

“Your body was once wracked with disease. Now all that fills it is hate.” 

I couldn’t argue with that. 

But what did this bizarre monster know of such things? 

“You don’t scare me… I’ve laughed death in the face. And I don’t care if I die,” I told it bravely. 

It’s laugh was ragged and hoarse. 

“If you are so brave, then speak your heart’s desire. I can make it true.”  

I considered it’s offer for a long moment. This had to be a dream. A lack of sleep and sickness taking its toll on my body. 

Convinced I was talking to an illusion I said, “I want to be free. I want to get away from here and get back with my dad… at least there I could do what I wanted.” 

“I could give you that freedom…” the monster snickered as it swirled toward the door.  

“All I ask is for your hate.” 

I paused and felt my mouth go dry. Such an odd request. How could I say no? My mother had always taught me that I needed to have a pure heart. Was this thing offering to cleanse my soul?

“Take it then, it’s yours,” I said without hesitation. 

One of its long slimy appendages reached out toward me and I flinched as it covered my skin, it felt like a vacuum was slowly sucking away at the edge of my nerves. I shook and swayed as the creature’s shimmering body opened wide and seemed to grow larger with each passing second. I thought for certain I would pass out, or that the dream would end soon. 

At last it released its grip on me and I lay down on the bed like a limp doll, exhausted from whatever it had done to me as it seemed to ebb and flow across the room with extreme pleasure over the meal I had apparently offered up to it. 

The creature moved toward the wall again, pushing its body against the tapestry as it whispered a final goodbye. 


“You may find freedom the heaviest burden of all to carry.” 

At last it disappeared from sight. 

I stood in confusion for a moment longer, certain it would return to terrorize me again. 

As I settled down on my bed though I did feel different. Something was gone inside my heart. I didn’t feel… well anything anymore. 

I smiled and relaxed in bed and closed my eyes, confident that the paranormal encounter would somehow make for an interesting conversation at breakfast in the morning. 

I sprung out of bed a few hours later, eager to seize the day and see if the odd wish I had asked for had any chance of coming true. 

“Mom, you’ll never guess what I dreamed about last night,” I said as I walked into the kitchen. 

The room was silent though, and for the first time since we had arrived I noticed that the smell of smoke was nowhere to be found in the house. 

I moved toward Aunt Bea’s room to wake her, her door slightly ajar and shouted, “Hey rise and shine! We have church today.” 

Bea didn’t respond. I moved over toward her and shook her to wake and then realized her body felt cold. 

I pulled back the blanket and found her whole back side seemed to be ripped apart, shredded like thin sheets of toilet paper. It smelled burnt. 

I screamed and ran to mom’s room. 

As I stepped into the dim lighting I already knew that something had happened to her as well. I will never forget that sight. 

 Her body had literally melted against the twin bed, nothing but a pool of skin and muscle was now scorching the carpet where she had once laid. Dark oil splotches covered the room, a testimony to what the monster had done. 

I screamed louder, my breath going out as I stumbled to the carpet and reached for my inhaler from my back pocket.

But as many times as I used it, nothing seemed to refill my lungs except more panic and desperation as I cried in exasperation. 

The official report said that Beatrice had killed my mother by roasting her alive in her room and then committed suicide but I know that was because the examiners didn’t know what to make of any of it. 

Dad came the next day to take me back to the trailer park. He was staying with a friend now, working two jobs to make ends meet. 

“Hey kiddo, good to see you…” he said as he came to pick me up. 

Tears welled in my eyes as we left Seattle. This was what I had wanted wasn’t it? To be free?

I knew that the monster had granted my wish, given me what I thought I wanted. But now as we made it back to the rundown recreational park, I felt even more hollow than that creature. 

We made it inside and I told him I would go wash up for supper, my nerves still rattled from everything that had happened. 

When I got back out I saw that dad was sitting and watching tv, drinking a beer and smoking a Marlboro. 

“I thought you said you quit,” I told him in frustration. 

“Sorry hun… this is the last one.”

I balled up my fists and closed my eyes in frustration. 

When I opened them again I saw a gentle shimmer on the east wall of the trailer. My mouth was dry and ragged as I felt my breathing increase. No. Not again. 

“Julie? Are you okay?” Dad asked as I called my nerves as the movement on the wall disappeared from sight. 

“No dad… it’s fine…” I told him warily as I went to my small room. 

I didn’t say a word to him about it after that. And the creature never made another appearance. 


The cancer came back though, and this time the doctors told me it’s probably going to stay. 

I told my dad that I was okay with it, with having a death sentence. 

Honestly, that’s because I know now that there are far worse things to live with.

In 1993, the Browns started 3-0, defeating the Bengals, 49ers, and Raiders. With a win (or a tie) against the Saints, they would accomplish this feat for the first time in a quarter of a century.

Year | Week 1 Result | Week 2 Result (if applicable)

Again, the last time the Browns didn’t have a loss after 2 weeks was 1993. If we go back even further (all the way back to 1980), the results look like this:

Year | Week 1 Result | Week 2 Result (if applicable)
--- | --- | ---
1992 | Loss 14-3 vs. Indianapolis |
1991 | Loss 26-14 vs. Dallas |
1990 | Win 13-3 vs. Pittsburgh | Loss 24-21 vs. NY Jets
**1989** | **Win 51-0 vs. Pittsburgh** | **Win 38-24 vs. NY Jets**
1988 | Win 6-3 vs. Kansas City | Loss 23-3 vs. NY Jets
1987 | Loss 28-21 vs. New Orleans |
1986 | Loss 41-31 vs. Chicago |

1981 | Loss 44-14 vs. San Diego Chargers |
1980 | Loss 34-17 vs. New England

Here’s some perspective on all of this. Prior to the start of the 1980 season, *The Empire Strikes Back* was released, “Funkytown” was the song of the summer, and the most recent Winter Olympics featured Team USA winning the gold medal and defeating the Soviet Union in one of the games in the Miracle on Ice. 

Since all of that took place, the Browns have been undefeated after the first two weeks of the season… twice. The Denver Broncos have done this three times in the past three seasons, and the Browns have done this twice since Jimmy Carter’s final year in office.",nfl,3412

lhoyt,2018-09-02 21:54:49+00:00,OC: Can you pay top dollar for 2 players and Contend?,"So after the Mack trade, I have heard a lot of ""you can't tie up that much salary between 2 players and be successful"". I was curious if this was true, so I pulled the Salary Cap (SC) data for the last 3 years and the teams that made the playoffs. I chose playoff teams because, when it comes to winning the Super Bowl, and the NFL playoff system, there is too much luck involved.

First part I will look at are the teams that made the playoffs in 2015, 2016, AND 2017. Those teams are New England, Pittsburgh, and Kansas City.

The average salary cap % for the two largest contracts on each team by year:

**New England:**

2015- 15.7%

2016- 15.1%

2017- 15%

Average 15.3%

**Pittsburgh:**

2015- 18.4%

2016- 24.8%

2017- 18.8%

Average 20.7%

**Kansas City:**

2015- 16.4%

2016- 19.6%

2017- 22.9%

Average 19.6%

Three teams have made the playoffs in each of the years looked at. Kansas City and Pittsburgh have both gotten close to 20% of salary cap being shared between two players. New England is an anomaly, and has the best QB of all time playing at a discounted rate. It is hard to gauge how the team would be built if Brady received his true market value. The thing that these teams have in common is that they all had veteran QB's that are arguably top 10. Most likely the Green Bay Packers would have been part of this list if Rodgers had stayed healthy last year. 

The list is also littered with teams that have high salary cap usage between two players, as well as having the benefit of having a top 15 QB on a rookie contract (Seattle, Rams, Tennessee, Houston, Philly, Oakland, Minnesota, and Carolina).

The teams that had the highest SC % usage were:

2015 Denver - 20.5%

2015 Carolina - 22.1%

2015 Green Bay - 20.4%

2016 Pittsburgh - 24.8%

2016 Dallas - 21.2%

2016 Atlanta - 25%

2016 Seattle - 21.6%

2016 Green Bay - 20.2%

2016 New York G - 22.2%

2016 Detroit - 22.5%

2017 Kansas City - 22.9%

2017 Atlanta - 22.4%

12/36 playoff teams had a SC % Usage of over 20% for their top 2 paid players.

After looking at everything, I don't see how this can be a blanket statement that is used as an excuse to not sign a top player. Mack and Carr would have averaged 21% of their teams cap % for 2018-2021 (using Mack's Chicago contact). This % could be lower, but since negotiations never happened between Oakland and Mack, we don't know the exact figures of a contract that he would have sought. 

What we do know is that Oakland has struggled to bring in additional talent around Carr and Mack on both sides of the ball, since they have been drafted. Cooper and Crabtree have been the only two consistent offensive weapons. And defensively not many have stood out. This is due to poor drafting, giving contracts to Free Agents that haven't panned out, and some bad luck. Carr is a top 10 QB, and it would be more evident if they had a defense that would allow Carr to play with a lead. And when the Raiders do have a lead, a running game that could help manage the clock.

There is more than one way to build a team to make the playoffs and sustain long-term success. Very few teams ever figure it out, which is why dynasties are rare. Giving up known, high-caliber, talent isn't the best way to do it. You can't blame the players for earning big contracts. You have to put the blame on management for not finding the right players to fit a team. Year in and year out Green Bay, New England, Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Atlanta, New Orleans, Houston, etc. find ways to build their team to get to the playoffs. There isn't one formula, and there is a ton of risk.

At the end of the day, I think Oakland made a mistake, and I am glad Chicago was able to capitalize. Maybe they suck, maybe they get to the crapshoot that is the playoffs and make a run within the next 4 years. They took the risk. Oakland is taking a risk and they are going to try and find another defensive anchor in the draft. I believe in throwing good money at a known quantity versus gambling in the draft.

Cat_Beans,2018-08-21 20:36:42+00:00,Update 6 - Washington State: Neighbor is currently video recording me and has a camera directly pointed at my bedroom window. What can I do? [It continues],"So my neighbor decided to throw up some nice floodlights pointed over his fence right at our bedroom window right after his court date.  In that time we have sold the home and moved to an apartment in transition to our new destination, far far away.

He turned on the floodlights every night at 10pm and they would clearly shine through the bedroom window even with the black out film, and really shone through our guest bedroom where my mom stayed for a week to visit. Police came out and took pics and drove by several nights to confirm they were still up.  Part of his plea deal is to not commit ""similar incidences"" and further harass us. This comes into play later.

I called the police and they ended up serving me papers saying I was required to be a witness in court.  Court day came, they were asking for jail time, and my neighbor's attorney asked for a continuance because he didn't have time to review the new info.

They granted it.

Second week comes around, we rescheduled for a special hearing with a pro tem judge.  Mistake.

Today was the hearing and the second time we all had to take off work to show up.  The judge immediately told the city prosecutor since she didn't have a formal briefing, that he was not familiar with the case and that it would not be heard today.  Typically the judge who does hear the city's cases is well informed and the prosecutor objected to this saying it is not a requirement, you knew what was on the docket today. The judge further mentioned that because specific charges were not filed and they were just asking for jail time given back onto the jail time they waived at the previous hearing, he wasn't interested in doing this today.  Then he mentioned he had court in Seattle in two hours and wasn't interested in hearing my testimony today.  Also, since we will be gone by October, he didn't see the issue in why we were even there - since we moved, we can't be harassed anymore so problem solved.

I broke down in tears of sheer frustration.  The prosecutor said I don't have to be a witness anymore and they would talk to the usual judge in the case.  And to keep in touch with her. When my neighbor walked out, he did a very dramatic prayer hands in the air, like he knew he won.  I give up again. We're leaving, it's over, I will never get my day in court. I will never know what I did to this man to make him harass me so deeply.  I will never get two years of my life back.

Anilxe,2018-08-20 15:28:59+00:00,"To the girls that pretended to be my friends when someone was following me at night, thank you.","It was 2015, I had just moved to Seattle and hadn't made many friends yet. I had a habit of going to a specific coffee shop in U District after I got off work, and playing hearthstone on my phone as I sipped hot chocolate. It was October, and the days were already pretty short. 

One of these days, I got off work and saw a guy staring at me across the road. I didn't think much of it, and walked to the bus stop. As I got on the bus, he did as well. I was sitting near the middle, he was at the front, and was glancing at me the entire ride to my coffee shop. 

I got off the bus, and after I got in line at the shop, I saw him pass by the front windows. I thought it odd, but still tried to think the better of it. It was entirely possible we just had similar destinations.

I played on my phone for about an hour, and then packed up to head to the next bus that would take me close to my Wallingford home. 

He got on the bus. And now he was glancing at me much more often. This was when the dread started filling my stomach. I watched him out of the corner of my eye, and when my stop came I hopped off quickly and started fast walking down the street. 

The streets leading to my home were dark, and dangerous, along the edge of the highway. I only lived in this place for 3 months because of how unsafe i always felt going to and from work. 

And he was behind me.

I was so scared, my phone had died because I was an idiot and wasted my battery playing that game (I now carry an external battery wherever I go). I already started tearing up in fear. 

And then I saw 2 girls walking side by side down the street. Without hesitation, I booked it to them. I heard the footsteps behind me suddenly get quicker and louder. Once I got to them, I nearly choked out ""Hes following me."" 

The first girl glanced behind us and saw him, and without hesitation she wrapped her arm around my shoulder and said loudly ""Its so nice to see you!!"".

We all heard the guy swear, and then he turned his heel. 

The girls walked me the 2 blocks to my house, made sure I was ok, and then we said our goodbyes.

&gt;Richard Russell: ""Yeeaah right! (pause) **Nah I'm a white guy. They--** (cuts off)""

The NYT audio compilation conveniently cuts the final line ""Nah, I'm a white guy"" and goes to the next audio clip. For an 8 minute clip, I'm sure there must be a *perfectly good reason* to edit a 3 second line.

Very simple process to get into Canada without an eTA/Visa from Sweden.

You simply fly to Seattle, then take a bus or cab up to one of the many borders to Vancouver. 

An eTA Visa from Sweden is only required if you're flying directly to Canada. Heck, I would even pick you up at the border. I have a media pass myself and will be going to the event. :)

Here is proof from the Canadian Gov't website:
http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/visas-result.asp?country=SE&amp;result=2

As you see, I have Sweden selected as country of origin and although you cannot fly directly too Canada you can fly to Seattle (or even closer to the border Bellingham) and just drive/ walk through.

cariboustewwwwwwwww,2018-07-31 21:57:54+00:00,[OC] What if the NBA had 100 teams?,"Talk about expansion is all over American professional sports, and basketball  is no exception. The NBA’s a bit different from most leagues, though, in that (besides Seattle) it’s not entirely sure *where* it wants to expand to. The other leagues are more certain -- hockey has Quebec City and Hamilton, soccer has at least 6 cities on standby, the NFL’s got at least a couple more teams to fit in the LA metro area, and Baltimore could really use a professional baseball team. The NBA, though? There's no consensus. Maybe Kansas City, maybe Louisville, maybe Omaha, that dude who was talking about Little Rock a while ago, Mexico City, Hampton Roads, Montreal, Vegas, St. Louis, Vancouver, who knows how many others. 

So why limit it to only adding one or two? If we’re gonna be expanding the league, I feel like we should be really, truly expanding the league. Maybe balloon is the better word, actually. Or detonate. I don’t know. Regardless, your initial reaction might be, “aren’t there innumerable downsides to suddenly rivalling D-1 college football in size?” And yes, but I believe there are also upsides:

1. There are dozens of cities that want an NBA team, and it’d be rude to turn them down. Would you go up to some little kid playing basketball in Edmonton and tell him he doesn’t deserve a pro team? I wouldn’t, mostly because they could probably beat me up, but that’s besides the point

2. The NBA is, like every other business in this hellworld, built on the back of the eldritch horror that is capitalism, a beast whose thirst for profit is unquenchable. Seventy more teams means 3.3 times the profit for its gaping maw

3. I’m from San Diego and this is the only realistic way I could get a local team

4. With this level of team saturation, team moves wouldn’t really happen anymore, mostly because there would be no open cities for the teams to move to. As a Kings fan, this would really take a load off my mind

5. Basketball and hockey both have a blessing football and baseball sadly don’t: their stadiums don’t take many people to fill up. The biggest NBA stadium doesn’t break 21,000 people, and the biggest basketball stadium *in the world* barely meets the *minimum* requirement for an NFL stadium, and it’s in the Philippines anyway. This means the NBA can expand to cities the NFL and MLB never could.

6. If this doesn’t happen, and expansion continues at the incredibly slow pace it’s going right now, we’ll still get to a number of teams that seems ungodly today at some point. The UN’s more moderate projections predict a US population of 450 million by 2100, and a North American population of 650 million, so it’s not like there won’t be enough fans in the future. Why not make the teams now, so not only will everyone get the teams they’d eventually get anyway, but also so those 2100 fans will have successful histories to look back on longingly when their team finishes 78th overall?

I believe these benefits outweigh the myriad problems the NBA would face with 100 teams. 

#The teams

So we’ve decided that there should be enough NBA teams to match the entire minor league baseball pyramid in a single league. Sweet! But where should we put all the new teams?

1. Firstly, we should put teams back in the cities who lost theirs to a move. That means, yes, bringing back the Sonics, but also adding teams in 11 other cities, not including the [Quad Cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quad_cities) and Fort Wayne because I’m trying to maintain at least a facsimile of realism. So there’s 41 teams.

2. Secondly, we wanna add teams to metro areas that can support them, which given point 5 shouldn’t be too hard. However, we’re gonna want to start with the non-American markets, since we don’t want America hogging all the teams. Since it’s the least complicated one, let’s do Canada first: every metro area with a population over 800,000 people -- half of that of the smallest NBA metro area, Salt Lake City -- gets a team (plus Winnipeg, since it barely misses the mark). There’s 47. 

3. Next we’ll add Mexican teams, which is more complex, since Mexico’s already got a pro basketball league, the LNBP. Should we even try to break through it? Not in *all* of Mexico, but in the north, yes; the cities (and the 4 existing northern LNBP teams) are pretty far from the south, and culturally pretty distinct as well. Besides those 4, we’ll also add another 5 metro areas without preexisting teams, since they’re big enough to support teams as well. There’s 56.

4. Why not add some Caribbean teams? Oh, what’s that you’re bemusedly listing? Reasons to not add Caribbean teams? That'd be great if I cared. Now there are really only 6 metro areas with enough people in the Caribbean for a team, but we’ll leave one of them, Port-au-Prince, out -- Haiti’s still reeling from the 2010 earthquake. There’s 62.

5. Also, just since they’ve got the people to support it and I like intercity rivalries, let’s add one team to metro areas that can handle more than one team, like Chicago and Dallas. That brings us up to 69. As a mature and respectable adult, I had an entirely mature and respectable response to that number when it came up. 

6. So now we’re finally able to add teams to new cities in the U.S. itself. We’ve got 31 left to work with, which is more than enough to sprinkle across the the country. I tried to spread them out evenly, which is why there’s a Boise team but not a Richmond team, and also wasn’t incredibly strenuous in my city choices, by which I mean I avoided cities I don’t like. In other words, if you’re annoyed your city didn’t get a team, you’re taking this more seriously than I am.

Also, I decided to stick with the 5-team division model in the current NBA, but put 5 in each conference, and bump the number of conferences up to 4, named after cardinal directions because I’m creative but not quite creative enough. Here they are:

As you can tell, the team names are the only (mostly) serious thing in this post. I tried to make up for it with the division names

#The Expansion Draft

So we’ve got 100 teams now, but we don’t have players for them. The CBA guarantees a league average of 14 players per team, which would mean we’ll need 1400 players for the league. That’s, uh. That’s a lot. How are we gonna get such a ridiculous number of players?

One word: G League. Two words. One and a half words. Who cares. See, there were 491 players at the beginning of the 2017-18 season, which, combined with the rosters of the teams we stole from Mexico, could probably be raised to about 550. The G League, though, has at least a thousand players -- I didn’t bother figuring the exact number, suffice to say there’s a lot -- more than making up for the deficit. 

So here’s what I’m proposing as an expansion draft: each already-existing team from the NBA or LNBP can keep 2 of their players, and the rest are thrown into a lottery consisting of them and every 2017-18 G League player. The players are then chosen at random and assigned to each team in a ridiculously long ceremony probably spread out over the space of 2 or 3 weeks. Truly a waste of time for everyone involved, just like this post was a waste of my time, but a necessary waste of time to ensure there’s basketball for the fans to watch. Maybe not good basketball, but basketball.

#The Season 

Instead of an 82-game season, I’m thinking we expand it to 110: 15 4-game series with 15 in-conference teams, then 25 2-game series with 25 out-of-conference teams. 
 
So after this season of only interacting with less than half the league, we come to the playoffs. What we should do here is obvious: the same thing the NBA does, but instead of 16 teams we go up to 64, 16 from each conference. Teams are reseeded once we get down to 16, then 4. This might be kind of an unnecessarily long playoff season, reminiscent of early MLS when 8 of 10 teams went to the playoffs, and I’m sure there’s more scientific ways to do it with fewer than 50 teams, but I’m not a science man, so whatever. 

Who wins? Who knows. Probably Golden State, since they’d keep KD and Steph and also because God is real and he hates us. Maybe we’d get an upset from Hawai’i or Albuquerque or something. Whatever, it’s 2:00 AM and I have to wake up at 7:00, I barely care anymore. Thanks for coming to my TED talk",nba,9568
TheDuzzyFuckling,2018-07-31 10:35:38+00:00,The College Football World Cup,"Surprise! The 2017 college football season was really just the qualifying campaign for the NCAA's new FIFA inspired tournament of champions. The CFB Playoffs last year? We'll call that the Confederations Cup. The regular season? Regional qualifying. Out-of-conference games? Let's say those were international friendlies that counted towards qualifying. (I'm gonna bend the rules a lot to make this work).

&amp;nbsp;

The format of this CFWC will follow the new 2026 WC format, with 48 teams qualifying and 32 of them moving on to the single-elimination knockout rounds. But first, how many bids does each region (conference) get to the CFWF? Let's use the average ranking from the post-season CBS 130 Rankings to gauge how well each region finished. And who's hosting? Well I looked forward to where the 2019 National Championship Game is being hosted, and its Levi Stadium in Santa Clara! The Bay Area has two CFB teams that matter (sorry SJSU), so California has been chosen as the host of the first ever College Football World Cup!

&amp;nbsp;

Region | Highest Ranked Team | Lowest Ranked Team | Average Ranking
--------|--------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------
SEC | 1. Alabama | 96. Tennessee | 46.4
ACC | 5. Clemson | 93. North Carolina | 46.8
Big XII | 3. Oklahoma | 123. Kansas | 47.6
Pac-12 | 11. USC | 112. Oregon State | 47.8
Big Ten | 6. Ohio State | 108. Illinois | 48.9
American | 4. UCF | 114. UConn | 69.8
Indy | 13. Notre Dame | 115. Idaho | 78.0
MWC | 24. Boise State | 128. San José State | 82.3
C-USA | 25. FAU | 130. UTEP | 85.5
MAC | 35. Toledo | 127. Ball State | 87.9
Sun Belt | 33. Troy | 126. Texas State | 93.2

&amp;nbsp;

Some notes before we continue: Idaho was kicked out of FBS because they literally couldn't find a sober person in Moscow to coach the team and New Mexico State was kicked out of the Sun Belt when everyone realized that they're like 500 miles away from the actual Sun Belt. Neither team qualified anyway.

&amp;nbsp;

I did some math based on region size and average ranking, and here's what I came up with for bids:

&amp;nbsp;

Region | Number of Bids | Notes
--------|:-----------------:|---------
SEC | 8 | The best overall conference gets the most bids. Easy decision.
ACC | 7 | The top half of the ACC makes it in. Seems reasonable.
Big XII | 5 | Again, the better half of the Big XII deserves a shot at glory. They'd get more bids if the region was bigger.
Pac-12 | 6 | Something tells me that Khalil Tate will find his way into the CFWC.
Big Ten | 6 | The lower half of the Big Ten drags them down to only 6 entrants. Someone gets Italy'd.
American | 4 | The top third of the AAC has shown in the last few years that they can compete with anyone.
MWC | 3 | If the Mountain West wants to be the ""Power 6"" we should probably play football better, starting with this tournament.
Indy | 2 | Maybe someday BYU will have another chance at a totally legitimate Natty.
C-USA | 2 | If you win a C-USA region, I'm saying... there's a chance.
MAC | 2 | Honestly only one MAC team deserved a spot but I just feel bad.
Sun Belt | 2 | The #funbelt deserves two bids for double the #fun.
Host | 1 | California's rich football history and huge fan base make them an obvious choice for the Bay Area host.

&amp;nbsp;

The next part is the most controversial one: which teams deserve to make it from each conference? I attempted to determine it from overall record and then conference record, taking head-to-head results into account. Some of you will hate me because your team should've played better in conference. Wah wah.

&amp;nbsp;

**SEC**  
1. Alabama  
2. Georgia  
3. Auburn  
4. LSU  
5. South Carolina  
6. Mississippi State  
7. Kentucky  
8. Missouri

&amp;nbsp;

The ""Confederations Cup"" champion and runner up top the group. Perennial powerhouses Auburn and LSU are next, followed by SCAR and Mississippi State, with Kentucky and Missouri slipping into the last two spots. Sorry Texas A&amp;M, you are the Dutch of this College Football World Cup. Maybe in four years.

&amp;nbsp;

**ACC**  
1. Clemson  
2. Miami  
3. NC State  
4. Virginia Tech  
5. Wake Forest  
6. Boston College  
7. Louisville

&amp;nbsp;

Clemson and Miami are legitimate threats to go all the way. NC State and Virginia Tech are riding the hype train until it goes off the rails, as usual. Wake Forest and Boston College sneak is as upset threats, and Louisville rides on the back of Lamar Jackson into the tournament. Sorry Florida State, your in-conference record was ass and you had to reschedule a game cancelled by a hurricane just to keep your bowl streak alive. You and Southern Miss are both missing this tournament.

&amp;nbsp;

**Big Ten**  
1. Wisconsin  
2. Ohio State  
3. Penn State  
4. Northwestern  
5. Michigan State  
6. Michigan

&amp;nbsp;

There is no debate about Wisconsin, Ohio State, and Penn State - they deserve to be here. Michigan State and Northwestern are quietly two of the best teams in the Big Ten, each achieving ten win seasons. Jim Harbaugh and Michigan ride into the tournament on a winning conference record and a fresh pair of khakis. Sorry Iowa, you cannot into CFWC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Pac-12**  
1. USC  
2. Washington  
3. Stanford  
4. Washington State  
5. Arizona State  
6. Arizona

&amp;nbsp;

Sam Darnold leads USC into the tournament, with Coach Pete and Washington close behind. The Cardinal ride in on Bryce Love's shoulders, while Luke Falk literally destroys his body and potential NFL career to get WSU in. The state of Arizona squeaks in on winning in-conference records. Sorry Utah, UCLA, and Oregon. Utah may have been the only Pac-12 team to win a bowl, but their measly 3-6 in-conference record doesn't deserve a spot. UCLA misses out, but Josh Rosen is busy at home being an ""entitled millennial"" anyway. (Also I'm not sorry about Oregon, you suck).

&amp;nbsp;

**Big XII**  
1. Oklahoma  
2. TCU  
3. Oklahoma State  
4. Iowa State  
5. Kansas State  
6. West Virginia

&amp;nbsp;

The biggest surprise here is that Iowa State comes in at the fourth spot. Powerhouses OU, TCU, and OSU lead the group with always consistent Kansas State and uber-talented but often injured and inconsistent WVU also included. Texas status: not back. 

&amp;nbsp;

**American**  
1. UCF  
2. USF  
3. Memphis  
4. Houston

&amp;nbsp;

Sorry Navy &amp; SMU, Houston edged you out in conference. UCF is hoping to continue its undefeated streak and possibly claim a legitimate national title. Quinton Flowers and USF will turn heads as they seek more postseason glory. Memphis has explosive talent and a potent offense that will score major points, as long as their defense isn't on the field too much.

&amp;nbsp;

**Mountain West**  
1. Boise State  
2. Fresno State  
3. SDSU

&amp;nbsp;

Only the Sun Belt has less teams in the Top 100. Fresno State shocked everyone by qualifying ahead of SDSU after going 1-11 in 2016. The Broncos and Aztecs are no strangers to being on top of this conference. Boise State looks to prove again that it is the undisputed king of the Group of 5 conferences.

&amp;nbsp;

**Independent**  
1. Notre Dame  
2. Army

&amp;nbsp;

New Mexico State is hoping for a strong 2021 campaign to qualify from this anti-geographical region. Notre Dame is going to be to Independents what New Zealand will be to Oceania in future FIFA World Cups. Army charges in on the back of the triple option.

&amp;nbsp;

**Conference USA**  
1. FAU  
2. North Texas  

&amp;nbsp;

The Lane Train and the Mean Green get a shot at glory. UAB almost surprised everyone and qualified. Most casual CFB fans probably can't name any other teams in C-USA.

&amp;nbsp;

**MAC**  
1. Toledo  
2. Akron

&amp;nbsp;

If Toledo and Akron could join forces, rocket-powered kangaroos could mix things up a bit. Unfortunately, they'll have to compete separately. Good luck, MAC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Sun Belt**  
1. Troy  
2. Appalachian State

&amp;nbsp;

Troy quietly went 11-2 during the qualifying campaign and will hope to turn some heads with a group stage upset. Does App State still have upset magic in them as well?

&amp;nbsp;

There you have it - the teams that will be competing for the first ever College Football World Cup. Next we have to sort the teams into groups based on strength and region. There will be 16 groups labelled A through P, with a team from each pot. Pots are determined by CBS Rankings. Cal is automatically assigned Pot 1 status and placed in the first position in Group A.

&amp;nbsp;

Pot 1 | Pot 2 | Pot 3
------|-------|-------
California (Host) | Stanford | Troy
Alabama | Michigan State | Michigan
Georgia | Northwestern | Toledo
Oklahoma | Memphis | Army
UCF | USF | Fresno State
Clemson | Mississippi State | SDSU
Ohio State | LSU | Boston College
Wisconsin | Virginia Tech | West Virginia
Penn State | Boise State | Kansas State
TCU | FAU | Arizona State
Auburn | NC State | Arizona
USC | Wake Forest | Missouri
Miami | South Carolina | Appalachian State
Notre Dame | Iowa State | Houston
Oklahoma State | Washington State | Kentucky
Washington | Louisville | Akron

&amp;nbsp;

Now for group selection! Teams were sorted into groups using a random letter generator for A-P. Random letters sometimes had to be regenerated so that no group had two teams from the same region.

&amp;nbsp;

----- Group A -----|----- Group B -----|----- Group C -----|----- Group D -----
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
California | Wisconsin | Notre Dame | Auburn
USF | LSU | Virginia Tech | Michigan State
Army | Kansas State | Toledo | Arizona State

&amp;nbsp;

----- Group E -----|----- Group F -----|----- Group G -----|----- Group H -----
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
TCU | Washington | USC | Oklahoma
Washington State | NC State | South Carolina | Northwestern
Houston | Appalachian State | Akron | Boston College

&amp;nbsp;

----- Group I -----|----- Group J -----|----- Group K -----|----- Group L -----
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
Oklahoma State | Georgia | Ohio State | UCF
Memphis | Louisville | Wake Forest | Boise State
Missouri | Michigan | Fresno State | Kentucky

&amp;nbsp;

----- Group M -----|----- Group N -----|----- Group O -----|----- Group P -----
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
Clemson | Penn State | Alabama | Miami
Mississippi State | FAU | Iowa State | Stanford
SDSU | West Virginia | Arizona | Troy

&amp;nbsp;

And now its time for the final simulation! Games were simulated at least ten times with the average score used for the final result. Some groups relied on score differential to decide who moved into the elimination round! Opponents play each other once with the top two teams advancing. Each team plays one ""home"" and one ""away"" game.

&amp;nbsp;

**GROUP STAGE----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

&amp;nbsp;

**Group A**  
USF defeats California, 35-17  
California defeats Army, 30-20  
USF defeats Army, 27-20  

&amp;nbsp;

1. USF (6 pts)  
2. California (3 pts)  
3. Army (0 pts)

&amp;nbsp;

USF charges through in arguably the easiest group, with California stopping Army's run game and taking the second spot. Army goes home with the satisfaction of being the only military academy to qualify for the tournament.

&amp;nbsp;

**Group B**  
Wisconsin defeats LSU, 23-17  
Wisconsin defeats Kansas State, 30-13  
LSU defeats Kansas State, 28-15  

&amp;nbsp;

1. Wisconsin (6 pts)  
2. LSU (3 pts)  
3. Kansas State (0 pts)

&amp;nbsp;

Kansas State's defense just can't stop Wisconsin and LSU as they comfortably advance.

&amp;nbsp;

**Group C**  
Notre Dame defeats Virginia Tech, 35-10  
Notre Dame defeats Toledo, 33-27  
Virginia Tech defeats Toledo, 25-21  

&amp;nbsp;

1. Notre Dame (6 pts)  
2. Virginia Tech (3 pts)  
3. Toledo (0 pts)

&amp;nbsp;

Toledo somehow holds Notre Dame closer than Virginia Tech, but ultimately fails. The Fighting Irish are rolling.

&amp;nbsp;

**Group D**  
Auburn defeats Michigan State, 26-14  
Auburn defeats Arizona State, 30-15  
Michigan State defeats Arizona State, 26-19  

&amp;nbsp;

1. Auburn (6 pts)  
2. Michigan State (3 pts)  
3. Arizona State (0 pts)

&amp;nbsp;

No real surprises here. The Pac-12 failing in the postseason? Color me shocked.

&amp;nbsp;

**Group E**  
TCU defeats Washington State, 33-18  
Houston defeats TCU, 26-25  
Washington State defeats Houston, 31-21

&amp;nbsp;

1. TCU (+14) (3 pts)  
2. Washington State (-5) (3 pts)  
3. Houston (-9) (3 pts)

&amp;nbsp;

The first big surprise! Houston holds off TCU but eventually gets eliminated on score differential after Luke Falk &amp; the Fighting Leaches decides that Pullman needs a happy reason to drink (for once).

&amp;nbsp;

**Group F**  
Washington defeats NC State, 23-14  
Washington defeats Appalachian State, 24-20   
NC State defeats Appalachian State, 29-15

&amp;nbsp;

1. Washington (6 pts)  
2. NC State (3 pts)  
3. Appalachian State (0 pts)

&amp;nbsp;

Washington saw that Washington State placed second in Group E and it became inevitable that a replay of the Apple Cup would occur in the first elimination round. Appalachian State keeps it fairly close but NC State wins it for Tar Heel State bragging rights.

&amp;nbsp;

**Group G**  
USC defeats South Carolina, 25-21  
USC defeats Akron, 27-11  
South Carolina defeats Akron, 31-3

&amp;nbsp;

1. USC (6 pts)  
2. South Carolina (3 pts)  
3. Akron (0 pts)

&amp;nbsp;

In a game to decide who the real USC is, the Trojans win late to stave off the SEC. Akron loses both games on their way to becoming the worst performer of the tournament. Womp womp.

&amp;nbsp;

**Group H**  
Oklahoma defeats Northwestern, 44-18  
Oklahoma defeats Boston College, 43-22  
Northwestern defeats Boston College, 22-11

&amp;nbsp;

1. Oklahoma (6 pts)  
2. Northwestern (3 pts)  
3. Boston College (0 pts)

&amp;nbsp;

Baker Mayfield grabs his crotch at least five times as Oklahoma outscore first round opponents 87-40. Northwestern shows that they deserve to be here.

&amp;nbsp;

**Group I**  
Oklahoma State defeats Memphis, 41-27  
Missouri defeats Oklahoma State, 35-28  
Missouri defeats Memphis, 40-28

&amp;nbsp;

1. Missouri (6 pts)  
2. Oklahoma State (3 pts)
3. Memphis (0 pts)

&amp;nbsp;

Missouri somehow exceeds expectations and win the group. The Memphis defense couldn't get off the field.

&amp;nbsp;

**Group J**  
Georgia defeats Louisville, 39-16  
Georgia defeats Michigan, 29-12  
Michigan defeats Louisville, 23-22

&amp;nbsp;

1. Georgia (6 pts)  
2. Michigan (3 pts)  
3. Louisville (0 pts)

&amp;nbsp;

Georgia scorches through to the next round. Lamar Jackson goes home early because Harbaugh FINALLY does something right.

&amp;nbsp;

**Group K**  
Ohio State defeats Wake Forest, 34-15  
Ohio State defeats Fresno State, 35-16  
Wake Forest defeats Fresno State, 29-16

&amp;nbsp;

1. Ohio State (6 pts)  
2. Wake Forest (3 pts)  
3. Fresno State (0 pts)

&amp;nbsp;

Cinderella story Fresno State gets on the board in both games, but ultimately can't compete with Power 5 talent and coaching. You'll get 'em next time, Tedford.

&amp;nbsp;

**Group L**  
UCF defeats Boise State, 33-20  
UCF defeats Kentucky, 27-23  
Boise State defeats Kentucky, 24-20

&amp;nbsp;

1. UCF (6 pts)
2. Boise State (3 pts)
3. Kentucky (0 pts)

&amp;nbsp;

THE GROUP OF FIVE SAYS, ""NOT TODAY, SEC."" The Golden Knights and Broncos are now G5BFFs.

&amp;nbsp;

**Group M**  
Clemson defeats Mississippi State, 19-18  
SDSU defeats Clemson, 22-20  
Mississippi State defeats SDSU, 32-17

&amp;nbsp;

1. Mississippi State (+14) (3 pts)
2. Clemson (-1) (3 pts)
3. SDSU (-13) (3 pts)

&amp;nbsp;

UPSET ALERT: Clemson cannot stop Rashaad Penny and SDSU's defense holds. Unfortunately, the Mountain West will not put two teams in the next round, as Mississippi State steamrolls SDSU after a close loss to Clemson, who advances on score differential.

&amp;nbsp;

**Group N**  
Penn State defeats FAU, 32-21  
Penn State defeats West Virginia, 30-24  
FAU defeats West Virginia, 38-21

&amp;nbsp;

1. Penn State (6 pts)  
2. FAU (3 pts)  
3. West Virginia (0 pts)

&amp;nbsp;

ALL ABOARD THE LANE TRAIN, CHOO CHOO MOTHERFUCKERS.

&amp;nbsp;

**Group O**  
Alabama defeats Iowa State, 34-13  
Alabama defeats Arizona, 38-22  
Iowa State defeats Arizona, 29-23

&amp;nbsp;

1. Alabama (6 pts)
2. Iowa State (3 pts)
3. Arizona (0 pts)

&amp;nbsp;

'Bama does what 'Bama does best. Khalil Tate is stymied by the defense that also told Baker Mayfield, ""DON'T.""

&amp;nbsp;

**Group P**  
Stanford defeats Miami, 22-20  
Miami defeats Troy, 26-13  
Stanford defeats Troy, 31-15

&amp;nbsp;

1. Stanford (6 pts)  
2. Miami (3 pts)  
3. Troy (0 pts)

&amp;nbsp;

Stanford and Miami play a close one. Neither falls to the same fate that LSU did during the regular season. This kills the Troy.

&amp;nbsp;

**ROUND OF 32----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

&amp;nbsp;

**A1 vs. B2**  
LSU defeats USF, 28-21    
The Bulls' dreams come to an end here after a close loss to LSU, the only second place team to win in the Round of 32.

&amp;nbsp;

**C1 vs. D2**  
Notre Dame defeats Michigan State, 31-14  
The Spartans just can't stop Brandon Wimbush in this classic matchup as the Irish continue rolling and increase their all time series lead.

&amp;nbsp;

**E1 vs. F2**  
TCU defeats NC State, 25-18  
The Horned Frogs comfortably win as Ryan Finley throws 17 interceptions but still gets Heisman mentions for some reason.

&amp;nbsp;

**G1 vs. H2**  
USC defeats Northwestern, 32-17  
Sam Darnold is looking like the 2018 Cleveland Browns starting quarterback.

&amp;nbsp;

**I1 vs. J2**  
Missouri defeats Michigan, 27-18  
Is there any better way for Harbaugh to go out other than losing to the worst SEC team in the tournament? He could almost smell the familiar confines of Levi's Stadium from here.

&amp;nbsp;

**K1 vs. L2**  
Ohio State defeats Boise State, 38-14  
Boise State keeps it close until halftime, but ultimately can't hold on. Ohio State pulls away as JT Barrett desperately petitions for a 29th year of eligibility.

&amp;nbsp;

**M1 vs. N2**  
Mississippi State defeats FAU, 27-21  
The Lane Train goes crashing off the rails as the Bulldogs steal a late win. Kiffin furiously tweets trash talk about the refs during the game.

&amp;nbsp;

**O1 vs. P2**  
Alabama defeats Miami, 33-12  
Nick Saban steals the turnover chain from the Miami sideline after the game and gives it to Satan as a sacrificial gift.

&amp;nbsp;

**B1 vs. A2**  
Wisconsin defeats California, 32-13  
The hosts perform admirably, but can't stop the Horniboi from throwing TD bombs.

&amp;nbsp;

**D1 vs. C2**  
Auburn defeats Virginia Tech, 34-9  
Virginia Tech's stout defense lays down and dies during the game. Gus Malzahn has earned himself one more year.

&amp;nbsp;

**F1 vs. E2**  
Washington defeats Washington State, 27-16  
The city of Seattle has another reason to be smug. The city of Pullman has been drunk for several weeks and will be for several more. At least WSU didn't give up 41 this time.

&amp;nbsp;

**H1 vs. G2**  
Oklahoma defeats South Carolina, 36-18  
Baker Mayfield actually pulls his dick out in the endzone and sceams, ""THIS IS WHAT A REAL GAMECOCK LOOKS LIKE."" The NCAA fines South Carolina for provoking him and his draft stock increases.

&amp;nbsp;

**J1 vs. I2**  
Georgia defeats Oklahoma State, 36-20  
The Dawgs are barking as Sony Michel and Nick Chubb each score a pair on the ground.

&amp;nbsp;

**L1 vs. K2**  
UCF defeats Wake Forest, 32-23

NinetyDolphions,2018-07-25 06:02:41+00:00,"""I’ve Never Met a Female in CS:GO Before""","I like playing CS:GO. Usually my profile picture is a character from a movie/TV show, and my name is very generic, you would never think I was a girl based off my picture/name because I don’t ask for that attention.
I was playing deathmatch with my internet best friend Derrick at an ungodly time of night, just talking about our thoughts and morals over voice chat in lobby. The server had about 7 people, in it and everyone would throw their 2 cents in with our conversation. It was pleasant and much needed, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Everyone was kind and respectful (something you hardly see on this game). 
One person had no microphone and only talked to us via chat. He told Derrick and I “I’ve never wanted to be friends with someone over this game before, so badly. Will you guys add me? I promise I’ll have a mic tomorrow.” I was a lonely person back then, so I accepted his friend request. His name was Corey. 
Derrick and I played CS:GO deathmatch nightly, just talking about all sorts of things. For 4 days straight, Corey would join us without invite. We found it odd he would join us, because he mentioned how strict he is with himself about being on a tight schedule and how dedicated he is for school. Because of this, we never invited him to our games. 
Which funnily enough, Corey got upset that we didn’t invite him to deathmatches, even though he told us he was focused on school and we only played late at night.
One way or another, Corey got the impression Derrick and I were dating, despite Derrick talking about his girlfriend at least once a day. I told Corey “Yes, we are obviously dating, because a male and a female can never be just friends.” My voice was as flat as I could make it sound, and as bland as I could try. Corey did not understand my sarcasm and ran with the thought of Derrick and I dating. 
Immediately, Corey tried his best to win over Derrick by buying him in-game valuables. (Case keys, a few skins worth real money) Everytime Corey would give Derrick these things, Corey would tell him “You better be treating her right, otherwise you will pay for it.” Derrick is a nice guy and has a hard time with confrontation, so he never replied to those messages, he would only relay them back to me. 
After 2 days of getting these gifts, I told Corey while in deathmatch “You do realize I was sarcastic with you when you asked if Derrick and I were dating, right? Derrick has a girlfriend and she doesn’t play video games.” Corey’s voice immediately goes into a much calmer voice during this game and does not stop saying “Oh thank god, thank you lord all mighty. You have blessed my life. Thank you.” Random people would tell him to stop talking and he’s being creepy. I didn’t say anything to Corey for a while after that because despite being over the internet, I felt an awkward connection with him. 
The following day, Day 7 of knowing Corey, he asks me to join him in a private game. I have immense anxiety with being alone with someone, no matter the circumstances. I simply tell Corey “No thank you, but thanks for the offer.” Corey tries to call me over voice, and I get a weird nervous feeling. I knew something was odd about this random voice call request. I check on his profile and he edited his entire profile to fit a 2008 emo myspace account. He changed his picture from Harambe to rain on a window, and his bio went from “I inject memes for harambe” to “My life is meaningless without her”. That was one of the most bizzare things I saw unfold in front of me over a video game. He explains to me that he wanted to play a private game with just me so he could plan a meet up with me and go get some coffee. He could tell where I lived because I told Derrick and Corey about the Seattle super hero I ran into a while back. But that was only the beginning of the creepy things he would say to me.
 At one point he said “your voice makes me trust you.” That made my skin crawl. Another time in the middle of a match he said in front of everyone “Is your body as smooth as your voice? You sound like a goddess on cake.” That made me almost vomit. A few more examples include “You make me want to just snuggle up on my bed and go to sleep."" in a cutesy tone, or saying “teehee” out loud instead of just laughing.“But whenever he said something creepy I would just ignore it or awkwardly say “thanks my dude”. It felt as if he practiced for hours just to say these lines to me, just unnatural. 
I knew this guy did not talk to any other females, because he told me so. “Girls in real life just find me creepy and whenever I approach them, they ignore me.” Is what he said, something I should have spotted as a red flag.  One day, he tries to send out a call request that I ended up hitting “ignore” on. I message him and say “What's up? Everything okay?” He only replies with “Not even close.” I had no clue what to respond with, so I just waited for a follow up message. 10 minutes pass by, and he spams me with personal questions. “What kind of males are you into? Do you only date tall skinny men? Do you care what other people think?” I oddly feel guilty, and feel obligated to reply with honest answers. I tell him “I care to an extent of what people look like. As long as they take care of themselves, I couldn’t care less what my friends look like. I don’t really have a unique type. I just want a healthy looking guy, regardless of height. Why do you ask?” 
He describes to me what he looks like, followed by a total of 10 photos. I never asked for a picture of him. It never crossed my mind to ask him what he looks like. He asks me all sorts of questions related to “Am I attractive enough? Am I too skinny? Too short? Do I have good hair?” I tell him “You look nice”. He was very skinny, average height, and looked like he took care of himself. A very normal looking human being. He replies with “Thanks, you’re so sweet. Such a lovely girl.” I don’t message him back, and just launch CSGO because Derrick was playing. We play our game of deathmatch and talk about the normal stuff. We make friendly talk with a complete stranger, and at the peak of it, Corey joins. Corey says nothing while we are all playing. I do not have notifications on when I play, so I have to manually check my messages while I’m in game. During map change, I realized I got flooded by Corey asking “Do you find this guy attractive? Does he sound hot to you? Is he funnier than me?” 
I ignore his messages and keep playing. I did not want to deal with that from him. I only knew him for 2 weeks at this point. Corey notices I am ignoring his messages, and he confronts me in front of this server of 20 people. “Why aren’t you replying back to me in steam?” I tell him “I don't have notification on, I’m too busy playing a game to want to hold a conversation while playing a game.” Corey goes on this rant about “I thought we were friends, why would you ignore me? Friends dont ignore each other.” and I don’t respond to him. This is all over voice, so everyone can hear him. I’m clearly uncomfortable and a random player tells Corey “You’re being kinda creepy dude, she clearly doesn’t want to respond to your weird messages.” Corey screams at the top of his lungs at this guy to “Go kill yourself, you useless human being, you don’t know her like I do.” and he promptly leaves. 
Derrick and I keep playing our game, ignoring our messages. After an hour, we get off the game and I open my messages. From Corey, I get a roller coaster of messages and feelings ranging from “I’m so sorry I screamed, you didn't need to hear that side of me” To “How dare you fucking ignore me” I reply with “You’re taking this friendship pretty fast, I think you should just calm down and take a break. The deepest thing I know about you, is your name and your favorite meme.” He replies with “You’re right. Goodnight.” I was hoping that maybe, for once, that would be the end of it and he would actually listen. I couldn’t be more wrong.
The following day, I wake up to my Steam app being spammed from Corey. “I need you, I’m at the hospital” A few things I noticed, he was on steam via web browser. Your name will have a web browser icon if you're logged in through your web browser and not steam/phone. Another thing I  noticed, he said he was on his phone. If this was actually true, it would have had a mobile icon next to him name. I knew he did not have a phone, because he told me “I broke mine last month when I threw it against the wall.” I remembered that because I think odd about people who destroy things in moments of anger. I don't mention either of these things to Corey, I figured he was lying because he was in the heat of a moment and was too scared to tell me the truth. I ask him why he is there and his response was “I don’t know, I was puking blood all last night for 8 hours and my mom and dad took me here. I’m so scared” 
Again, I was naive and let that slip. I found it odd that his parents would wait so many hours to take him to the hospital while he's puking blood. I didn’t tell corey of my suspicion though, I wanted to see where this was going. I assure him “You’ll be fine, I’m sure of it.” He said without a minute passing “My parents are talking with the doctor right now and they're crying. I don’t know what's going on.” I asked “why aren’t you in there with them?” He tells me he's going into the room, but he was stopped by a security officer who told him “I’m sorry we don’t think you’re ready for the news just yet. Have a seat.” I play dumb and don't question his bullshit story. I reply “It won't do you good to get worried about something you can't control.” 
He spams me with broken sentences such as “in sp scred rht npw plezde helo me” I understand when people are crying, it can be hard to see what you're typing, but he told me many times before “I’ve been hurt so bad before, I can't even cry. I didn't even cry when my brother died.”Also, he was typing perfectly clear and reable, before and after this message.  Again, I didn’t question his story. He quickly tells me “oh my god, they just told me I have cancer.” I respond with “didn’t you just get to the hospital a few hours ago?” He replies “Yes, its stage 4 skin cancer.” I didn't let him know I thought he was lying and was currently laughing.
I messaged Derrick about the situation, and don't reply to Corey for roughly 10 minutes. I open Coreys messages back up to find him explaining to me how he got his skin cancer. He apparently got it from a mole on his chest that he cut off because it was in the way, and it got infected with cancer. I didn’t think this lie could get any worse, so I confess to him I know he is lying. I express how disgusting it is to lie about having cancer, and that my adopted mother died of cancer herself. 
He rushes his response to “Oh my god I had no idea I’m so sorry. The reason I lied to you was because I am actually sick but with something else. I actually have type 1 diabetes. I lied because I didn’t want you to think I was fat.” I ask him if he remembers sending me pictures of himself and he said he remembers but he was worried I still thought he was fat. He probably weight at most, 120. 
I cut off contact with this guy on everything the same day. Roughly 6 months after deleting Corey, I run into him in real life. I knew it was him because his voice was unique and distinct. Corey never saw what I looked like, I never sent him pictures or posted on my instagram a selfie. I knew it was Corey and he looked the same as he did in those photos. This was during Seattle’s street fair, but I never thought I would run into this guy. I’m glad he didnt recognize me, I have no idea what I would have done if he did.

Expand to Seattle and Kansas City, get rid of conferences, make divisions way more important, and make 1-16 seeding 
in the playoffs.

#* Expansion - Seattle and Kansas City

Seattle is more or less penciled in to eventually get their team back.  That leaves one other city that needs to be 
added to make it even.  The city of choice: Kansas City, Missouri.  Kansas has the fanbase and appreciation for 
basketball through the Jayhawks, and an NBA ready stadium with the Sprint Center (which has already hosted 
preseason games before).  There is also this quote from an NBA executive back in May:

&gt; [“Jarrett, going to be real honest with you, Kansas City will get an NBA team at some point. It’s a real thing 
I’ve heard from multiple sources. Just a matter of time. Seattle and KC to me are most valuable markets for league 
expansion when it makes sense.”](https://twitter.com/JarrettTSutton/status/997522223073234944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw

#Eliminate Conferences, but push for much more importance with divisions.  

The rivalries will keep the fans engaged 
(even in years where certain teams might not be good), while also increasing the storylines between two teams' 
players who can drastically effect each other's standings in the playoffs.  Because there is nothing more satisfying in a lost year than ruining your division rival's shot at making the playoffs.  The new divisions are as follows:

#* Atlantic: Knicks, Nets, Celtics, Sixers 

NY, Boston, and Philly are tied to the hip by default in sports, so this is a gimme

#* Mideast: Raptors, Cavaliers, Pacers, Wizards 

Wizards are much closer to the Raptors, Cavs, and Pacers than they are to Miami and Orlando

#* Great Lakes: Pistons, Bulls, Bucks, Timberwolves 

Minnesota's distance to the people currently in their conference is insane, and you would increase the rivalry and 
engagement between fans much more to put these 4 NFC North rivals in a conference together

#* Southeast: Hornets, Hawks, Magic, Heat 

Falcons and Panthers fans hate each other already, bonus if Bucs fans are mostly Heat or Orlando fans

#* Southern: Mavs, Spurs, Rockets, Pelicans 

Texas Triangle is tied to the hip, with New Orleans being the closest to them

#* Central: Memphis, Thunder, Kansas City Knights*, Nuggets

With two Florida teams and 3 Texas teams, this is the closest Memphis was to enough teams for a division (which 
still isn't that far)

#* Southwest: Jazz, Suns, Clippers, Lakers

Nothing specific pairing these teams other than location and 4 other teams being closer to the coast and each other

#* Pacific: Warriors, Kings, Blazers, Supersonics

West Coast connection

---

#Season Schedule:

You play your division 9 times a year, and you play everybody else 2 times per year to equal 83 games a year.  Nine 
seems like a lot on paper, but the point is to influence organic rivalries between teams who in many cases don't 
have much reason to have any animosity to each other other than something historic like the Celtics/Lakers.  Now 
you get to see Donovan Mitchell versus Devin Booker, 9 times a year.  KP vs Embiid, 9 times a year.  Giannis vs KAT, 
9 times a year.  You get the idea.  You wanna make people hate another team, make them have to go at it that many times in the regular season *and* potentially see them in the playoffs.  Those guys will get very acquainted, very fast.  4 home games, 4 away games, and 1 game either to whoever has the better overall record, or in neutral territory if the league does a game in London (as an example).  This will also get rid of the idea of just making 
the seeding 1-16 without sorting out the issue of bad west teams facing good west teams and looking worse or better 
than they might actually be; now everybody outside of the division plays twice regardless.

---

#Playoff Seeding

1-16 seeding, *but* every team that wins their division gets home court advantage in the first round (top 8 seeds). 
 Then it is sorted out by best overall record for the remaining teams.  That would have made the 2018 playoffs 
(without adjusting the entire schedule for hypothetical match ups):

1. Rockets

2. Raptors

3. Warriors

4. Celtics

5. Thunder

6. Jazz

7. Timberwolves

8. Heat

9. Sixers

10. Cavs

11. Blazers

12. Pacers

13. Pelicans

14. Spurs

15. Nuggets

16. Bucks

With the Wizards just barely missing the playoffs with the Nuggets taking their place instead (which is only a 9-7 
West to East imbalance and not the drastic ones that people claim in hypotheticals).  Now before the ""How are the 
Blazers the 4 seed"" people point out the Heat being the 8 seed, my counter argument.  Yes, the Heat are technically 
the 8 seed, but that means that they have to go up against the 2nd best team from one of the best divisions in the 
league that year (in this case, the Sixers).  Which would mean that being strong in a weaker conference does not 
save you from tough match ups if you weren't able to handle your business outside of the division.  That makes the 
first round:

* Bucks @ Rockets

* Nuggets @ Raptors

* Spurs @ Warriors

* Pelicans @ Celtics

* Pacers @ Thunder

* Blazers @ Timberwolves

* Cavs @ Sixers

This opens up potential for even more rivalries from teams who may never meet unless they both make the Finals 
(which, while that raises the stakes if they do meet, takes away from that potential playoff battle that could 
happen).  This schedule gets the best of the best teams, while making divisions matter in the process.
And if a team ties that isn't inside the division (if the Wizards and the Bucks had tied this season, for example), 
make it a play-in game.  Whoever is higher in their division standings gets home court (in this hypothetical, Bucks 
get homecourt).

---

#The Draft

One of the main issues people point to for why there is such an imbalance in talent to go around the league is that 
the bad teams in the West get to be even worse because they face more superstars/superteams, giving them higher 
draft picks until they get a chance at superteams too.  Smoothing out the schedule outside of the divisions gets 
rid of that.  

The other solution is to make it so that the worst team in each division gets a top 8 pick.  This stops the middle 
of the league from becoming hollow ""purgatory"".  It also gets rid of the incentive for a team in the middle to blow 
it up in January.  For example, the entire Central Division could have made the playoffs in theory if the Wizards 
won one more game.  Which means there is no incentive for them to tank when they could knock off somebody else at 
the last minute.

If there were tanking left, it would be from the absolute worst in the conference or teams that just *barely* 
missed the cut tanking the last few games.  But that's better than teams trying to outtank each other for the 9th 
pick in the draft or teams playing meaningless games with 12 left to go knowing there's basically no chance.

---

#What if the NBA doesn't expand?

This becomes a lot harder on the Northwest conference without realignment, but it's not an impossible situation.

* Play everybody in your division 8 times a year

* Play everybody else 2 times a year (84 games a year, just cut back on preseason a little)

* Same playoff rules from above apply

* Same draft rules from above apply

---


I'm sure it isn't perfect, but even if an expansion doesn't happen, I think the playoffs become a lot more exciting 
if the schedule is tweaked to make the top teams the top and the bottom teams the bottom while decreasing the size 
of ""NBA purgatory"".  And I think it makes way more sense than something like a tournament for a draft pick or 
simply expanding without addressing how concentrated the talent can get on one team.  Games also mean more if they 
grow something organic with the geographic/historic rivals they already have that they just don't cater to at all.  
It can become something like the NFL where a team that might be completely out for the season plays their asses off 
specifically to screw a division rival out of the playoffs (which is how it should be in a sports division).",nba,1679

Envi_Sci_Guy,2018-07-17 13:27:47+00:00,"You're right, I don't work here. I'll be going now.","I worked in a restaurant a few years ago that was located just outside of a mall.  The day was some major shopping holiday so management expected a large turnout to the restaurant and had a ton of servers working the morning shift to handle the work load.  The only problem was that everyone was in the mall, and hardly anyone came into the restaurant. Most of the staff were just standing around and I decided that I wanted a milkshake that pretends to be coffee from everyone's favorite Seattle-based coffee chain.  I asked around for anyone who wanted something and got an order of maybe 6 drinks, each with their own requirements (skim milk in one, Sugar in the Raw in another, vanilla creamer in this one, etc.), wrote down the orders and went off to the coffee shop.

The coffee shop was at an intersection inside the mall and was absolutely mobbed. The line was wrapped around the corner. I had nothing better to do and I already collected orders and cash from my coworkers so I just waited and placed my order. Several minutes later my drinks came up. I bring them over to the prep station that has all the sugars and creamers and begin making everyone's coffee just so.

I pull out my slip of paper and the first coffee gives me a problem. My coworker wanted 4 packets of Sugar in the Raw.  I look at the sugar caddy and see the familiar white refined sugar packets, those yellow, pink, and blue packets of sweet chemicals that are somehow different from one another, and a conspicuously empty black tray that I assume used to have sugar in the raw. I look over to the counter and the employees are either a beautiful disaster or a well oiled machine; blenders are going, beans are being ground, the employees are shouting lingo back and forth to one another. They looked busy. I look back to the prep station and its is atop some cabinets. ""If I worked here,"" I thought, ""I would put all the extra shit for this station in these cabinets.""  It felt foolish to me to go bother an employee, break them out of their rhythm, and have them come move something from my knees to my hips. I knelt down and opened the cabinet.

Some Lady: Do you work here?

Me: No. (I'm dressed as a waiter in all black, wearing a black apron with red lettering on it)

Some Lady: Well then what do you think you're doing?

At this point I actually look at her thinking that SHE might work here. I guess I am kind of rummaging through cabinets and that might not be cool. I look over and she is just Some Lady, though, so I go back to my mission.

Me: I was just looking for some, ah, here we go. Sugar in the Raw.

I grab an handful and restock the empty black tray, thinking that will be the end of it, but of course it isn't.

SL: Why do you think that you can just do that? There are employees right over there. You really should have asked. Its their job anyway. You really should have told them. If they aren't going to stay on top of this then someone really should let them know. If they're too bust then they should have more people working here. That one isn't even working, you should have asked her. I'm going to let them know. You really shouldn't be doing this. You could have put anything in that cabinet. What were you really doing in there? I need to tell someone about this.

That was the gist of her tirade. I offer almost nothing in my defense but stammers and the beginnings of a few sentences that are immediately cut off. She then tells me to wait where I am because she is going to get the manager, then she walked away and cut to the front of the line.  I noticed that the refined sugar and pink chemicals were low so I restocked them, too, and then went back to making my coworkers' coffees.

I finished up and had two hands full of those compressed, recycled cardboard trays with 6 coffees and my own barely-coffee-mostly-milkshake, and I'm walking away when I hear her.

Some Lady: Yeah, that's him right there!

I turned on my heels to face this random do-gooder lady and a dead-eyed employee.

Dead Eyes: Um, sir? Did you go in the cabinet and, uh, restock the sugar.

Me: Yeah.

Dead Eyes: And are you leaving?

Me: Yeah.

Dead Eyes: Ok, then I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

Me: Right.

The random lady looked so pleased with herself. I think the nuance of the null interaction I had with the employee went right over her head. It made me super angry to see her smug smile and sense of self satisfaction, but I'm a well adjust young man so I just brushed it off and went back to the restaurant.  I tell it as the time I was kicked out of a coffee house for restocking their sugar caddy. I'm sorry if that was a bit anticlimactic.  I still do this, by the way. I rummage through cabinets all the time. Just the other day I needed a small Slurpee lid and did the exact same thing except everyone left me alone.

Tl;dr: I needed sugar in the raw but the coffee house was out, so I rummaged through their cabinets to find more.  A random lady took offense to this and had an employee ""kick me out.""",IDontWorkHereLady,3190

SPDScricketballsinc,2018-06-29 15:47:36+00:00,The Anomaly of Mark Buehrle,"We all know who Mark Buehrle is. He was a solid starter, who pitched with the pace of a 19th century player, threw a perfect game, and a 1 run complete game in game 2 of the ALCS.

But there is much more to him than that.
I grew up a sox fan, and loved mark buehrle, but I never realized how much of an outlier he was in so many ways. 

#Longevity + Health

Mark Buehrle threw at least 200 innings per year for 14 years straight. We may never see that accomplished ever again. The current leader in that stat is Corey Kluber with 4 seasons. How did he do this? He was **never on the disabled list** for his 16 year career. That is a remarkable achievement. Staying healthy requires a certain amount of luck, but sustaining 3200 innings of health is remarkable. 

#Contact Management

Mark Buehrle career ERA: 3.81
Mark Buehrle career FIP : 4.11

A difference in .3 between ERA and FIP over 3000 innings is crazy. How can you prevent runs with a high 80s fastball and a paltry 13.6% K? Contact management and precision. A 5.4% BB is premier. Buehrle's consistency in throwing, simple motion and a repetoire of reliable, but not overpowering, secondary pitches, allowed him to get low HR/FB, and high GB/FB rates throughout his career.

#Fielding 

So far all of his stats have been solid, but nothing that eye popping. That will change [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_m3qy2O7bA). Mark Buehrle is credited with **88** DRS at pitcher. That is the most all time. Second is Zack Greinke with 79. 3rd is Kenny Rogers with **49**. He and Greinke are such outliers defensively that even pitchers with 5000+ IP cannot dream of catching them.

#Baserunning

This is my favorite portion of Mark Buehrle. You simply cannot run on him. It cannot be done. In his career, 3200 IP, 69 runners have successfully stolen a base on Mark Buehrle. 81 have been caught stealing. That is a SB% of **42%.** The league average is 71%. 

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention he has **100 career pickoffs**. More pickoffs than successful stolen bases. He simply had the best pickoff move ever. 100 pickoffs place second all time to Steve Carlton's 147, but Mark Buehrle's PO/IP is first all time. 

These stats also do not account for all the people who never even tried to run or lead off. His reputation stopped you from even trying to run. 

#Pace of play

Manfred probably has a picture of Buehrle that he sleeps with. Buehrle owns the top 7 fastest time between pitches since the stat was recorded. His career time between pitches is about 16.4 seconds. The blistering pace of his attack gave the batters no time to think about what could be coming next. In 2015, Mark Buehrle and Chris Sale each threw complete games in a game that took **1:51**. But it does not stop there:

April 16, 2005: 9 IP, 3 H, 1 ER, 1 BB, 12 K vs. Seattle. Time of game: 1:39

*99 Minutes** Obviously this requires some help from the opposing pitcher, but this was obviously a gem in every way. 
(Fun Fact: Ichiro got all 3 hits against him, as only Ichiro would)

#Perfect Games and 'Perfect Games'

In 2009, Mark Buehrle retired 27 straight Tampa Bay Rays for a Perfect Game. However, it was not the first time he had faced 27 in a complete game. 

On July 21, 2004: 9 IP, 2 H, 0 ER, 3 K vs. Cleveland. Time of game: 2:31.

The 2 hits were followed with double plays, keeping the batter count to 27.

There was another time as well, this one coming during Buehrle's No Hitter:

April 18, 2007: 9 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 1 BB, 8 K vs. Texas. Time of game: 2:03

The one walk was to Sammy Sosa. Who was then picked off at first base. What Sammy Sosa was doing more than 6 inches from first base in 2007, I'll never know. But this meant that only 27 batters came up to face Mark that day. 

Too my knowledge, he is the only pitcher to face the minimum more than once in his career. 

TL;DR 

Threw slow, but threw quickly. Best defensive pitcher ever. Best pickoff move/ stealing prevention ever. Threw one perfect game and two others where he faced 27 batters.

SoldatJ,2018-06-23 01:13:27+00:00,Why the Golden State Warriors should trade Klay Thompson for Carmelo Anthony,"With the rumblings about league parity and the apparent invincibility of the Golden State Warriors, there's no shortage of NBA fans ready to see the giant fall. Naturally, they want to retain a top notch team as long as possible, but a cloud of salary cap taxes looms large over Golden State. So first, let's take a look at Golden State's salary situation.

**Steph Curry** - Supermax until 2022  
This one isn't changing any time soon. Golden State wouldn't trade Steph Curry for LeBron James and three unprotected firsts.

**Kevin Durant** - $26,250,000 in 2019, almost certain to be pushed up to $35m and rising with a max contract  
This one also is as close to set in stone as you can get unless Durant shocks the world by opting out and signing with the Lakers to play with LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, DeMarcus Cousins, Chris Paul, and Carmelo Anthony.

**Draymond Green** - $17,469,565 in 2019, due for a raise in 2021  
Hometown discounts are one thing, but Dray isn't pulling in the same endorsements as his two MVP teammates. He can get paid, he should get paid, and he will get paid. If he's making less than $35m in 2021, either he's not the player he used to be or he's leaving large bags of money with dollar signs printed on them sitting on the table because he would rather a billionaire keep the change.

**Andre Iguodala** - $16,000,000 in 2019, expires in 2020  
This is the first money that Golden State wouldn't mind seeing drop off the books. After this contract ends, he could retire a wealthy and accomplished player. Don't look for him to stick around unless he's signing a vet minimum to be the designated crafty old veteran.

**Shaun Livingston** - $8,307,692 in 2019, expires in 2020  
Here's one of Golden State's most fair contracts. Livingston is a top notch backup point guard who doesn't let the team fall apart when Curry takes a break and that's all Golden State needs him to be. They could waive him after 2019 and save a few million if Pat McCaw can take his place.

**The Man, The Myth, The Klay** - $18,988,725	in 2019, due for a raise in 2020  
Here we arrive at the topic of the discussion. Klay Thompson is the best two way guard in the league, capable of drawing magic out of toasters and quite possibly a literal Super Saiyan in the third quarter. Despite talk of a discount, everyone knows Klay is a max player.

**Everyone else on the Warriors combined** - $5,361,477 due in 2019 already signed  
This doesn't count 28th pick Jacob Evans, it doesn't count Pat McCaw, and it doesn't count expiring contracts such as Zaza Pachulia, David West, and JaVale McGee.

With Evans on board, this puts the Warriors at 11 roster spots and $130 million, with the tax expected to kick in at around $123 million. Next year could be roughly $130 million, which conveniently is about how much Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson under a max contract would be scheduled to earn. By 2021, the Warriors would be approaching the repeater tax with Steph, KD, Klay, and ten minimum contracts. Would the Warriors do it? Maybe. Maybe not. A dynasty is a great thing to have, but they're not going into the repeater tax hoping three players are enough to keep the team untouchable. Draymond Green would get paid and the Warriors could be footing a tax bill large enough to pay for another NBA roster.

*How does Golden State fix this?*

The Carmelo Anthony experiment failed in Oklahoma City. He looked miserable out there at times and it's obvious his play style doesn't mesh too great with Russell Westbrook. Since it is conventional wisdom that any player who leaves OKC instantly becomes better, Melo is a highly desirable trade target since he will obviously return to Olympic form the minute he leaves town. Sam Presti knows this and he's had his eye out west for quite some time. Golden State turned down MVP James Harden for Klay Thompson, but he's back with another superstar to offer.

*The Trade*

Golden State receives **Carmelo Anthony** **Oklahoma City 2022 1st round draft pick, top-5 protected** **Cash Considerations** *in the form of a $50 gift card to Braum's*

Oklahoma City receives **Klay Thompson** **Andre Iguodala**

*Why Golden State does it*

Golden State desperately needs a player who gives Steph Curry some spacing outside. The Rockets proved that successful teams need inefficient mid-range shooting to warm up the rim for three point shooters. Melo is an amazing shooter from the international 3 point line which has an exchange rage of 2 American points. He brings two Olympic gold medals and an NCAA championship to the team. On top of all of that, he allows Kevin Durant to slide back to his natural position as a shooting guard. Meanwhile, the salary cap relief means that Melo's expiring contract is worth more than an unspecified amount of solid gold.

*Why Carmelo Anthony does it*

Melo wants to be a starting player for a championship contender. He also loves the spotlight and wants to play in California. Sources suggest he is leaning towards accepting this trade.

*Why Oklahoma City does it*

Sam Presti is not an idiot.

*Why Klay Thompson is okay with this*

Klay will get paid large sacks of oil money. Russ eats criticism for breakfast and haters for lunch so Klay doesn't have to. Oklahoma is about to vote on SQ 788 to legalize medical marijuana and every ad on TV says that means veterinarians can prescribe six pounds of weed in dorm room grow-ops for anyone who has ever thought they could get sick and they can smoke it while at work inside schools and the cops can't do anything about it. We all know Klay doesn't smoke weed, but just in case he wants to try it, he'll be able to get it on every corner.

*Why the league is okay with this*

Once the Melo Warriors superteam expires with his contract, the NBA will have legitimate contenders in the Thunder, the Rockets, the still kind of okay Warriors, whatever team LeBron signs with, the Celtics, the 76ers, the Pacers fueled by two guys who don't play with Russell Westbrook anymore, and if LeBron leaves the East, the Raptors. This will usher in a new era of parity in the league and Adam Silver will channel his inner David Stern and declare that for basketball reasons, the next team to try tanking will be moved to Seattle.

What are our options?","On Saturday, as we (me, husband, 1 year old daughter) were walking home from an event at the local elementary school, we noticed a man walking back and forth in the middle of an intersection. He saw us and changed direction to follow us. He followed us to our front door and attempted to open the door for several minutes while we called 911. The dispatcher told me a man matching that description had been reported missing from a home for the mentally disabled on the next street over. I requested an officer come speak with us, but they never did. I had to call our local police department back to even find out what was going on.

&amp;nbsp;

On Monday evening, we were playing with our daughter in our front yard and driveway when I noticed the same man shuffling down our street alone again. He heard us in the yard, turned and crossed the street towards our house, and again he went to our front door and attempted to open the door and look into our window. As soon as I saw him turn and head towards our driveway, we grabbed our daughter, told him to leave, and ran inside to call 911. Again, I requested an officer stop by, but 2 hours later we hadn't had any contact with an officer. I called the department again and was told he was taken back to his home and that our only option was to lock our doors and keep calling 911 when this happens. 

&amp;nbsp;

I've spoken with our neighbors across the street (directly behind the man's house), and they said he moved in about 2-3 months ago and they've never seen him without an aide. When the police gave me his address I walked over to talk with his aide. The aide refused to give me any information about the agency he works for and denied that the man was ever alone that night. When I mentioned that our Ring doorbell had recorded both incidents, he got extremely defensive and closed the door in my face.

&amp;nbsp;

We don't know anything about this man, or what he is capable of, except that he is mentally disabled in some capacity. This has now been twice in 3 days and we are afraid to spend time outside (especially me home alone with the little one all day). What are our options here? Is our only option really to just keep calling 911 every time this happens? What if he manages to get into our home? Both incidents have been terrifying and we are so lost on what we can do about this. Thank you.

I decided to compile a list of things that the Sonics have done more recently than each team in the league. 

&amp;nbsp;


| Team Name | Thing the Sonics have done more recently  | Explanation  | Odds this changes within 5 years |
|:-----------:|:------------:|:------------:|:--------------:
Atlanta Hawks | Win an NBA title | The last time the Hawks won an NBA title was in 1958. The Sonics won their only title in 1979. | 3% You never know.
Boston Celtics | be coached by Bill Russell | The last time the Celtics were coached by Bill Russell was in 1969. The Sonics were coached by Bill Russell in 1977. | 0% Russell is too old to coach again.
Brooklyn Nets | had their city fight to keep them | The New Jersey Nets fans didnt really fight super hard to keep them in Jersey. Seattle fought to keep the Sonics as recently as 2008. | 0% Brooklyn is not going to move again.
Charlotte Hornets |  win 50 games | The Hornets have never won 50 games in a season. The Sonics won 50 in 2005. | 10% a lot can change in 5 years.
Chicago Bulls | Change their logo | The Bulls last changed their logo in 1966/67. The Sonics last changed theirs in 2008. | 0% It's been around for 50 years, it'll be around for 5 more.
Cleveland Cavs | fire head coach George Karl | The Cavs fired Karl in the middle of the 1985/86 season. The Sonics fired him after 1998. | 2% You cant rule out the possibility of the Cavs hiring Karl and realizing quickly it was a mistake. 
Dallas Mavericks | trade for Kurt Thomas | The Mavericks traded for him in 1997. The Sonics did the same in 2007. | 0% Thomas has been retired since 2012.
Denver Nuggets | draft a Rookie of the Year | The Sonics drafted the ROY in 2007. The Nuggets have never done this. | 50% The Nuggets drafted Donovan Mitchell before trading him to the Jazz for Trey Lyles and Tyler Lydon. Mitchell and Ben Simmons have the best chance at winning it this year.
Detroit Pistons | were founded | The Sonics were founded in 1967. The Pistons havent been founded since 1957! | 1% they probably wont get founded again. 
Golden State Warriors | have a player win the JWKC award | Sonics’ player and cousin of then coach and GM Bill Russell, Slick Watts won it in 1975. No Warrior player has ever won this. | 10% I could see the league giving to KD for his community work.
Houston Rockets | move cities | The Sonics moved from their city in 2008. The Rockets havent moved since 1971 when they moved from San Diego! | 0% Rockets owner has pledged to keep team in Houston.
Indiana Pacers | play in the Western Conference | The Sonics last played in the Western Conference  in 2008. The Pacers havent been able to do that since 1978! | 2% highly unlikely but not impossible.
Los Angeles Clippers | lose a game in the Western Conference Finals | The Sonics last lost a game in the WCF in 1996. The Clippers miraculously are undefeated in the Western Conference Finals! | 0% I cant see this hot streak ending any time soon!
Los Angeles Lakers | had a player win Defensive Player of the Year | Gary Payton won this award on the Sonics in 1996. The last Laker player to win was Michael Cooper in 1986. | 2% if the Ball family is able to sign LiAngelo and he leads the league in steals, it could happen, but other than that I dont see it happening.
Memphis Grizzlies | finish the season as a top 3 seed | The Sonics finished 3rd in 2005. The Grizzlies have never been able to do it. | Originally a 0 but Marc Gasol seems like a nice guy so I had to bump it up to a 3%.
Miami Heat | not retire MJ’s number | The Sonics have not retired MJ’s number as recently as right now. The Miami Heat retired it in 2003. | 1% Bill Cosby has had a bunch of Honorary Doctorates taken back so you never know. 
Milwaukee Bucks | had a player on the All NBA first team| Gary Payton was All NBA first team in 2000 for the Sonics. The last Bucks player to do that was Sidney Moncrief in 1983! | 100% Giannis is gonna do it.
Minnesota Timberwolves| trade away Ray Allen | The Sonics traded Allen in 2007. The Timberwolves traded Ray Allen away in 1996 for Stephon Marbury. Allen went on to be a 10 time all star and is 1st in all time 3 pointers made. Marbury has done great things in China. | 0% Allen retired in 2016 
New Orleans Pelicans | relocate to OKC | The Sonics relocated in 2008. The Pelicans, then the Hornets, relocated to OKC in 2005 after Katrina hit. | 0% would require two teams moving and thats not going to happen.
New York Knicks | had Knicks legend Patrick Ewing on the team | The Sonics had Pat on the team as recently as 2001. Ewing hasn’t been on the Knicks since 2000 when they traded him to the Sonics. | 1% Ewing is retired but if Dolan is desperate enough I wont rule it out completely.
Oklahoma City Thunder | be liked by Sonics fans | The Supersonics have been liked by Sonics fans since the team was founded till today. The Thunder have never been liked by Sonics fans | 1% maybe Seattle gets its team back and the fans kinda chill.
Orlando Magic | draft 23rd | The Sonics drafted Bobby Jackson 23rd in 1997. The Magic last drafted 23rd in 1991 when they took Stanley Roberts. | 10% Although usually you have to be good to draft 23rd, the Magic have many young players they drafted high in the lottery who they might trade for an expiring contract and a late 1st rounder.
Philadelphia 76ers | win their division |  the Sonics won their division in 2005. The 76ers havent won since 2001. | 50% as long as Joel Embiid can stay healthy, Ben Simmons can get a shot, and Markelle Fultz can get his shit together I would say they have a pretty good shot. It goes up to 60% if Saric ever comes over.
Phoenix Suns | be sold | the sonics were last sold in 2008. The Suns were last sold in 2004 | 1% With the leagues’ value at an all time high and newish owner Robert Sarver only being 57 years old I think Suns fans have a long future with the man who beat James Dolan in a ranking of the worst owners in the NBA.
Portland Trailblazers | draft Kevin Durant | The Sonics last drafted Kevin Durant in 2007. The Trailblazers have never drafted Durant. | 5% This may seem high but Im trusting my gut. There are a lot of Kevins out there. A couple of them might have the last name Durant. 
Sacramento Kings | win a playoff series | The Sonics beat the Kings in the playoffs in 2005. The Kings last series win was in 2004. | 50% I am a big believer in Doncic and if the prophecy is true than the Kings should be pretty set.
San Antonio Spurs | had a player win Most Improved | Dale Ellis won it for the Sonics in 1986/87. Alvin Robertson won it for the Spurs in 1985/86. | 10% The Spurs have always been good at developing players and I could see them snagging one.
Toronto Raptors | retire a number | The Sonics retired Gus Williams’ number “1” in 2004. The Raptors have never retired a number. | 100% I just think they’ll do it soon for either Carter Bosh or LeBron.
Utah Jazz | lose 60 games |  The Sonics last lost 60 games in 2008. The Jazz have remarkably never lost 60 games. | 1% with young stars Mitchell and Gobert I see this team having a better chance to win 60.
Washington Wizards | play in a conference finals | The Sonics last played in the conference finals in 1996. The Wizards havent made it out of the second round since 1979 where they won and went on to meet the Sonics in the Finals for the second straight year. | 10% I am a big John Wall fan but if Lebron stays in the East its going to be difficult for this team to get back.

Because the Timberwolves finally made the playoffs this year, they now have made the playoffs more recently than the Seattle Supersonics. I decided to compile a list of things that the Sonics have done more recently than each team in the league. 

&amp;nbsp;


| Team Name | Thing the Sonics have done more recently  | Explanation  | Odds this changes within 5 years |
|:-----------|------------:|:------------:|--------------
Atlanta Hawks | Win an NBA title | The last time the Hawks won an NBA title was in 1958. The Sonics won their only title in 1979. | 3% You never know.
Boston Celtics | be coached by Bill Russell | The last time the Celtics were coached by Bill Russell was in 1969. The Sonics were coached by Bill Russell in 1977. | 0% Russell is too old to coach again.
Brooklyn Nets | had their city fight to keep them | The New Jersey Nets fans didnt really fight super hard to keep them in Jersey. Seattle fought to keep the Sonics as recently as 2008. | 0% Brooklyn is not going to move again.
Charlotte Hornets |  win 50 games | The Hornets have never won 50 games in a season. The Sonics won 50 in 2005. | 10% a lot can change in 5 years.
Chicago Bulls | Change their logo | The Bulls last changed their logo in 1966/67. The Sonics last changed theirs in 2008. | 0% It's been around for 50 years, it'll be around for 5 more.
Cleveland Cavs | fire head coach George Karl | The Cavs fired Karl in the middle of the 1985/86 season. The Sonics fired him after 1998. | 2% You cant rule out the possibility of the Cavs hiring Karl and realizing quickly it was a mistake. 
Dallas Mavericks | trade for Kurt Thomas | The Mavericks traded for him in 1997. The Sonics did the same in 2007. | 0% Thomas has been retired since 2012.
Denver Nuggets | draft a Rookie of the Year | The Sonics drafted the ROY in 2007. The Nuggets have never done this. | 50% The Nuggets drafted Donovan Mitchell before trading him to the Jazz for Trey Lyles and Tyler Lydon. Mitchell and Ben Simmons have the best chance at winning it this year.
Detroit Pistons | were founded | The Sonics were founded in 1967. The Pistons havent been founded since 1957! | 1% they probably wont get founded again. 
Golden State Warriors | have a player win the JWKC award | Sonics’ player and cousin of then coach and GM Bill Russell, Slick Watts won it in 1975. No Warrior player has ever won this. | 10% I could see the league giving to KD for his community work.
Houston Rockets | move cities | The Sonics moved from their city in 2008. The Rockets havent moved since 1971 when they moved from San Diego! | 0% Rockets owner has pledged to keep team in Houston.
Indiana Pacers | play in the Western Conference | The Sonics last played in the Western Conference  in 2008. The Pacers havent been able to do that since 1978! | 2% highly unlikely but not impossible.
Los Angeles Clippers | lose a game in the Western Conference Finals | The Sonics last lost a game in the WCF in 1996. The Clippers miraculously are undefeated in the Western Conference Finals! | 0% I cant see this hot streak ending any time soon!
Los Angeles Lakers | had a player win Defensive Player of the Year | Gary Payton won this award on the Sonics in 1996. The last Laker player to win was Michael Cooper in 1986. | 2% if the Ball family is able to sign LiAngelo and he leads the league in steals, it could happen, but other than that I dont see it happening.
Memphis Grizzlies | finish the season as a top 3 seed | The Sonics finished 3rd in 2005. The Grizzlies have never been able to do it. | Originally a 0 but Marc Gasol seems like a nice guy so I had to bump it up to a 3%.
Miami Heat | not retire MJ’s number | The Sonics have not retired MJ’s number as recently as right now. The Miami Heat retired it in 2003. | 1% Bill Cosby has had a bunch of Honorary Doctorates taken back so you never know. 
Milwaukee Bucks | had a player on the All NBA first team| Gary Payton was All NBA first team in 2000 for the Sonics. The last Bucks player to do that was Sidney Moncrief in 1983! | 100% Giannis is gonna do it.
Minnesota Timberwolves| trade away Ray Allen | The Sonics traded Allen in 2007. The Timberwolves traded Ray Allen away in 1996 for Stephon Marbury. Allen went on to be a 10 time all star and is 1st in all time 3 pointers made. Marbury has done great things in China. | 0% Allen retired in 2016 
New Orleans Pelicans | relocate to OKC | The Sonics relocated in 2008. The Pelicans, then the Hornets, relocated to OKC in 2005 after Katrina hit. | 0% would require two teams moving and thats not going to happen.
New York Knicks | had Knicks legend Patrick Ewing on the team | The Sonics had Pat on the team as recently as 2001. Ewing hasn’t been on the Knicks since 2000 when they traded him to the Sonics. | 1% Ewing is retired but if Dolan is desperate enough I wont rule it out completely.
Oklahoma City Thunder | be liked by Sonics fans | The Supersonics have been liked by Sonics fans since the team was founded till today. The Thunder have never been liked by Sonics fans | 1% maybe Seattle gets its team back and the fans kinda chill.
Orlando Magic | draft 23rd | The Sonics drafted Bobby Jackson 23rd in 1997. The Magic last drafted 23rd in 1991 when they took Stanley Roberts. | 10% Although usually you have to be good to draft 23rd, the Magic have many young players they drafted high in the lottery who they might trade for an expiring contract and a late 1st rounder.
Philadelphia 76ers | win their division |  the Sonics won their division in 2005. The 76ers havent won since 2001. | 50% as long as Joel Embiid can stay healthy, Ben Simmons can get a shot, and Markelle Fultz can get his shit together I would say they have a pretty good shot. It goes up to 60% if Saric ever comes over.
Phoenix Suns | be sold | the sonics were last sold in 2008. The Suns were last sold in 2004 | 1% With the leagues’ value at an all time high and newish owner Robert Sarver only being 57 years old I think Suns fans have a long future with the man who beat James Dolan in a ranking of the worst owners in the NBA.
Portland Trailblazers | draft Kevin Durant | The Sonics last drafted Kevin Durant in 2007. The Trailblazers have never drafted Durant. | 5% This may seem high but Im trusting my gut. There are a lot of Kevins out there. A couple of them might have the last name Durant. 
Sacramento Kings | win a playoff series | The Sonics beat the Kings in the playoffs in 2005. The Kings last series win was in 2004. | 50% I am a big believer in Doncic and if the prophecy is true than the Kings should be pretty set.
San Antonio Spurs | had a player win Most Improved | Dale Ellis won it for the Sonics in 1986/87. Alvin Robertson won it for the Spurs in 1985/86. | 10% The Spurs have always been good at developing players and I could see them snagging one.
Toronto Raptors | retire a number | The Sonics retired Gus Williams’ number “1” in 2004. The Raptors have never retired a number. | 100% I just think they’ll do it soon for either Carter Bosh or LeBron.
Utah Jazz | lose 60 games |  The Sonics last lost 60 games in 2008. The Jazz have remarkably never lost 60 games. | 1% with young stars Mitchell and Gobert I see this team having a better chance to win 60.

darthstupidious,2018-06-10 16:52:33+00:00,"On January 4th, 2001, a Seattle-area real estate agent is killed during a showing by a mysterious client. A decade later, a professional killer is implicated in the case. Who wanted Mike Emert killed? [Unresolved Murder]","Born on November 13th, 1960, Michael Angelo Emert grew up in Walla Walla, Washington, before attending Washington State University in Pullman. Shortly thereafter, he moved to the Tri-Cities area to start a seed company, then began a career in real estate (which took him to the western side of the state).

In the 1990's, he began working for a Kirkland-based Windemere Real Estate office, becoming one of the area's most well-liked and well-regarded realtors. He won his regional ""Realtor Of The Year"" from Windemere, and was even crowned a top Puget Sound Real Estate Professional Twice (in 1998 and 1999). 

In addition to selling multiple million-dollar-plus homes, he also married in the mid-1990s: to a woman named Mary Beth Chandler, who worked with him at his Windemere office. She had one daughter from a prior relationship, but Mike and her would have no children of their own.

-------------------------

On January 3rd, Michael Emert met with a mysterious client in the parking lot of the Kirkland Park Place shopping mall. This client wanted to look at houses along the market, in the Eastside area. One home in particular, in the local suburb of Woodinville, piqued his interest. They viewed this home, and the client seemed very interested. They made plans to view it again the next day.

Mike shared some details of this client with his wife and other co-workers: he said this client spoke with an East Coast accent, claimed to have recently relocated from Northern California (and was currently staying with friends), was in his early-to-mid 50's, and - most uniquely- walked with a limp and carried a cane. 

He also told his wife that the client was ""odd"" and remarked to a coworker that this man was a ""weird dude,"" but no one thought twice to ask for any more details. In his work planner, Mike marked the client's name as ""Steven.""

On January 4th, Mike met with the client again at the Kirkland Park Place shopping mall, at around 11:30 AM. They headed straight to the Woodinville home, located in the area of 157th Place Northeast. The home, a modern, brick-and-beige three-story home, was located on a private lot; it was pretty isolated, and well-separated from any of the neighbors' homes. 

At around 12:40 PM, the homeowner returned home for her lunch break. She had known about the 11:30 showing, but figured that the realtor &amp; client would be gone by the time she arrived. She entered through the garage, and inside the home, found the front door ajar. As she went to close it, she heard the sound of running water upstairs. So, she crept upstairs, and saw a trail of blood leading from a bedroom into the upstairs bathroom. 

Mike Emert had been stabbed 19 times in total, as well as suffering through a vicious beating. His body had been dragged eighteen feet, from an upstairs bedroom (where it was believed the client named ""Steven"" had blindsided him) to the bathroom (where he was dropped, face-down, into the bathtub). The sound of running water came from the showerhead, which had been turned on, and presumably meant to wash away any evidence of the killer. In addition to the shower, the ""his and her"" sinks in the bathroom had been left on.

This marked the first murder in Woodinville since 1997, so the King County Sheriffs Office was called in immediately. They created the supposed series of events, and reported items missing from the scene: namely, Mike's wallet, cell phone, car keys, wristwatch, and wedding wing. 

-------------------------

Mike's car keys would be found inside the vehicle, which had been returned to the Kirkland Park Place shopping mall parking lot. Police believed the killer drove it there. 

Despite being unable to find any DNA evidence at the scene of the murder, investigators found skin and blood samples inside Mike's Cadillac Escalade. These samples were submitted to the FBI's forensic database later that year, in 2001. More on that in a bit.

Mike's wallet was found in Seattle, on top of a payphone at the Colman Dock (also called Pier 52). It is unknown why it was left there, but investigators would later learn that Mike's ATM card was missing (and it was used some time after Mike's murder). 

Mike's cell phone was recovered, but police refused to say where or how it had been found. However, they did confirm that it had been used after Mike's murder, as well.

Mike's gold-and-silver Breitling Chronomat wristwatch (valued upwards of $3000) and his gold wedding ring (which contained three diamonds in a row, as well as the interior inscription ""ADI""; valued in the thousands) were never found/recovered.

King County Sheriff's investigators conducted an exhaustive review of Mike's finances, and looked into most of his family, friends, and coworkers. The way the murder had been conducted led detective to believe that it had been done by an experienced killer; perhaps even a professional. They doubted the motive as being a simple robbery, because the killer had gone through an in-depth planning stage to isolate Mike, and conduct the crime in a short period of time (between meeting with Mike at 11:30 and the homeowner returning a little over an hour later, at 12:40). It is believed the homeowner had missed the killer by mere minutes. 

Police also began to publicly float the possibility that the killer had used a hidden knife/sword concealed within a walking cane. After all, they had been unable to find the murder weapon, and Mike's description of the killer pointed to an interesting ruse. Perhaps the killer didn't have a limp, and concocted this as part of a story?

-------------------------

A suspect emerged just a week or so after the murder, named Jeffrey John Solo. 

Jeff Solo was a homeless transient, who often frequented the Kirkland Park Place shopping mall where Mike had met this mysterious client 2x. Most uniquely, he walked with a limp and carried a cane. 

&lt;Side note: Jeffrey Solo is also the father of world-famous Olympic gold medalist Hope Solo. Thought that was interesting.&gt;

Jeff Solo had a history of being a con artist, and admitted that he had, on occasion, lied to female real estate agents in order to try and ""woo"" them. However, he had no history of violence and plead his innocence. 

He cooperated with authorities, giving up hair and blood samples, as well as going through with a polygraph test. 

Solo remained a person-of-interest, but was later cleared of any involvement. 

-------------------------

Years passed, and the murder of Mike Emert slowly-but-surely became a cold case. 

However, in 2010, a seemingly-unrelated incident kicked off a series of events. 

In March of 2010, a Kirkland-area orthopedic surgeon named Dr. Craig McAllister was returning home after picking up his son from the airport. It was night out, on a Friday, and the two men were accosted by a strange pair of masked men outside of his home (along Lake Washington). The masked men wanted inside his home, where Dr. McAllister's wife and 13-year old daughter were.

Dr. Craig McAllister decided to fight back, allowing his son to run off to a neighbor's home. Eventually, he pulled the ski mask off one of the masked men; ultimately leading to the two strangers running off into the night. 

This seemed like an odd, unrelated home invasion. But DNA testing of the ski mask, which had been left at the scene, pointed towards a pair of criminals named John Alan Bradshaw and Gary Krueger. 

John Alan Bradshaw was 65-years old, and had been convicted in 2001 for arson and money laundering.

However, Gary Krueger was a 62-year old former-police officer, who had been in-and-out of jail multiple times for bank robbery. As an officer in the 1970's, he had a checkered past of violent outbursts, and had been suspected in a couple of murders in the early 1980s. 

Months later, in September of 2010, the body of Gary Krueger would be found floating in Lake Washington. He had drowned. Nearby him was a capsized small boat, which he had tried making an escape with following the failed home invasion in March. His partner-in-crime, Bradshaw, has never been found (it is believed that he died in Lake Washington, as well).

-------------------------

In March of 2011, the DNA of Gary Krueger was finally submitted into the FBI forensic database. It took a few months to get any results, but it finally pinged in September of that year. 

Gary Krueger, the former-police-officer-turned-career-criminal, was the provider of the skin &amp; blood samples found inside of Mike Emert's Cadillac Escalade back in 2001.

Police then began working backwards through Krueger's unfortunate life, and fit him into their working theory about Mike Emert's death... they believed that Gary Krueger had been a professional killer, dating back to a series of murders in the 1980s:

- In 1981, a former police officer named Terry Dolan was killed outside of an Everett, WA gas station. Police suspected that his death was staged to look like a robbery. Krueger was suspected, but police couldn't gather enough evidence to make a case against him.

- In 1984, a Bellevue, WA attorney named Jim Barry was stabbed-to-death at his office, sometime in the late evening. Barry represented a bank that was involved in collection efforts against Krueger. 

- In 1985, a Seattle union boss named Mario Vaccarino was found beaten-to-death. Like Mike Emert, he was found in a bathtub. It is believed that Joe Massimino, Sr., another member of the union, was involved in the death... because he succeeded Vaccarino as the head of the union, and had a strong personal relationship with none other than Gary Krueger. 

Gary Krueger's wife, Betty, later admitted to police that she was aware of Gary's involvement in the hit on Mario Vaccarino (they had been divorced when he committed the other two crimes).

-------------------------

So now police have developed Gary Krueger as their primary suspect in the murder investigation of Mike Emert. However, because Krueger passed away before they could interview/interrogate him, they are unable to ascertain his motives. 

If Krueger and Mike had any kind of personal or professional relationship, it has been impossible to decipher. Police believe the two did not know one another, which led investigators to the understanding that Krueger had likely been a contract killer. 

If so, then the person who hired Krueger has gone unidentified for almost twenty years. 

What do you think? Do you think this was an in-depth robbery, or was there more to it?

Xelif,2018-06-08 11:53:10+00:00,Trump targeted Canada. Every American should be outraged.,"On September 11th, 2001, there were two major news stories.

The first, of course, was the despicable attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

The second was Canada's reaction to those attacks and the events that followed. It went like this:

* America: ""Oh shit, we've been attacked by terrorists hijacking airliners. We don't know who they are, where they came from, or how many more of them are out there waiting to strike. Every airliner is a potential missile.""
* Canada: [""We've got your back. Send them here.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Yellow_Ribbon)

At 9:45, 8 minutes after the third plane hit the Pentagon, the FAA fully closed American airspace. Simultaneously, despite no apparent threats to the country, Transport Canada closes Canadian airspace as well - but unlike the US, does not ban incoming flights. Canada volunteered to accept all incoming transcontinental flights to the US - even though Canada, as a US ally, could very well be a target, and if terrorists took over planes diverted to Canada they could improvise and crash them into Canadian buildings.

When Canada volunteered to take all incoming flights, the danger had not yet passed. Flight 93 was hijacked at 9:28, but it didn't crash until 10:03 - and that was early, thanks to the brave passengers of that plane. Canada took in flights before the attack had even ended.

While the US was on fire, Canada was the one who ran into the burning building.

Most Atlantic flights were diverted to Gander International Airport. Gander, a town of 10,000 people, still has a huge airport because it used to be a key refueling stop on the Transatlantic route. It took in 38 wide body aircraft, which is 38 more wide body aircraft than Gander gets in a normal year. With a population of less than 10,000, Gander cared for over 6,600 guests in their time of need. Similar situations played out in Halifax, St. Johns and Moncton, and as most people could not be housed in hotels, thousands of Maritime Canadians opened their homes to passengers, providing room, board, and for those with friends and family in New York, a shoulder to cry on.

Gander is a big airport in a small town, so if an aircraft had been hijacked, the damage would have been tragic but minimal. But there's no such thing on the west coast. The only non-US airport on the Pacific coast capable of handling large aircraft is Vancouver International Airport, which is smack dab in the middle of Vancouver, BC. A foiled hijacker bound for Seattle or San Francisco or Los Angeles would have found many ripe targets in Vancouver. But Canadian authorities willingly landed dozens of Transpacific aircraft at Vancouver, despite the danger. As on the east coast, ordinary Vancouverites lined up to house thousands of passengers bound for the US in their own homes. Vancouver International's switchboard was overwhelmed with calls from people and companies asking how they could help.

We're liberals, and we're going to be bothered by most everything Trump does. But his recent disrespect of Canada should outrage every American who remembers 9/11, and it should motivate us to rise above lazy ""lol Trump"" and take action. Canada voluntarily took in 269 flights - at that time, 269 potential missiles - carrying nearly 50,000 passengers bound for the US. They didn't have to - they could have easily said tough luck and thrown the problem right back at the FAA. They did so out of pure friendship. 

Every time ""NINE ELEVEN!"" passes Rudy's rotting jaw, remind your Trump-supporting friends and family of how Canada had our back on 9/11. If you're the slacktivist type, consider tweeting at [your Canadian consulate](https://travel.gc.ca/assistance/embassies-consulates/united-states) to thank them for being #FriendsForever. And if you know any Canadians, thank them personally!",esist,10352

**tl;dr:** My, now former, employer terminated me.

Slightly longer version: I received my termination letter and personal effects by registered mail and was provided a certified ~~letter~~ envelope to return company property with, which I have already sent out.  The essence of the letter was, *""You're being terminated because of that screw up.  Here's the part of the company manual that told you not to do something like that.  Give us our stuff back or get no last paycheck.""*

So let's get the basics out of the way.  I have, from the beginning, accepted that this is wholly my fault.  I meant it in jest.  I thought I was so obviously past the line of Poe's Law that I would simply give the other guests a humorous story to tell.  It's a running joke to have WiFi with something like *""FBI Surveillance Van.""*  I wanted only that.  Something for the other guests to chuckle over.  Be careful what you wish for, you dumb shit.  What do [they say about hindsight](https://i.imgur.com/7EFAnWo.jpg)?  Half of the world knows this story now.  We'll get to that in a minute.

I wanted my post to serve as a warning to others.  I received several notes from people who had considered doing the same or similar with one guy even planning it for the next day, and stopped because of my post.  That is enough.  Yes we've already agreed I'm a screwup (or some variation), so let's skip that this time.  I'd say take it back to the previous post but that got locked.  I mean, seriously, I just pissed away a 9 year career and the world saw it happen.  Again, we'll get to that.

To the one guy who wished I'd get AIDS, you gotta put some work into it, dude.  *""Haha I hope you get AIDS,""* is not enough.  You have to wish, at the very least, that I pick up a heroin addiction and get AIDS in a hobo camp.  Creativity.  Seriously, kids these days.

I'm pretty much begging, please do not turn this into another episode of *""Reddit solves mysteries.""*  A lot of things were said in the previous post that will allow you to infer a fair amount.  Yes, it was public sector.  Please leave it at that.  I have already shamed my employer within its own circles.  There is no good reason to publicly shame them by linking them to me.  I have not represented them or their values with my behavior.  Please don't dox me.  Thank you.

A lot of you expressed concern for my well being, some long after the thread was locked.  I appreciate that more than you will ever know.  You helped me get through when my support system, conveniently /s, happened to be at its lowest and it was a true pleasure to see the orange icon every time.

Now, about that *""half of the world""* crack.  There's fucking up.  There's really fucking up.  There's fucking up in public.  And thennnnnnnn, there's 3rd place on the bloody front page.  What in the People's Republic of Hell is going on around here?  I was only expecting a dozen upvotes, 5 comments of *""haha, what a moron!""* and maybe one supportive comment that got downvoted past the threshold.  

Somehow I ended up on Facebook feeds of people in New Zealand and one of my friends from Seattle heard his coworkers talking about it.  I had two former coworkers from years back text message me out of nowhere to get more details.

There's something darkly humorous and possibly ironic that the biggest mistake in my adult life practically turned into a meme.  I'm unemployed, why don't I [make it for you](https://i.imgur.com/gds897P.png)?

So now it's on to processing this, filing for unemployment (if I'm even eligible), touching up my resume and cover letters, and starting to rebuild.  Don't even get me started on the insurance debacle to come.  I'd say this is the last update, but if I get a positive reaction from a future employer about this story I'll let you know.",tifu,2049

********************

&amp;nbsp;

As I watched Salk study himself in the mirror, I kept waiting for some sign he knew I was there—a glance in my direction or some indication he was preparing for a fight.  But there was none.  He continued to practice smiling for a few more moments and then he replaced the photo on the mirror and left the room.  When I heard the front door open and shut again I assumed he’d left, but even after I strained and heard what sounded like his car cranking up and driving off outside, I waited a couple of minutes before easing open the closet door.
&amp;nbsp;

I was tight with tension, with every creak of the floor sounding like a gunshot in my ears.  I crept to the back door, constantly looking around for some sign that Salk had silently doubled back to trick me into thinking he had left.  But no, he seemed to truly be gone.  Peeking out the back door window, I made my way out onto the back porch and across his yard.
&amp;nbsp;

When I was back to my car I drove around to his street and Salk’s car was gone.  I had no way of knowing where he had went, but I decided that was okay.  While I didn’t have definitive evidence he was a killer yet, the strangeness I had observed that night made the idea a lot more credible. Tired, I went home and tried to get some sleep with little luck.
&amp;nbsp;

Two days later I received one of my distant newspaper deliveries.  A twenty-year old girl had gone missing the night I had been in Salk’s house and he had left for parts unknown.  It was nearly 200 miles away from here, but based on the timeline of when she was last seen, he would have had plenty of time get there if it was him.  Even not knowing if he were to blame I felt terrible.  Responsible.  If I had done better, been smarter, I could have stopped him already or at least tracked him so I would know if he had gone to the girl’s town or not.
&amp;nbsp;


As it was, I was left with continuing to observe.  That, and trying to find out more about Marcus Salk from his past.
&amp;nbsp;


I pulled his file in the Admin office at the hospital and found that prior to coming to our town he had been at a hospital outside of Olathe, Kansas for a number of years.  Not much other information beyond his curriculum vitae, which contained nothing out of the ordinary for an orthopedic surgeon.  Still, it gave me a jumping off point.
&amp;nbsp;


I called the hospital in Kansas and worked my way to someone in human resources, telling them that I was with a large medical practice in Seattle that was considering extending an offer to a former doctor there and was checking through his references as part of the potential hiring process.  The woman on the phone was friendly from the start, but I could tell there was a brief hesitation and change of tone when I mentioned the person in question was Dr. Salk.
&amp;nbsp;

“Well…I can put you in touch with the chief of staff if you want.  He was chief back when Marcus was here too, so he can talk more about what kind of doctor he was.  But I…well, I shouldn’t say anything.”
&amp;nbsp;

Her desire to gossip was almost palpable.  “I understand, and I’m not trying to put you in a bad spot.  But I don’t want to make the wrong choice on the guy either, so anything you tell me will be off-the-record.  But it’d be a big help if you could give me any insight you have into him.”  There was a moment of contemplative silence and then she went on.
&amp;nbsp;

“It’s just…Look, Marcus was a nice guy when he first came here, right?  Joked around a lot, patients loved him, he had a sweet wife and he fit right in.  Then him and his wife go on vacation to Europe one summer, this was six or seven years ago now, and when they got back he was different somehow.”
&amp;nbsp;

“Different how?”  I asked, trying to keep the intense curiosity out of my voice.  I was supposed to be a mildly interested businessman, not an obsessed stalker.  
&amp;nbsp;

I could almost hear her shrug over the phone.  “I don’t know how to describe it.  He was still nice and would joke some, but it all seemed forced.  He was off from how he had been before.  Within a few months him and his wife were divorced and he had moved away.  I guess he’s on the move again.”
&amp;nbsp;

“Yeah, we’ll see.  You’ve given me a lot of food for thought.  Hey, was his wife okay?  I mean did everything turn out okay for her?
&amp;nbsp;

I could sense her hesitating again, and I was worried I may have pushed for more than she’d give.  Luckily the gossip in her won out as she let out a small sigh.  “Yes, I guess so, bless her heart.  She still lives around here, so I see her from time to time.  She doesn’t look happy though.  I think Alicia really loved him, and whatever came between them, I think it hurt her a lot.”
&amp;nbsp;

I could feel the rage building in me again as she spoke.  “Yes, losing someone you love like that, it kind of destroys you.  I…thank you.  Thank you for the help, you’ve given me a lot to go on.”
&amp;nbsp;

“Don’t you want to talk to the chief?”
&amp;nbsp;

I gave a small laugh I didn’t feel.  “No, I think I got what I needed right here.  Thank you again.”  When I hung up the phone, I sat with my head in my hands for some time.  My thoughts were swimming in the blackness of my mind like pale, blind cave fish.  I would catch glimpses of their pallid scales and hear the occasional ripple or splash as they stirred the water, but these ghost impressions left me with little in the way of a solid idea or plan.  The things that felt most real to me were my pain and my anger, and it was getting harder to hold them in check.
&amp;nbsp;

Still, I had to be sure.  I took a few days off and drove to Olathe to try and track down Salk’s ex-wife.  She wasn’t going by her married name any longer, so the phone directory was of little use.  I called the Kansas medical board and got a residential mailing address that he had never changed.  This led me to a nice brick home in a small suburban neighborhood not far from Salk’s former hospital.  As I went up to the front door I could see that the paint around the door and on the shutters was peeling, and the air of disuse and being unoccupied grew so strong as I approached that I felt sure I was knocking at the door of an empty house.
&amp;nbsp;

But only seconds after I knocked a woman in her forties opened the door.  She looked at me warily as I fought down the urge to tell her that I knew her.  In a way it was true.  She was the girl from Salk’s picture.  
&amp;nbsp;

Swallowing, I pushed forward with my story.  “Hi, ma’am.  My name is Peter Elliot.  I was hoping I could ask you a few questions about your former husband.”  I tried to smile and seem non-threatening, but I could see her running the mental calculus of the likelihood I was a thief or rapist.  After studying me further she nodded and stepped aside.
&amp;nbsp;

“Come in I guess.  Is Marcus in some sort of trouble?”  We stepped into a foyer cluttered with stacks of books and magazines, and as we spoke she led me down a path to a living room that was even more filled with row after row of books.
&amp;nbsp;

I gestured around.  “You’ve got quite the collection.”  She had moved a stack of newspapers off a worn-looking sofa and gestured for me to sit down.
&amp;nbsp;

She shrugged, looking disconsolate.  “I think I slipped from being a collector to a hoarder about two years ago.  I need to clear all this junk out.”  She looked used up and small in her pale blue bathrobe as she sat down in an old recliner.  Her sad eyes looked thoughtfully distant for a moment before coming back to me.  “So is he?  In trouble?”
&amp;nbsp;

I smiled.  “I don’t know yet honestly.  I’m just looking into him for an interested party, and my understanding is that you two were together for years.”
&amp;nbsp;

A brief look of pain crossed her face.  “Yeah, we were.  Childhood sweethearts if you can believe it.  I thought we’d always be together.”
&amp;nbsp;

I leaned forward.  “If you don’t feel it’s too personal, can you tell me what changed?  Did Marcus change?”
&amp;nbsp;

She picked at some dried skin on her lip nervously.  She suddenly seemed very uncertain.  “I…Fuck it.  Yes, he did.  He changed all of a sudden.”
&amp;nbsp;

“Do you know when or why?”
&amp;nbsp;

She nodded, her eyes focusing on me as anger lit the edges of her face.  “I know exactly when.  We had just come back from a trip to Europe.  Something we had wanted to do since high school.  Had a great time too.  We had landed in Atlanta and were waiting for our connecting flight to Topeka.  That’s when he got sick.”
&amp;nbsp;

“Got sick?  Sick how?”
&amp;nbsp;

She shook her head.  “I don’t know.  He had gone to the bathroom near the terminal, and when he came back he said he didn’t feel well.  His head and neck were hurting a lot.  He felt nauseous.  By the time we landed in Kansas he said it had passed.  But…”  She sighed.  “This is pointless.  You won’t believe anything I’m going to tell you anyway.”
&amp;nbsp;

I grimaced slightly.  “I will.  Please.  I can’t go into detail, but this is really important, and I’ll listen to anything you tell me with an open mind.”
&amp;nbsp;

She looked at me for several moments, again weighing.  Finally she nodded and went on.  “He was different from then on.  At first I thought he was still sick or jet lagged.  Then I thought he was stressed or having a mid-life crisis.  But those were all just excuses really.  Because I was thinking it from the night we got home from the airport.”
&amp;nbsp;

“Thinking what?”
&amp;nbsp;

“That it wasn’t Marcus anymore.”  She held up a hand.  “I know how that sounds.  Believe me.  But I knew that man.  I had known him and loved him since I was 10.  It was like whatever happened between us landing in Atlanta and taking back off…it swallowed him up.  He still sounded like Marcus, and I could see him trying to act like him.  But it was wrong somehow.  False.  It felt like someone who knew a lot about Marcus was trying to impersonate him.”  She gave a harsh laugh.  “I swear to God, he even smelled different.  I told my mother that and she set me up with a therapist right away.”
&amp;nbsp;

I didn’t know what to do with all of this.  What she was saying was incredible, in the literal sense of that word, but I found myself believing her.  Even if she was wrong, I didn’t think she was lying to me.  “So what are you saying?  You don’t think it was him anymore?  What does that mean?”
&amp;nbsp;

“I don’t know.  Believe me, I’ve spent years wondering about it and I still don’t know the answer.  But something changed, and not in the normal “oh people change” way.  He was not right.  I would see him sometimes when he didn’t know I was around, and he was entirely different.  His face would be slack, his eyes would be dead.  He looked like some kind of terrible doll.”
&amp;nbsp;

I thought about my night in the closet and suppressed a shudder.  “Was he ever violent or abusive towards you?”
&amp;nbsp;

She shook her head.  “No, never.  Never said a harsh word to me.  Actually had less of a temper than he had before, but he’d always been sweet back when he was himself too.”  She rubbed at her eyes for a moment before continuing.  “But it didn’t matter.  I tried talking to him about it at first, tried to see if I could help, but when I finally accepted that it wasn’t him anymore, I found myself just getting more and more withdrawn.  More and more afraid of him.”
&amp;nbsp;

“What made you afraid of him?”
&amp;nbsp;

She stood up, jamming her hands in the pockets of her robe as she began to pace around the open patches of floor in the room.  “You ever been to an aquarium with sharks?”
&amp;nbsp;

I nodded.
&amp;nbsp;

“You know how they’ll swim by, looking at you all calm and placid, but you know that behind that black eye they aren’t calm or placid.  They’re just not ready to eat yet and they know there’s glass in the way.  That’s the way I came to feel when Marcus was here.  He would glide around me silently in the mornings and at night, his eyes seeing and not seeing me at the same time.  And he was always calm, always grinning his fake shark grin.  And maybe it was my imagination, but I felt like whatever hunger he had, it was growing.  And the glass holding him back was getting thinner.”  
&amp;nbsp;

I realized I had been holding my breath and I let it out.  “So you divorced him.”
&amp;nbsp;

She gave a small, sad smile as she sat back down.  “Yes, it was very easy.  I told him I wanted a divorce, he said that sounded just fine, and he moved out the same day.  Aside from signing papers in a lawyer’s office, I never saw him again.”
&amp;nbsp;

“Okay.  But why did you stay here?  Stay in the same house?  Weren’t you worried he might come back?”
&amp;nbsp;

Her smile grew slightly.  “Well, that’s the thing, isn’t it?  On the one hand, yes I’m scared of seeing Marcus showing back up one day.  But what if it was the real Marcus that came back?  What if I had moved, changed my name, made sure he couldn’t find me, and then it was the real Marcus, somehow back as randomly as he was taken away, and he came looking for me?  What if he couldn’t find me?”  Her voice grew thick at the end, and I reached out to grasp her shoulder.  I didn’t have any real words of comfort or wisdom for her, and being around her pain just reminded me of my own.
&amp;nbsp;

Standing, I looked down at the girl that had once been  Alicia Salk.  It made me hate Marcus even more to see what he had done to her.  “I don’t have any easy answers for you, Alicia.  I just…I don’t think that Marcus, your Marcus, is coming back.  I don’t know if that helps or hurts you, but maybe it will make it easier for you to move on.”
&amp;nbsp;

She looked up, her expression bitter.  “It doesn’t help.  And I know you mean well, but I’d like you to leave.”  I nodded and headed outside.  I turned to say goodbye, but the door was already closed behind me.
&amp;nbsp;

When I got back home the following morning, I found a follow-up article on the missing girl.  She had been found behind a middle school a few miles away from where she was abducted, and she had been torn apart.

kNYJ,2018-04-26 12:26:48+00:00,I Quantitatively Analyzed Every First Round Draft Pick from 2002-2015 [OC],"#***Introduction:***

Today is the big day! I’m a huge fan of the NFL draft and wanted to find a good way to analyze past draft picks. I unfortunately don’t have the means or time to watch a ton of tape, so I wanted to find a way to analyze only stats and numbers. It’s not a perfect system, but at least it’s not subjective. I set the following guidelines:


•	I will look at picks from 2002-2015. Prior to 2002 there were 31 teams which made things tricky in my data analysis. I also wanted to make sure the draft class had at least three years in the NFL

•	I’ll only look at first round picks. Looking beyond that would make it too prone to outliers without a big enough sample size. Although maybe in the future I’ll expand it. 

•	My scoring metric would be Pro Football Reference’s AV. The grade is cumulative and is standardized across positions. [If you want to read more about it, you can check here](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/index37a8.html). It’s not perfect methodology (raw stats don’t always tell the full story) but it is a pretty complex grading system that covers a lot of factors way better than I could.

•	The grade is for the player’s career, not just for the team they were drafted by. 


I’ll now go into my methodology. It gets a bit dry and math-y, so if you’re not interested, I would recommend just skipping down to the Results/Analysis section. 


#***Methodology:***

I first took everyone’s AV and put them in a giant chart, 32 picks over 14 years. [It wasn't too hard pulling the data from this page for each year.](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2002/draft.htm) I wanted to look at how a player did relative to his draft position. Obviously, the first overall pick is expected to perform better than the 32nd. So I divided each player’s AV by the average AV across their year. For example, Cam Newton has an AV of 95, whereas the rest of the 2011 draft class has an AV of 41.84 on average. So he has done 2.27x ""better"" than the rest of his first overall peers. 


&amp;nbsp;


I then took these scores and averaged them for each draft slot across all the years. So Cam did 2.27x better than his class, and on average, each first overall pick did 1.65x better than his respective class. Likewise, the 32nd pick did .712x as well as his class. Logical that the last pick did “below average.”

&amp;nbsp;


I figured this would be a good metric to measure picks. Given that Cam did 2.27x better and other first round picks did 1.65x better, that would imply Cam was a good pick in that he outperformed expectations. However I needed a few more steps to clean up the data. I needed to add a regression line of best fit. This was necessary to ensure a later pick wasn’t graded harsher than an earlier pick. For example, the 17th pick did 0.81x as well as his class on average, while the 18th pick did 1.05x as well as his class. It wouldn’t be fair for any given 18th pick to be held to a higher standard than a 17th pick because the rest of his 18th overall peers did better. The regression line would ensure each pick would decrease in value and expectations.

&amp;nbsp;


The equation of best fit was GRADE = -0.192*PICK# + 1.4896. I was a bit disappointed the R^2 value was only 0.54, essentially implying it only properly represented 54% of the data. However, taking a closer look at some picks showed why the R^2 value was so low. There were a handful of notable outliers. The 24th pick was used on Ed Reed, Steven Jackson, Aaron Rodgers, Chris Johnson, Dez Bryant, David Decastro, and a handful of other stars. The 11th pick had Dwight Freeney, Patrick Willis, Big Ben, Jay Cutler, JJ Watt, and a few other stars as well. The 7th pick had an abnormal number of busts. Removing a couple of these picks brought the R^2 value up to about 0.83, which is pretty darn good. Removing data isn’t always best statistical practice, but this isn’t based on any sort of mathematical/physical “law,” so it’s not needed or expected to be perfect. Overall I am comfortable in saying this relationship is sufficient and ""smooths"" the data appropriately.

So each player’s grade was subtracted from their expected value based on the equation, and that was their draft grade.

#***Analysis:***

Now that all the scores are determined the fun part is looking at it and interpreting it.

&amp;nbsp;


**Top 10 Biggest Busts:**

*10.* Wendell Bryant: -0.917, [](https://www.reddit.com/ARI)Cardinals DT, 12th overall in 2002

Bryant played just three seasons for the Cardinals before getting suspended for his third strike of the NFL’s substance abuse policy. He quietly ended his career with 39 tackles and 1.5 sacks. 

*9.* Justin Gilbert: -0.922, [](https://www.reddit.com/CLE)Browns CB, 8th overall in 2014

There’s no denying that the Brown’s drafting has been ugly, especially in recent years. Gilbert may just be the worst pick of them all. The Oklahoma State product just couldn’t get it together in the NFL, getting traded to the rival Steelers for a 6th round pick just two years later. He is currently serving a year-long suspension.

*8.* Johnathan Sullivan: -0.922, [](https://www.reddit.com/NO)Saints DT, 6th overall in 2003

I think what this project revealed to me is how many defensive tackle busts slide under the radar. Sullivan had a very short and boring career, playing 3 seasons with Saints before being traded to the Patriots with whom he didn’t play a single snap before getting released.

*7.* Vernon Gholston: -0.939, [](https://www.reddit.com/NYJ) Jets DE, 6th overall in 2008

This one especially hurts as a Jets fan. Gholston was a quintessential “Workout Warrior,” with an incredible combine performance and all the physical attributes you’d want in a defensive end. However, he never put it all together in the pros and infamously finished his career without a single sack.

*6.* Troy Williamson: -0.940, [](https://www.reddit.com/MIN)Vikings WR, 7th overall in 2005

The heir apparent to Randy Moss, Williamson was a physical freak with high expectations. Unfortunately, he had no hands. He was traded to the Jags for a 6th round pick in 2007 and actually stuck around until 2010. He came up 14,161 yards short of Randy Moss.

*5.* Kevin White: -1.055, [](https://www.reddit.com/CHI)Bears WR, 7th overall in 2015

I’ll cut Kevin White some slack here, given he’s had some injuries to deal with, and it’s probably a bit early to say he’s the 5th biggest bust in the last 14 years. That being said with 193 yards and 0 touchdowns, he better hope he can get healthy and produce fast. His AV is 1 and the three picks after him are 22, 20, and 30. 

*4.* Jason Smith: -1.086, [](https://www.reddit.com/LA)Rams Tackle, 2nd overall in 2009

Smith is one of the more overlooked busts in recent memory. He was expected to be a franchise left tackle for years to come but never reached that potential. To give you an idea, he was traded for Wayne Hunter and was barely an upgrade. Oof. If it’s any consolation, the top of the 2009 draft was pretty weak outside Stafford.

*3.* Dion Jordan: -1.109, [](https://www.reddit.com/MIA)Dolphins DE/OLB, 3rd overall in 2013

The Dolphins traded their second-round pick to move up to take Jordan, and he rewarded them with 3 sacks in two seasons before getting a year-long suspension for PEDs. He did get 4 sacks with Seattle this last season, so it isn’t too late for a career resurgence. At this point in his career though he is a pretty big bust.

*2.* Charles Rogers: -1.267, [](https://www.reddit.com/DET)Lions WR, 2nd overall in 2003

A fair amount of my friends are Lions fans, and they would be happy to tell you their first-hand experience of the Matt Millen years. Charles Rogers was the first of the Lion’s 3 first round wide receiver picks from 2003-2005, and he was easily the worst. He ended his career with 36 receptions for 440 yards. Pretty rough for the second overall pick. At least they’d hit on Megatron a few year later.

*1.* JaMarcus Russell: -1.351, [](https://www.reddit.com/OAK)Raiders QB, 1st overall in 2007

Could it be anybody else? Russell is widely considered the biggest bust in NFL history, and I’m glad my system determined the same. My method doesn’t even consider the financial implications of his holdout and enormous contract. Russell was a highly touted prospect and physical freak, but just didn’t seem to care. This anecdote about Russell sums it up:

""The Oakland coaching staff would routinely give Russell DVDs featuring gameplans and new plays for him to study. The coaches started to suspect the rookie wasn’t doing his homework and came up with a brilliant plot to test him. One day they asked Russell how he liked the gameplan on the DVD they had sent him home with the previous night. He said he did, but there was one problem: The coaches purposefully gave him a blank DVD. Their suspicions were confirmed.""

Russell finished his career with a 7-18 record and 18-23 interception ratio.

&amp;nbsp;


**Top 10 Best Picks**

Let’s shift gears to some better picks

*10.* Joe Flacco: 1.283, [](https://www.reddit.com/BAL)Ravens QB, 18th overall in 2008

If you haven’t already guessed, this is going to be a pretty QB heavy list. Despite Flacco having some up and down years, his 2012 playoff run stands as one of the best. He was pivotal in bringing another Lombardi to Baltimore, and all the better value being a mid-first round pick.

*9.* Terrell Suggs: 1.297, [](https://www.reddit.com/BAL)Ravens LB, 10th overall in 2003

Back-to-back Ravens! Plus there’s one more coming up on this list. Suggs has been a staple of the Ravens defense since he was drafted, getting a sack in each his first four games at only 20 years old. Now he’s 17th all-time in sacks, and a repeat of his 11 sacks in 2017 would put him top 10 all time.

*8.* Aaron Donald: 1.403,  [](https://www.reddit.com/LA)Rams DT, 13th overall in 2014

Donald is the youngest player on this list by quite a few years. It’s all the more impressive considering the 2014 draft was pretty damn good. Having made the pro-bowl every year of his career and all-pro every year since his rookie season, there’s no wonder how Donald is on this list. The reigning DPOY has a bright future (and big payday) coming ahead. 

*7.* Logan Mankins: 1.418,  [](https://www.reddit.com/NE)Patriots G, 32nd overall in 2005

The only offensive lineman on this list, Mankins was a big part of the Patriots mid 2000s dominance. With 7 pro bowls (and a fumble recovery touchdown in 2006), Mankins was exactly what a team would want in a franchise guard. All the better he was taken 32nd overall.

*6.* Ben Roethlisberger: 1.476,  [](https://www.reddit.com/PIT)Steelers QB, 11th overall in 2004

Big Ben has been the face of the Steelers since getting drafted and starting with a 13-0 record as a rookie. He’s been consistently one of the best quarterbacks in the league since. Big Ben still holds the record as the youngest starting QB to win a Super Bowl at 23 years old in his second year. No doubt he has been a huge pick in maintaining Pittsburgh’s franchise success.

*5.* Philip Rivers: 1.574,  [](https://www.reddit.com/LAC)Chargers QB, 4th overall in 2004

Looks like we got back-to-back 2004 QBs (unfortunately neither Eli nor JP Losman are on this list). I expect some disagreement on Rivers over Big Ben, and to be honest I’m not sure I agree either. Rivers does however have the higher AV. Regardless there is no doubting that Rivers has been one of the best and often overlooked passers of the last 15 years. He is certainly the cornerstone of the Chargers franchise.

*4.* Ed Reed: 1.646,  [](https://www.reddit.com/BAL)Ravens DB, 24th overall in 2002

Ed Reed is considered one of the best safeties of all time, so his inclusion on this list isn’t surprising. He was a huge ballhawk, with the most career interception return yards (1,590) and as many playoff interceptions as pro-bowls (9). I could write more, but everyone knows Reed was awesome.

*3.* Julius Peppers: 1.693,  [](https://www.reddit.com/CAR)Panthers DE, 2nd overall in 2002

The hype around Julius Peppers has maybe declined as he’s gotten older, but he’s been dominant during his career. [Just take a look at this laundry list of NFL records and accomplishments. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Peppers#NFL_records_and_accomplishments)

*2.* Matt Ryan: 1.816,  [](https://www.reddit.com/ATL)Falcons QB, 3rd overall in 2008

I’m a huge fan of Matty Ice, but I was certainly a bit surprised by him being second on this list. But looking at his stats, he has been very consistent and his 2016 was certainly MVP caliber. Interestingly enough, he is one of only four MVPs (along with Cam Newton, Aaron Rodgers, Adrian Peterson) in this entire project due to Brady and Manning not being included. Regardless, the Falcons should be thrilled with Ryan’s career so far.  

*1.* Aaron Rodgers: 1.934,  [](https://www.reddit.com/GB)Packers QB, 24th overall in 2005

Before starting this, I would have bet money that Rodgers would be on the top of the list. I’m again glad that my method seems to match reality. Rodgers’ 2011 season throwing 45 touchdowns to 6 picks was one of the greatest seasons I’ve seen. He makes throws I don’t think anyone else can. He’s had some injury troubles, but Rodgers remains arguably the most talented passer in the league and the Packers are incredibly fortunate that Favre’s replacement is another Hall of Famer.

#***Conclusions and Evaluation***

Overall, I’m pretty happy with the results, as they seemed to do a decent job correlating how good/disappointing picks are. I'm glad this all came with 0 subjectivity, so there can't really be any accusations of bias towards a certain team. Most of the worst picks are guys that are traditionally seen as pretty big busts.

It’s not without its flaws but I don’t really think a flawless grading system exists. I would say there is definitely an argument to be made that the most recent drafts punish guys that start out the gate slow. For example Kevin White isn't officially a mega bust and Dante Fowler got punished for missing 1/3rd of his seasons so he is mischaracterized as a bust. In general injuries are treated just as bad, if not worse than a terrible season. You can make the argument that is a good rule of thumb (the best ability is availability) but I suppose there is some debate around that. Essentially, take 2015 with a grain of salt. 

Keep in mind that this grading system is entirely subjective. So while there may be grades you disagree with, the core of it really boils down to their AV, not any sort of bias. In other words, the grades are final. Also, I am not a statistics major or anything, I just did this for fun. 

If anyone has any feedback or questions feel free to comment! Hope you all enjoyed this!

LTHz2142,2018-04-22 14:24:31+00:00,Did one contract dispute/holdout in 2006 alter NFL offenses forever?,"Hear me out:

2006 Offseason: Super Bowl 39 MVP Deion Branch holds out for a new contract. Belichick is having none of it, as he credits the Eagles obvious zone coverage for Branch's Super Bowl performance. This is now a year later, after the Pats lost to Denver in the Divisional Round. While Branch is holding out, the Pats #2 receiver David Givens signs with Tennessee the same offseason.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

Now for the butterfly effect:

2006 Preseason: Pats trade Branch to Seattle for a 1st round pick. Pats #1 receiver is now a 35\-year\-old Troy Brown

2006 Playoffs: Pats blow 21\-3 lead in Indy thanks to many important drops. Brady struggled to connect with his WRs and favored TEs Dan Graham and Ben Watson.

2007 Draft: Belichick has had enough, trades for Randy Moss.

2007 Season: The Patriots totally alter their offense while keeping the base system the same. The league average for shotgun in 2007 was around 20&amp;#37;, the Patriots ran almost 50&amp;#37; of their plays out of shotgun. After tearing up the league, going 16\-0, setting many passing records, and generally taking advantage of teams playing their base defense every snap, the rest of the league decided that instead of trying to fight them they might as well just copy them.

The league average for shotgun use jumped to around 40&amp;#37; in 2008 and is today in 2018 around 65&amp;#37;. In fact, 2007 was the last year that any NFL team ran 100&amp;#37; of their plays from under center \(a few teams did, I believe Seattle and Washington were in this group\).

The base formation in the NFL was either singleback 12 or I\-form 21. The Patriots single handedly changed the base offense to shotgun singleback 11 or even 10 personnel.

This offense also killed the ""split backs"" formation in the NFL. This formation was once as common as I\-form, but by 2007 it was a formation for 3rd down and goal line: The 2\-point stance version on 3rd downs, and the 3\-point stance version on the goal line. However it was still popular in both of these situations at that time, especially for the teams running 100&amp;#37; under center. Seattle was still running 20\+ plays a game from split backs in 2007.

However, just like with the shotgun the Pats set the new tone. The Patriots ran just 1 play from split backs in 2007 \(a 1\-yard TD to who else? Randy Moss\), and again the copycat element was in play with the rest of the league. In 2008 and 2009 \(prior to the 2010  roughness and DB rules\), around the NFL the formation dropped off to endangered status, before almost completely disappearing in the 2010s.

The Pats themselves have never run the formation again after 2007. Split backs was used only for only 3 plays all season in the entire league last year. Since 2015 when I began keeping track, the formation has been used a total of 7 times in the NFL.

To a lesser extent, and unintentionally, the offense also killed off the ""offset singleback"" formation, a formation that was really only popular with the aforementioned Washington and Seattle by 2007. But the Pats killed off any last vestiges, by again running a handful of snaps out of this look \(maybe 3 or 4 all season\). They have used it very sparingly since 2007, for a handful of plays in the past decade. However, they still have used it more than split backs \(comparatively speaking, it might be like 3 \- 0\) which hasn't been seen at all. This formation was killed less intentionally than split backs, the Pats switch to shotgun is really what killed this one since the shotgun singleback is almost the same as offset singleback.

So I'm indirectly crediting Deion Branch's holdout for setting in motion the rise of shotgun use from 20&amp;#37; to 65&amp;#37;, for the decline in split backs thanks to the pats only using it once, and for shotgun switch logically killing offset singleback.",nfl,6430

ErrantVagrant,2018-04-15 19:57:13+00:00,Mom and Rimworld,"In '08, I moved to Seattle with dreams.  Dreams that were crushed by the job market and my own health problems.  I spent some time living in my car, hoping that I didn't have yet another heart attack.  In '09 I moved back home, in with my mom for a year before I got my feet under me.  She told me not to worry about it, and that some day I'd pay her back.  I got my feet under me but good -- by '12, I was buying a house.

And then Mom got put on oxygen.  COPD.  It started off light, but it quickly got worse.  I'd had plans for my bestie to move in with me, but we kinda scrapped that.  Mom moved in instead.  Which was fine at first.  We both still had our independence, my friend still spent a lot of time with me, and everything was good.

But her heart and lungs kept getting worse.

We went through all the tests, but there isn't a lot in the way of actual treatment.  What started as ""Use the oxygen while you sleep"" became ""24/7, plus having to use a nebulizer several times a day just to remain functional.""  My friend would spend the week at my place, helping Mom out while I was at work.

I knew that her not being able to even get out and garden hurt her but what could I do?  She was content to watch me do it, but it wasn't the same.  Eventually, I turned to video games.  We've always been huge into theater, so I started with the story-heavy stuff.  I was thrilled when she liked Skies of Arcadia and Chrono Trigger.  The stories that I could tell you about the Mass Effect Trilogy...  ""LASER PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE!""

But there were two games that I tried that she took a more active interest in.  After the both of us becoming rather invested in the troops of XCOM, I tried something new and she gobbled it up.  The first was Stardew Valley, where she could reclaim some of her lost gardening.  She actually played it!  It blew my mind!  The second was Rimworld.  She started off MGS1 saying how stupid and cliche the plot was.  By MGS4, she looked me dead in the eye and told me that if I didn't get Big Momma to safety, she'd disown me.  And then ordered me to stop my no kill run.

We talked a lot about the characters as we played, cursing them, loving them.  I installed careful mods to enhance what she seemed to enjoy.  As time went on, she decided to give it a try for herself.  The game is hard, but not because it's hard to understand or has a steep learning curve.  She was good at it!  I bought her a tower and a wireless mouse and keyboard so that she could play in her recliner, and she spent so much time playing that I had to get her a steam account of her own.

This changed about a month ago when she asked to go to the ER.  She'd been in pain, but we thought it was something else.  The doctor said that he thought it was her gall bladder, but that had already been removed.  We got transferred to another hospital.  They quickly realized that there were lesions on her liver.  They weren't lesions.  That damnable big C.  The biopsy confirmed it, stage 4.

A full week later, on a Friday, she was released back home with more followup tests and treatments to come.  Two days later, on Easter Sunday, we took her to the university hospital.  She didn't get released until Wednesday, sent to a nursing home for physio so that she could come home at some point.  Chemo, of course, but still.

The next morning, they didn't show up with her morning medication and nebulizer treatment until 11 AM.  By that point, she'd already soiled herself.

I pulled some dirty tricks to get her transferred to a better care facility immediately.  It was either that or murder, even though I'm pretty sure I understand exactly why it happened and don't entirely blame the staff.  (Management, though...)

This morning, I waited until she called to visit.  When she did, she had a simple request.  ""I want my tower.""  The nurses were a little frowny over that, saying that she needed her rest and shouldn't excite herself with video games.  We both pointedly ignored them as I set it up for her.  It wasn't on the big screen TV like she's used to, taking my spare (little) monitor.  Tomorrow I'll buy her a new one.  Once we were connected to the net, she updated Facebook, then immediately doubleclicked on Rimworld.

Within half an hour, she hit the space bar, turned off her mouse and keyboard, and took a little nap.  Twenty minutes later, she was apologizing and turning them back on.  She dived right back in, and we started talking about the colonists again, their hopes and dreams, why those two keep failing to woo each other within minutes of the other failing to woo them, and how she was upset that she didn't have a mortar to help take out the Thumbro yet, because she'd have pemmican for years.  She's been smiling as she played.

I don't know how much time I have left with her, but she's still here.  The woman who told me how worthless games were when I was young, who called me a fool five years ago, is being granted some relief from everything by making hats.  Not even human leather hats!  ...Well, she's old, I'll give her a pass.

She's napping again.  I'm sitting here, listening to the music.  Her tribe is in good shape.  Not great shape, but good shape.  They even have a revolver!  The nurses peek in on occasion, and I smile at them.  She's not getting excited, she's taking it nice and slow.  It helps that it's on a pretty low difficulty with Phoebe.  And while she's still weak and needs to nap constantly, right now things aren't so bad for her.  She has something more than just television to get her through.

To everyone who works on the game, developers or modders, thank you so much.  You have no idea what you've given me. ",RimWorld,2027
MiopTop,2018-04-14 23:32:17+00:00,"If Harden wins the MVP this year, OKC/SEA will have drafted as many future MVPs in the span of 3 years as the Celtics and Lakers have over the course of their entire history COMBINED.","Without a number one overall pick.

I think that's the best way to contextualise how insane what OKC/Seattle did in '07-'09.

They'll have drafted as many MVPs in those 3 years as any other franchise has in its entire existence. 

In fact, there's only 2 franchises in the history of the NBA that have drafted 3 future MVPs. The Bucks (Kareem in '69, Dr. J in '72 and Dirk in '98) had 3, but only got to pick Dr. J because he was already in the ABA and nobody else wanted to waste a pick on a dude that wasn't even going to join the league. Drafting him was completely worthless anyway since the Nets joined the NBA after the merger and got to keep Erving.

The Tri-City Blackhawks AKA Miwaukee Hawks AKA Saint Louis Hawks AKA Atlanta Hawks also drafted 3 future MVPs (Cousy in '50, Pettit in '54 and Russell in '56). Those guys won the first 4 NBA MVPs.

But then again, there were only 12 teams in the league in the '50 draft and only 9 in the '54 and '56 drafts.

Both those franchises drafted 3 future MVPs but only had one of them play for the team.

Other fun fact : Red Auerbach is the only GM to draft 3 future MVPs ('50 Cousy, '70 Cowens, '78 Bird).

If Harden wins, Presti will have joined Red Auerbach, also drafting 3 future MVPs ... in his first 3 drafts as GM.",nba,3518

From what I could see, none of them intended to get a job writing for web sites. Many of them wanted to be professors, some would settle for being a teacher, ideally they would write a novel or a screenplay.

Writing for websites was the LAST thing they wanted to do.

But the road to becoming a professor is exceptionally expensive and harrowing. For instance, my girlfriend had attended TWO of the tops schools in the world, and even then, she secured a job by the thinnest margin. The schools she attended are household names, and they are very VERY expensive.

90% of her peers didn't make it, so they had to do something else with their lives.

Stop for a minute, and imagine that you're twenty six years old, you have three hundred thousand dollars in debt, and you're a bartender. *Wouldn't that be a wee bit frustrating?* Imagine yourself working at some dive bar in Seattle, and you have a degree in English literature, but you didn't make the cut. And now you're using that college degree to deliver anecdotes to techbros from Amazon.

Imagine the absolute seething rage you'd be filled with, if you saw some dick from Amazon pull up in his shiny new Audi, while you're riding a bicycle to your bartender gig. And you have a shiny degree from Berkeley, while this dickhead from Amazon has no debt and he's five years younger than you.

But that's not all folks!

Now imagine if you spent six years of your life getting a degree, invested three hundred thousand dollars doing it, and you're pushing thirty. **Here's where the story gets particularly dark.** Although you'd always espoused the views of feminism, deep down inside there was nothing you wanted more than a white picket fence, a handsome husband, and a couple of kids. But here you are, at the age of 29, and things are starting to look bleak. You feel like you invested the best years of your life getting that degree, while all of your girlfriends were partying and meeting guys. Your girlfriends found the life they were looking for, and you're a freelance writer with no kids, no white picket fence, no husband. Even your writing gig is a joke, the truth is that you work at a bar to pay the rent, and having a mortgage is an unachievable dream.

If this was your life, would you feel a tiny bit of rage at the tech bros? When you saw some shithead from Expedia come into your basement bar, would it fuel your rage, which you channeled into your writing?

Or would you look at his smug face and think, ""good for him!""

Again, I had an opportunity to meet dozens of people like that writer, and I found that they were bitterly unhappy. *Which made for great articles!* But they were miserable people. Everything they'd ever dreamed of was slipping away, and they were mad as hell about it.",KotakuInAction,1007
Throw_Me_Da_Wae,2018-03-30 15:06:00+00:00,"I had trouble getting bites on my applications. Then I stopped checking ""I have or had a disability.""","This is kind of interesting and disappointing to me. I have a good resume, a 3.93 GPA, a couple of letters of recommendation (one from the editor of one of the biggest CS research publications in the US), and a not-too-shabby portfolio. But out of nearly 70 applications - mostly to local companies, even - I only got two responses. Didn't get either opportunity; they had hired someone else before even scheduling my interview.

I've never thought twice about checking, well, any of the boxes for reporting demographics or disability status. Honesty seems important when it comes to things they'll learn anyway in the interview. Plus, they talk all about how they legally can't discriminate, and they make a big ruckus about how that they even get bonuses from the government for taking on disabled workers! My disability is minor - I have a crappy lower back that I take medication for and it doesn't really impact anything that I do, but it was notable enough that I ended up registered as disabled. So if a company wants to use my semi-trivial condition to make stacks off the government, why not!

But then I started feeling really down on myself about not getting a single bite on these applications. Threads on this forum always say *you need to stop looking at the big companies and go local*! Well, I was already doing that; I don't want to move out of state, and certainly not to California or Seattle or anywhere else with outrageous cost of living, so I only applied to the likes of Google if they had openings in the local office. *You must have a bad resume*, well, apparently it's bad in a way that no career professional could spot, because I had plenty of people look it over. *Your portfolio must be underwhelming*, but in all of my applications, not a single person even viewed my portfolio.

It really sucks to get shot down when you should be at the very top of the candidacy list. So I finally decided on one simple lie on my application. I didn't click ""I choose not to disclose my disability."" I went all the way over to ""I do not have a disability"" while applying for 8 positions.

I got 5 emails and one phone call that week. One email asked me in the very first exchange what my expected salary would be. They didn't disappear when I gave them a vague range about 10% higher than the local going rate - they called the number I left in my response 2 hours later.

I'm kind of overwhelmed now by all of it, really. It feels like being thrown into the deep end. I'm being really skeptical as I approach these interviews I've got lined up because it feels like there has to be some catch here. While it could all just be coincidental, it seems unlikely - and that really makes me angry. I think that's what I'm feeling most right now. I've been told that disability information typically isn't even shown to the hiring folks for the sake of legal liability. But wow.

Has anyone else had this experience?

Edit: Whoa gold, thanks so much guys! It's both depressing and encouraging to read the replies here. I think what I'm maddest about is the idea that there were some good companies I may have had an opportunity to interview with if I hadn't checked that box - the places I'm talking with now will be good money and okay work, but they're definitely not in fields I'm excited about and are mostly my ""bottom picks."" So part of me still hopes it's a coincidence or a statistical anomaly. Hopefully experience and networking with these companies will at least get me into CS work that I'm more passionate about!",cscareerquestions,1217

ShivaMateria,2018-03-21 03:51:43+00:00,I found a stray dog while in vacation on the big island of Hawaii - what should I do?,"[Kohala’s gofundme page is now live for anyone wanting to help with her vet bills!](Https://www.gofundme.com/kohalas-vet-and-travel-expenses) 
UPDATE: we called Kohala animal rescue and spoke to them. They said if we surrender her here she’ll be euthanized. They’re helping us with paper work and she’s our dog now! She’s coming home with us to Seattle! 

UPDATE #2: we named her Kohala after the area we found her in. She’s already cuddly and quirky and completely inseparable from us. We tried to set her up a bed in the garage, but she started crying when we walked away. We’re going to hide her in our room until we can find somewhere pet friendly to move to in the morning. Thank you to everyone for all your kind words and support!

My friend and I found this young dog in the middle of the rain forest on Hawaii and it’s obvious she’s been out here a long time. She’s extremely skinny, her tummy and vulva are swollen, so we think she may be pregnant or sick. She obviously needs to see a vet. We fed her a little bit of wet food and gave her some water and now we’re letting her rest while we figure out where to take her. Advice on how to best (and affordably) handle this situation is appreciated! Also, suggestions for other subs to post this in would be awesome! I may consider crowd funding to help with her vet bills if they’re more than I can handle, but I have never done it before. 

I’m here until Friday morning, then I leave for Seattle, WA. 

I’m also curious about what the process is like if I decide to keep her, and what would be required to have her transported to the mainland if anyone has any resources for that.

MyWorkAccount_11,2018-03-21 03:02:10+00:00,Manatraders cancelled my account for complaining on facebook (Which was not associated with my manatraders account in any way),"So, I decided to re sign up for manatraders to start getting some standard reps in for GP Seattle, and I went to attempt to resubscribe after unsubscribing due to a negative experience, and a lack of use before.  But I thought a 1 month subscription was worth the negatives.  So, I go and try to resubscribe, but get an error message.  I open the live chat, and ask why I was getting an error, and proceed to have the following, very disturbing conversation with the representative.

TL;DR: I made a comment on Facebook stating I was cancelling because I was not happy with their system(respectfully, no name calling or anything rude, just stating I felt there were too many missing parts).  They apparently Facebook ""stalked"" me and found the manatraders account related to my facebook (That doesn't even share an email), and blacklisted my account.
Also: sorry for typos, I am apparently full of them...

Staff
Hello &lt;Me&gt;. How may we assist you?

&lt;Me&gt;
Hi, I am trying to resubscribe to your service, but I am getting ""Sorry, we cannot process your subscription right now""

Staff
Hi there, let me take a look

Unfortunately, that means that you are not eligible for a subscription at this time.

&lt;Me&gt;
Why is that? I was a subscriber for 6 months?

I cancelled not even a montha go

or rather just over a month ago

Staff
Not sure, let me take a closer look

did you have any issues in the past?

&lt;Me&gt;
unsure of what you mean by issues

Staff
were there any issues with your subscription in the past

&lt;Me&gt;
I forgot to return a deck for a couple weeks just before I cancelled, but I paid back all the mana hours with the buy more mana hours option

Staff
Ok, let me review, it may take some time. I'll create a ticket for you, and when i have more information for you i'll respond via the ticket. It will send an e-mail to the one you provided here

&lt;Me&gt;
okay thank you

Staff
One last thing

what level sub were you looking for? Premium like before?

&lt;Me&gt;
yes

Staff
did you write any bad comments on facebook regarding our company?

&lt;Me&gt;
Excuse me?

Staff
it's a simple question, did you write any negative comments on facebook or twitter about our company?

&lt;Me&gt;
My facebook activity is in no way linked with my manatraders account. Any correlation or change based on my posts is a violation of my privacy, and the law.

My facebook ahs not been linked with my account, and my email is not shared between the two

Staff
You want a subscription with us yet you cannot answer simple questions that we ask you?

&lt;Me&gt;
I absolutely posted a complain on your facebook wall, decalring the reason I was cancelling

Staff
but now you want a sub with us again after you publicly tried to discredit us? is this correct?

&lt;Me&gt;
discredit? Complaining about holes in your system is not at all trying to discredit

Nevermind, I have no interest in giving a company who does not respect it's customers any money Read

Staff
respect?

Staff has closed the chat.


--------------------------------------------------------
So, for more context I attempted to go find the Facebook post I made, but it appears to have been deleted.  They also do not appear to not allow any comments on their page since February.  But, it was along the lines of: I was cancelling despite liking the service because there were too may details they were missing.  For example, I rented a deck, and apparently forgot to return it, but didn't receive any notification of that, so I went heavily in debt on mana hours.  (Which I paid back).  I was upset that I didn't receive a notification after a day or even a week that they wanted their stuff back.  And I just wanted to share that feedback with them.  Apparently, they took that as a personal attack, and decided to try and get retribution on me.  

To be clear, I actually do not have a problem with the mana traders service itself, but the utter ridiculousness of this conversation is beyond me.  The email linked to my Facebook is not the same email that was linked to my mana traders account, nor did I link my facebook to my manatraders account, which means they did some real digging to find out which account was mine.

DriesMertens,2018-03-20 11:41:40+00:00,[OC] I’ve tallied the number of cards shown in the 5 most recent instances of 141 different club rivalries around the world to try to determine the “craziest” rivalries in world football.,"I’ve tallied the number of yellow and red cards shown in the most recent 5 matches between a collection of 141 rival clubs (in all competitions). My main goal here was to use the cards-per-match data to figure out which rivalries are the “craziest”. I know it’s nowhere near the best metric for this purpose, but it was relatively easy to obtain all the data using this metric and I think it’s still accurate for the most part if you look at the results.

---

All data taken from the 5 most recent matches for which soccerpunter.com had card data on record.

I suggest sorting by average yellow/red/total cards in descending order to get a picture of the rivalries ranked from “craziest” to “tamest”.

^^2 Only includes 3 matches.

^^3 Only includes 4 matches.

^^4 Two of the last 5 matches have ended in 0-3 awarded victories due to fan trouble.

The #1 most-carded rivalry was Universidad de Chile vs. Colo-Colo from 2010 to 2013 — by far. As you can see from the box-and-whisker plots, this select sample was a huge outlier. I was astonished when I saw that streak so I just had to include it.

On the other hand, the “tamest” rivalry (excluding the small-sample West Brom vs. Wolves) in terms of average total cards shown was Brighton &amp; Hove Albion vs. Crystal Palace.

I know it throws errors for the average calculations, not sure why. I think if you download the spreadsheet and open it in Excel it should be fine.

It's early, and slow, but it's building.","I know I don't have much to bring to the table yet as I am still growing this business but I thought this would be a good post for those always asking about home businesses or a side hustles all while still working a full time job. My daughter and I started this business two years ago and it is now bringing in around $1000 a month and still growing. 

A thousand dollars may not compete with some of the ""we made it"" posts that get added here but for most people asking questions about how to get started this might motivate a few to start. 
I also want to point out that my subscribers, followers, sales, that I am about to list are not high by any means. I hope this doesn't discourage anyone as well but help you understand that even with these small numbers we are making what many would consider a nice monthly side income to help out. 

**This turned out really long, I am sorry and I hope this is useful**

**The genesis**
This all started when we stayed at a hotel in Seattle a few years back and my eleven year old daughter and her cousin kept running to the bathroom to use a sugar scrub that was placed on the sinks. 
They must of used it at least a dozens times a day and as we left she asked to buy some. Once she purchased this small 1oz scrub for $7 I started to look at the product itself and the costs that went into it and mentioned ""we could make this at home"". 
She got excited and asked repeatedly over the next couple of weeks to make it, and then asked if it would be something we could sell. I looked sugar scrubs up online, found a couple facebook groups dedicated to this stuff and asked a few questions to get an idea of what I was looking at. Once we had a recipe we wanted to try we ran out and bought supplies, sugar, oils, jars, labels, all totaling about $50.
We spent that night putting them all together, mixing, labeling, wrapping up so that I could take them to work the next day. I work in a building that has a lot of women who love this type of stuff and they're constantly bringing in their own handmade items such as quilts, sewing projects, baked goods, etc for others to look at and purchase.
I grabbed all the jars the next morning and as I left my wife said ""You really think you're going to make money off those?"" 
I sold half the jars I took to work that first day for $97 to which my wife said as I got home ""No shit, you actually made that much from those?!""

**Creating the product**
Once I got home that night I told my daughter that I think we have something here and we should make them nicer next time. I spent the next few nights searching wholesalers, suppliers, amazon, you name it, for cheaper jars, bulk sugar, oils, labels and started ordering. I found a nice plastic jar we could package them in, some labels, cheaper oils and sugars and we got to work on the labels ourselves. 
We spent maybe another $100 on everything and had a sugar scrub that we liked, jar, label, product. 

**Selling the product**
I started selling to family and coworkers first, I think most people start there. I will say that I am lucky with work and some small sales. I work in a building that has a few thousand people and it's easy to show alot of people. Don't get me wrong this is not a gold mine, it brings me around $100-$200 a month from regulars and new. I don't want to discourage anyone reading this thinking that I jumped into a work goldmine.
Once I had products at work I started to walk around our town, which is a little tourist trap in spots, and shopped our sugar scrubs. I also posted in the local facebook town group and asked if anyone would be interested in selling our scrubs in their shops and had one lady say she would love too. About a month later she said that she hadn't sold a single one, even though I had a friend tell me she walked in and bought one from her. She never put them out on her shelves so I told her I would just come pick them up and thanked her for giving us a shot. 
I did this for a month or two, work, facebook, family and then finally started to wander around town for a place to set up a table display. I tried to think of some parks, town squares, anything that would have a lot of people walking through and everything took a city license to set up. Finally I drove past a local Whole Foods style grocery store and said fuck it, I'm asking these guys if I can set up and without hesitation they said yes. 
That first table set up should of been embarrassing but I didn't give a damn, I set up anyway and sold almost every single scrub I had and even the ones from the shop that said she couldn't sell them. I am normally a very quiet person out in public and don't often initiate random conversations with strangers but I hit up every single customer that walked in with a big smile and said ""All natural sugar scrubs today if you'd like to test them"" 
We made a little over $300 that day! 

From there I started to ask them every Saturday if I could set up again and they said ""Absolutely"" I was there every Saturday for about two months straight when one of the managers came to me and said they wanted to carry our products in store. During this time we also started to add some more products to our table. We made some body butters, lip scrubs, pretty much anything my daughter wanted to try out. 
My wife finally said ""If you're going to make things will you make me some candles, I hate spending so much for them."" Over the next couple of weeks we added candles to our table and made about $400. The first day I set them out we sold every single one. 

**Expanding our business**
This is where we are now, we have some of our products narrowed down and are now solid sellers, candles being the top one. For the last year we have been doing anything we can to get our products seen and anything to make sales. I sell them on our website, still at work, random friends on facebook, facebook sale groups, a few new small shops locally, and two in other states. 
I started to send our candles to anyone that had a following on instagram and found a couple of influencers with a decent following, anything to get them seen and grab new followers to the instagram profile. 


**Growing pains and mistakes**
From the top of the article, my first mistake was doing consignment with that shop that didn't sell a single scrub. I said no problem to this agreement in the beginning because we were small and I didn't have leverage to say no. Lesson learned. She actually did sell a couple scrubs, I know this for fact because a personal friend bought one. I gladly took my product and moved on. Consignment can be fine for some but if you do so you will have to keep track with your inventory, their inventory and you will even have to promote your own product for them as they really stand nothing to gain from selling your product like they would if they bought it from you at wholesale. 

Influencers is where I messed up next. I started to send my products to people with influence and didn't have a clear idea of what I was doing and no way to keep up with demand and offers since we were just starting. 
I reached out to a team member of Garyvee's that I followed at the time to see if she would take a look at our product and give us some feedback. She received our package and then asked if we would want to be one of Gary's sponsors for his weekly email he sent out back then. Gary's old email, and some still do, contain a sponsor at the bottom that offers free products or a nice discount for one of their products. I thanked her and another member that sets this up but had to say no because there was just no way I could meet this demand or even cover the cost for shipping 150 of anything for free. Huge miss. 

The next influencer I sent the candles too was a hit but it was a selfish send on my part. I noticed she used a lot of candles and asked her if we could send her some of our candles to try out. She loved them and said thank you but didn't post about them. After watching Garyvee for so long I wasn't disappointed, I knew that I didn't do anything too special to get a nice tag or feature. It wasn't until after I sent them that I realized there was nothing special about what I sent her, just a random product thinking she would use her giant platform for my gain. Very selfish without realizing it. 
A couple days later I finally pulled my head out of my ass and customized the candles for her. I had been following her for a while so I knew her colors, her styles, her likes and made a set of candles with a logo that featured her brand and made my logo very small in the corner of the label, she loved them! 
She promoted them on her profile, talked about them on her live stream and even used one as a giveaway item. I have sent her a few new version now and honestly I have not been sending her enough candles, I need to double down on this one! 
TheSkinnyConfidential has been nice enough to feature us many times now and I could not be more grateful. 

Not buying what I need, when I need it. Once I knew which products were selling well and I was making consistently, I should of bought items to help make this process more efficient. Soap molds instead of pans then cutting bars individually, jars, lids, commercial equipment, anything to help speed up production. 
I have gone months in some instances before I nutted up and bought something that would of saved me countless hours of time and made me money quicker because of cost and fear. 
When you know you have demand for something you know you will use such as a larger mixer, premade labels, more jars, back stock oils, whatever, buy it! 

Facebook ads is another growing pain. I am still learning this one and not gaining much traction but I see results in other ways. I have been playing with them for about a year now and I am starting to see what's working and what's not. I have spent about $500 so far but I have not gained one sale from that $500. I have picked up some subscribers but no sales that I can tie directly to the ads whatsoever. I am also not spending enough per ad to really grab the best clients I imagine. I only spend at most $20-$30 per ad just to test audiences and creative. 

**Learning patience and unknown blessings in going slow**
I always wish I had an extra $10,000 only to be thankful a few months later that I didn't have it. 
What I mean by this is every time I have said to myself ""If I only had X amount I would buy so much of X right now"". I can think of a thousand things I need at this moment to make this go faster but I have to remind myself that I am still in the beginning stages of this still and I am still learning. 
Not having that amount I would spend far less, something like $30 on new packaging that I wanted to order a thousand off, praising the patience Gods later because it turned out to no the right one, right size, right color, etc and only being out that $30 and not thousands. 
I am the type to go full force without thinking or testing properly and I have made several packaging mistakes that thankfully have only added up to very small amounts. I would of wasted thousands if I would of had it at the time. Throwing away $30 in product because I was impatient is easier to swallow than $3000. 

**Successes** 
One of our successes has been starting a youtube channel doing howto's on everything we do. I noticed that when I was learning how to make candles the videos on youtube were pretty bad and didn't include alot of pretty valuable information that a beginner should know. The top video in candle making even says in the video ""I won't show you exactly how I make these because I don't want you cutting into my sale"" 
I told my daughter ""we can make a better video than that!"" So we did! 
We are now at 3000 subscribers and that how to make candles video just hit 100,000 views! We could not be happier about that. 

Last year we missed out on all of the local farmers markets just because we started too late to sign up. This year I jumped fast and I have the licenses needed and I am signed up for all the big ones. This year should be very nice for our business. 

**Shameless plugs**
If I missed anything please let me know, I will try to answer everything. 

I hate to plug my stuff but just to show what we have been up too, here are the links to every thing mentioned above.

**Some more stuff**:  
Hey guys! So the one question I have been asked very often is ""Wait, you sold your house, and you're donating 100% of proceeds, so how are you making your money back?"". I'm not. It's that simple. And, while that may seem crazy, the reality is PLENTY of indie developers put themselves into total financial ruin making games that they want to sell and earn money from. In fact, I don't even think it's altogether RARE for this to be the case. The only difference between what I am doing and what others before me have done, is that I decided long before I started the game that I was not going to make money from it. That allowed MANY amazing sponsors and partners to come on board and give to the game in ways they couldn't if the game were not for charity. Microsoft did an entire User Research project on the game last summer, flew me up to Seattle on multiple occasions to meet with their 1st part design team, as well as visit Seattle Children's Hospital to allow current cancer patients to try the game out and give me feedback. They even hired a QC company to assist me get through certification on Xbox One. Razer donated a Blade for me to develop on the road and at conferences, Twitch partnered my channel and has been very generous with featuring my work as I went along. Unity gave me two years of Pro license and Cloud Build for free. And most of all GameChanger Charity has pulled all stops to support my efforts and has made creating this game for them a breeze.  
  
This was removed previously for being a request post.  So I changed and resubmitted.  But, if you are enjoying the AMA and think that the game should win a HUGE prize for the charity, then you can [Please take the 10 seconds it takes to vote for ""I, Hope"" in the Indie Amplifier](https://www.amazon.com/l/17592296011)

Gaymerwannabequeen,2018-03-03 03:19:05+00:00,Extra tea from De La's viewing party in Seattle!,"Hiya subreddit! So /u/Istsomface put up a post earlier today that has the biggest bits of tea I got from the viewing party (link: https://www.reddit.com/r/rupaulsdragrace/comments/81csvv/i_went_to_bendelacremes_viewing_party_in_seattle/), but I took notes during the show and have more to spill. There's kind of a lot of little things, so I'll just go chronologically, and this is gonna be a LONG post, so buckle up.

The show was co-hosted by Seattle-based gender blending burlesque performer Waxie Moon (who is fucking fabulous, look her up), and the show opened with performances by three other members of the Seattle burlesque scene that are close De La friends (the amazing Faggedy Randy, The One The Only Inga and Ruby Mimosa), and then things got right down to business.

Waxie brought up Shangela, and De La echoed something she'd mentioned in previous viewing parties, that watching Shangela on set was like watching a master at work since she's so good at reality tv. She jabbed at Shangie by saying ""She does reality television like I do actual challenges"", and we all fell out laughing.

De La also brought up the meme she put up on Insta a bit ago (https://www.instagram.com/p/BfXUaW4AbqU/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=bendelacreme), and said that she actually checked with Shangela before posting it, asking if it was funny, to which Shangela replied ""girl that's hilarious, go for it"". She mentioned that the two of them have gotten pretty close.

There was discussion of the previous weeks' events and what De La had been doing with touring, and she mentioned that she did her show Inferno A Go-Go at the University of Miami in Ohio, and the second day she was there she did a workshop on a specific theatre term (that I can't recall and didn't write down) about writing your own shows, and said that it was one of the most fulfilling experiences she's ever had.

Right as the episode was starting, she mentioned that people have been calling her ""calculating"", and retorted with ""thinking things through before you say them is being calculating, but blurting out your thoughts is being real?""

During the first commercial break she talked about her Spice Girls fandom, and said that in junior high she dyed her hair red with a blonde streak, and went to see Spice World in a mostly empty theater, and she was super excited that Emma Bunton was going to be a guest judge (when usually the contestants feign interest).

Waxie Moon asked her how long the drama circle around the table lasted, and De La quipped ""oh, like six months."" Her only new comment to add about her elimination of Morgan was thinking ""yes, I will be a hypocrite for one moment to move forward drama free. Welp, that didn't work!"" When Waxie mentioned that Chi Chi didn't seem to have any drama with everyone, De La responded that Chi Chi had spent several weeks being like ""yeah you guys can pick me"", and didn't have any beef about it.

When it cut to commercial right after her recording session with Adam Lambert, she immediately said ""yeah, I was in my feelings, but I'm also not a very good singer"", and I died. She said that the nympho mathelete character Trixie came up with was brilliant, and called her an idiot (in a loving way). She said that she thought her banter with Adam was super entertaining, and said something akin to ""that should be the show, why am I watching thorgy yell at people"".

De La and Waxie had a bit of an in depth conversation about how De La chose the goth character (Waxie's alter ego is a professor at Cornish College of the Arts), and talked about how De La was intentionally putting how she was feeling in the moment into the work she was doing in making that character, a topic that De La echoed later about her creation of her one-woman shows and Gaylord Manor. She also said that the goth kitty character was an intentional choice to contrast Shangela, Bebe and Kennedy's characters, saying that in some ways they can boil down to ""drag queen"", then Trixie came out of left field with sexy nerd, and she wanted to do something with the same camp and specificity as Trixie.

Threw out this comment: ""there's nothing like a subtitle to make you realize how much you say 'like'. I'm in good company, but I'm the worst.""

She later mentioned that since the show, she and Morgan have gotten pretty close. There's a group text with all the contestants, but De La has a few one-on-one texts with the other girls, and Morgan is one of them.

She described her hemming and hawing about choosing who to eliminate as ""pug noises"" and parodied them by basically snorting and grunting into her mic, which was hilarious.

She also mentioned that the style note for this challenge was extra vague, just ""90's pop group"", and she went with something Baby Spice-inspired, which included the yellow skirt that Trixie was wearing!

During the commercial break before the lip sync, she quipped ""it was really an impossible decision. Except that Shangela shouldn't go"". Then someone in the audience shouted at her asking if she threw the lip sync, to which she responded ""It's in three minutes, calm down! What are you, reddit?"" She also confirmed that the lip sticks are fake, they're just painted rectangles.

The only other thing I'll add (since the other tea post covers most of the rest of what I wrote down) is that she elaborated on her whole decision, and compared it to watching the movie Signs in terms of foreshadowing (the blonde girl leaving out water glasses that kills the aliens, specifically, and how it was set up steadily over the whole movie). She came up with and executed the idea in about 12 hours, and started with the winner being forced to send one of the top five girls home. During deliberation, the other four of the top five queens were all really pressed about one of them having to go home, and De La didn't feel the same anger at that piece of their situation.

Apparently after the queens choose their lip sticks and walk off set, they have to show the director who they chose. When she showed her white-outed lip stick to the director, she was feeling unsure if she would be able to do it (hence picking Kennedy's lip stick in case they forced her to eliminate one of the bottom three). But the director's response was to do a hand motion of an explosion, and say ""magic"", which confirmed for her that she was making the right decision.

After the episode ended, there was some Q&amp;A, and someone asked if her previous drag persona Tina Angst inspired her goth kitty character, and she confirmed that it did. In talking about Tina, she mentioned that she felt super angry back when she was living in Chicago, in part because she felt she didn't fit into the drag scene there (which at the time was heavily influenced by the lineage of pageantry in drag), and that informed Tina. But then about when she was creating De La, she realized ""you know what doesn't make you feel less angry? Acting angry all the time.""

The last question asked was which three seattle queens she'd like to see on seasons 11 and beyond, and she mentioned Abbey Roads, Minerva Markos (noting that she has a cool look and is a blatantly political queen, which De La likes), and then finished with ""I think drag race is ready for Waxie Moon"".

All in all, it was a super touching experience, not just for the gaggerama but to see the outpouring of love and support Seattle has for De La. The room was full of unabashed fans, and the mood was so earnest and open-hearted, and I'll treasure last night for a long time.

TLDR: Seattle adores De La, she said a lot of quippy funny things, and was wonderful to watch.",rupaulsdragrace,1030

Istsomface,2018-03-02 08:21:22+00:00,I went to BenDeLaCreme’s viewing party in Seattle.,"I was in Seattle by happenstance when Ben announced that she was having a viewing party. Having read the spoilers..... I knew this was the one not to miss. Here are some significant things she said during the viewing

- Apparently Thorgy brought the whiteout. Ben remembered she had it from earlier in the season and asked her for it, but didn’t tell Thorgy why she needed it.

- Ben and Trixie joked all season about using white out on the lip stick and writing Rupaul’s name instead, so Ben knew this would be especially a gag for Trixie. 

- Ben wore the outfit she was going to wear if she made it to the finale. It was this beautiful sparkly gown with peacock feathers in the back. When the episode was finished she tore off the bottom part of the outfit and pushed the peacock feathers back to reveal a plume. She then turned around and there was a peacock head on her derrière. It was awesome.

- Ben said if she HAD to send someone home it would have been Kennedy. (Obv)

- If RuPaul was eliminating queens instead, Ben said she probably wouldn’t have quit, but she’s not one hundred percent sure. 

- Ben got teary eyed eyed after the elimination and said she didn’t regret her choice. 

- Someone in the audience asked why she didn’t choose Aja, considering her superior performance. Ben pretty much reiterated what she said on the show about why she brought Morgan back. She felt like Morgan didn’t get the chance to showcase a lot of her drag because she was out first. She talked about how Drag race is one of the sole platforms in drag and felt like Morgan had the most to gain. Apparently she is one of the few queens from the season Ben texts regularly.

-  I asked Ben if she would consider coming back to an all winners season due to her track record. She said who knows, which I took as a yes.",rupaulsdragrace,1978

If you’re on r/NFL a lot, you’ve probably noticed that whenever there’s a story about a player working in charity or something, I comment that if they were a dog, they’d be a good boy. I thought I should write something up like the [Which teams have fewer fans than their namesake? A study](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/6jarda/ocwhich_teams_have_fewer_fans_than_their_namesake/) that we got last year in the offseason. 

The way I am going to tell who the most good boy is by picking one player each team and giving them a good boy rating. Right now you’re probably asking, “oh, but u/CharleyJacksson, how did you decide what player represented each team?” Well, I basically just picked fan favorite players that have a good reputation for working in charity, or just didn’t rape someone or murder a guy. 

I recommend donating to your favorite good boy’s charity of choice :)

#Denver Broncos Good boy: Von Miller

Good boy rating: 7/10

[Charity link](https://www.vonmiller.org/)

Starting out with my Raiders most hated rivals, the Broncos most good boy is Von Miller, a 6-time Pro-Bowl OLB. The biggest knock to his good boy-ness came in 2013, when he was suspended for violating the league's rules on drugs. He apologised and has done a lot to help restore his character. Von is a big supporter of our troops, and has a foundation to help kids get glasses.

#Kansas City Chiefs Good boy: Eric Berry

Good boy rating: 11/10

[Charity link](http://eb29.com/online/eric-berry-foundation/)

If this were a test to see what player would be the toughest boy, Eric Berry would win. After playing 5 seasons in the NFL, Eric Berry was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, but was back on the football field a year later. Berry has suffered several injuries throughout his playing career, including a torn ACL in 2011, a high ankle sprain in 2014, and a ruptured Achilles this past season. As a Raiders fan, I find it very hard to root against him. He is exceedingly inspirational, and an overall great person. Eric runs The Eric Berry Foundation, which provides beneficial opportunities and a safe environment for children to participate in team sports and leadership development programs in order to encourage strength of body, mind and spirit. Eric also travels with mobile medical clinics, even going to Ugandan villages in 2013 and 2014. 

#Los Angeles Chargers Good boy: Philip Rivers

Good boy rating: 9/10

[Charity link](http://riversofhope.org/donate/)

Rivers is known for being a fantastic leader and great trash talker. A 7 year boy fighting two different types of cancer in LA wanted nothing other than to meet Philip, so Philip got in a car, drove two hours each way just to meet him, and watched a Ravens-Chargers game with him. Rivers said, ""there was a kid that could be dying any day, and he wants to meet me of all people. This 7-year-old could make any wish and he wants to hang out with me. Man, you don't turn that one down."" Philip’s charity is Rivers of Hope, a free 24 hour crisis line. 

#Oakland Raiders Good boy: Derek Carr

Good boy rating: 10/10

[Charity link](https://www.valleychildrens.org/)

Now for my favorite Good boy. This one was tough because I had to come up with a fair and unbiased rating for him. Derek is a fantastic man that is not shy to stand up for what he believes in. He is very involved in his faith, and works closely with Valley Children’s to help sick children. After signing his $125mil contract, the biggest contract in NFL history at the time, Derek was very excited to talk about all the positive ways he will spend his money, saying, “The exciting thing for me money-wise, honestly, is this money is going to help a lot of people. I’m very thankful to have it, that it’s in our hands because it’s going to help people. Not only in this country, but in a lot of countries around the world. That’s what’s exciting to me.”

#Houston Texans Good boy: JJ Watt

Good boy rating: 37,000,000/10

[Charity link](http://jjwfoundation.org/)

Everyone knew this one was coming. The Walter Payton Man of the Year winner this season, JJ Watt made headlines after raising $37,000,000 for Hurricane Harvey relief. He not only raised that substantial amount, but he also did as much as he could by going out and giving the men and women of Houston food and water. Although it took a detour to help after a disaster hit home, JJ’s foundation, “mission is to provide after-school opportunities for middle-school aged children in the community to become involved in athletics, so that they may learn the character traits of accountability, teamwork, leadership, work ethic, and perseverance, while in a safe and supervised environment with their peers.”

#Indianapolis Colts Good boy: Darius Butler

Good boy rating: 7/10

[Charity link](http://dariusbutler.com/foundation/)

This player is probably one one of lesser known good boys, but it is not undeserved. Darius’ foundation strives to help feed the hungry and inspire kids in rough communities. His father served 11 years in the Army, so Darius knew the importance of life and the cruel, uncaring void that we call a universe. 

#Sacksonville Jaguars Good boy: Blake Bortles

Good boy rating: 7/10

[Charity link](https://www.blakebortlesfoundation.com/)

Blake Bortles is anything but trash. A mid-tier starter on the field, Blake gets a lot of hate thrown his way. He has become a fan favorite after upsetting several teams who called him and his team garbage. Off the field, he is a fan favorite for his goofy, [awkward interview with Barstool](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/7qtapx/qb_blake_bortles_on_what_he_would_be_doing_if_he/), and his fantastic charity which supports first responders in the Jacksonville area, and helps people with intellectual and developmental disabilites persue full and indepent lives.

#Tennessee Titans Good boy: Delanie Walker

Good boy rating: 10/10

[Charity link](http://delaniewalker.org/)

Everything I hear about Delanie is positive. He has broken out the past 4 years, getting over 800 yards 4 seasons in a row as Marcus Mariota’s go-to receiver, and he has taken advantage of his success on the field and used to to spread awareness and help those less fortunate than himself. [You may remember him offering to let bullying victim Keaton Jones come to a Titans game.](https://247sports.com/nfl/tennessee-titans/Bolt/Delanie-Walker-brings-awareness-to-school-bullying-112048402) His foundation stands to provide inner city and low-income children with educational opportunites and resources to reach their full potential. 

#Baltimore Ravens Good boy: Joe Flacco

Good boy rating: 6/10

[Charity link](http://www.the-red-devils.org/)

Joe Flacco is elite in the hearts of Ravens fans everywhere. He has fully embraced Maryland and the Baltimore area, spending a lot of time working for the community. While he doesn’t have his own foundation, Joe has worked with several other charities, most notably The Red Devils of Maryland, a breast cancer foundation. He has also worked with several of other Raven’s players foundations, including Ray Rice, Ben Grubbs, Derrick Mason, and Ed Reed. 

#Cincinnati Bengals Good boy: Andy Dalton

Good boy rating: 8/10

[Charity link](https://www.andydalton.org)

Andy is a fellow Texan and ginger, so I will always support him and his fire crotch. Andy’s foundation became famous after he put the Bills in the playoffs and fans donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to it. The foundation, run by his wife, does several things for Cincinnati and Texan communities, including bring technology, educational resources, and entertainment devices to schools and hospitals, a daycare for parents of sick kids so they can go and have a date night, a all-expense-paid trip to a theme park for sick kids, a fund for medical equipment that goes to the families of sick children, and trips to children hospitals from Santa and his Elves. 

#Cleveland Browns Good boy: Joe Thomas

Good boy rating: 10/10

[Charity link](http://www.sc4k.org/)

Joe Thomas is known for being a dedicated player, sticking with a franchise that shoots itself in the foot repeatedly. He is a fan favorite for being a super cool dude. He doesn’t have his own foundation, but is a huge advocate of Shoes and Clothes for Kids, which gives shoes and clothes to kids. One thing is for sure, Joe Thomas isn’t as terrible as his franchise is.

#Pittsburgh Steelers Good boy: Alejandro Villanueva

Good boy rating: 11/10

[Charity](https://secure.uso.org/?sc=WEBDONATE&amp;show_amount=true)


Alejandro, a former Army Ranger, is a massive supporter of the military. After bring national attention to himself after accidentally standing away from his team, his jersey sales spiked, and he donated all of the money he got from them to the USO and other military non-profits. 

#Buffalo Bills Good boy: Andy Dalton

Andy is a fellow Texan and ginger, so I will always support him and his fire crotch.

#Miami Dolphins Good boy: Kenny Stills

Good boy rating: 4/10

[Charity link](https://pledgeit.org/kennystills)

I honestly had no idea to pick for the Dolphins. Jarvis Landry, Ryan Tannehill, and Cameron Wake don’t seem to have favorite charities, and Jay Cutler’s foundation is shut down, or at least doesn’t have a website or anything. Most of the charity work I found under Jay Cutler is from years ago. Kenny was their Walter Payton Man of the Year nominee and is active in the stand against social injustice. 

#New England Patriots Good boy: Nate Solder 

Good boy rating: 6.9/10

[Charity link](http://special.patriots.com/offers/index.cfm?UUID=NEPCFDonations)

Nate protected Jimmy G’s beautiful face for a couple games. He also did some charity work or something with kids or something, but he protected Jimmy G’s face. 

But in all seriousness, Nate is a great guy. He works with the Patriots foundation to help build playground for kids.

#New York Jets Good boy: Quincy Enunwa

Good boy rating: 7/10

[Charity link](https://palnyc2008.thankyou4caring.org/pages/donate)

A lot of people may have forgotten about Quincy, but I haven’t. He’s a great slot receiver, a real gym rat. He won United Way of NYC’s Hometown Hero award, and works with NYC PAL to help kids play sports.

#Dallas Cowboys Good boy: Jason Witten

Good boy rating: 11/10

[Charity link](http://jasonwitten82.com/foundation/)

Jason is a stand up dude on and off the field. I always thought he ran real weird though. That doesn’t matter though, he’s a cool dude. His foundation helps with NFL Play 60, and helps put positive influences in battered women’s shelters all over Texas. I implore you to go to his charity link and read about all the things his foundation does. It’s fantastic and I’m not surprised because Jason is just so great. 

#New York Giants Good boy: Eli Manning 

Good Bote rating: 10/10

[Charity link](http://www.hackensackumcfoundation.org/site/TR?team_id=2016&amp;fr_id=1430&amp;pg=team)

Eli is a massive dork and is totally self aware of that. He’s such a great guy too. He is responsible for the Pats losing 2 SBs, and works closely with several charities and organizations. The one I linked to is one for children with cancer, and him and his wife will match all donations to it. Eli is a really good boy.

#Philidelphia Eagles Good boy: Carson Wentz

Good boy rating: 17/10

[Charity link](http://www.ao1foundation.org/)

Carson was so close to locking up the MVP trophy before he tore his ACL. After reading about his foundation, I had to up his Good boy rating. One of his foundations 3 objectives is to support the development of individuals by providing service dogs to help increase their quality of life. I got a service dog several years ago and he saved my life. I am so happy to hear Carson is trying to help more people get service dogs.

#Washington Redskins Good boy: Kirk Cousins

Good boy rating: 10/10

[Charity link](http://theelaineshusterfoundation.org/)

Kirk loves Julie very much. He is knowns for complementing players for hitting him and apologizing to his O-Line after sacks for holding onto the ball for to long. Whoever lands him in free agency is very lucky to get him and Julie. He and the Redskins donated several dollars to The Elaine Shuster Foundation, which brings money to education in Maryland. 

#Chicago Bears Good boy: Sam Acho

Good boy rating: 13/10

[Charity link](http://www.livinghopeministries.us/donate/)

As a massive Longhorns fan, I’ve always loved Acho. He is well known for his trips to Nigeria to help those less fortunate. He, and his brother, are fantastic and what he does for people cannot be understated. 

#Detroit Lions Good boy: Matthew Stafford

Good boy rating: 10/10

[Charity link](https://leadersandbest.umich.edu/find/#!/mimed/mott?utm_source=givetomott&amp;utm_campaign=givebtn)

Stafford is seriously underrated and I like him a lot. Everything I just read on him said that he does a lot of charity work but it isn’t publicized very often. I found a cool story where he won an auction for Lions tickets, parting with $15,000, then gave the tickets to a sick child. What a good boy.

#Green Bay Packers Good boy: Aaron Rodgers

Good boy rating: 7/10

[Charity](https://give.salvationarmyusa.org/site/SPageNavigator/national_memorial_form.html)

Aaron Rodgers is possibly the most talented QB to ever play the game of football. He’s also the star of some state farm commercials that has a very good boy in it. He doesn’t good work off the field too, he donated $38k to Salvation Army. 

#Minnesota Vikings Good boy: Teddy Bridgewater

Good boy rating: 10/10

[Charity link](https://give.bcrf.org/checkout/donation?eid=31404)

His purpose will not be denied. 

#Atlanta Falcons Good boy: Julio Jones

Good boy rating: 7/10

[Charity link](https://childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/donate/)

Julio would be a very good boy. He would be very good at catch. He, along with his Falcon teammates visit Children Miracle Network Hospitals to cheer sick kids up. He is also a big fan of Campbell’s Soup. 

#Carolina Panthers Good boy: Cam Newton

Good boy rating: 10/10

[Charity link](https://www.cam1newton.com/)

Cam is known for his confidence on and off the field, so I think he would be a hard boy to settle down and train, but I bet he would be a good boy once he is trained. He works at his foundation to enhance the lives of youth by addressing their educational, physical, and social needs. 

#New Orleans Saints Good boy: Drew Brees

Good boy rating: 14/10

[Charity link](http://www.drewbrees.com/)


I lived in the NOLA area when Hurricane Katrina hit, and what Drew has done for the people of that area is immaculate. He does his best to make the community better and inspire every person he meets. He would be a very awesome boy.

#Tampa Bay Buccaners Good boy: Gearld McCoy

Gerald grew up hungry and lost his mom at only 19 to an unexpected Brain Aneurysm. He had a rough road to get here, but that doesn’t matter, Brian, he’s here. He spends time with kids at free football clinics, teaching them how to be great men like himself.  

#Arizona Cardinals Good boy: Larry Fitzgerald

Good boy rating: 13/10

[Charity link](https://give.bcrf.org/checkout/donation?eid=31404)

[Charity link](https://secure2.wish.org/site/SPageServer?pagename=donate_now&amp;chid=100-000&amp;chid=100-000)

The winner of Defensive of Player of the Year in 2017, Donald is the best DT around. Wade Phillips even said he should have won MVP. A couple years back, Donald won a Madden charity tournament, giving $51k to the Make-A-Wish Foundation. 

#San Francisco 49ers Good boy: Jimmy Garoppolo

#Seattle Seahawks Good boy: Russell WIlson

Good boy rating: 16/10
[Charity link](https://whynotyoufdn.org/)

Russell is the definition of a class act. He has donated millions on top of millions to various charities and hosts golf tournaments. He even gave the Patriots a Superbowl. He is a favorite of mine and if it wasn’t for Carson Wentz being such a dog lover, and JJ Watt saving a city, he would be the most good boy in the league.

CProphet,2018-02-06 20:57:56+00:00,Falcon Heavy Future,"The long anticipated Falcon Heavy has finally come - and gone to Mars – so it should be interesting to explore some of the great things this goliath launch vehicle could accomplish in the near future. Just this year we expect two more FH launches, [STP-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Test_Program#Upcoming_activities) for the US Air Force (to complete EELV certification) and [Arabsat 6A](http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/arabsat-6a.htm) for Saudi Arabia, due to fly on a new FH version called ‘Block 5’ (SpaceX never stand still on development!)

More interesting still is the new vista of possibilities opened up by FH, which is now the most powerful rocket in operation. Falcon Heavy is classed as a ‘Super Heavy Lift’ (SHL) launch vehicle, in other words it’s capable of placing more than 50 metric tons into Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Effectively that means FH can launch any planned payload to any location in our solar system.

So the answer to the question: what missions can Falcon Heavy fly is – YES!

[Grey Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_2#Crewed_circumlunar_flight)

[Europa Clipper](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/europa-clipper/)

[Psyche](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/psyche/)

[WFIRST](https://www.nasa.gov/wfirst)

Here’s a table to give some idea of the maximum payloads possible for a selection of solar destinations:-

| | LEO | GTO | Mars | Pluto |		
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|	
| Max Payload | 63.8 mt | 26.7 mt | 16.8 mt | 3.5 mt |

Basically SHL is too much for LEO but should be ideal for cislunar operations, which is anywhere in proximity to the Moon. For example the Saturn V was a SHL launch vehicle, optimised for Moon landings. 

The government will pay good money to build a cislunar station (called Deep Space Gateway), plus provide all the necessary crew flights and cargo. It is currently proposed such a station could be complete by 2030, using a fleet of disposable SLS. However, with a single reusable Falcon Heavy, such a station could be deployed by 2020 (assuming availability of modules), using just the SLS reserve funds!

Given the magnitude of missions FH can perform, perhaps it would be more practical to discuss what new types of  missions it makes possible.

* Lunar landers/rovers – essential for scouting locations of a Moon base or in situ resources

* Orbital fuel depot – the ability to refuel satellites using rendezvous vehicles is an emergent technology. Having an orbital depot capable of refuelling those rendezvous vehicles could allow these operations to be performed faster and at less cost (because rendezvous vehicles could be refuelled and reused)

* Planetary orbital missions – instead of flyby probes, FH should allow long duration orbital missions because the increased payload capacity allows sufficient fuel to be carried for orbital insertion and maintenance. In addition these flights could be direct i.e. dispense with planetary slingshot manoeuvres to increase velocity, reducing time to deployment

* Search for life – three moons in the outer solar system, Europa, Enceladus, and Titan, look particularly juicy prospects for [discovering life](https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/04/nasa-confirms-two-moons-in-the-solar-system-are-venting-oceans-into-space/). From today FH makes these destinations accessible to automated landers/rovers. If NASA discovers life on any these worlds, their funding worries will likely be over, with international agencies fighting to be included on follow-up missions

* Extraplanetary Satellite Constellations – colonies on the Moon or Mars will require satellite constellations for communication and real time monitoring of surface operations. At the opening of the SpaceX Seattle Office [Elon Musk said](http://shitelonsays.com/transcript/spacex-seattle-2015-2015-01-15): “That same system [Starlink] we could leverage to put into a constellation on Mars, because Mars is going to need a global communications system too and there's no fiber optics or wires or anything on Mars. We're definitely going to need that. We're going to need high bandwidth communications between Earth and Mars. So I think a lot of what we do in developing an Earth-based communication system could be leveraged for Mars as well.” Falcon Heavy could be used to establish both Moon and Mars constellations before the first manned missions arrive, allowing more in-depth preparation and less fraught launch schedules

* Contingency Utility – we never know what we might need in the future, possibly at quite short notice. For example:[Oumaumau](https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/11/so-you-want-to-send-a-probe-to-catch-up-to-oumuamua/), the first extrasolar asteroid ever detected, has passed us by without any possibility of a mission to explore this interesting phenomena. However, with a fast turnaround SHL like Falcon Heavy, such missions could be launched while an intercept flight is still feasible. Asteroid defence is also a concern and FH should allow us to launch quite substantial countermeasures at relatively short notice, similar to a scaled up version of [DART](https://www.nasa.gov/planetarydefense/dart)

From a commercial point of view this inaugural launch proves SpaceX have no gaps in their capabilities and can compete for the most lucrative military missions, such as the hard driving  reference missions to Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO) or direct insertion to Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO). The [recently announced](https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=cc4fe6a113403f3a7b1d79cee4a123ff&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1) SBIRS GEO-5 (GTO), AFSPC-44 (GEO) and SILENTBARKER (GEO), are now fair game for SpaceX to pursue. They will likely win some of these launch contracts away from ULA, because from the military’s perspective, having an alternate vehicle to Boeing’s Delta IV Heavy should help them achieve their goal of: “assured access to space.”

Possibly the most exciting application for SHL is expanding the commercial space economy. In a few years Bigelow Aerospace plan to establish the first commercial space station using [B330 expandable modules](http://www.bigelowaerospace.com/pages/our-technology//). It’s possible FH could launch 2 modules (in tandem) to LEO or a single module to the Moon. Also there are asteroid mining ventures like [DSI](http://deepspaceindustries.com/mining/#mining)
 and [Planetary Resources](https://www.planetaryresources.com/), who will require increasingly heavy payloads delivered even further afield, to enable in space  resource extraction and refinement. In the medium term, the launch capabilities and cost advantages offered by Falcon Heavy should allow these commercial space concerns to shift into high gear.

From a strategic perspective, SpaceX are advertising they can launch much heavier payloads than previously possible. This should encourage customers to make more ambitious plans, now there is a rocket capable of delivering much heavier payloads. Overall the hardware for such missions can take years to develop, so it’s quite possible some launches gained with FH could later be transferred to BFR, when it becomes operational. Such launches should be considerably cheaper for BFR, thus generating even greater revenue for SpaceX’s end run on Mars (all made possible by FH).

Future is bright with Falcon Heavy, or more correctly golden. It’s our bridge to the future.

PoorNursingStudent,2018-01-14 06:19:16+00:00,Fire me for not wanting to risk my life? I'll cost you 250k+,"So this is a story from a long time back that is the biggest bit of revenge I've ever gotten. 
While I was in college, I had my EMT certification and decided to go for a EMT job after getting laid off from another job. It didn't pay as much but I found a decent local job that was by my house so I applied and got a position. I could tell it was a smaller outfit, they only had 3 ambulances and were desperate for any transports they could get. One day, at the end 10 hour shift when I was staring at the clock ready to go home I got a call from the owner, someone I had met only once and usually was home in Seattle (The company was in the Bay Area). 

He told me that he wanted me to take a call at the end of my shift and he would be putting in a bonus of 50 dollars if I took it . I said why not and had him text us the info. Turns out he wanted us to transport a psych patient in full restraints over 600 miles. It would have easily been a 10 hour drive including LA traffic and he told us he expected us to turn around and drive back right after. I flatly refused as this would have put me at 30 hours straight behind a wheel and I was done and afraid I'd fall asleep and crash.

He exploded at me and fired me on the spot over the phone (after trying to convince me to quit verbally first for not doing my job). I was beyond pissed. However he made one miscalculation in firing me. 

The previous job I had? I was a intern at the EMS agency, specifically the one who licenses him to allow him to operate.

I'd had called my old supervisor, a paramedic veteran, before before and after being fired with the details of what was going on. He'd said he'd take care of it but I never got a update.

Luckily for me, EMT's are in high demand and 2 weeks later I had a job and was training at a much more reputable company with over 40 ambulances and a real HR. At training, someone walked in I did not expect, a coworker from the previous ambulance company. 

She told me that my old supervisor did a surprise inspection the very next day, and apparently ripped the owner a new one and instantly shut him down and listed off a huge list of violations that had to be fixed (the ambulances had expired equipment/lacking certain things, The crew quarters were not proper enough). She told me that most of the EMT's had quit and the office staff/supervisors only stayed because he was paying them to not leave while he sorted everything. It took him nearly 2 months from what I heard to get everything up to snuff and get business going again. Over all in fines and repairs plus lost staff time were easily over 250 thousand dollars along with all the lost income from not operating. 

Now, I'm happy and just finished nursing school (so I'm no longer a slave driver, So much respect for people who stay as EMT's, its not fair what they are paid).",ProRevenge,1135

Velostodon,2017-12-18 20:12:48+00:00,Washington State Train Derailment Information,"**Updates Valid as of 4:15AM DC Time**

Hello everyone, 

By now you've probably heard the bad news about the train derailment in Washington State this morning. Now that we have some facts about what happened we would like to share them and make them more visible. 

**Known Facts:**

- #[NTSB has confirmed Train 501 was going 80MPH in a 30MPH zone.](http://www.king5.com/article/traffic/3-killed-dozens-injured-in-amtrak-crash-near-dupont/281-500303305)

- #[Amtrak confirmed that Positive Train Control, an automated system that makes trains slow down, was not in effect on Train 501 today.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/train-derailment-seattle/548660/)

- All but the following engine jumped the tracks. 13/14 cars. 

- 5 vehicles were struck by the train.

- Two additional semis were struck by the train. 

- There are fatalities but cannot confirm how many. Rumor is 6. 

- This was the very first run of this train and this service line. 

- This service line was supposed to be an improvement upon turns that were too sharp for trains to go fast on. 

- A Local Mayor campaigned against the train's current set up with a group that were urging the speed is was set to travel at was too high. 

- That fastest section of track was rated for 79MPH which is already pretty generous; according to most sources. According to the following bullets the speed for the section the crash occured on was only 40MPH. 

- [***The train at time just before derailment was clocked traveling at 81.1MPH.***](http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/amtrak-train-derails-south-seattle-51861721)

- ~~[Google is reporting the crash was here.](https://imgur.com/a/yxkyf) This is incorrect.~~ Google has corrected the placement of the crash.*

- The crash was [here.](https://imgur.com/a/49qKH) 

- [This stretch was on the blue line labelled here headed Southbound](https://imgur.com/ovUL1Ib.jpg). 

- [Which means the train was going far faster than allowed according to WSDT.](https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Projects/Rail/PNWRC_PtDefiance/Map.htm)

- Passengers reported rocking before bucking, which means the train leaned off the track from momentum rather than suddenly hitting something. 

- Some passengers now reporting a bucking as well, which contradicts earlier statements. This would support suddenly hitting something or jumping the track rather than rolling off of it. 

- The train took a trial run just this past week without issue and the first real run was this crash. If there was an obstruction on the track it would have had to have ended up on the tracks very recently. 

**Rumors/Most Likely Irrelevant Information:**

- AQAP published more tips about how to derail trains in the August 2017 issue of Inspire. They've been doing this for years and AQ has been threatening to derail trains for decades. This is not new and its not likely that they suddenly started acting on it on a train that's never run before. Possible, but not likely. 

- An ANTIFA affiliated webpage had a post talking about putting concrete on train tracks to stop movement of oil related materials. This was posted on 20 April 2017. This is most likely not related at all. 

- The ANTIFA Twitter that ""endorsed"" it is a troll account. 

- Other than the State of Washington and the existence of trains there is absolutely nothing to indicate ANTIFA is related at this time.

The NBA draft is arguably one of the easiest sources of what-ifs, and I found myself today thinking how different the league might look if Portland had taken Kevin Durant instead of Seattle (sorry Blazer bros). Got me to wondering how the league would look if some other drafts were flipped.

1998:
#1 - Clippers - Mike Bibby
#2 - Grizzlies - Michael Olowakandi
This does not change much historically. Grizzlies never get Bibby, which means Sacramento never gets Bibby, which maybe means that the Lakers don't have the big, tough rival Kings to deal with (though J-Will was awesome). Grizzlies get the shittiest kandi a kid can think of.

1999:
#1 - Bulls - Steve Francis
#2 - Grizzlies - Elton Brand
Another draft where the end result didn't truly matter either way. In real life, Francis pouted his way out of Vancouver before ever suiting up, eventually heading to Houston. I think if the Bulls take him, he ends up playing for Chicago for a bit. No backcourt mob with him and Cat Mobley. Memphis, meanwhile, would be trotting out a Kandiman - Elton Brand... AKA the exact line-up the Clippers sucked with a few years later. 

2000:
#1 - Nets - Stromile Swift
#2 - Grizzlies - Kenyon Martin
Take note: Grizz have had the #2 pick three years in a row. Christ. It hurt me having to think about Stromile Swift being the first overall pick in any draft ever (though his dunks were on point). K-Mart to the Grizzlies means they now have drafted three big men in a row. Sixers fans know what I'm talking about.

2001:
#1 - Wizards - Tyson Chandler
#2 - Clippers - Kwame Brown
Overall, the Wiz still wiff on this pick, with Pau Gasol coming off the board at #3. But Tyson is and has been infinitely better than Kwame, even if Kwame kind of got shit on unfairly during his career. This would be sooooooo mid-2000's clippers though to end up with Kwame. Instead they used Chandler to trade for Elton Brand in real life.

2002:
#1 - Houston - Jay Williams
#2 - Chicago - Yao Ming
This is probably the first draft that has some legitimate implications. Yao is a franchise-altering big. And Williams had moments as a potential stud point guard during his rookie year. Honestly, who knows if either player gets hurt in this scenario. Remember, Houston doesn't have Francis in this scenario, so Jay Williams and Mobley would form a nice backcourt. Of course, they'd rather have Yao. and Chicago gets a STUD to eventually pair with Hinrich, Deng, Gordon, etc. Also fat Eddy Curry has to move to the bench in this scenario

2003: 
#1 - Cavaliers - Darko Milicic
#2 - Pistons - LeBron James
hahahahahahahaha holy shit hahahahahahahahahahaha
But really. Cavs fans would be on suicide watch. They had already had a very rough last ten years leading up to this draft. Darko would be the nail in the coffin. And Pistons fans? Imagine Chauncey, Rip, LeBron, Rasheed, and Ben Wallace with Tayshaun off the bench. Is that 70 wins year in and year out? Fuckin A. Obviously this never would have happened but it's fun to imagine I suppose

2004: 
#1 - Magic - Emeka Okafor
#2 - Bobcats - Dwight Howard
While the Magic never won a title, it's hard to imagine them being relevant with Okafor at all, even though he was an incredibly serviceable big man for a long while. Charlotte gets the perfect building block to start their rebuild; maybe they are still the Bobcats if Dwight leads them to success, and maybe no one hates Dwight Howard. Eh or maybe everyone still does

2005: 
#1 - Bucks - Marvin Williams
#2 - Hawks - Andrew Bogut
One of the blander Top 2's. I suppose you could make the case that Bogut going to Atlanta means no Bogut going to the Dubs, which maybe means no Warriors dynasty. Maybe. Bucks would have been pissed with Marvin Williams. Hawks may have been fun though; Bogut's play style was similar to Horfords back in the day in regards to passing out of the high post (obviously not the shooter Horford was/is). Hawks don't change too much I don't think

2006:
#1 - Raptors - LaMarcus Aldridge
#2 - Bulls - Andrea Bargnani
Of course, the Bulls ended up trading Aldridge to Portland for Tyrus Thomas (ow). Bulls fans, would you rather have had Tyrus Thomas or Andrea Bargnani? I'll take a pair of adidas socks and some beats by dre over either guy, thank you. Raptors are scary as shit though. Aldridge + Bosh? that's V E R S A T I L I T Y. Maybe Bosh never goes to Miami, and there is no big three (also, LeBron is in Detroit killing it so he ain't leaving). 

2007: 
#1 - Blazers - Kevin Durant
#2 - Sonics - Greg Oden
So, in this scenario, Portland does not have Aldridge; instead they have Tyrus fucking Thomas. BUT they still have Brandon Roy. So we get at least a few good years of Roy - Durant, which is absolute dynamite. Maybe a lesser scoring load means Roy's knees hold up longer. Who knows. For the Sonics, it's a punch in the nuts. I've been saying injuries may not have happened in different scenarios for some of these guys, but I believe Oden would have been hurt no matter where he ended up. But maybe by not having Durant, the Sonics/Thunder would have kept Harden, meaning we still see a Harden/Westbrook backcourt. Could there have been some Durant/Roy vs. Harden/Westbrook matchups? I'm sad there wasn't.

2008:
#1 - Bulls - Michael Beasley
#2 - Heat - Derrick Rose
At this point, the big three in Miami probably isn't happening, as LBJ is in Detroit winning titles and Bosh is leading Toronto deep in the playoffs with Lamarcus by his side. So Wade needs a side-kick. How about another dynamic, slashing guard? No one would be able to contain a Rose/Wade backcourt; it would have been disgusting. The Bulls would have been fucked. Now they have Beasley, Deng, Hinrich, and Yao. Solid squad... but not a contender like they were with Rose.

2009:
#1 - Clippers - Hasheem Thabeet
#2 - Grizzles - Blake Griffin
If this exercise has taught me anything, it's that things could have been much worse for the Clippers. In our scenario, we have the Clips ending up with Thabeet and Kwame Brown as top 2 draft picks. Fuck. Clips bball would still be dead today. Grizz would be nice, pairing Griffin with Marc Gasol and Mike Conley. that's a championship contending trio right there.

2010:
#1 - Wizards - Evan Turner
#2 - 76ers - John Wall
Process? fuck the process! Sixers wouldn't need to tank, as a team with John Wall, Jrue Holiday, and Andre Iguodala would be supremely athletic. That might not be a title nucleus, but they'd be a perennial playoff team for years. The Wizards... not so much. I mean, maybe Turner gets a chance to shine as the lone scoring option, but his inability to shoot would have hindered him wherever he ended up. Wiz would be screwed.

2011:
#1 - Cavs - Derrick Williams
#2 - Timberwolves - Kyrie Irving
Man Cavs really getting dicked here. No LeBron, and now no Kyrie. But hey, Derrick Williams! Crazy to think that these two guys went back-to-back; ones out of the league and ones a bonafide star. Minnesota has a Kyrie - Love tandem, which is funny. And Cleveland continues to be horrific, all the time. That Mo Williams - Derrick Williams - Darko trio would have been lit

2012: 
#1 - Hornets - Michael Kidd-Gilchrist
#2 - Bobcats - Anthony Davis
Hey! Bobcats score a stud! In our redraft, the Bobcats have gotten AD and Dwight in an 8 year span. Im retroactively ordering bobcats gear as we speak. The hornets get Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, which is who he currently plays for, but the Hornets are the Pelicans and the Bobcats are the Hornets so... yup.

2013:
#1 - Cavs - Victor Oladipo
#2 - Magic - Anthony Bennett
The Cavs finally get their superstar. Oladipo has proven to be the best player in the NBA this season and, possibly, the best player of all time. Can't believe the Magic eventually traded the GOAT for half a season of Serge Ibaka. For the Magic, this is sad, and also not happy. They get Bennett, who enjoys those Florida eats and balloons to 430lbs. Nothing magical about that.

2014:
#1 - Cavs - Jabari Parker
#2 - Bucks - Andrew Wiggins
Jabari has been great when he's healthy. He just hasn't been healthy. Are the Bucks dramatically better with Wiggins running next to Giannis? Maybe. I think he'd be dynamite as the second option there. A Wiggins/Middleton/Giannis wing trio is long as shit. For the Cavs, they now get Jabari to pair with Oladipo, which is a lot of athleticism and a lot of posters. 

2015:
#1 - Timberwolves - D'Angelo Russell
#2 - Lakers - Karl-Anthony Towns
Remember, in this scenario the Wolves have Kevin Love and Kyrie already. Russell would be pretty great as a combo guard next to Kyrie, but that backcourt defense would be a turnstyle. The Lakers get a year of KAT+Kobe, and then can begin to rebuild around an absolute stud. Not even Earvin himself could fuck that up

2016:
#1 - 76ers - Brandon Ingram
#2 - Lakers - Ben Simmons
Sixers fans, don't freak. You still have Embiid in this set-up. Ingram is not Simmons, but he's been pretty solid this year and could still turn into a stud. His scoring would look real nice on Philly. For the Lakers, Simmons + Towns is the best young core in the NBA. Durable and dominant.

2017:
76ers - Lonzo Ball
Lakers - Markelle Fultz
LaVar Ball is so fuckin pissed. But now the Sixers have a big baller to play next to Embiid. Is a Ball/Covington/Ingram/Saric/Embiid team a playoff contender? I think so. For the Lakers, maybe their organization doesn't rush a kid out onto the court who can't shoot without looking like your chubby friend at the rec. 

TL;DR - The league looks pretty different",nba,1094

Hello and welcome back!

Does a bad week sting any less when we see it coming? No? I didn’t think so. Defenses were predictably a disaster in Week 14, but predictions don’t score fantasy points unless you can act on them, and we had very few profitably actionable choices. It's a bit morbidly amusing that we can forecast the week to be bad, but we can't find our way out of the mess even still.

Versus consensus rankings, readers could have successfully sat Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, New England, or the Jets, who finished with a combined negative one fantasy points in MFL Standard. Unfortunately, our targets were the Cowboys (8 points), Bills (5 points), and Packers (7 points), which really is nothing to brag about, and would have caused big misses on Denver, Detroit, Kansas City, et al. Again, is it any consolation that consensus rankings missed those too? Maybe a little bit, but mostly not.

Rank correlation on the week was a dismal -0.197, suggesting that it would have been more productive to select your defense at random. FantasyPros ECR clocked in a bit worse with -0.205, so at least it was not just us!

So yeah, Week 14 sucked. Let’s hope things turn around in a hurry!

 **Week 15 D/ST Projections**

https://imgur.com/a/AUTbw

1	12.9	Jacksonville Jaguars

2	12.2	Baltimore Ravens 

3	12.0	New Orleans Saints

4	10.9	Philadelphia Eagles

5	10.0	Buffalo Bills

6	9.9	Minnesota Vikings

7	9.7	Detroit Lions

8	9.3	Washington

9	9.0	Carolina Panthers

10	8.6	Denver Broncos

11	8.3	Arizona Cardinals

12	8.2	Miami Dolphins

13	8.2	Los Angeles Chargers

14	8.1	Dallas Cowboys

15	7.9	Atlanta Falcons

16	7.9	Indianapolis Colts

17	7.7	San Francisco 49ers

18	7.7	Tennessee Titans


19	7.6	Seattle Seahawks


Jacksonville, Baltimore, and New Orleans are entirely locked in. If you have access to multiple from that group, just flip a coin. All three of them are as obvious of a D/ST play as you’ll ever get, so even if you choose the wrong one, you can rest easy knowing you didn’t make a mistake at kickoff. Save your overthinking and tinkering for the rest of your lineup if you're in this boat.

Philadelphia joins them in the top tier, but their case is a little trickier. With Carson Wentz they would probably be a slam dunk play as well, but instead we get merely “very good” – the game is on the road and the Giants have (surprisingly) avoided giving up the jackpot D/ST scores recently. Still though, they’re not good, and they have mostly allowed for a very high D/ST floor for their opponents. I would pivot away from the Eagles for one of the three teams mentioned first, but they make a solid start for anybody who was hoping to ride them through the playoffs.

The second tier is a lot more difficult to parse than the top tier. Buffalo and Miami are off the board right now, probably due to Tyrod, so I filled in the line as Buffalo -2, over/under 38. If the line differs significantly from that when it is finally hung, then adjust your expectations for both teams appropriately. Miami would jump into the second tier if Peterman starts, and Buffalo would drop down a few slots (but probably remain in the second tier anyway) in that case. I am hopeful that Tyrod will finally play.

Carolina rank as the last team in the second tier, but I suspect this will be the most volatile rank of them all for Week 15. The line currently sits at Carolina -3, and when combined with the Aaron Rodgers rumors, I think there’s a very decent chance we see him play. If so, I would yank Carolina from consideration entirely, but if not, they make a very good start. This projection here is a bit of a hedge: I fully expect it to move up or down significantly by the Saturday update this week, so make arrangements for a backup plan if you are risk averse.

Minnesota is my personal favorite on this tier. Good matchup, huge favorites, playing at home, and it’s projected to be a low-scoring environment. They check every box, and the only reason they are not a top tier option is because their YTD scoring has been a little bland. They haven’t scored 10+ points since their bye week, but this is as good a week as any for that to change.

NFC North rival Detroit also show up in the second tier once again. I have not been kind to the Lions D/ST throughout the column this season, and I think the pessimism has mostly been warranted. It’s hard to ignore a home game against the Bears though – despite pushing their opponent into the negatives in Week 15, the Bears have been a top D/ST matchup all year long. They are my second favorite play on the tier behind Minnesota (and of course, pending QB news in Carolina/Green Bay) .

The tier is rounded out with Washington. They have not been particularly good as a D/ST this season, and this game sees a scoring environment a little higher than I would normally like for a defense. However, the game will be played at home, and the Cardinals have been fairly generous to opposing D/STs. This game will have a low floor and a relatively high ceiling for Washington and it is one I would try to avoid if possible. I do not know if I would dip into the third tier instead, but if I did, the targets would be Denver, Miami (speculating on Tyrod v Peterman), and the Chargers.

All in all, the third tier feels right, in that it’s a bunch of options that make me groan when I think about starting any of them. As mentioned above, Denver is intriguing and so is Miami if things break right for them. The Chargers have been incredible, so they can be justified as a start on that basis, but the matchup is horrible and backers have probably made arrangements for this week a few weeks ago.

I think that will do it for Week 15 for now. I’ll be taking my final final exam as an undergraduate this afternoon (!), so I might need a few hours before fielding too many questions. But I tried to hit on all of the most interesting options above to make up for it, and will definitely pop in and out of the thread more often this week than I have lately. 

Best of luck!",fantasyfootball,1151

Going a little deeper than usual this week because the tiers are massive. Just a warning, the slate this week **does not** look conducive to a good D/ST week. With a low average projected score overall, massive tiers, lots of road teams... brace for impact.

* The Jaguars get a strong ranking here because they've just been so fucking good. Fire 'em up, even in a mediocre matchup. The Seahawks have been playing great lately, and Duane Brown has made a very marked impact on the offensive line. The rest of the line is trash though, so you can expect the Jaguars to fall into a few sacks by default, even if their ceiling is a little lower than it is against more mistake-prone QBs.

* The other top D/ST on the season, Baltimore, is going to put a lot of us in an awkward spot on Sunday. I clinched a playoff spot in my NarFFL league thanks in part to the Ravens, but will probably make arrangements to start either Dallas or Green Bay, or whatever else I can find off of waivers. I will not dip into the 3rd tier (the red cells on the chart above), but virtually anything in the 2nd tier looks like an upgrade to my own eyes. Indianapolis is the one I would probably pass on in favor of the Ravens, because Fuck The Colts.

* Dallas and Green Bay headline the streamers this week. Both are on the road. If this week were another episode of the McAdoo show, the Cowboys would be a lot more enticing. As it is, they're probably just decent. There's a good chance they sink a lot of playoff teams, but the matchup is too good to ignore. That said, the Giants have only been the 12th best matchup for opposing D/STs, and their cancerous coach is finally gone. This could be a real letdown game for Cowboys backers and I would much rather be on Green Bay here. Their matchup is better, their defense isn't that much better/worse, and I think their floor and ceiling are both higher.

* The Chargers are too good to ignore, and can probably be started with confidence even in a mediocre matchup. Just eat the loss if it happens.

* Buffalo/Indianapolis is off the board right now due to Tyrod's injury status. They can probably be started as a Tier 2 option regardless of the QB, but I don't want to be anywhere near this game if it's Nathan Peterman. See what I mean about this week's slate being terrible? That does mean the Colts are on the table as a possible streamer on the road, which is disgusting and disappointing. Stay tuned for updates throughout the week: I [usually post them to my Twitter feed by Saturday](https://twitter.com/dtlerch/status/937348558411517952). Tampa/Detroit is also off the board currently, so there is more volatility there than usual.

* If you have anything on this list at Pittsburgh or higher, I think you should feel good enough about your chances. Anything below Pittsburgh and you should be looking to make an improvement.

* The nature of the week otherwise is that the tier breaks are not very steep and there are a ton of choices that all kind of suck in their own ways. So to be honest, as long as you're choosing a D/ST that you're able to justify as a reasonable start, you're doing OK for yourself. Just remember: Home teams &gt; away teams, Favorites &gt; underdogs, Low-scoring environments &gt; High-scoring environments, and Good pass rushes &gt; Bad pass rushes. Easier said that done maybe, but there you go.

quickonthedrawl,2017-11-28 20:10:45+00:00,"Week 13 D/ST Scoring, 2017","Hello and welcome back!

I hope everybody’s Week 12 went well. This is the home stretch for those of us in a playoff hunt; I’m still in three leagues with a playoff spot up for grabs, and I’m sure most of us still reading here today are either still in the hunt, or looking for an edge to gain in Weeks 14/15/16. That will follow after the rankings.

Week 12 itself was fairly kind, and it marks the sixth week in a row where I would consider the results to be very much in line with the projections. Rank correlation for our model was 0.396, compared to FantasyPros ECR’s result of 0.412. It was the first week since Week 4 where our model was outperformed by ECR, and it was by a fairly slim margin at that.

The biggest culprit was the Cleveland Browns, which was by far the biggest miss of Week 12 (though perhaps not the most impactful miss). The most impactful miss was probably the San Diego Chargers, who kept up their recent run and the Cowboys’ recent struggle with a dominating performance on Thursday afternoon. Otherwise, the model (barely) correctly selected Baltimore over Pittsburgh – small consolation to those who didn’t have the option and went with the Steelers anyway – and also more accurately identified Washington as a streaming option.

Like nearly every week, there were some big hits, some big misses, and a lot of garbage in between. The machine grinds on another week.

17	8.0	Green Bay Packers

18	7.9	Denver Broncos

19	7.9	Detroit Lions


So many options this week!

1.	Jacksonville and Baltimore remain the cream of the crop for another week. Baltimore has gotten extraordinarily lucky with their schedule, facing a not-so-murderer’s row of backup QBs and garbage offenses. This week might be a little bit tougher, but they get the Lions at home, and Stafford has some injury worries of his own in Week 12. However, I am assuming that he will be fully good to go, and that the Ravens will be a start-worthy option regardless in Week 13. The Jaguars are also at home, and they get the Colts. Both starts are exceedingly obvious for anybody with access to one or the other, with the Jaguars getting the edge if you somehow have both available.
2.	San Diego gets a crack at the Browns at home, so of course they are obvious as well. I would start them in the same order presented above with regard to Jacksonville and Baltimore.
3.	The Steelers disappointed in Week 12, and although they get the Bengals on the road this week, it’s still a slam dunk tier 1 start. I would not overthink this one too much if I had access to the Steelers. The Bengals are still a bad offense, and they should come back down to earth a bit after a romp against Cleveland.
4.	The Rams, also on the road, are probably my least favorite of the ones discussed so far, but the Cardinals are an exploitable offense. This is the kind of game where you’d really wish your D/ST were playing at home, but so it goes. The Cardinals have been the 6th best matchup for opposing D/STs on the season, have conceded eight scores of 9+, and have never conceded fewer than 6 all season long.
5.	Among the top tier, that just leaves the Tennessee Titans. The same lowly titans that are in the bottom 3rd of fantasy D/STs, and the same Titans that gave up roughly 4 million points against the Texans in Week 4. This time, the Texans are running out the inimitable Tom Savage, who has quite possibly the worst resume among current NFL starting QBs. The Titans' defense is pretty bad, the Texans' offense might be worse, and the Titans come in as 1 TD favorites at home. Streamers probably cannot do better, but let’s see what other choices they may have just in case.
6.	The Chicago Bears are probably the best pivot if you don’t trust the Titans. The 49ers have not been as kind to opposing D/STs as you might think, entering the week as just the 13th best matchup for opposing D/STs before adjusting for strength of schedule. They have not officially named a starting QB as far as I am aware, but should finalize something within the next 24 hours or so. Either way, the Bears are probably a great streamer. They are the 10th highest scoring D/ST on the season so far, with six scores of 9+ and a nice stretch of 69 points in four consecutive weeks from 5-8. The game is at home, Vegas has the scoring total low and the Bears slightly favored. Not great, but certainly good enough. We do not have enough of a sample size of Beathard and Garoppolo to accurate parse the difference between them, so I would not recommend spending too much effort in trying.
7.	Philadelphia has been lights out on both sides of the ball lately, and they should probably be considered up near Jacksonville as being too good to let go. Get away from them this week if you can due to playing on the road (as road favorites in Seattle!), but not for anything extreme. They are an every week starter for most teams that have access to them, as needed.
8.	New Orleans was the other midseason darling, but they have not really kept up their pace. Losing their top two CBs for last week made things more difficult than they probably should have been otherwise, and if that changes in Week 13, they can be started with a little more excitement. Otherwise, the matchup is OK, they are playing in the Superdome, and they should probably be started in most 12-team leagues. I would not rush to the waiver wire to grab them though. So while ""Who Dat"" has turned more into ""Whoa, Don't"" as far as their D/ST has been concerned, but they still probably have enough talent to justify a look.
9.	Washington does not make the cut for the column, but they deserve a mention here. The Cowboys have been really bad, but this is yet another case where we must separate expectation from results. Were they expected to score 8 points per game over their last three? Should they have been? My own answers are no and no, and I don’t think it’s particularly close. Again, we can ground ourselves with Vegas, which sets their team total at approximately 21 points for Week 13. If you think that Vegas is wrong by multiple TDs, well, I don’t know what to tell you. They haven’t built grand palaces in the desert by being habitually wrong by those kinds of margins. I do not see the Washington football team as being matched up well enough to exploit the Cowboys' recent deficiencies, and this is a great chance to bet on Dallas to show some amount of regression toward a healthier scoring output.
10. Interesting that Dallas themselves rank high enough to consider for streamers. I don't have the fortitude to do so with my own money, but if your waiver wire is dire enough, it might be necessary. Certainly playing at home is a nice plus, and they could be a backup plan for anyone who swings and misses on claims for Tennessee or Chicago.
11. Kansas City might be on the wire in many leagues and should be looked at on the same level as Chicago, at the very least. Their recent offensive disasters have really done a number on their floor and expectations both, and they're playing on the road against a (gasp) capable NYJ offense. Plenty of red flags, but the model likes them even still.

That’s enough for Week 13. Let’s look at future weeks. The strategy is very simple:

•	If you have an every-week starter, which at this point is probably just Jacksonville, stop reading and don’t worry about pairing them with anything. The Jaguars get three consecutive home games and then an away tilt against the 49ers.

•	The Eagles have good enough matchups in Weeks 13, 15, and 16 and only require a pair for Week 14. The Ravens have good enough matchups in Weeks 13, 15, and 16 and only require a pair for Week 14. This means you should not pair them with each other, but both can be a strong main D/ST.

•	So can the Chargers, who have strong matchups in Weeks 13, maybe 14, and 16.

•	Add to that the Steelers, who have strong matchups in Weeks 13, 14, and 16 and only require a pair for Week 15.

**Week 14**

Packers (@ CLE)

Kansas City (v OAK)

Texans  (v SF)

Bills (v IND)

**Week 16**

Vikings (@ GB)

Patriots (v BUF)

Bears (v CLE)

Lions (@ CIN)

Panthers (v TB)

Washington (v DEN)

Cardinals (v NYG)

Basic strategery:

1.	Start with Week 14 and make sure you have that covered. As you can see, none of the options listed above double up in Weeks 14 and 15, so you’ll have to pair unless you have a strong multi-week option available also.
2.	Once you have Week 14 covered, cover Week 15. Forget Week 16 if you have to, or grab a 14/15 option that is usable in Week 16 in a pinch. Chicago is great for that. Minnesota is too. Panthers as well. Same with the Lions. There are a lot more 15/16 teams than there are 14/16 teams, so keep that in mind when choosing.
3.	And that’s literally it. The list above is not comprehensive, and I might have missed something obvious or sneaky. If you see an option that plays at home against a decent matchup, don’t worry if I didn’t list them. Feel confident that they’re probably a reasonable choice.

And with that, I think we can conclude Week 13’s preview. Yet again, it will be a busy week for me, and hopefully the last one for a long time. After 12 years off and on at two universities, two community colleges, and across three different states, I’m finally finishing up my last week of coursework. I'm excited to level up from math student to underemployed mathematician, but I have to get through these last few exams first.

As always, if you see users in the comments with questions you feel confident answering, please pay it forward and help out. Someone will hopefully have your own back covered when you need help as well.

Best of luck in Week 13! ",fantasyfootball,1316

Dronelisk,2017-11-22 10:43:54+00:00,Tutorial: How to set up a simple proxy server for $5 a month to bypass any internet throttling/censoring. [x-post from /r/kotakuinaction],"Greetings,

With the as of late moral panic over net neutrality, I thought it was time to share with you some tried and true tips from a foreigner living in china and how to access the entire internet at full speed under the Great Firewall.

###You will need:

* $5 a month for this example, prices may vary from provider to provider, but usually a $5 VPS grants you a monthly 1000GB of traffic.

* [Shadowsocks-R](https://github.com/shadowsocksrr/shadowsocksr-csharp/releases) proxy client

* [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/) SSH client

###STEP 1: Sign up for a VPS provider

For this example I use [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/). They provide $5 a month VPS at various locations, which should help you pick one that allows you to bypass any censoring/throttling.

Using the hostnames below, send a ping command to each server to check the latency to your location. Remember to turn off any existing VPN connections, because we want to check the latency between our ISP and the Vultr servers:

Location|Hostname
:--|:--
Tokyo, Japan|hnd-jp-ping.vultr.com
Singapore|sgp-ping.vultr.com
Silicon Valley, California|sjo-ca-us-ping.vultr.com
Los Angeles, California|lax-ca-us-ping.vultr.com
Seattle, Washington|wa-us-ping.vultr.com
Frankfurt, DE|fra-de-ping.vultr.com
Amsterdam, NL|ams-nl-ping.vultr.com
Paris, France|par-fr-ping.vultr.com
London, UK|lon-gb-ping.vultr.com
New York (NJ)|nj-us-ping.vultr.com
Chicago, Illinois|il-us-ping.vultr.com
Atlanta, Georgia|ga-us-ping.vultr.com
Miami, Florida|fl-us-ping.vultr.com
Dallas, Texas|tx-us-ping.vultr.com
Sydney, Australia|syd-au-ping.vultr.com

**Look at the packet loss and average ping time for each server and choose the best one, or choose a few of them.**

I am going try a Tokyo server (14% packet loss, 122ms average ping) and a Los Angeles server (1% packet loss, 179ms average ping).

To avoid confusion, I will just show the instructions for setting up 1 of the servers, although I am actually doing both at the same time.

The first step is to go to [Vultr and create an account](https://www.vultr.com/) if you don't already have one. You will need to fund your account with a minimum $5 deposit using PayPal or verify a valid credit card.

Once your account is funded/verified then you can deploy a new instance (VPS).

1. **Choose your location.** [Image](https://imgur.com/Oaozpdb.jpg)

2. **Choose the server type (OS). For this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu 14.04 x64.** [Image](https://imgur.com/aosJ0lc.jpg)

3. **Choose the server size** [image](https://imgur.com/Isu1FGB.jpg)

4. **Set a hostname if you want and press on deploy now** [Image](https://imgur.com/SNVMmpU.jpg)

Wait until your VPS is finished installing and the status changes to ""Running"". Then, click on the server to open the server details.

**We will need the IP address and password to log into our server by SSH.** [Image](https://imgur.com/j3i5tlH.jpg)

I am using Windows, so I have downloaded [Putty.](http://www.putty.org/)

If you are using Putty for Windows, enter the IP address of your Vultr server and press open to connect to it. Leave all of the settings as default. You can save the session so you don't need to enter the IP address next time, I saved the settings as ""Vultr Tokyo"".

[Image](https://imgur.com/0pK6Dgv.jpg)

Accept the security warning and then login as root and enter the password from the Vultr server management page.

Tip - To paste text from the clipboard using Putty, simply press the right mouse button once and whatever is in the clipboard will get pasted. When typing or pasting your password, you won't see anything on the screen. Just press enter after you have typed it or pasted it by single clicking the right mouse button.

###STEP 2: Installing shadowsocks

Now we are logged in, your screen should look like this.

[Image](https://imgur.com/P8vs1IX)

Update and upgrade the machine by entering the command below.

    sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade -y

Any time that you see highlighted text, enter it as a command. I will only show the screenshot for the first command, shown below.

[image](https://imgur.com/h8WTcv6.jpg)

After you enter the command, press enter to execute it.

When executing this first commend, you may get a message that says something like this:

""A new version of configuration file /etc/default/grub is available, but the version installed currently has been locally modified. What do you want to do about modified configuration file grub?""

You can just press enter to keep the default option of using the current one.

Now, let's install shadowsocks on the server. There are many different versions of shadowsocks and many different ways to install them. I am going to install ShadowsocksR (SSR) using an installation script from GitHub user teddysun.

Enter the following 3 commands to download the run the SSR installation script.

    wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teddysun/shadowsocks_install/master/shadowsocksR.sh

    chmod +x shadowsocksR.sh

    ./shadowsocksR.sh 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee shadowsocksR.log

Enter the parameters that you want to use for your server. Here is what I am using for this tutorial. You change these settings later if you want.

Password: testing, Port: 443 , cipher: chacha20 [IMAGE](https://imgur.com/nlTQAKt.jpg)

protocol: origin, obfs: http_simple_compatible [IMAGE](https://imgur.com/6nw4oZ0.jpg)

After you enter all of the settings, press any key to start the installation. It will take about 5 minutes.

The server is already running, you can download a shadowsocks client and try it now.

###STEP 3: Test your proxy server:

The original version is called Shadowsocks (SS). ShadowsocksR (SSR) is a newer version that supports obfuscation, which can make your shadowsocks traffic look more like regular https web traffic. This can prevent your speed from getting throttled by your network or ISP.

The server that we just made is compatible with both SS and SSR clients (if you chose the same parameters as me when creating your server).

All of the clients are a little bit different, but basically you need to enter the following settings (assuming you chose the same options as me).

Server - The IP address of your server
Port - 443
Password - whatever you specified
Encryption - chacha20
Protocol - origin (this option is only available for SSR clients)
Obfs - http_simple for obfuscation or plain for no obfuscation (this option is only available in SSR clients)

This is how my SSR client settings looks like:

[IMAGE](https://imgur.com/ojfrdxM.jpg)

**Using the SSR Windows client:**

Enable the proxy by choosing Mode --&gt; Global or Mode --&gt; PAC. Disable the proxy by choosing Mode --&gt; disable system proxy.

If you are using the original SS client:

Enable or disable the system proxy by toggling the option Enable system proxy. The mode (PAC or Global) has it's own setting under Mode --&gt; Global or Mode --&gt; PAC.

TIP - Make sure you remember to disable the system proxy before you exit the client or shut down your computer. Otherwise, you will find that you have no internet at all. To solve this problem, just open the shadowsocks client and disable the system proxy.",pcmasterrace,2380

quickonthedrawl,2017-11-21 20:39:26+00:00,"Week 12 D/ST Scoring, 2017","Hello and welcome back!

First, please excuse how late this entry is. I work hard to hit my own deadlines, and so I hate it when I am late. And I especially hate it when I have a relatively incomplete final product like I have right now! But so it goes in this busy world sometimes.

Week 11 was interesting. Overall, I think the results were very strong. The Chargers, Jaguars, and Ravens all followed through with their high rankings and produced week-winning scores. Detroit lagged behind but still put up a top 12 finish. The big disappointments from the top tier were Kansas City and Arizona with 6 and 2 points, respectively.

The biggest points of diversion from projection-to-results between FantasyPros ECR and the column last week were Philadelphia (I ranked 20th, ECR ranked 13th, finished 4th), New Orleans (I ranked 8th, ECR ranked 12th, finished 26th), and Houston (I ranked 4th, ECR ranked 11th, finished 15th) for the misses and Tampa Bay (I ranked 10th, ECR ranked 21st, finished 5th) and Denver (I ranked 11th, ECR ranked 5th, finished 17th). Whew that's a tough block of text to parse. For a more complete look, the overall rank correlation last week here was 0.393, compared to 0.382 for ECR. It's been a kind season overall.

As usual, I posted an updated set of rankings to Twitter last week after the Vegas lines had settled down. [here](https://twitter.com/dtlerch/status/931195672988209153). I will do the same this week, so stay tuned!

**Week 12**

First, the projections:

1	12.6	Baltimore Ravens 

2	12.2	Jacksonville Jaguars

3	11.4	Philadelphia Eagles

4	11.3	Kansas City Chiefs (vs Peterman)

5	11.0	Pittsburgh Steelers

6	10.7	Seattle Seahawks

7	10.4	Cincinnati Bengals

8	9.8	Carolina Panthers

9	9.6	Washington

10	9.3	Kansas City Chiefs (vs Taylor)

12	9.1	Atlanta Falcons

13	8.9	Tennessee Titans

14	8.8	Minnesota Vikings

15	8.6	Arizona Cardinals

16	8.1	Houston Texans

Bye weeks are done! Time to jettison the dead weight and grab some upside stashes, choice handcuffs, and D/ST pairings. Unfortunately I will not be able to revisit D/ST pairings this week as planned. Next week, I promise.

**Thoughts on Week 12**

* Kansas City is a great start regardless of who the Buffalo QB is (or how long the starter lasts), but they clearly gain more upside against Peterman than against Taylor. Keep an eye on practice reports and beat writers if deciding between them and something else, and perhaps just keep them on your roster until we have more news.

* Baltimore and Jacksonville are both a half step up on the alternatives in tier 1. If you have one of those two, don't overthink it, just start them. I would lean Baltimore over Jacksonville if you have both; they're playing at home, and they get Primetime  Road Texans as their opponent. Jacksonville for their part play on the road, but they get to come face-to-face with the curse that is the Texans hangover: [every team they've played this year has lost the following week's game](http://texanswire.usatoday.com/2017/11/21/teams-that-played-texans-have-lost-the-next-week-every-time-in-2017/). If this entirely nonsensical trend continues, the Cardinals are in for a tough game. More likely, they're in for a tough game because the Jaguars defense should probably murder them.

* The Eagles really showed up on Sunday night and proved me wrong. I did think they would roll the Cowboys over and blow them out, but I did not expect the defensive result that they came through with. Dallas didn't really miss Elliott, but Dak had (one of?) his worst game(s) as a pro QB and the Eagles feasted. They would have finished strongly even without the D/ST TD, and can probably be considered every-week starters going forward.

* Seattle really struggled without their injured players. Going into the game sans Sherman, Avril, Chancellor, and then losing Griffin early... it was ugly. They have a great matchup this week and then alternate good-and-bad going forward. Keep them on your roster but not if the price is too high.'

* The Chargers killed it on Sunday, but most of that was thanks to Peterman as their opponent. Do not look for them to repeat that feat in Week 12. Hold them for their game next week against the Browns if you'd like though, and in fact if your bench situation is friendly enough, most folks should look to do exactly that. They can then be kicked to the wire in Week 14 or held through Week 16 @ NYJ.

* Otherwise, if you have Week 12 questions, they can almost all be solved by looking at the projected rankings. I don't see any compelling reasons to adjust any specific team up/down out of the tier they currently reside in. ROS questions can be answered by looking at the Week 10 thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/7bezhj/week_10_dst_scoring_2017/) or waiting until next week.

Best of luck in Week 12! We're almost done. I'll try and keep up with questions in this thread, especially if/when I have to go hide from conversations on Thursday, but it might be difficult again otherwise. The best place to get a specific question answered by me is almost always [on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/dtlerch), though note the DM inbox does sometimes hide stuff from me if I don't follow you already.

 - Under **Years** I listed their first and their last year in baseball, so they may have missed time in between. Some guys missed a ton of (major league) time, mainly cuz they were languishing in the minor leagues.

 For NLB players I listed their first year in any organized Negro League, even if it was before 1920 (the first year of what is considered the first Negro Major League), but I listed their Primary Team by their primary Negro Major League team.

Welcome to the November project update for Fallout 4 : The Capital Wasteland. This month has been a very busy one for just about everyone active on the team. Recently we decided to Restart our main exterior world space because of size and scale issues. This was admittedly my fault and no one elses, There is some good coming from this though. Over the last week we have made more progress on the Main Capital Wasteland world space than we have over the past months. Some of this progress is shown below.

This month also saw us begin the switch of our dev tracking tools, plenty of teething problems to come while we all figure it out. While all this is going on SikSikSikki has begun working on a Website for the project. It will include a gallery page, a recruitment page and a page where you can learn about the current team members.

But we are not the only Project that has been making moves this month. Our friends over at Fallout : Cascadia have been hosting a Charity stream for Child's play Seattle over the course of the entire weekend. From time to time members of the Road to Liberty Team have taken over to give them a break.

We also have much more planned for the community in the coming months including a number of Trailers and game play videos.

To stay updated with the project Follow my self @NafNaf_95 or @RoadToLibertyFO on twitter or join our Discord here : https://discord.gg/ZKdVtua

quickonthedrawl,2017-11-14 16:38:30+00:00,"Week 11 D/ST Scoring, 2017","Hello and welcome back!

Week 10 was a little bit weird, a little bit expected, and as usual, involved a lot of randomness. If you haven't yet come to terms with fantasy football as a mixed game of skill and chance (very heavy on the chance element), well, then I'm not sure what game you've been playing all year! Rank correlation for the column was 0.396, compared to 0.279 for FantasyPros ECR. It has been a kind season overall so far.

Week 11 for me marks the home stretch. This is the final week of byes, so fantasy teams should start looking a little bit less like the walking wounded. It's still a violent sport though, so your mileage may vary. Most importantly, it means that the playoffs are on the horizon. Most leagues go from Weeks 13-16 or 14-16. Some do 15-16. Some people have told me that some fantasy leagues go into Week 17, but I'm pretty sure they're trolling. Either way, it's time to either lock up a playoff spot or play spoiler and crush some dreams. Both are noble goals.

In a bid to save time, I'm hoping this image will suffice instead of the usual chart:

https://imgur.com/a/9Ecxj

And in plain text:

1. Jacksonville Jaguars, 12.5 points (tier 1)
2. Baltimore Ravens, 10.4 (tier 1)
3. Detroit Lions, 10.3 (tier 1)
4. Kansas City Chiefs, 9.9 (tier 1.5)
5. Arizona Cardinals, 9.7 (tier 1.5)
6. New Orleans Saints, 9.5 (tier 1.5)
7. Pittsburgh Steelers, 9.3 (tier 1.5)
8. Los Angeles Chargers, 9.1 (tier 2)
9. Houston Texans, 8.9 (tier 2)
10. Denver Broncos, 8.3 (tier 3)
11. Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 8.3 (tier 3)
12. Seattle Seahawks, 8.2 (tier 3)
13. Green Bay Packers, 8.1 (tier 3)
14. Miami Dolphins, 8.1 (tier 3)
15. Minnesota Vikings, 8.1 (tier 3)
16. Cincinnati Bengals, 8.0 (tier 3)

On bye this week are San Francisco, Indianapolis, New York Jets, and Carolina. The first three are droppable in 100% of formats. The Panthers probably are not, and whether you hold on to them or not depends on your other options and your bench depth.

Please see [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/7bezhj/week_10_dst_scoring_2017/) for playoff pairing recommendations. Notably absent from the list were the LA Rams and the Philadelphia Eagles, and both make solid ROS options. The Eagles might be the best team in football, and the D/ST attached to that is almost always worth a start somewhere. The Rams can claim similarly, although their schedule might get a little tougher going forward.

**Thoughts on Week 11**

* The Broncos finally make an appearance in the startable ranks. Sad that playing the Bengals at home only expects 8.3 points. I do expect them to beat that projection, however that team is a wreck right now. As long as the QB is a liability, just like any strong defense, their D/ST will suffer - and I'm much less certain today than I was last month that the Denver Broncos are actually a strong defense. They probably are, but they have not played like it these past couple of weeks.

* The Texans project similarly, however they do open up the week as home underdogs. That means the Cardinals are road favorites. Both D/STs should have a chance to score well here, but it's definitely less likely that both score well than we get one good score and one landmine. Hope you choose correctly! I would probably lean toward Houston straight up and just start drinking a couple hours early.

* Please be encouraged to hold a second D/ST on your bench for matchups, but remember, it's still a valuable roster spot. Don't pass up a real stash or starter to game out a theorized half point of expectation. In fact, if you can't be sure that you're going to get yourself an extra 0.5-1.0 points or more by stashing your D/ST, you should probably just pass and take the RB or WR instead. I know, it's less fun to have a mid-tier D/ST starting, but really, the equity you're giving up is mostly psychological. Again, check the post last week for recommendations, and we'll probably revisit that after Week 11.

* The Seahawks have some injuries. It sucks. They'll be OK, but temper some expectations. Earl Thomas is probably more important than Richard Sherman, so as long as they get Thomas back, they're going to be a weekly D/ST starter. If not... yuck. Especially on the road. This week is a bad matchup but it's at home, so I'd fire them up across the board anyway.

* Speaking of injuries: Again, most injuries don't matter for D/ST scoring. Period. On the micro level, they're huge - but when aggregating so many players into one starting position, they don't matter. You're better off ignoring injury reports entirely vs relying on them extensively.

* The line I used for LA/Buffalo was LA Chargers -4. To me, being that the line is public and widely available and sitting at this number, it suggests Philip Rivers will clear protocol and start Sunday. If he does not, that sinks the Chargers a bit and raises the Bills a bit, perhaps into starting ranks themselves. We'll cross that bridge if/when we get there.

* Similarly, the line for Houston/Arizona is public, but not widely available. There's some uncertainty with the Cardinals' starter. I don't know that Gabbert is a huge step up/down from Stanton so not going to watch this one as carefully as the Chargers. But keep it in mind if you're considering one of these two teams. It's another reason to lean toward Houston though perhaps.

Sorry for the different format this week. The fantasy season can be a grind, and between 24 leagues and all the normal worldly commitments, this is the part of the season where things start to hit a wall. But here we go! Please continue to step up and answer other users' questions here in the comments, since I'm sure there is a ton that I left out up here and it'll be another busy week.

Thanks for reading, and best of luck in Week 11!",fantasyfootball,1848

quickonthedrawl,2017-11-07 18:08:01+00:00,"Week 10 D/ST Scoring, 2017","Hello and welcome back!

It's Week 10, which seems fucking ridiculous, doesn't it? The season has been really kind to me so far and I hope it has for you too. Week 9 was another high-scoring D/ST week and another in which rank correlation was high: 0.47 for both our model and the consensus rankings at FantasyPros. It's been a really sweet three-week stretch. Let's hope it continues.

The Bills were the big dud last week. They didn't play well, and they also got very unlucky. Bad combo. Don't beat yourself up too much over it, I think the process was fairly correct. The converse of this was the other big miss on the week was the Jets, who finished 16+ places higher than projected. Washington was the other big miss, beating their projected rank of 22nd and finishing tied for 9th.

The rest of the misses were fairly painless. In all, the average D/ST on MFL scored 8.0 points in Week 9. New Orleans in particular kept up their own torrid pace and have placed themselves squarely in contention for an every-week starter.

________


**Week 10 D/ST Scoring**

Rank | Team | Points | Tier | Notes
:--------: | :-------- | :--------: | :--------: | :--------
1 | Los Angeles Rams | 12.3 | 1 | 
2 | Detroit Lions | 11.5 | 1 | 
3 | Pittsburgh Steelers | 10.8 | 1 | 
4 | Jacksonville Jaguars | 10.7 | 1 |  
5 | Seattle Seahawks | 10.4 | 1 | 
6 | Carolina Panthers | 10.1 | 1.5 |  
7 | Tennessee Titans | 9.7 | 2 |  
8 | Chicago Bears | 9.5 | 2 | 
9 | Minnesota Vikings | 9.2 | 2 |  
10 | New Orleans Saints | 9.1 | 2.5 |  
11 | New York Jets | 9.0 | 2.5 |  
12 | Tampa Bay Buccaneers | 9.0 | 2.5 |  
13 | New England Patriots | 8.7 | 3 |  
14 | San Francisco 49ers | 8.6 | 3 | 
15 | New York Giants | 8.5 | 3 | 
16 | Buffalo Bills | 8.1 | 3.5 |  

Two weeks of byes left. For now: Baltimore, Kansas City, Oakland, Philadelphia. The Raiders can obviously be dropped in all formats. The other three can all be dropped/held depending on your situation I guess? I wouldn't want to pass up on a reasonable WR/RB for a second D/ST ever, but we'll talk playoff pairs later.


**Thoughts on Week 10**

Let's just look forward first. The best D/STs to target that might be off the wire in the next few weeks are:

**Week 11**

Steelers v Titans

Dolphins v Buccaneers

Ravens @ Packers

Saints v Washington

Broncos v Bengals

**Week 12**

Washington v NY Giants

Bengals v Browns

Panthers @ Jets

Steelers v Packers

Eagles v Bears

Falcons v Buccaneers

**Week 13**

Bears v 49ers

Steelers @ Bengals

Chargers v Browns

Saints v Panthers

Broncos @ Dolphins

Titans v Texans

**Week 14**

Texans v 49ers

Bills v Colts

Broncos v Jets

Steelers v Ravens

Bengals v Bears

Bears v Bengals

**Week 15**

Ravens @ Browns

Vikings v Bengals

Saints v Jets

Bills v Dolphins

Washington v Cardinals

**Week 16**

Ravens v Colts

Steelers @ Texans

Vikings @ Packers

Bears v Browns

Cardinals v NY Giants

Washington v Broncos

(I'm sure I missed a ton)

Whew. That's a start. That obviously exempts the true every-week starters like Jacksonville and Seattle. Judging by the above, I'd consider the most value D/STs to be:

Jacksonville, Seattle, Baltimore, and Pittsburgh. The Chiefs probably fit here too. The Vikings might. The Saints probably do. Each of them are good D/STs, have scored well YTD (especially in good matchups), and probably have enough upside to consider them a starter-quality choice in most weeks.

* Jacksonville - do not pair

* Seattle - do not pair, or target Ravens/Vikings/Washington

* Baltimore - do not pair, or target any of the Week 14 options

* Pittsburgh - target any of the Week 15 options

* Kansas City - do not pair

* Minnesota - target Steelers/Bears/Texans?

* New Orleans - target Steelers/Broncos

* Denver should probably be started in most leagues in most weeks. I just don't know that I'd want to be the one to do it. They can be ignored this week though but might make a good pairing with anything.

* Having a main D/ST (New Orleans, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, et al) and streaming your pair is also viable. Don't stress about it. Even a great choice vs a mediocre choice in a given week might only be worth 1-1.5 points of expectation. Not huge. Not enough to pass up on a strong RB/WR that could be worth easily 2-3x that much in a single week! So don't overdo it.

* Likewise, having 3+ D/STs is really never necessary. Really try and find a better plan.

* Wondering about an option I didn't mention? It's easy. Look at their schedule. Write down the weeks that make you go ""Ughhhh"" - then write down the teams that have good matchups during those weeks. Same as before - good defenses, home games, playing against worse teams, bad offenses, and/or rookie/backup QBs. See which options you have to cover for you and if any of them can cover multiple weeks.

That's it! Super easy.

Not a ton to say about Week 10 right now unfortunately otherwise. I'm going to have to defer to the projections this time, since I've spent that time I have today going over ROS and playoff options.

**Best of luck in Week 10!**

#Statewide Ballots (ME, NY)

New York will hold municipal elections across its various cities, including New York City, where incumbent Mayor Bill de Blasio is standing for reelection. In addition, the New York state Constitution mandates a statewide ballot measure this year asking whether to hold a state Constitutional Convention. 

Maine will be holding statewide elections for various ballot measures. In particular, there will be a ballot referendum on the issue of whether to accept the PPACA (Obamacare) Medicaid expansion. Previous bills by the state Legislature authorizing an expansion had been vetoed by Governor LePage. Additionally, a special election is being held in HD-56 of Maine's lower House. Democrats retain a narrow 77-72 majority in the state House (Republicans retain a narrow 18-17 majority in the state Senate). 

**NOTE:** Maine has same-day in-person registration. If you haven't registered yet and are interested in casting a ballot, follow the [instructions](http://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/voter-info/voterguide.html) on the registrar's website directing the appropriate proof required (A drivers license ID#, or the last 4 digits of your social security number). 

##Maine

It almost feels like we've gone through this all before, but Week 8 was a very strong week for D/STs once again. They averaged 10.0 points per game! The seven top tier options from last week scored an enormous 15.3 points per game, followed by
10.7 points per game from the second tier, and very few plays backfired for streamers.

The biggest misses were the Bears (projected 26th, finished 11th), New Orleans (projected 1st, finished 15th), and Miami (projected 12th, finished 24th). Overall rank correlation was 0.563, compared with 0.479 for FantasyPros' ECR. It has been a very kind season.

14 | Dallas Cowboys | 8.0 | 3.5 | v KC
15 | Carolina Panthers | 7.7 | 3.5 | v ATL
16 | Cincinnati Bengals | 7.2 | 4 |  @ JAX

We have one more very tough week of byes: Chicago, Cleveland, Minnesota, Pittsburgh, New England, and the Chargers are all off this week. Any of these can be dropped if needed, with Minnesota and Pittsburgh having value past their byes. Minnesota is on the road at Washington next week while Pittsburgh is at Indy. The Steelers might be worth stashing but as always, ties go to the RB/WR vs the D/ST on your bench.

**Thoughts on Week 9**

* Lots of strong plays this week for streamers and otherwise. New Orleans, Arizona, and SF (!) all should be available in some number in most leagues. I don’t know that I would trust the Niners myself, but I’ve also been proven wrong multiple times this year by being too pessimistic on highly-ranked options.


* KC showed last night that they still have the upside they were drafted for, maybe Denver will be next. They have a very bad matchup this weekend and again next weekend though. I’m glad I don’t have them on any of my own teams because this might be the time to get away from them if you do. It also wouldn’t surprise me if they finished the season within the top ~8 of D/STs. That’s just how the position works. I will say that Osweiler or Lynch is reason enough to drop them if it comes to it. I still feel OK with them as long as Siemian is under center.



* Aside from Dallas (probably safe to say they're a bad start this week), the rest of this list looks really good to my eyes. As always there is a lot of room to shuffle the options around among a same/similar tier. It simple isn't worth stressing over if you find yourself in that situation. Just flip a coin if you really can't decide, otherwise, my recommendation will almost always be to follow the rankings. Look at your options' matchups for next week as a final input/tiebreaker.


* Playoff pairings recommendations will start next week.


That’ll have to be it this week, sorry! Looking like it's going to be the busiest week of the semester so far.


I’ve been updating the projection model [on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/dtlerch) every week on Saturday evening or Sunday morning. It’s also the best place to reach me for questions throughout the week. It’s going to be another busy one for me; my apologies in advance for missing as many questions as I'm sure I will. After Thursday I might be a little more accessible if I miss a question and it's still unsettled.

If you see somebody struggling in the thread and feel like you know what you’re doing, help them out please.

2017's Week 6 is quite possibly the highest-scoring D/ST week in the last half-decade. It certainly makes the short list if not, and I'd be curious if anybody has a week they remember rivaling it! In MFL Standard scoring, every single D/ST scored 5 points or more, and the week's average was an astounding 11.4 points. For reference, going into the week, D/STs had averaged 8.3 points per game.

Overall, the projection model had a fairly average week, however compared to ECR things went very well. Tier 1 plays scored 22, 24, and 9 points (with Tier 1.5 adding in just 6 and 7 points). Tier 2 fared less well, but it was buoyed by New Orleans incredible 34 point game - 5 sacks, 3 interceptions, 2 fumbles recovered, and 3 (!) touchdowns. We will cover the Saints D/ST in a little more detail later.

The Broncos were the week's obvious disappointment. As I explained to people last week, the projection model can kind of break down on the extreme ends, and Denver was a slam dunk top play against the Giants at home. Unfortunately, sometimes double-digit favorites lose, and that's exactly what happened. Similarly, top streaming options Washington and Atlanta both fell flat.

In all, rank correlation for the projection model was a modest 0.19, compared to just 0.06 for FantasyPros ECR.

On bye this week are just Houston and Detroit. Both can be safely dropped in most/all formats.


**Thoughts on Week 7’s projections**

* Jacksonville is currently leading the league in sacks with 23, interceptions with 10, and they lag behind the lead in fumbles recovered by just 1. Perhaps more importantly, they lead the league in rushing attempts with over 33 per game. Bortles can't Bortle if he's handing off every other snap! This has been significantly mitigating his liability to the team, and it has allowed the Jaguars D/ST to really play above its preseason expectations. It's been incredible to watch. Expect regression (which is virtually always the case with the #1 D/ST through midseason), but they can be fired up without regret in all but one week going forward.

* New Orleans ranks #2. This feels high. But going into the bye, they had clocked in two strong performances with two 4-sack games, and they just throttled the Lions for 34. A word of caution: this game should not have scored that highly - the Saints were the beneficiaries of some really weird bounces, lucky plays, and some sweet, sweet touchdowns. However, this is now three straight games where the Saints have generated a sufficiently powerful pass rush, and they were just gifted with a backup QB in Week 7. Brett Hundley might be good. His weapons certainly are good. But all that said, the spread sits at New Orleans -6 and that suggests that the Packers offense can be exploited.

* The rest of the top tier should be pretty self explanatory. The Seahawks at home against the Giants, the Steelers at home against the Bengals, and the Rams at home against the Cardinals. Three home defenses, three decent defenses, and three terrible opposing offensive lines. Fire them up without regret if you have access. **Edit: as was pointed out, the Seahawks are away. The projection remains the same and this was a cosmetic error only. However, it does skew things slightly for the Seahawks D/ST, but not enough to worry. They're still a great start.**

* The other top tier choice is the Bills, and this one is a little volatile. Right now, there is no public line on the game due to Jameis Winston's uncertain status. I used Buffalo -3 with an over/under of 44 to set this projection. If that line is wrong, the projection will be wrong. [Check back on Twitter later in the week and I will update this (and every other) line to account for mid-week movement](https://twitter.com/dtlerch/status/919421549404356608), like I have the last few weeks.

* Two other games have no public line due to being involved in MNF. I used Jacksonville -3, over/under 38 and Tennessee -6.5 over/under 43 in IND/JAX and CLE/TEN, respectively. As above, check back on Twitter later in the week for updates if you end up on the fence with Tennessee. Jacksonville's line will not matter, they are a top tier play regardless. Speaking of Tennessee, they were a mixed bag against the Colts last night. They got gashed on the ground early and then stiffened up; they mostly kept big plays to a minimum. Game script was weird and I'm not sure we can read too much into the results.

* The Broncos and Chiefs are both still in the top 16, and both still have the same weekly upside that led you to take them way too early in your draft. This year has been a perfect example of why you should never draft a D/ST highly. You took them early, you can't drop them, they haven't been living up to expectations, but they're still projected well enough ROS that you're stuck. Awkward. Live and learn and invest less in your D/ST next year.

* ROS D/STs worth a look beyond the current week: Jacksonville, Denver, Kansas City, Seattle. Seattle and Denver are past their byes, which is sweet. Minnesota is close and might still be there. Baltimore can say the same. Pittsburgh might too. I'm ready to count Arizona out of consideration here until we see changes. The Rams are probably in the same boat too, but they've definitely got the better case. When in doubt, always favor the current week, then the following week, then mostly ignore everything past.

* We are still at least 2 weeks away from having D/ST pairing recommendations for playoff runs. I will not be looking at options until then since I hate encouraging folks to carry two D/STs before they really should be. Focus on bye weeks and RB/WR stashes in the interim, and if you really want to carry a second D/ST, you'll be on your own. Use the same tools as I use here to figure out the best starts - home teams with great defenses, home teams with great matchups, away teams with great defenses, away teams with great matchups, in approximately that order. Easy right? If your team doesn't have a great defense or a great matchup, you should not be stashing them now. Period.

Another week, another week where I have an exam on Tuesday afternoon. I'll be mostly absent from the discussion until later in the day but will do my best to catch up later. Anybody who feels like that have a strong grasp on D/ST scoring should feel encouraged to chime in with their thoughts and help answer questions.

jms2906,2017-10-13 17:15:02+00:00,"Talk over my gf, enjoy the spoiler","I moved to Madrid in March but used to live in Seattle. I went back with my gf over the summer to visit the old stomping grounds. She and I went to college at UW together and had a lot of mutual friends in the area.

We were all meeting up with people at a bar that we used to go to a lot, and a friend of a friend, who we'll call Woman Hater (WH for short), wanted to tag along. I always thought WH was kind of a dick, but he was good at banter and generally fun company at bars, so I said sure. My gf, on the other hand, was not pleased. Before we went to meet up she pointed out to me that WH was really disrespectful to women and turned everything into a boys club. I had never really noticed myself but it was definitely within the realm of possibility. WH had never had a girlfriend, had no female friends and made a lot of ""barefoot in the kitchen"" type comments. I apologized and told her that I already said he could come, so we just went along with it and decided to make the best of the situation.

...Also, an important part of the setup is that WH is a HUGE Game of Thrones fan.

We get there, and WH shows up a bit later. We're a big group of all guys except my gf. There's a lot of broey banter, dick and fart jokes, general immaturity going around the table, but it's a great time and we're all catching up. As the conversation goes on, though, I start to notice that every time my gf tries to say anything, WH interrupts her or cuts her off. He's also making a lot of misogynistic comments and jokes, and my gf is getting visibly upset. I haven't seen my friends in 6 months so I'm trying to let things go so everyone can have a nice time, but I'm getting a bit annoyed too.

So I let the first few times slide, but it's starting to be a problem and some of my other friends are starting to notice too, so I politely call him out. I'm not great at confrontation and at this point my heart is racing. He throws crazy shade at me and my gf but begrudgingly apologizes and we all kind of shrug it off. Things got a bit tense for a minute after, though.

To my relief, someone else breaks the ice and we move on. We start talking about tv shows, get to Game of Thrones - and WH gets really excited. He was behind on the newest season at the time so we all try to avoid spoilers. But then it happens again: my gf starts to talk (she and I are also huge GoT fans) and WH cuts her off, almost deliberately, and gives me this look like ""yeah, fuck you, I did just do that again"". I've had enough. I've also had a few more drinks and the liquid courage is coursing through my veins. I decide it's time to stoop to his level, so while WH is in mid-sentence I interrupt him and start listing as many spoilers as I can remember.

Things get *really* awkward after I do this. After a 5 second silence and a very dirty look, WH just goes ""what the fuck man"", gets up, and leaves the bar. Some of my other friends are also like ""dude wtf that was mean"". Even my gf is giving me a look like ""damn dude that was pretty low"". We explain to the rest of the table that WH is a dick to women and it starts to look like it's finally dawned on them. They then all start bringing up other times WH had been disrespectful to women. 

We saw WH one more time at a party that summer. We locked eyes for a second, he kind of frowned at us and left the room. I probably won't be seeing him next time I'm in town.

quickonthedrawl,2017-10-10 15:27:27+00:00,"Week 6 D/ST Scoring, 2017","Hello and welcome back!

Week 5 was a very interesting one. For a week in which numerous cellar dwellers populated the D/ST projection rankings, the results were actually quite passable. [After accounting for line movements throughout the week](https://twitter.com/dtlerch/status/917052486858498048), the Colts, Jets, 49ers, and Browns all ended up with start-worthy projections. They finished with 3, 11, 7, and 9 points, respectively.

Top tier choices were a little less forgiving. Pittsburgh got trounced, though with the exception of a single 90 yard run by Leonard Fournette, they actually played pretty well. The Chiefs gave up 34 points, 21 of which was in the 4Q with an untouchable lead. The Bills and Eagles played well defensively but didn't pad their D/ST stats enough to satisfy. The Ravens solved that problem by piling on a D/ST TD. The only truly disappointing play at the top was the Detroit Lions, which we will cover in more depth later.

But first:

* What is a projection?

* What is a prediction?

Roughly once per year it becomes clear that the fantasy community treats two words as the exact same thing, when in reality they mean two very different things. My apologies if we end up in the weeds.

Think of a D/ST score as a random variable. In this case, let's use a 12-sided die (a D12). Our sample space consists of the 12 discrete numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12. The probability of each roll is simply 1/12. The outcomes are uniformly distributed, so it makes things super easy: if a roll of a D12 models our D/ST's score, then:

1. We're in trouble, and

2. Our expectation is 6.5 points.

We **expect** 6.5 points, but your **guess** (read: prediction) is as good as mine, or your cat's, or another D12. If you predict them to get 12 points, you will be wrong with probability 11/12. If you predict them to get 9+ points, you will be wrong with probability 2/3. This should all be fairly obvious.

D/ST scores, thankfully, aren't uniformly distributed. They’re also not normally distributed, but I don’t think that distinction matters for now.

What *does* matter is the distinction between a projection and a prediction. You can *project* a team to score X points, and you can *predict* a team to beat their projection for a variety of reasons. But when you make predictions like that, you will have to reckon with being wrong far more often than being right. Relying on predictions is a recipe for disappointment over the long term. Relying on projections is not.

And of course, not all projections are created equally. My D/ST model has had a number of successful years, and after two weeks of 2017, we appeared headed for another. In the three weeks since, it has been more of a struggle, but thankfully (I guess?) the struggle has been virtually universal. Both the column's rankings and FantasyPros rankings clocked in with a rank correlation of 0.15 in Week 5.

With yet another week of data available and 2016 entirely purged from the sample, let's see what we can expect going forward.

16 | Indianapolis Colts | 7.4 | 3.5 |  @ TEN

On bye this week are Seattle, Cincinnati, Dallas, and Buffalo. Seattle is worth holding. The rest are probably not.


**Thoughts on Week 6’s projections**

1. The Jacksonville Jaguars defense is very good (not all that surprising), but their offense has been limiting its mistakes. The fewer times Blake Bortles throws, the better their D/ST will be, and Bortles has averaged just 27 attempts per game so far. This is excellent news, and it is enough to officially bump the D/ST up out of the streaming ranks if you had not already. As discussed the last couple of weeks, they have been on the cusp: clearly good enough at home and in good matchups, and sketchy on the road or in bad matchups. With a strong road showing against the Steelers (who, as it turns out, might just be bad), they deserve the benefit of our doubt. And for fun, courtesy of [Scott Barrett at PFF: opponents have been better off spiking the ball instead of targeting Ramsey and Bouye](https://twitter.com/ScottBarrettDFB/status/917205037956292608).

2. There are not many other D/STs that can claim to transcend streaming. The short list is Denver, Kansas City, Seattle, and the aforementioned Jacksonville. Denver is now past their bye, and Seattle will be next week; that is huge. As we saw in Week 5, even in mediocre matchups, these are the types of D/STs that have enough weekly upside to justify a start in every single week. I know the projection model may not agree, and in those cases, ignore it.

3. That leaves a ton of defenses that look good when they're at home, bad when they're on the road, and end up being very matchup dependent. Baltimore, Arizona, Minnesota, Houston, Detroit, Philadelphia, Buffalo, et al. In deeper leagues, these can be clung to a little more tightly. In shallower leagues (8- or 10-team), they can be dropped and streamed as needed. In a 12-team league you'll have to use your intuition and figure out when it's worth dropping them. A very loose rule of thumb: If you can drop them and expect &gt; 1 point of added value in the current week, go ahead. If you're dropping them to gain &lt; 0.5 point of added value, hold them. If it's anything in between, the decision is probably pretty marginal to begin with, so don't stress about it too much.

4. If you have a defense that's not listed above: congratulations, you're streaming. You probably already knew this. Just play the matchups every week, do your best to pick something good, and hold on for the ride. You'll make some ""mistakes"" - in quotes because, if you use a solid process to choose the best option, you can't be making a mistake. It doesn't matter how much they score.

5. This week should present a bit less variance compared to the last 2-3, given that so many more good D/STs are at home right now. In Weeks 3 and 4, the best options tended to be on the road. In Week 5, we saw the rise of the cellar dwellers and some of the top options face unpopular matchups. In Week 6, we have a goldmine of good D/STs at home against bad offenses. Baltimore, Jacksonville, Houston, Washington, Denver, Atlanta, and Tennessee are ranked one-through-seven and all are at home.

6. On Detroit: they faced a confluence of events on Sunday. Mostly, I still don't think that they're *that* good. They are a solid defense, they have a couple of stud players, but they are certainly not as good as Denver or Kansas City. Without a consistent strong pass rush, they will continue to rely on turnovers to generate D/ST scoring. Turnovers are notoriously inconsistent, notoriously unreliable, and put Lions D/ST backers in a bad spot going forward. They will not have the upside in bad matchups to justify, nor will they have enough upside in the good matchups to hold through the bad ones. I considered Week 5 a freeroll: backers lost, and so it's probably time to move on until after the bye week. Weeks 10-14 have enough value to keep them in your peripheral vision, but not enough (IMO) to hold between now and then. There is a nonzero chance that the Lions are still good enough going forward, and that Carolina is just a bad matchup now; I respect that possibility, but I would bet against it. If anything, the Panthers are good and the Lions are mediocre-but-above-average, and I would hesitate to move too far off the latter assumption.

7. The average D/ST in Week 5 scored 9.1 MFL points, which is a full point per game more than they had averaged in Weeks 1-5. Take the gifts where you can, but unfortunately, a rising tide lifts your opponents' boats too. But, while the variance in the week was higher than normal, the results were satisfactory for most folks.

8. Streamers should look at Washington, Atlanta, and Tennessee, in approximately that order. With so many home teams projecting highly in Week 6, there is a wealth of options for streamers.

9. A lot of people ask every week about which defenses pair well with each other ROS. I try not to answer that this early, because I do not like to encourage bad strategy. In most normal leagues (probably 95% of readers or more), carrying two D/STs right now is a mistake, with the notable exception of a stud D/ST on bye. Teams have bye week woes, injury woes, bad team woes, woe is me woes, etc. Use those bench spots for RBs and WRs even if your starting lineup looks stacked. Getting next week's hot wire add the week before for free is a much better strategy than eking out an extra tenth of a point of expectation per week by carrying two D/STs. Once we get closer to the end of the season, we can discuss D/ST pairs in depth.

I've got an exam to attend to early today, and then I'll do my best to clear up as many good questions as I can find afterward. Thank you all for your time, and for reading every week.

#Introduction


On October 6th, 2007, the Stanford Cardinal entered its fifth game of the season against the USC Trojans with a 1-3 record. Few people gave the Cardinal any chance against the #1 team in the country (#1 in Coaches Poll, #2 in AP Poll). They were coming off a dismal 1-11 season. In their 3 games against (ranked) Pac-10 teams so far that season they had been outscored 141-51. They had a first-year head coach. And as if the odds weren't already stack against them enough, the Sunday before the game their starting QB, TC Ostrander, suffered a seizure and would be unavailable to play; so sophomore QB Tavita Pritchard would make his first collegiate start...on the road...in the Los Angeles Coliseum...against the #1 USC Trojans. 

**Vegas pegged Stanford as a 41-point underdog.** But every dog has its day. And that day – October 6th, 2007 – belonged to the Stanford Cardinal.

#The Key Characters

Looking back on this game, you'll recognize a lot of familiar faces. Here are just a few of the key characters from that game:

**USC**

* **Pete Carroll** - USC's Head Football Coach. Entering the 2007 season (his seventh as HC), Carroll had led the Trojans to five Pac-10 titles, two national titles (2003 AP, 2004 AP/Coaches/BCS), and a national title game appearance (2005). Carroll would leave USC after the 2009 season and become the head coach of the Seattle Seahawks, eventually leading them to two Super Bowl appearances and a Super Bowl title. Carroll is now in his 8th season as head coach of the Seattle Seahawks.

* **Steve Sarkisian** - USC's Offensive Coordinator and Quarterbacks Coach. This was Sarkisian's sixth season with USC (and Pete Carroll). Sarkisian would later become the head coach of the Washington Huskies in 2009 and then return to USC as head coach in 2014. He was fired from USC midway through the 2015 season. He took over offensive coordinator duties for Alabama in the 2017 National Championship Game (which they lost to Clemson) after serving as an offensive analyst throughout the season. He is currently the Offensive Coordinator for Atlanta Falcons.

* **Todd McNair** - USC's Runningbacks Coach. This was McNair's fourth season with USC. The NCAA would later target McNair as part of its probe into the [Reggie Bush scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California_athletics_scandal). McNair has since sued the NCAA and the case is ongoing.

* **John David Booty** - Starting QB. Booty broke his finger sometime during the game (second quarter?) but remained in the game. He threw four interceptions including a pick six, one that set up Stanford's game-winning drive, and one that sealed Stanford's victory.

* **Mark Sanchez** - Backup QB. He was sitting on the sidelines while Booty was throwing interceptions with a broken finger. Sanchez would start the next three games while Booty was out with a broken finger. The following season, Sanchez led the Trojans to their sixth straight Pac-12 title and a Rose Bowl win against Penn State. Sanchez would be drafted 5th overall by the New York Jets in the 2009 NFL Draft. The ""Sanchize"" led the Jets to two AFC Championship Games. Since his 5-year stint with the Jets he has become a NFL journeyman, playing for the Eagles,  Broncos, Cowboys, and Bears.

* **USC's NFL Linebacking Corps** - USC's linebacking corps in this game featured future 1st/2nd round draft picks Clay Matthews, Rey Maualuga, Keith Rivers, and Brian Cushing.

**Stanford**

* **Jim Harbaugh** - Head Football Coach. Harbaugh completely changed the culture surrounding Stanford football and resurrected the program from the ashes of a 1-11 season. This game would be the marquee win of the Harbaugh era, leading to a huge improvement in winning recruiting battles...and, more importantly, football games. After the 2010 season (in which Stanford finished 12-1 and won the Orange Bowl), Harbaugh left to become the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers. Today, Harbaugh is the head coach of the Michigan Wolverines (because Jed York is an idiot).

* **David Shaw** - Offense Coordinator. Shaw would later succeed Harbaugh as head coach when he left after the 2010 season to become the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers.

* **TC Ostrander** - Starting QB. On Sunday, September 30th, 2007, [Ostrander suffered a seizure while out to lunch in Palo Alto with his family and WR Evan Moore's family](http://www.mercurynews.com/2007/10/02/ostrander-sidelined-for-week-after-seizure/). Due to the seizure, Ostrander would not play in the game against USC.

* **Tavita Pritchard** - Backup QB. After Ostrander's seizure, Pritchard took over the reigns at QB. He made his first collegiate start against USC...not a bad first start. Today, he is the Kevin M. Hogan Quarterbacks Coach at Stanford (yes...we endowed the title of our Quarterbacks Coach).

* **Richard Sherman** - WR. Sherman was a WR at Stanford his first three seasons (2006-2008) before transitioning to cornerback before the 2009 season. Sherman converted a 4th and 20 on the game-winning drive with a catch that went for ~20.2 yards and set Stanford up with a 1st and goal with a little over a minute left in the game. Sherman would later be drafted by Pete Carroll and the Seahawks in the 5th round of the 2010 NFL Draft. Sherman would eventually become one of the top CBs in the NFL and (at one point) was the highest paid CB.

* **Mark Bradford** - WR. Bradford did not practice with the football team for much of the week as he was in Los Angeles with his family following the death of his father. In a ""this is so unbelievable I would reject this movie script"" moment, Bradford caught the last-minute, game-winning touchdown in his hometown to defeat the #1 team in the country. [Bradford dedicated the game to his late father, Mark Sr.](http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2007/10/07/bradford-dedicates-game-to-late-father/)

#The Game

The first half saw USC put up only 9 points, while Stanford's offense put up none. But it was Stanford's defense that really kept them in the game (they recorded 5 turnovers). A goal-line stop at the end of the first half on 4th and goal from the 1 was the big momentum turn. Three minutes into the second half Austin Yancey intercepted one of Booty's passes and returned it for a TD, cutting USC's lead to 2. USC and Stanford then traded TD drives at the end of the 3rd quarter/beginning of the fourth quarter to bring the score to 16-14. With 11 minutes left, a 46-yard TD pass from Booty to Ronald Johnson put USC up 23-14.

With 5:43 left in the game, Stanford kicker Derek Belch cut USC's lead to 6. With three minutes left, Booty overthrew his receiver and the ball landed in the waiting hands of Wopamo Osaisai. Tavita Pritchard then marched Stanford down the field for the game-winning TD pass to Mark Bradford. Another Booty interception thrown to Bo McNally sealed the victory for the Cardinal.

**Key Plays**

* **USC's Blocked PAT** - The 1-point difference in the final score was due to a PAT that Stanford blocked midway through the second quarter that kept the USC lead to only 9-0. 

* **[Stanford's Goal Line Stand (start at 39:29 mark of video)](https://youtu.be/zjvNzj7TobM?t=2369)** -  With only a couple of minutes remaining in the first half, USC had a first and goal at Stanford 9-yard line, leading 9-0. USC ran the ball on second, third, and fourth downs but was unable to punch it in. The biggest moment came when Stanford stopped USC on a 4th and goal from the 1-yard line with 11 seconds left in the first half.

* **[Austin Yancy's Pick Six (start at 39:41 mark of video)](https://youtu.be/zjvNzj7TobM?t=2381)** - Three minutes into the second half, John David Booty threw the first of his four interceptions to Austin Yancy, who returned the ball 31 yards for the TD.

* **[John David Booty's Third Interception (start at 40:20 mark of video)](https://youtu.be/zjvNzj7TobM?t=2420)** - With three minutes left in the game, John David Booty throws his third interception of the game to Wopamo Osaisai, who returns it to the USC 45-yard line, setting up Stanford's game-winning TD drive.

* **[Richard Sherman's 4th and 20 Conversion (start at 7:57 mark of video)](https://youtu.be/zjvNzj7TobM?t=477)** - With 1:39 left on the clock, on 4th and 20 from the USC 29-yard line, Tavita Pritchard throws a pass directly over the middle to Richard Sherman, who completes an amazing 20-yard catch that makes it just inches across the line to gain.

* **[Mark Bradford's 4th and Goal Game-Winning TD Catch (start at 18:35 mark of video)](https://youtu.be/zjvNzj7TobM?t=1115)** - With 0:49 left on the clock, on 4th and goal from the USC 10-yard line, Tavita Pritchard lobs a fade to the left corner of the end zone (the exact same play that was run on third down to Evan Moore). Mark Bradford pulls it in, toe taps, and scores the game-winning TD. The excited Versus announcer is so surprised he screams ""Touchdown USC!""

**[The Game-Winning Drive (first 22 minutes of video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvNzj7TobM)**

Booty throws an interception that Stanford returns to the USC 45. Tavita Pritchard then marches Stanford down the field (enduring a handful of penalties and incomplete passes). Richard Sherman and Mark Bradford make two of the most icon catches in Stanford Football history. Plus, lots of peak Harbaugh.

I strongly recommend you [watch the video of the final drive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvNzj7TobM) (it's the first 22 minutes).

#The Aftermath

**Immediate Aftermath**

How unexpected was this result? [Well, it was so surprising that a number of Stanford students held an impromptu bonfire in the Main Quad, right in front of Memorial Church.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZppBPlvyiIo) [Here is the cover of the Stanford Daily the Monday after the game.](https://imgur.com/a/POySM) [Stanford Athletics also made this t-shirt.](https://imgur.com/a/E24NP)

This was another in a series of unexpected results during the wild 2007 college football season. College football fans around the country rejoiced when they heard the news of yet another shocking upset. Per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Stanford_vs._USC_football_game#Aftermath):
&gt;The final score was announced at the Rose Bowl, where USC's two arch-rivals, UCLA and Notre Dame, were playing each other. Irish and Bruins fans cheered in unison and celebrated together briefly. At the same time, at Tiger Stadium, the #1 LSU Tigers were playing the #9 Florida Gators and the fans in the stadium celebrated when the USC score was announced there, too. The Tigers would later come from behind to beat the Gators 28–24, making them #1 in both polls with USC dropping from #1 in the coaches poll due to the loss.

USC finished the season with a Pac-10 title (shared with Arizona State) and won the 2008 Rose Bowl against an overmatched Illinois team, but this loss ultimately knocked USC out of the national title game. This shocking upset paved the way for LSU to get into the 2008 National Championship Game and beat Ohio State 38-24, becoming the only 2-loss national champion of the BCS/CFP era.

**Long-term Aftermath**

If there is one game to point to and say this is when the Stanford Football Renaissance began, this is **THAT** game. The incredible upset validated Harbaugh’s boastful claim that ”We bow to no man. We bow to no program here at Stanford University.” If not for this victory, Harbaugh may not have been able to recruit the players (e.g. Andrew Luck, David DeCastro, Coby Fleener, Zach Ertz) that would become the foundation of the unprecedented success of the last decade of Stanford football. Needless to say, we hold this game very dear to our hearts.

Here is a comparison of Stanford Football in the decade before October 6th, 2007 and the decade since:

Stat | Decade Before | Decade Since
:-: | :-: | :-:
Record | 43-69 (0.384) | 95-37 (0.720)
Record against USC | 3-7 (0.300) | 8-4 (0.666)
Record against Rivals (USC, Cal, ND) | 10-19 (0.345) | 22-10 (0.688)
Conference Record | 30-52 (0.366) | 65-25 (0.722)
10+ Win Seasons | 0 | 6
Conference Titles | 1 | 3
Bowls | 2 (0 wins) | 8 (5 wins)
Major (BCS/NY6) Bowls | 1 (0 wins) | 5 (3 wins)
Rose Bowls | 1 (0 wins) | 3 (2 wins)
Heisman Finalists | 0 | 4 (4 runners-up :/)

This game also revived the USC-Stanford rivalry (which dates back to 1905), which had become very...lopsided in recent years. Since 2007, USC-Stanford has become must-watch television, producing instant classics like 2010 (Stanford defeats USC on a walk-off FG), 2011 (Stanford defeats USC in 3OT), 2012 (Stanford defeats #2 USC 21-14), 2013 (USC defeats Stanford on last-minute FG). Stanford has always hated USC, but in the last decade Stanford has (finally) given USC a reason to hate Stanford, posting an 8-4 record against the Trojans.

#A New Record

For almost ten years, Stanford overcoming a 41-point spread stood as the largest upset in college football history. However, in week 1 of this season, [the FCS Howard Bison (led by Cam Newton's younger brother, Caylin) defeated the UNLV rebels 43-40](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dc-sports-bog/wp/2017/09/03/howard-and-caylin-newton-stun-unlv-in-one-of-the-biggest-upsets-in-college-football-history/?utm_term=.962588571655), overcoming a 45-point spread and taking over the record for the largest upset (by point spread) in college football history. 

Now, Stanford's 2007 upset of USC stands as the largest upset *between two FBS teams*.

quickonthedrawl,2017-10-03 14:58:44+00:00,"Week 5 D/ST Scoring, 2017","Hello and welcome back!

Week 4 was a return to normalcy in the NFL, in that it was still extremely random but with some semblance of order. And to drive home that randomness, again we saw a number of Vegas underdogs win outright: Carolina, Los Angeles, Detroit, Houston, Buffalo, New York, and Philadelphia all won their games. It’s actually somewhat remarkable that D/STs did as well as they did in that context, coming through with results that are mostly par for the course. Rank correlation for the Week 4 rankings was 0.27 and lagged behind FantasyPros ECR’s 0.37.

Top tier plays in particular paid off. The Cowboys were terrible (or the Rams were good?), but Arizona, Jacksonville, Cincinnati, Seattle, and Kansas City all paid dividends. The tier as a whole averaged 11 points, even considering the negative Cowboys score. The second tier was full of landmines however. The Ravens disappointed *again*, the Titans conceded the most points in Houston Texans team history, and both New England and Tampa Bay fell way short as well.

Which of these are fit for another try, and which of them are steaming hot garbage? Let’s first look at the Week 5 projections.

________


**Week 5 D/ST Scoring**

Rank | Team | Points | Tier | Notes
:--------: | :-------- | :--------: | :--------: | :--------
1 | Pittsburgh Steelers | 10.4 | 1 |  v JAX
2 | Buffalo Bills | 10.3 | 1 |  @ CIN
3 | Philadelphia Eagles | 10.1 | 1 |  v ARI
4 | Detroit Lions | 10.0 | 1 |  v CAR
5 | Baltimore Ravens | 9.8 | 2 |  @ OAK
6 | Kansas City Chiefs | 9.8 | 2 |  @ HOU
7 | Cleveland Browns | 9.6 | 2 | v NYJ
8 | Tennessee Titans | 9.3 | 2 |  @ MIA
9 | New York Jets | 8.8 | 3 |  @ CLE
10 | Indianapolis Colts | 8.7 | 3 |  v SF
11 | Cincinnati Bengals | 8.6 | 3 |  v BUF
12 | Houston Texans | 8.3 | 3.5 |  v KC
13 | San Francisco 49ers | 8.2 | 3.5 |  @ IND
14 | Minnesota Vikings | 8.1 | 3.5 |  @ CHI
15 | Oakland Raiders | 8.1 | 3.5 |  v BAL
16 | Los Angeles Rams | 7.8 | 4 |  v SEA

On bye this week are the Saints, Falcons, Broncos, and Washington. The Broncos should be kept in virtually all formats despite being just the 15th highest-scoring D/ST to start the season. They are too good to drop and have upside in basically every week. The other three can be dropped easily.

**Thoughts on Week 5’s projections**

What. The. Fuck. Is. Going. On?

Just going down the list: The Bills? Browns? Jets? Colts? 49ers? These are not good teams. These are not good defenses, at least as we conceptualized them going into the season. Nor do I think they are particularly good defenses today, but they do have something important: They have good matchups. And for their own part, the Bills might actually be a good team (slim chance, but I’m saying there’s a chance). How do we even begin parsing all of this?

•	The Steelers are a clear top tier play, and there is no doubt about this. In choosing Baltimore over Pittsburgh last week (for both the week and going forward), I may have backed the wrong horse. I don’t think they have done enough to jump out of the streaming pool, but they have done more than enough to play at home against the Jaguars. To be fair, the Jaguars have played very, very well so far offensively. They have only conceded 3 sacks so far in 2017, best in the league (I know, right?). Bortles has thrown fewer interceptions than games played (I fucking know, *right?*). Still though, the Steelers are 8.5 point favorites at home and the game has a Vegas total of just 44. Fire up the Steelers with confidence.

•	Let’s talk briefly about that Jaguars defense then. They were bailed out last week by a D/ST TD in what should have been a great matchup. Their rushing defense is a complete liability right now, but they have a great pass rush and a great secondary. This means that they will be extremely good plays at home and against bad teams, and sketchy plays on the road going forward. Are they better than streaming? I don’t think so, at least not appreciably so, and certainly not enough to suffer through alternating bad/good matchups. It might be worth suffering through a bad one if it buys you 2-3 good ones. Luckily for their backers, they have far more good matchups remaining than bad ones, and so might end up starting by default for most GMs.

•	Trust the Ravens, nevermore? I can’t trust them but I can’t get away from them yet. Backup QBs are D/ST goldmines, and E.J. Manuel is one of the best. The game is on the road (bleh) against a good (?) offense (bleh bleh), but Manuel himself is enough to cancel out all of that. They’re not a great start, but they’re also not bad, and getting through this game gives you vs CHI, @ MIN, vs MIA, and @ TEN before they go to Lambeau. That’s probably enough to keep them out of the streaming pile for another month.

•	Defenses that right now I trust more than streaming: Kansas City, Denver, Seattle. Period. Then we still have a large group of teams that are nipping at their heels, and that are probably better than streaming but not quite matchup proof. Those are Arizona, Jacksonville, Minnesota, and then perhaps a half dozen others that will vary a ton week-to-week (as some pass great matchups or enter into terrible ones, and/or pass their bye weeks). If you do not have one of those top options – it’s simply not worth stressing over dropping your D/ST if you can pick up something you feel good about in the immediate week.

•	Seattle and LA have a Vegas total of 47, and the Seahawks are underdogs on the road. Off the top of my head, this is the highest-scoring profile I can remember in this matchup for years, and it’s a sign to avoid this game on both sides. However, backers of Seattle (as mentioned above) can probably just eat the bad matchup and start them anyway. Backers of the Rams should proceed with caution.

•	Buffalo get a road game as underdogs and still churn out a top tier ranking. I don’t know that I believe it. The Bengals are really bad, and the Vegas total is just 39; but everything else about this game profiles negatively. Streamers take notice but I would not jump off an option you can otherwise stomach in order to grab them.

•	Briefly on KC: They’re on the road. Deshaun Watson is pretty dreamy. Start them anyway.

•	There is no public line yet for Oakland/Baltimore, Chicago/Minnesota, and Miami/Tennessee due to QB injuries. Last week, [I pushed an update to the rankings to Twitter to account for line movements on the week](https://twitter.com/dtlerch/status/914326599851528192), and will do so again this week.

•	Speaking of Minnesota, they too get a backup QB. I’m less excited about this spot than I otherwise would have been, but they should still be fired up across the board. The Bears have a very good offensive line and have shown a willingness to avoid throwing the ball; I don’t know that it’s enough to cap the Vikings’ upside here, especially given that the game is at home.

•	The Lions show up well here. This is a great week for backers to take a freeroll of sorts, similar to that of Jacksonville last week. Their scoring profile has not been sustainable (4 fumble recoveries and two TDs), but they’ve also been the top-scoring D/ST in MFL Standard. To throw some cold water on that, they have games at New Orleans, then a bye, then at Green Bay in three of their next four weeks, so this might be the last time to start them for a while. They should be started in 100% of leagues this week, but also probably dropped in a majority of them afterward.

Lots of options for streamers this week, so here’s hoping you pick correctly. Make good choices and that’s all that counts. As always, I’ll do my best this week to field the most interesting, difficult, and common questions in the thread below.

Thank you, as always, for reading. And I would like to extend my sincerest gratitude for the response last week. There were some disappointing reads, and some foul garbage in my PMs, but the kind and thoughtful words easily outnumbered them 10 to 1. Thank you.

AMA!","Hi Reddit! 

I’m Dr. Matt Kaeberlein, and I’m here to talk about what influences healthy aging in our pets, especially the biological and environmental factors, and how we can use this information to improve the quality and length of their lives. There’s a lot that understanding aging can teach us about our pets… did you know that large breed dogs age faster than small breed dogs, and that aging pets may experience more sleepless nights? Did you know dogs and cats are considered senior around age 7 and begin to experience physical and cognitive changes? Aging is the most important risk factor for a wide range of diseases not only in pets, but humans as well, so by targeting the biological mechanisms of aging, humans and pets can expect to live healthier, longer lives.

My research is aimed at better understanding ‘healthspan,’ the period of life spent in good health free of disease and disability, so we can maximize the healthy years of our pets’ lives. I study aging in dogs not only because they are man’s best friend, but because they age very similarly to us, share similar genetic and phenotypic diversity and, most uniquely, share our daily environment. Imagine the strides we can make with advancing human healthspan if we’re able to fully understand how to increase the healthspan of our pets!

A bit [more about me](http://kaeberleinlab.org/people/matt-kaeberlein): I’m the Co-Director of the [Dog Aging Project](http://dogagingproject.com/trial-one-study/), Adjunct Professor of Genome Sciences and Oral Health Sciences and a Professor of Pathology at the University of Washington in Seattle. In my role as Director of the Dog Aging Project, we are working to increase healthspan in dogs so pet owners can have more healthy years with their best friends. We were recently featured on the [TODAY](https://www.today.com/video/your-dog-could-live-years-longer-thanks-to-a-new-drug-913562691791) show – check us out to learn more about our groundbreaking work.  I have three dogs: Dobby, a 5 year old German Shepherd, Chloe, a 11 year old Keeshond, and Betty, an elder-dog rescue of unknown age containing an interesting mix of Basset Hound, Lab, and Beagle.

This AMA is being facilitated as part of a partnership between myself and Purina Pro Plan, as nutrition also plays an important role in supporting the healthspan of pets. Scientists at Purina Pro Plan have been studying aging in pets for more than a decade and discovered that nutrition can positively impact canine cognitive health and feline longevity. This research led to two life-changing innovations from Pro Plan for pets age seven and older – BRIGHT MIND Adult 7+ for dogs and PRIME PLUS for cats.

Let’s talk about the ways we can help the pets we love live longer, healthier lives – Ask Me Anything! I’ll be back at 1 pm EST to answer your questions.

quickonthedrawl,2017-09-26 14:52:07+00:00,"Week 4 D/ST Scoring, 2017","This past NFL weekend will be written and talked about at length over the coming weeks, and deservedly so. The American President spoke out against NFL players – most notably Colin Kaepernick, but also Eric Reid, Brandon Marshall, Malcolm Jenkins, Michael Bennett, and others – calling them “sons of bitches” for kneeling in protest of police brutality during the national anthem, and then calling for them to be fired. He said this at a rally in Alabama, speaking about mostly black men to a mostly white audience. The contempt in his voice was palpable, and his implications were clear. Because fantasy football also has a mostly white audience, it is to them that this piece is primarily directed toward.


Protests are often not intended to be convenient or even pleasant for the people whose attention they are trying to get. They are the inevitable result of a person who has reached their breaking point, someone who is so frustrated with the status quo that they have no other option. And in terms of pure inconvenience, Colin Kaepernick’s protest has barely moved the needle. I’m surprised some folks even noticed “politics invading their sport” in between the national anthem, the field-stretching flag waving, and the Department of Defense-sponsored Salute to Service every week. Consider how lucky you are to have even felt that way to begin with.



Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr’s *Letter from a Birmingham Jail* features the following excerpt:


&gt;“I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.”

The full text of Dr. King’s letter [can be found here]( https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html).

Read his words. Read them, then read them again, then read them once more. Read them until you understand every single one of them, until you recognize that he was absolutely, unequivocally, 100% correct. Dr. King’s legacy during the Civil Rights Movement has been whitewashed in the half-century since his death, and his message has been distilled into the few quoted lines from his “I Have a Dream” speech that are taught in public schools. Why? Perhaps it’s just a coincidence, or maybe it is so the average white American feels less culpability when considering the black experience, if they even allow themselves to consider it at all.


Slavery and its tangential evils left an ugly wound in this country. 150 years have passed since the Civil War, yes, but adherents of white supremacy have enjoyed a measure of comfort in the decades since. They have been Senators and Congresspeople, Judges and lawyers, Mayors and city managers, police chiefs and officers, doctors and engineers, even Presidents; in reality, virtually every role in society at some point, in some place, has been filled by some brand of white supremacist. They have had a hand in making the laws, enforcing the laws, and nearly every aspect in between of American life in some way. And then many tens of millions of white Americans, whether consciously or not, have taken advantage of this system. Those of us who benefit from whiteness have been reaping its rewards time and time and time again.


Read Dr. King’s words again. Think over how many times you’ve heard criticism of Colin Kaepernick, telling the world how much they agree with his message but just wish he would protest differently. Think about how many people, rather than addressing the issues he has raised, have shrouded themselves in the American flag and expressed disapproval about him “disgracing the troops.” Short of actual substantive discussions about the issue of law enforcement in communities of color, we are left with arguments over military support and over freedom of speech. Maybe you have been one of those voices yourself. If you have been – please ask yourself if you are the “white moderate” that Dr. King wrote about, and if so, what can be done to change that.



Know, too, that there are many millions who have watched this all unfold without saying a word in support of Kaepernick’s message to their friends or family; without so much as lifting a finger or raising a fist or taking a step forward; without doing a single thing in support of Colin and his message - they too are Dr. King’s “white moderates.”



We can only claim ignorance for so long. At some point, it becomes time for all of us to take a stand, and for most of us that time has long since passed. Go look at photos of the Little Rock Nine from 1957 as we reach the 60th anniversary of integration. Just as (I hope) none of us want to be remembered as the sneering racists who spit on and abused those black teenagers on their way to school, none of us should want to be remembered as the nameless faces in the crowd that watched it all unfold and did nothing to stop it.


The good news is that it is never too late. Listen to the voices of people of color when they share with you their experience. Amplify the voices that you hear and spread their messages to your friends and family. When you hear somebody say “I’m hurting,” don’t make them jump through hoops or prove their pain; ask them “How can I help?” You have immense ability to change the narrative, to do work beyond just retweeting a trending hashtag, to actually help right the wrongs of racial injustice and move us all forward. 


Colin has gotten our attention. What are **you** going to do about it?

16 | Detroit Lions | 7.7 | 3 |  @ MIN (no widely available line yet)


Week 3 was a D/ST disaster for almost everybody. You would have literally done better flipping the rankings upside down and using them in reverse. The top scores on the week were a mediocre Bengals defense at Lambeau, the New York Jets, a mediocre Washington defense against the Oakland Raiders, and the New Orleans Saints on the road. Good luck finding a single person who predicted any of that.


Do recall the following quote from last week: “Lots of road games this week. Of 15 games with public lines, 10 of them have a road favorite. My instinct suggests we’ll have a very frustrating week in general with D/ST scoring.” Weird things happen when we find so many road favorites, and this past week was no exception. Just as you should have avoided weighing Week 1 or Week 2 too highly seven days ago, the same applies to Week 3 today. The entire season to date should be taken as a whole, to the best of our abilities.

**Best of luck in Week 4.** I have dedicated my allotted time this week to writing what I did above, and so I do not have time as usual to expand on the rankings before publishing. I will really appreciate reading any thoughtful commentary and thoughtful responses to what I wrote. However, I will also be happy as usual to discuss our D/ST options in the comments, and will edit the OP to include answers to some of the more common/interesting questions that get asked over the next 90 minutes in particular.

**EDIT: As promised, a few hours late**

* [Why I hesitate to trust the Cowboys, but accept that they're a reasonable choice](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/72kuv2/week_4_dst_scoring_2017/dnkqysu/)

* [Why the Jaguars present a ""freeroll"" of sorts](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/72kuv2/week_4_dst_scoring_2017/dnjcq7z/)

* [Why I'm giving the Ravens another chance](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/72kuv2/week_4_dst_scoring_2017/dnj83fl/)

* [Loose grouping of the top 8 D/STs, and which are closest to joining them rest of season](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/72kuv2/week_4_dst_scoring_2017/dnjqu0n/)

* [Which teams I'd add the Jacksonville Jaguars over, and which ones are a little tougher](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/72kuv2/week_4_dst_scoring_2017/dnjiffc/)

* A lot of questions revolved around the Ravens in particular. I think they're still a good defense, still a mediocre offense, and they got exposed on a neutral field last weekend. Nothing more, nothing less. Unfortunately, this opens the door for them to be something significantly less than an every week starter, and there is not much room between ""every week starter"" and ""drop for streaming"" in D/STs in most leagues. So, they're definitely on notice, and anybody who has cold feet can pivot into the Jaguars pretty cleanly this week. I wouldn't do it myself, but I can understand and support anybody who does.

* As for those Jaguars? They're a very good choice this week. The same hesitations that were here last week are still here for me; but we've now seen more good from them than bad, and so we can *start* to give them the benefit of the doubt. What really sells them though is that their matchup this current week is so good. That's why I called them a ""freeroll"" of sorts. You can add them for Week 4 and start them with confidence regardless of if their offense is ready to start clicking or not. Then, based on what happens in Week 4, you can always reevaluate next week and toss them back in the streaming pile, or reup for Week 5. It's a good spot to be in. Though note, Week 5 they are @ Pittsburgh in what is a very bad matchup.

* A lot of questions revolved around the Cardinals as well. I think they're still a great option going forward. They're not an every-week starter that you can feel comfortable with, but they're not quite a streaming option either. I would bet on them finishing in the top 8 of D/ST scores by year's end, which would put them roughly equal with streaming in most years, and without having to pay any waiver transactions. That's not a bad spot to be in by any stretch, and not something that you can expect to improve upon unless something unexpected falls in your lap.

I think that covers most of the more common questions this week, as well as some of the tougher ones. From the bottom of my heart, thank you so much to everybody who has received this week's writeup warmly. It has been really inspiring to read some of the resulting discussions.

NFL_Mod,2017-09-24 11:06:58+00:00,Gameday Protest/Reaction Megathread,"##UPDATE: The Megathreads are now locked, and we are returning to regular order here in r/NFL.

For three days we have given you all the opportunity to freely talk about the events of the past week. We appreciate the help that many of you have given to police the community and keep it as decent as possible when considering the topics at hand.

The mod team has agreed that midnight EDT is officially the end of the weekend, and so the end of the threads. We will leave them up as is, and we ask that everyone look at them, honestly and objectively read them, and see as many sides that you can so we can all understand each other a little better, even if we can not or will not agree.

The r/NFL community is a strong mix of people from all walks of life, of every race, creed, gender, orientation; from over 100 countries around the globe. That is what makes us so much more than some random message board. We are a tight night group of fanatics who love football, and love to talk about it.

We will all have a discussion on this, and the other issues of politics and football that we had planned on talking about later this week, even before this situation began to unfold.

Thanks everyone, sincerely. You're our guys (and gals), we are are your guys (and gal).

Cheers,

MJP

Over the last 48 hours we have had two previous megathreads after the comments made by President Trump at a rally in Alabama on Friday night.

The first was immediate reaction to the statement. [**It can be found here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/71vp3n/megathread_presidents_comments_on_kneeling_nfl/).

The second was player, owner, NFL League Office and NFL Player's Association reactions to the statement, as well as additional tweets from President Trump. [**It can be found here.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/71ytmn/league_response_megathread/)

At this time, both of those threads are locked, and we ask that continuing discussion be kept here. This includes any highlights of the protests, further player/team/league reactions, your own feelings on the matter, etc.

We all understand that there will be a strong desire to talk about the protests in the individual game threads, but the r/NFL mod team asks everyone here today, and we mean everyone, to respect that fact that there are hundreds -if not thousands- of users who just want to talk about and react to the game on the field. For that reason, we ask all of you to report any comments within the game and postgame threads that are outside of the rules of this subreddit as they stood before this took place.

As we've said the previous two days, this is a huge area where the NFL and politics intersect and this discussion will be allowed to the fullest extent possible. However, we implore you to keep conversation with other users civil, even if you disagree.

anoncopSEA,2017-09-24 02:00:50+00:00,"""Why don't the police do anything about property crime?""","I'm a Seattle police officer. I will not do an AMA. But I am tired of reading complaints against us on this forum as if we don't do anything about property crimes. So the answer to the above question is: we do. We do a lot. But it's not enough for the following reasons:

**We are seriously understaffed.** Patrol staffing now is chronically low. The average squad size right now, for a patrol sector, is about half of what it was in the 1980s - when the city was much smaller. Only about half of the 1200 officers in the department are actually assigned to the patrol bureau, and that includes units like bike squads which don't respond to 911 calls. 

**Understaffing also applies to follow-up units** - precinct detectives are overwhelmed with cases to follow up on. Misdemeanor thefts typically get little follow up. 

**We write a ton of reports.** For example, even the briefest contact with a person ""in crisis"" is required to be documented in a ""crisis report"", even when there is no crime, no involuntary commitment, and no meaningful action taken. Additionally, any citizen who demands a report, even about the most inane of non-crimes (""someone made a mean comment on Facebook"") is given one. I have spent many hours I could have been patrolling writing and filing reports about non-crimes.  Use of force reporting also takes time. Use of force is rare, but when it happens we're off the street for hours writing reports. Under policy, if a suspect says ""ow"" when handcuffed, we must write a use of force report. 

**King County filing standards.** King County prosecutors [generally will not file felony charges](http://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/prosecutor/criminal-overview/fads.aspx) in the following cases:  

a) robberies where a shoplifter fought store security but didn't use a weapon  

b) burglaries where the building hit was a parking garage  

c) burglaries where the suspect was trespassed from a store after a theft and then returned to commit theft again  

d) possession of stolen property (PSP) when the suspect has credit cards belonging to three or fewer victims (the law only requires one)  

e) any theft, PSP, or property damage under $1000 (the limit in the law is $750)

In my experience criminals and cops alike here are familiar with these filing standards and usually act accordingly - cops don't want to spend time on cases they know won't be filed as a felony, and criminals know they can target certain locations and types of property without fear of felony prosecution. There are probably hundreds if not thousands of burglary and robbery cases in King County not filed for this reason.

**Nobody wants to prosecute drug addicts.** Drug crimes are not technically property crimes, but almost all thefts are committed by hardcore drug addicts. King County prosecutors will not file any drug case based on paraphernalia/residue only, and Seattle has no misdemeanor drug paraphernalia charge, so possession of drug paraphernalia has been effectively legalized in the city.  King County will not file drug cases as felonies where the suspect possessed less than three grams of meth, cocaine, or heroin. These are all filed as misdemeanors, even on a second offense (in reality these cases often aren't filed at all). 

Only 1800 drug cases were even filed in all of King County in 2014. Only 38% of those were prosecuted as felonies, half were made into misdemeanors and the rest went to drug court. Scott Lindsay hit it on the head in 2015 when [he said:](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/seattle-officials-point-fingers-over-cause-of-increased-downtown-crime/)

&gt;The increase in street disorder is largely a function of the fact that **heroin, crack and meth possession has been largely legalized in the city** over the past several years as the County Prosecutor significantly raised the bar to prosecuting drug possession (arrests and prosecutions have dropped off a cliff as a result)... With drugs and drug addiction comes property crimes and street disorder.

**Sentencing and bail** Rarely is anyone held on bail for property crimes or drug crimes. Most drug criminals and property criminals facing felony charges are released within 72 hours. Bail for misdemeanor property crimes doesn't usually happen until a person misses two or three court dates. Misdemeanor theft could theoretically result in up to 364 days in jail. I have never seen this happen, usually *prosecutors* ask for 10-20 days.

**Treatment?** A lot of people have argued that if drugs are the problem, drug treatment is the answer and not jail. That might be true, but that's not what we're doing. We're just arresting drug addicts and releasing them immediately with no supervision, treatment, or consequences. If I could arrest drug addicts and commit them for 30 days to a drug treatment center whether they liked it or not, that's what I would do with almost everyone I arrest. But I can't, so I book the same people into jail again and again.

**Seattle the dumping ground.** Neighboring cities in King County have no interest in any of what Seattle is doing as far as criminal justice reform, but they know how to take advantage of it. They issue ""non-extraditable"" misdemeanor arrest warrants so transient drug addicts will be arrested, but only if they return to Kent/Shoreline/Bellevue/etc. They typically will not pick these people up unless we drive them back to their cities for them, something which low staffing usually makes impossible. I also know for a fact that neighboring police agencies will take drop people off in Seattle whom they don't want in their city, on the premise that ""Seattle offers more services"" for transients and drug addicts.

These opinions are my own and not the opinion of any city or county agency.

quickonthedrawl,2017-09-19 14:57:26+00:00,"Week 3 D/ST Scoring, 2017","Hello and welcome back!

Last week, with just 15 NFL games total in our 2017 sample, the theme for everybody’s Week 2 preparation should have been “Temper your goddamn expectation!” Sometimes, a great team plays poorly and looks terrible. Sometimes, a terrible team plays well and looks great. Sometimes they both happen in the same game!

And just to muddle the mixture even more, sometimes a good team can become bad (and vice versa). Be honest, who among us had the Jacksonville Jaguars as D/ST stud going into Week 1? But then after they demolished the Houston Texans, who among us had them as a top option? Followers of this column would have been skeptical before Week 1 and skeptical again before Week 2, and before having run the numbers for Week 3, I would expect that to continue.

This brings us back to a key point with D/ST projections, and with fantasy football projections in general. If you have a prior expectation, and you have a good reason to anchor that expectation at a certain point, it should necessarily take a decent amount of data before you're willing to come too far off of that prior expectation (in either direction, both higher and lower). Did you have the Jaguars as the 24th best D/ST before the season started? Then you probably shouldn’t have had them as the 2nd best D/ST before Week 2 started.

Unfortunately, that means we are going to miss out on some options that we would have gotten had we jumped the gun and bought in early. Conversely, we will be paying far less when we swing and miss on the remainder of them. It evens out, and in the end, I think we come out ahead.

Overall, Week 2 was very kind to D/ST scoring. In fact, with a correlation coefficient of 0.49, the results were about as good as a D/ST projection model can expect. For reference, FantasyPros’ ECR scored 0.38, suggesting that it was just a good week in general for the position. Last week’s Tier 1/1.5 plays – seven in all – averaged 11.9 points.

That means we’ve gotten two strong weeks in a row, and while there’s no such thing as being “due” for a letdown, don’t be surprised when it finally comes.

Please refer back [to Week 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/6y0l2c/week_1_dst_scoring_2017/) if you have questions about the scoring settings or the methodology.

**2017 Week 3!**


Rank | Team | Points | Tier | Notes
:--------: | :-------- | :--------: | :--------: | :--------
1 | Baltimore Ravens | 11.8 | 1 |  @ JAX
2 | New England Patriots | 10.4 | 1 |  v HOU
3 | Miami Dolphins | 9.7 | 1.5 |  @ NYJ
4 | Tampa Bay Buccaneers | 9.7 | 1.5 |  @ MIN (assumes Bradford OUT)
5 | Green Bay Packers | 9.7 | 1.5 |  v CIN
6 | Philadelphia Eagles | 9.5 | 1.5 |  v NYG
7 | Pittsburgh Steelers | 9.4 | 1.5 | @ CHI
8 | Indianapolis Colts | 9.3 | 2 |  v CLE
9 | Los Angeles Rams | 9.1 | 2 |  @ SF
10 | Denver Broncos | 9.0 | 2 |  @ BUF
11 | Kansas City Chiefs | 8.9 | 2 |  @ LAC
12 | San Francisco 49ers | 8.8 | 2 |  v LAR
13 | Carolina Panthers | 8.8 | 2 |  v NO
14 | Dallas Cowboys | 8.7 | 2 |  @ ARI
15 | Cleveland Browns | 8.7 | 2 |  @ IND
16 | Tennessee Titans | 8.2 | 3 |  v SEA
17 | Buffalo Bills | 8.2 | 3 |  v DEN

Everything below can be considered unstartable in Week 2 except in very deep leagues. That includes the Seattle Seahawks (6.9), Jacksonville Jaguars (7.8), Minnesota Vikings (6.7), Arizona Cardinals (6.5) and others. When in doubt, it's almost always safe to drop a D/ST instead of a position player to stream or stash something more important. When dealing with a D/ST like Seattle with significant residual value expected past the current week, it is always viable to start them in a bad matchup.

**Brief thoughts**

* Can we dispense with the “Jacksonville is a top tier D/ST” trope for now? D/STs attached to a bad offense are rarely worth chasing, and turnover-prone offenses are somehow even worse. If Bortles and the Jaguars ever figure that part out, then I’ll pay attention.

* The Ravens, however, continue to look the part of a top tier D/ST. I personally think they’re for real, but their schedule also has (potentially) masked some of their deficiencies. Real tests await them but not this week. Temper expectations slightly, however. With 8 interceptions through 2 games, their pace is skewing the projection model slightly. 2016 still makes up a significant part of the sample, but the Ravens are certainly not *that* good. They’re very good though.

* So much for the Cleveland Browns “improved” pass blocking. Through two games, the Browns have conceded 10 sacks, worse even than last year’s 4.1 per game. The only team worse through two games has been the Houston Texans who, after allowing 10 sacks in their one game against Jacksonville, allowed just 3 at Cincinnati.

* The Seahawks, Cardinals, and Vikings are on notice. They have gone from “probably better than streaming” to “maybe better than streaming” and all three need to get their offenses under control before they can be started with confidence. Whether to drop them or not has more to do with your league and available options than any hard and fast rule.

* That would leave just the Broncos, Ravens, and Chiefs as 100% holds through bad matchups, at least for now (along with some # of the aforementioned SEA/ARI/MIN trio). The Panthers, Rams, and Buccaneers are probably capable of getting into the conversation, but they’re not quite there yet.

* For streamers, look toward New England, Miami, or Green Bay before digging deeper. Indianapolis rates highly enough but I worry it’s a small sample size trap (cute DFS play though?).

* Note that the Tampa/Minnesota game has not been made public with sportsbooks due to Bradford’s status. This projection can change in a hurry through the week and I will update the post to reflect it when it does.

* Lots of road games this week. Of 15 games with public lines, 10 of them have a road favorite. My instinct suggests we’ll have a very frustrating week in general with D/ST scoring.

I think that’s enough for now. We’re now more than 12% of the way through the fantasy season, and perhaps 15% of the way through most regular season schedules. Blink and you’ll miss it.

Best of luck in Week 3! As always, I’ll do my best to address the most interesting and most common questions in the thread below.

First, I need to extend my deepest appreciation for each and every kind word that was written here last week, and for every single donation that was made to help communities in Houston and the surrounding region. I tried to respond to each and every person who reached out last week - every single one of you are heroes. If I missed anybody, I am so sorry, but please accept a huge ""thank you"" here as well. The /r/fantasyfootball group has blown me away on multiple instances, and this has been one more entry at the top of the list. Thank you all so, so much.

____

Football in Week 1 was strange. It was a strong week for some folks and disastrous for others; after all, football is a violent sport, and violent sports lead to violent injuries. If you found yourself on the receiving end of one of more painful ones, it's time to dig deep and do your best to recover. Sometimes there will be nothing you can do, and that's just how it goes.

D/STs are more forgiving. While individual defensive players can be injured throughout the season (and very often do!), D/ST scoring typically moves right along past each of them. The position aggregates the performance of 11 players at a time, and so very few players actually matter when it comes to D/ST scoring. The stud interior lineman? Irrelevant. The middle linebacker? Irrelevant. The shutdown corner? Irrelevant.

Mostly.

While each player lost does have some effect, it tends to be marginal enough to ignore. Would the Rams have scored more points with Aaron Donald? Maybe, but clearly they were still OK without him. Would the Jaguars have notched fewer than 10 sacks if Duane Brown had played? Probably, but he alone can't have been to blame. The lesson here is to focus on the matchup and the defense in aggregate, not look too hard for specifics. It actually makes things easier!

In Week 1, multiple strong projections came through with strong scores. My favorite play for the week, the LA Rams, finished with 28 MFL points. Across the top two tiers, the six teams averaged a stellar 12.7 points, although backers of Houston and Denver probably regret their choices. Unfortunately, that's part of the position.

Overall, rank correlation for Week 1 was 0.33 - relatively average overall compared to the last couple of seasons, but extraordinarily good for Week 1. Unfortunately, FantasyPros changed their site such that I cannot find a full list of their Week 1 D/ST ECR; if anybody has it, I'd be happy to run te correlation for them as well. I would expect it to be similarly strong.

Please refer back [to Week 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/6y0l2c/week_1_dst_scoring_2017/) if you have questions about the scoring settings or the methodology.

**2017 Week 2!**


Rank | Team | Points | Tier | Notes
:--------: | :-------- | :--------: | :--------: | :--------
1 | Baltimore Ravens | 12.3 | 1 |  v CLE
2 | Arizona Cardinals | 11.4 | 1 |  @ IND
3 | Oakland Raiders | 10.6 | 1 |  v NYJ
4 | Seattle Seahawks | 10.3 | 1.5 |  v SF
5 | Carolina Panthers | 10.3 | 1.5 |  v BUF
6 | Tampa Bay Buccaneers | 10.0 | 1.5 |  v CHI
7 | Cincinnati Bengals | 9.8 | 1.5 | v HOU 
8 | Los Angeles Chargers | 9.4 | 2 |  v MIA
9 | Pittsburgh Steelers | 9.1 | 2 |  v MIN
10 | Dallas Cowboys | 8.7 | 3 |  @ DEN
11 | Kansas City Chiefs | 8.3 | 3 |  v PHI
12 | Washington | 8.0 | 3 |  @ @ LAR
13 | ~~New York Giants~~ | ~~8.0~~ | 3 |  v DET (SEE EDIT BELOW)
14 | Tennessee Titans | 7.7 | 3.5 |  @ JAX
15 | Los Angeles Rams | 7.7 | 3.5 |  v WAS
16 | Miami Dolphins | 7.5 | 3.5 |  @ LAC
17 | Houston Texans | 7.4 | 3.5 |  @ CIN

**Edit: The Giants/Lions line is public, and it's much lower than I thought it would be. The NYG D/ST now projects to score 8.6 points and jumps to #11 overall. The Lions D/ST jumps to 6.9 points and 18th overall.**

Everything below can be considered unstartable in Week 2 except in very deep leagues. That includes the New England Patriots (6.5), Jacksonville Jaguars (6.9), and others. When in doubt, it's almost always safe to drop a D/ST instead of a position player to stream or stash something more important.

**Brief thoughts**

* Many more home teams than road teams at the top of the list this week. This is by design, and should be expected to continue more often than not. Again, favor home teams over road teams when all else is equal (just as you should favor favorites over underdogs when all else is equal).

* I try my best to control for sample size issues in the early weeks, but somethings will be difficult. Jacksonville got 10 sacks in Week 1. Pittsburgh got 7 sacks. Conversely, Houston and Cleveland conceded 10 and 7 sacks, respectively. These extreme performances will taint the sample slightly for perhaps 4-6 weeks. Use extra caution when backing a team (or fading a team) with an extreme performance in their recent history.

* Indianapolis might not start Tolzien in Week 2. Sad day. But the roster is still putrid, and they're still a fade going forward.

* New England looked terrible and that is concerning. But they're still a good team until proven otherwise, so do not panic. Similarly with Seattle and Denver in particular, their D/STs should be fine going forward. Both passed the eye test this weekend. While New England is rated as unstartable, they probably should be kept and started anyway (yeah, awkward, I know).

* Houston is concerning. Their offense was a huge liability on Sunday, and it was one of the worst games of ""professional"" football I've ever seen. If you're going to get away from them this season, the time is now. Two consecutive road games at Cincinnati and then at New England, and their next start-worthy game might not be until they host Cleveland in Week 6. No gracias.

* Tier 1 and 1.5 extend fairly far this week. Lots of good choices. Don't stress yourself out too much if you have multiple options within the same tier; chances are, the decision matters a lot less than you think it might. Focus your waiver attention on other positions if you find yourself in that boat.

* Oakland, Seattle, and Baltimore are my favorite options this week otherwise, in no particular order.

* The Rams are worth holding onto this week for an OK matchup at home, but temper expectations and do not shy away from continuing to stream if you are so inclined. Much more difficult to back the Jaguars going forward but they can be similarly justified. Theirs is a slightly worse matchup, but also (tentatively?) at home.

* As of early Tuesday morning, the public line on Denver/Dallas is not sharp enough to rely on, and there is no public total for the Giants/Lions. Tread carefully with both until we get better data.

As always, I'll do my best to field questions all week long. If you worry something got lost in the muck here, a reminder that I do try to keep a close on [my Twitter page](http://www.twitter.com/dtlerch) for fantasy questions also. The Reddit inbox does not handle these threads particularly well on Tuesdays or Wednesdays.

Otherwise, **best of luck in Week 2!**",fantasyfootball,2573

Sweggeh,2017-08-18 19:31:26+00:00,"Daniel Bryan broke down today the full story of how he was made to retire due to concussions. And after hearing it, I'm more convinced than ever that he should be allowed to get back in the ring.","This is a long read, but Im gonna recap all the information he gave regarding his injury and how he was made to retire. This can all be found by listening to his interview today with Edge and Christian on their podcast.

So his story starts with the time of his last concussion. He gets cleared by his own doctors, but that isn't enough for WWE.

So first WWE and Vince in particular force him to see their hand picked experts to get testing done on his brain. So they sent him to these doctors (that aren't his own doctors which already cleared him), first of which was a concussion specialist in Phoenix. They cleared him.

That wasn't enough for WWE, and he asked WWE what more they want him to do. He said he would go get a 3rd opinion. So he went to UCLA to get testing from a team of concussion specialists who had him run a lot of different tests. They cleared him.

He comes back to WWE, and yet again they say no you are not cleared to go, even though 3 independent institutions had already cleared him, 2 of which were doctors WWE chose.

So they send him to go get some experimental stuff done. Testing that isn't even FDA approved. They do some kind of reflex or impact testing, so they hook stuff up to his brain and test that and whatever. So he does that, and they tell him he has a lesion in a certain region on his brain. So he calls Vince, and he tells him he has this lesion on his brain. He says he was crying when he got off the phone because his career was done. And the next week Vince calls him and tells him to come to RAW in Seattle and give a retirement speech. Initially he didn't want to do it but he became convinced it was for the best.

Then after everything dies down, he gets a call from one of the doctors who originally cleared him and he asks him what happened that made him retire. He tells the doctor that they found a lesion on his brain. And then the doctor tells him that in medical terminology, a lesion does not mean what it usually means. Bryan thought it meant he had a cut on his brain, but the doctor says that in medical terminology, a lesion is a very vague term. It just means that *something* is there. Not necessarily a cut or anything like that.

Then that doctor looks at the report that said he had a lesion. And what he found was that Daniel's brain reflexes in that region were slower than they expected. Thats why in the report they wrote it in as a lesion.

Now here is the really messed up part. That region of his brain had a slow reflex compared to MMA fighters and football players and athletes that they usually test at that facility. It did NOT have any reflex that is slower than what you would expect in a normal human being. And since Bryan is a performer and not really a sports person, obviously you would expect his reflex time to be closer to an average persons, not a high level sports athlete.

In addition to that, they didnt have a baseline for how fast the reflex in that part of his brain used to be. So they had no way of even knowing if there was actually any damage there, or if that was just the normal speed at which that region of his brain functioned.

He went to this Joe Namath institute to get more tests done and they said his brain is no different from a run of the mill college football player. He has had some concussions, but he is not a person at risk of brain damage.

He has had even more testing done and from certain tests they say that now, with the time he has had out of wrestling, and with continued work and treatment, his brain could look like someone who has never even played a contact sports. And he says he is sad looking back because he feels he wasted the prime years of his career.

**EDIT:** As some people have mentioned, DB has said he is continuing to get healthy with his treatment and he has said categorically that if he ever found a problem that legitimately made it unsafe for him to wrestle, he would not do so.

**Second EDIT:** Daniel Bryan has also said that he understands why WWE did what they did, implying he feels WWE were only doing what they thought what was best. If people are getting the idea from this that he is implying they purposely screwed him, I don't think that is the case. ",SquaredCircle,2662

I'm glad memorials to slave owners and defenders of slavery are being removed throughout the southern states. However, not only European-Americans owned slaves. Chief Seattle of the Duwamish nation, Emperor Montezuma of the Aztecs, and Chief Joseph Vann of the Cherokee nation practiced slavery. There are two statues of Chief Seattle in the city of Seattle, a statue of Montezuma at San Diego State University, and Vann's home now operates as a museum in rural Georgia. If America wants to completely condemn the practice of slavery, it should not only remove memorials to white slave owners, but also memorials to non-white slave owners.

WhoIsEarthshaker,2017-08-05 06:20:42+00:00,Interesting facts about Chinese broadcasting scene,"The Chinese broadcasting scene is very different from the English one. In English broadcasting scene, getting invited to TI is undoubtedly the most important achievement for all talents. All popular English talents will gather at TI each year (except 2GD and KotlGuy I guess). And 99% of viewers will watch the official English channel. However, it is almost opposite for Chinese broadcasting scene. That is, almost all popular Chinese talents choose not to join the official broadcasting team, instead they cast all games on their own channel, which have much more viewers than the official channel.

1. Who are the popular Chinese talents?
    Retired pro players. And some retired pro players formed casting teams. The first and most popular team is Old Boys (OB), including IG.YYF, IG,ZHOU, LGD.DD, DK.ZIPPO, DK.LONGDD, EHOME.820. They spread on different streaming platforms and usually have the most viewers on their respective platform. Earlier this year, Xiao8 followed suit and formed South-North F4. F4 also has IG.430, Newbee.Mu, Newbee. SanSheng. Because SanSheng joined the official broadcasting at Seattle, Newbee.Hao took his spot during TI7. Last night, Xiao8's baby was born, so he went to hospital and IG.Chuan joined F4's casting (Yes, all F4 members and even little helpers are TI champions). Last year, as ROTK and BurNing failed to make TI, they also teamed up and formed a casting duo. They are very likely to team up again after retirement, in my opinion.

2. How does their broadcasting work?
All members from one team will broadcast one game together, unless there are multiple Chinese teams playing at the same time. They will do OB themselves in-game. After the game, they will switch to official broadcasting channel and let the viewers watch players' reaction or handshakes etc. In between the games, they will play online poker, arcade games or just talk random anecdotes.

3. Why?
Because they have streaming contracts worthy half million to multiple millions of dollars per year. If you remember EE's famous blog after leaving Team Secret, he mentioned that he got an offer of half million dollars to stream on PandaTV. And EE's popularity is nowhere near those retired Chinese players.
TI attracts the most viewers in a year, so both the platform and streamer don't want to waste the chance to score huge viewer number, which is crucial for their future contract negotiation. Moreover, viewers are more likely to give streamers gift during TI (like donation for Twitch) for celebrating a big win or asking streamer to tell stories on certain player etc. Sometimes, streamers can earn thousands of dollars per day from gifts alone. 

4. Who is on official broadcasting team then?
Except for a few pro players (LaNm, SanSheng this year), all other Chinese talents come from different studios (e.g., MarsTV, imbaTV). Their popularity simply can't match OB or F4.

Tl;dr
Most popular Chinese talents do casting on their own channel, instead of joining the official team, because of the lucrative steaming money.

DaRedBeard,2017-08-02 20:18:06+00:00,I hate “mom and pop” golf stores.,"I hate “mom and pop” golf stores. 

So I’m new to the area, and I head into this golf store I see from the road in Mukilteo, WA (Jorgensen Golf for those north of Seattle). I think to myself “I don’t need anything, but I got time to kill so I’ll just poke around.”

This is where things took a turn for the worse. The woman working the store was too effing nice, and she gave me a tour of their store. She didn’t make fun of my being left handed, she took interest in my background and where I like to play, and she was just really sweet, it was awful. She mentions to me that they do free club fittings if you make an appointment, and she connives me into setting one up for later in the week (which was this morning). She then forced me to stay for half an hour trying out used clubs. Ugh. 

So today I head in with my clubs, and she fits me with my existing set. She looks at me and lets me know that I need an upright lie of 4 degrees! Immediately skeptical, she hands me a Ping G25 7 iron (32 degree loft) that’s 2.5 degrees upright and tells me to give it a swing. Coming from Nike VR blades, I generally average 155 carry with my 7 iron (35 degree loft), and a 168 carry with my 6 iron (31 degree loft). 

I hit 25 balls, and averaged a 192 yard carry. 192 carry. 

In all seriousness, it was terribly eye opening and a wonderful experience! Can’t wait to go back in a couple months and do some serious testing and fitting for a new set of irons!

TL;DR - Don’t go to “mom and pop” golf stores. They know too much, and will make you spend money you didn’t know you wanted to spend. ",golf,4727

kingcobweb,2017-07-27 06:14:08+00:00,"The Ancient Coin problem, or: does no one care when a support item is incredibly broken?","Hi there. It’s your friendly support-main complainer again, back from my two-year island vacation off the profits of Vaynespotting. Reddit has a pretty sweet deal where they give you $1k per upvote. Maybe you’re just not high-tier enough to know about it.
I’m here to complain about something unusual today, as a Janna player: the item that Janna players buy first. Ancient Coin is so out of line that even Phreak took time from [his video from the *previous* patch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiqNNEbprFE&amp;t=1927s) to tell people how busted it is. So it… stays the same in the current patch? Well, that’s how itemization is.

If someone one-shots you when they very obviously shouldn’t, you look at their items or champion and go, “well that needs a nerf.” So it gets nerfed. If a tank is unkillable for way too long, you do the same thing. When a support player has too much mana or money, absolutely nothing happens, apparently; it’s too subtle for anyone to give a shit about.

I’m fine with Janna being broken, because it got me to Diamond. But now Nami and Sona players are latching on to it, and when someone other than me is benefiting from something, it’s a clear indicator that something is wrong. So what’s wrong with Ancient Coin?

1. It’s way too easy to get money from it. With Relic Shield, you actually have to go to the minion at a specific time to get the last hit, and you’re gonna take some harass for that. With Spellthief’s Edge, you actually have to deal damage to trigger it, and take a trade back. With Ancient Coin, you just have to… be near the minions, at some point, whenever, you know, just get back to us, it’s up to you, really. There’s zero risk, because the Ancient Coin champions are the ranged ones whose zones of control allow them to go to the minions whenever. With Janna, specifically, her W passive lets her just walk through them. Now, this would be a reasonable advantage if it was still the starting item with the lowest gold per minute, but…

2. The gold you get from Ancient Coin is ridiculous now. Especially because, once upgraded, it additionally triggers off every assist, I’ll commonly be a thousand gold ahead of the opposing support just because I have the good starting support item and they don’t. Once, when I moronically played Nami with Spellthief into a Janna with Coin, I harassed every single time the Spellthief Passive was up. It was absolutely majestic. We did our first back and I finished… about twenty gold behind. But even if they the same amount of gold, champions like Nami want Ancient Coin, because…

3. Ancient Coin is a hack for infinite mana. Supports, since they inherently don’t scale as well as other champions (that’s why they’re supports), are incredibly reliant on casting their skills. Specifically, caster supports are gated less by their cooldowns than by their mana pools. A Sona with a full mana bar is ridiculous, a Sona with no mana is a caster minion. Because the mana coins drop 15% missing mana, caster supports can just spam all their spells, yet be in absolute safety because they’ll constantly get mana regenerated from Coin pickups. Then, when they upgrade the item, during skirmishes and teamfights they’re constantly getting refreshed mana because it gives both gold and mana for assists. Why does the item do this? Who knows!

Since Coin got buffed, Janna has gone past 55% winrate, even with a super-high play rate. Nami and Sona, despite being the ideal Spellthief’s users, are vastly more successful playing a super passive, boring lane with Coin.

Let’s be real: this item is fucking boring. It incentivizes you to stay back and do nearly nothing, since you’ll get super filthy I-inherited-a-fortune-from-my-parents-and-founded-a-startup rich regardless of how you do in lane.

If it was any other role aside from support this was affecting, it would be a five-alarm siren, “PLAYERS ARE QUITTING THE GAME” alert across this Reddit. But it’s just some support players, so who cares.

So fine. Don’t nerf the item. Keep allowing Janna players to earn more gold per game than the midlaner. I’m a Seattle resident, so I’m perfectly fine being passive-aggressive and just allowing it to continue.",leagueoflegends,2053

camly75,2017-07-13 12:31:10+00:00,If Mike Trout played the rest of his career in Korea - an OOTP experiment,"In one of the most interesting moves of this offseason, the Brewers signed 30 year old first baseman Eric Thames to a 3 year, 16 million dollar contract. Thames hadn’t played in the majors since 2012, and he was rather unremarkable when he did. In 181 games over two seasons with Toronto and Seattle, Thames posted a -0.1 WAR and struck out in over 25% of his at bats. So why is Thames suddenly signing with a major league team, especially for this kind of money? The answer is because he spent the last three seasons in Korea, and he absolutely mashed. Thames had a 1.171 OPS and hit 124 home runs. In his 2015 MVP season, Thames put up an absurd line of 
.381/.497/.790 with 47 homers. He also stole 40 bases and was only caught 8 times. And the move has paid off for first place Milwaukee, as Thames has an impressive wRC+ of 137. However, he has fallen down to Earth it seems, as that number was 107 in May and a dreadful 67 in June.

Eric Thames is obviously a better hitter than he was five years ago, but outside of the first month, he has been a far cry from his Korea self. Clearly, playing abroad against weaker competition has inflated Thames’ numbers, as it has for several mediocre major leaguers such as Wladimir Balentien, who in 2013 became Japan’s single season home run king. Seeing the success of Thames led me to ask an interesting question. If playing in Korea can turn someone like Eric Thames into a hitting God, what can it do for the best player in the majors, Mike Trout? I decided to test this idea out.

I used OOTP, a highly realistic baseball simulation game, to get the answers I wanted. I placed Mike Trout on Korea’s KT Wiz, the team playing in the biggest hitters’ park in the league. To ensure Trout didn’t get homesick before I was through with him, I deleted the MLB and all its players and prospects. The only baseball league in the world is the Korean Baseball Organization, and its superstar is Mike Trout. At only age 24 going into the first season, can the Millville Meteor become the greatest baseball player South Korea has ever seen over the rest of his career?


[See how happy he looks?](http://i.imgur.com/G49Hyy5.png)

**2016:	WAR - 10.5**

There was no transition period for Trout, as he quickly established himself as the best player in the league. Winning the triple crown and MVP, Trout hit .324 with 31 home runs in the 144 game season. His on base percentage was an absurd .507, thanks to 152 walks and 155 hits. His 10.5 WAR was nearly twice as high as the second best hitter. Trout led the league in just about every offensive category except for total bases, which was led by none other than Eric Thames. Unfortunately, Trout’s Wiz lost in the Korean Series to the Daegu Samsung Lions. His .370 batting average couldn’t prevent the Lions from winning in 7 games. Though the loss was disappointing, Trout’s career was only just beginning.

**2017: WAR - 12.2**

Trout had an even better season than his first, hitting .346 with 43 home runs and 12.2 WAR. He couldn’t win back to back triple crowns, as he was beaten out in RBIs by Rockies legend Wilin Rosario. Trout was the uncontested MVP, but his Wiz unfortunately missed the playoffs. Mike Trout can travel halfway across the world, dominate much inferior competition, and he still can’t play for a winning team.

**2018: WAR - 14.3**

After three years and three MVPs, Mike Trout’s numbers are starting to approach insanity. His second triple crown in three years, he slashed .372/.472/.759 with 53 home runs and 14.3 WAR. He also had a remarkable 40 game hitting streak beginning in August that stretched into September. NC Dinos player Sung-bum Na is the only player who even approaches Trout’s numbers, with 39 homers and 10.1 WAR. Na gets the last laugh, though, as his team downs Trout’s in 7 games in the Korean Series. The Dinos scored 4 runs in the bottom of the 8th to win the deciding game 10-8 and rip Trout’s heart out once again. As a consolation, Trout won series MVP with a .439 average and 5 home runs in the losing effort.

**2019: WAR - 13.7**

In his age 27 season, Trout reached another level on offense, but suffered his first injury. Trout missed the final two weeks of the regular season and the entire playoffs with a fractured thumb. However, he hit a ridiculous .401 with 44 home runs in 127 games to win his third triple crown and fourth MVP. He slashed .401/.531/.803 for an OPS of 1.334, a number that would be 6th in MLB history, bested by only three Bonds and two Ruth seasons. Oh, and with Trout on the disabled list, his KT Wiz won the Korean Series in five games. With only one season before free agency, this upcoming year is a big one for our hero.

**2020: WAR - 6.6**

A testament to his abilities, Trout played in only 73 of his team’s 144 games due to three different injuries, and he still managed to lead the league in WAR without coming close to qualifying for the batting title. His team struggled without him and finished 8th out of 10 teams in the league. The writers still voted him MVP, and Sung-bum Na was forced to settle for second for the 4th year in a row.
In the ultimate Kevin Durant move, Trout signed a 6 year 8.7 million dollar contract with his rival Na’s NC Dinos. Trout joins the team that has won three of the past four championships with the second and third best hitters in the league: Na and our old friend Eric Thames.

**2021: WAR - 10.1**

Trout puts up the lowest WAR in a full season of his career, largely due to the fact that he is inexplicably playing designated hitter. He won his fourth triple crown and sixth consecutive MVP on the back of a .350/.468/.718 slash line and 50 home runs. The Dinos unsurprisingly swept the Korean Series, with Trout being named MVP. He turned 30 during this season, and to this point, he has hit .357, averaging 14.0 Wins above replacement per 162 games. He’s pretty good.

**2022: WAR - 11.2**

Trout has one of his best offensive seasons yet, slashing .362/.504/.763 with 48 home runs, winning his 7th MVP and 5th triple crown. His WAR took a hit from the lack of playing a position in the field, but his 1.267 OPS is his second best. He set a career high in extra base hits with 97. For the second year in a row, Trout finishes with 666 plate appearances, further solidifying my theory that he sold his soul to the devil in exchange for his baseball talents. Unfortunately, his Dinos were upset in the semifinals by the Gwangju Kia Tigers (named after the car company). The Dinos obviously felt the loss of first baseman Eric Thames, who signed as a free agent with Mike Trout’s former team, the Wiz. Trout’s teammate Sung-bum Na put up another 7.5 win season, finishing  second in MVP voting for the 6th consecutive year.

**2023: WAR - 11.7**

Trout’s career WAR now sits above 90 after only 8 seasons. It is now a given that he will win the triple crown, as he does so for the sixth time in eight MVP seasons. He also leads the league for the first time with 50 doubles, crushing his previous career high of 39 set last year. His Dinos finish 100-44, cruising to their 5th title in the past 7 years. Teammate Sung-bum Na finishes second in MVP voting for the seventh straight season, and at age 34, 2 years older than Trout, his chances at an award may be few. Eric Thames has retired, leaving behind a whopping 156 WRC+, a top 20 all time number in the MLB. Trout’s 217, meaning he is 217% as good as the average hitter, is by far the best of all time.

**2024: WAR - 13.6**

Trout returned to playing center field full time and posted his highest WAR in five seasons, despite missing a week with a hand injury. He slashed .376/.498/.736 to win his 9th MVP, but he could not win the triple crown. His team sweeps through the playoffs, and Trout has another ring to add to his collection. He is a career .360 hitter with 384 home runs and 104 WAR in only 8.5 seasons and showing no signs of slowing down.

**2025: WAR - 11.7**

Even though he has proven to be more than capable in the outfield, Trout’s manager decided to move him back to DH for the 2025 season for some reason. He had the type of season that’s begun to be expected of him, with a 1.225 OPS and a career high 54 home runs including his 400th. Trout becomes a free agent following the upcoming season. He has won the championship in four of his five seasons with the Dinos, but the 10-time defending MVP may choose to chase a large contract elsewhere.

**2026: WAR - 11.3**

Back in centerfield, the 35 year old Trout may be beginning to show signs of slowing down. Though he hit .351 and won his 8th triple crown, Trout’s 1.110 OPS was his lowest since his first season in Korea. He also won his 4th straight and 6th overall Korean Series, as the Lotte Giants blew a 3-1 lead, and the Dinos won Game 7 on a walk off double by Min-kook Kang, who hit a whopping .212 in the regular season.
In the offseason, Trout signed a 3 year, $3.5 million contract with the Seoul LG Twins, a team sponsored by one of the country’s largest electronics manufacturers.

**2027: WAR - 10.2**

Despite missing nearly 40 games with an array of injuries, Trout had another phenomenal season, putting up a slash line of .359/.502/.698 and over 10 WAR in a season in which he barely played 100 games. He had his 2000th career hit in June and his 500th career home run in July.

**2028: WAR - 14.4**

When many thought his career was entering its twilight, Trout put up the best season he has ever had. Hitting .396 with 54 home runs, Trout at ages 36 and 37 had a higher WAR than in any season thus far. In the modern era, only 5 men have had a higher OBP in a single season than Trout’s career value of .492. Trout won his 13th MVP, 9th triple crown, and 7th ring as his Twins won in 7 games. In other words, he is the greatest baseball player this world has ever seen.

**2029: WAR - 3.6**

It was a lost year for Trout. Ravaged by several injuries, he hit below .300 for the first time in his career. For the first time ever, he failed to win MVP. The award instead went to Min-su Lee, who led the league with 51 home runs. At age 38 and entering free agency, Trout’s days may be numbered.
In the offseason, Trout chose to remain with the Twins on a two year deal.

**2030: WAR - 2.1**

Trout’s downfall was as quick as his rise. Missing 30 games due to injury, he had the worst WAR of his career, largely due to his diminished skills in the field. Though he still had an OBP of .430, Trout was all around the worst he has ever been, failing to win MVP for the second season in a row. Rival and former teammate Sung-bum Na retired following the season. Na finished second behind Trout in MVP voting 7 seasons in a row from 2017 to 2023.

**2031: WAR - 4.1**

Now 40, Trout is a shadow of the player he formerly was. He still led the league in OBP, as he has done in every season in which he has qualified, but he hit only .260. He hit his 600th career home run in late July, but he failed to hit another over the rest of the season. Still valuable but no longer elite, Mike Trout hopes to play a few more seasons in the Korean Baseball Organization, as long as his body holds up.

**2032: WAR - 6.7**

Defying the odds, Trout continues to be a solid contributor past the age of 40. It shouldn’t be too surprising, since many former major leaguers such as Julio Franco and Manny Ramirez have come to Asia and found success playing against weaker competition. In the offseason, Trout signed a 1 year deal with his former team, the NC Dinos, who won 5 championships in Trout’s six seasons with them. In 2032, Trout proved he could still hit, leading the league with a .448 OBP and winning his 13th Korean Silver Slugger. His Dinos were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs, but Trout has proven he is not done yet.

**2033: WAR - 2.5**

41 years old on Opening Day, Mike Trout signed a 2 year deal with the defending champion Nexen Heroes. He had the worst season of his career, batting .225 with 8 home runs and 163 strikeouts. He continues to get on base in his old age, reaching at a .415 clip. This is the first season in Trout’s career in which he does not lead the league in that category; he finishes second behind Min-su Lee, whose batting average was 110 points higher. Though he struggles, Trout remains a positive contributor, and he plans to suit up for at least one more season.

**2034: WAR - 3.9**

Trout had a bit of a bounce back season at the plate, leading the majors with a .432 on base percentage. Despite his 131 wRC+ in nearly a full season, Trout drove in only 31 runs for the 4th place Heroes, due to the fact that he only had 23 extra base hits. A 43 year old free agent and on base machine, Trout hopes to be able to sign another major league contract. Meanwhile, Sung-bum Na was inducted into the Hall of Fame with 95% of the votes and zero MVPs.

**2035: WAR - 0.9**

It took 20 seasons, but Mike Trout is officially washed up. After signing a deal with the Doosan Bears, Trout produced a WAR below 1 and a pathetic .613 OPS, slugging an impressively bad .262. He led the league in walks once again with 97, but he also led in strikeouts with 193, which translates to a Mark Reynolds-esque 217 in a 162 game season. In an otherwise awful season, there was celebration as Trout recorded his 3000th career hit in September. His personality characteristic is listed as “Never satisfied with his performance,” and in that vein, the Millville Meteor returns for a 21st season in Korea.

**2036: WAR - 1.7**

Trout returned to the NC Dinos for a third stint with the team with which he won 5 rings. He improved slightly at the plate, posting an OBP of .361 and a league leading 108 walks. His 11 home runs were his highest in 4 years. However, he batted .207 and slugged .303, lowering his career average to .322. Against all odds, Korea’s GOAT decides to push off retirement another year and return for another season.

**2037: WAR - 1.1**

Trout limped to the finish line as a member of the Kia Tigers with a career low .183 batting average. The only reason he was above replacement level was because of his league leading 118 walks. Trout’s slugging percentage was .255, which is incomprehensibly bad, especially for a 13 time MVP. 46 years old and with his best years a decade behind him, Mike Trout retires from Korean professional baseball.

So what did we learn from this exercise? We learned that Mike Trout would be pretty good if he played in Korea. The best ever, in fact. He won 7 rings and 13 MVPs and played well into his 40s.
Here are some of his career numbers:

Seasons: 22 (19 full)

Hits: 3191

Walks: 2472 (Led the league every season)

Batting Average: .316 (Career high .401)

OBP: .458 (Career high .533)

Home Runs: 651 (Career high 54)

wRC+ 181 (Career high 249)

WAR: 178.4 (Career high 14.4)

MVPs: 13

Triple Crowns: 9

Championships: 7

Gold Gloves: 2

Trout took advantage of the relatively weak pitching in the league, and became the best hitter of all time. If we've learned anything from this experiment, it's that Mike Trout is wasting his talents in Americs.",baseball,1016

# World Trade Center - Flights 11 and 175

## WTC 7
World Trade Center Building 7 was a 47-storey, fireproofed, steel-frame building completed in 1987. On 9/11 2001, it was hit by debris from the North Tower WTC 1 collapse at 10:28 AM. The official government narrative claims that this debris ignited fires that burned for several hours and weakened WTC 7 until it collapsed at 5:20 PM. This narrative has been doubted by skeptics who have studied the collapse -- notably the 2,800+ Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth (AE911). Noting the sudden initiation of the collapse, the complete destruction of the building, the lack of structural resistance, freefall speed, and symmetrical fall into its own footprint, AE911 insists WTC 7 was brought down via controlled demolition.

## Government's Inaccurate WTC 7 Collapse ""Simulation""
The 2004 9/11 Commission Report did not mention WTC 7. After complaints from architects and engineers about this anomalous collapse being swept under the rug, the US Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) began a formal WTC 7 study, initially attempting to blame internal diesel tank fires and denying freefall collapse speed. However, with AE911 Truth pointing out calculations of freefall speeds from video, and that diesel fires could be ruled out by lack of smoke, NIST was forced to concede on both of these points before their final 2008 WTC 7 report.

Still, NIST officially claimed that WTC 7 collapsed **""primarily from normal office fires.""** By ignoring sheer studs and other structural components of this modern steel-frame building, NIST concluded that the failure of column #79 somehow initiated a sudden universal ""progressive collapse.""

Here is NIST's computer model of the initiation of collapse alongside video of the actual collapse. Does it match?

Video: https://youtu.be/pmdcMb5D9gM

AE911 Truth asked to see the data behind this simulation to understand how NIST reached their conclusions. Their request was denied because it might ""jeopardize public safety.""

## Larry ""Pull it"" Silverstein 
Owner of the WTC buildings Larry Silverstein says that he decided loss of life in WTC 7 was so heavy that he should just ""pull it."" Whatever that means!

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p34XrI2Fm6I

Silverstein built and owned WTC 7 since 1985, and acquired the WTC towers in July 2001. After 9/11, he fought in court for a double insurance payment, claiming there were two terrorist ""occurrences."" He didn't win the $7.1 billion double payment he was hoping for, but he was awarded for 1 &amp; 1/3: a payout of $4.55 billion. 

Other interesting statements by Silverstein: 

- his wife thankfully reminded him of his dermatology appointment on 9/11 and insisted he go, making him skip his customary breakfast at the top of WTC 1 that morning: https://youtu.be/9ScGZCqEyGM

- Regarding the new replacement building for WTC 7, ""the first design meeting was in April of 2000."" ... 17 months before it was destroyed?: https://youtu.be/j-_WYHwUtcI?t=28

## What Was In WTC 7?
WTC 7 consisted exclusively of government agencies and financial institutions, including the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management, as well as Secret Service and CIA offices.

http://www.wtc7.net/background.html

## Previous High-Rise Fires
Before and since 9/11, no steel-framed high-rise buildings have ever collapsed from office fires. We are told that on that day, three did: WTC towers 1, 2, and building 7.

Past examples:

*1991, Philadelphia, PA – One Meridian Plaza* burned for 18 hours, gutting 8 of 38 floors. A FEMA report said ""beams and girders sagged and twisted,"" but ""continued to support their loads without obvious damage."" 

*2004, Caracas, Venezuela – Parque Central* building burned for 17 hours, gutting 20 of 50 floors. It did not collapse.

A segment on previous high-rise fires: https://youtu.be/l0Q5eZhCPuc?t=746

A 9 minute video, Steel Buildings Don't Collapse From Fire: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnnjIzamnJo

Of course, WTC 7 was hit by debris, which did some damage. Also, WTC 1 and 2 were hit by airplanes, but they withstood those impacts well, like they were designed to.

## 1993 Seattle Times Article, ""Twin Towers Engineered to Withstand Jet Collision”
John Skilling, WTC head structural engineer: 

&gt; Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel (from the airplane) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire. A lot of people would be killed… The building structure would still be there.

Full article: http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930227&amp;slug=1687698

## January 2001 Interview with WTC Construction Manager
WTC Construction Manager Frank DeMartini:

&gt; The building was designed to have a fully loaded 707 crash into it. That was the largest plane at the time. I believe that the building probably could sustain multiple impacts of jetliners because this structure is like the mosquito netting on your screen door—this intense grid—and the jet plane is just a pencil puncturing that screen netting. It really does nothing to the screen netting.

Video of interview: https://youtu.be/1pvEge5HPJU

Note: The Boeing 707 and 767 aren't ""apples and oranges"", see the stats compared here: http://www1.ae911truth.org/faqs/655-faq-9-were-the-twin-towers-designed-to-survive-the-impact-of-the-airplanes.html

Frank DeMartini died in the towers on 9/11.

## Aman Zafar Photoset
Aman Zafar took hi-res photos on 9/11 from a distance across the Hudson River -- some of the best photographic evidence from that day. They show pretty clearly how undamaged the lower 90ish and 75ish floors of the towers were. Were these massive marvels of modern architecture really so fragile that one to two hours of fires fuelled by office furnishings and jet fuel (essentially kerosene) in the top floors was enough to suddenly reduce thousands of tons of structural steel and concrete into clouds of dust and a pile of debris barely taller than the lobby?

Note the upward and outward ejections of debris. Could fire and gravity do that?

Photoset: http://www.amanzafar.com/WTC/

## Fire and Steel Temperature
Even if we're generous and claim the fires burned as hot as 1500°F (which is unlikely -- though NIST claims 1800°F), they would have to heat thousands of tons of structural steel beams to at least 1000°F for significant weakening. These beams would be fireproofed and would meet building codes created to protect against fires. Is it plausible that fires could do this to the buildings in just 56 minutes in the case of WTC 2 and 1 hour and 42 minutes for WTC 1?

## Fire Department Tapes
The tapes of FDNY comms show firefighters ascending the stairwell of the South Tower WTC 2 and dealing with ""two isolated pockets of fires"" at the 78th floor. They are convinced they ""should be able to knock it down with two lines."" The firefighters have no concern about collapse, even to the last minute. This doesn't sound like they are discussing a building with 1000°F raging fires burning so intensely throughout that they could have heated the beams on every floor -- in an under an hour -- to weaken them enough to initiate an immediate total collapse with negligible structural resistance.

## WTC 7 Collapse Foreknowledge
### Firefighter Foreknowledge
At least 60 firefighters demonstrated foreknowledge of the collapse of WTC 7 at 5:20PM. More than half of them spoke in certain terms (i.e. “*is* coming down” vs “might”). Considering no steel high-rise building in history had ever collapsed from fires (except the Twin Towers that morning), how were they so certain that this modern, 1987, 47-story, fireproofed steel-frame building would collapse? It seems they may have been told by somebody. 

Graeme MacQueen has looked into this a bit:

With ReThink911: https://youtu.be/rNJ6WYFwR-o

### News Foreknowledge
Jane Standley of BBC reported on the collapse of WTC 7 (AKA the Soloman Brother's Building) at 4:54 PM -- **26 minutes BEFORE it collapsed**. The building is visibly standing behind her as she reports it has collapsed. BBC ""loses connection"" with her mid-conversation. BBC's official explanation for this was that they received an erroneous report from Reuters on a confusing day. 

Video Clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltP2t9nq9fI


Later, BBC contacts Standley again for a report. She describes the situation but when they bring up WTC 7 (@ 2:12), the audio cuts out. Coincidence?

Video Clip: https://youtu.be/gsqAHhTWEH0?t=40


CNN Report the collapse 67 minutes early:

ABC News: 

&gt; another building in the World Trade Center Complex, which was not struck by an airplane, is in danger of collapsing...

NBC News, reporting upcoming collapse 26 minutes early:

&gt; ""Keep your eye on that building, that thing's comin' down!"" 

&gt; ""The whole thing is about to blow up. Move it back!""

Video Clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU_43SwWD9A


Fox 5 Reports Collapse &lt; 1 min early. After reporting it collapsed, they cut to a live feed, and it comes down live on screen: 

Video Clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDDZANw9isI


Not foreknowledge, but an interesting observation from Dan Rather at CBS: 

&gt;For the third time today. Its reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite.

## PNAC Describes Benefits of ""a New Pearl Harbor"" in 2000
The Project for the New American Century, a neo-conservative think-tank that included many Bush Administration members such as Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and Paul Wolfowitz, wrote a report in September 2000, a year before 9/11, called Rebuilding America's Defenses. It outlined a plan of massive military expansion, with a goal of ultimately fighting and winning ""multiple, simultaneous major theatre wars"" to consolidate US global hegemony.

They stated that their ambitious 

&gt; process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event -- like a new Pearl Harbor.

Full text (see page 51 for quote): http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/pdf/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf 

## Zelikow Describes How US Gov Could Exploit a Major WTC Attack in 1998
Philip Zelikow was a member of George HW Bush's National Security Council during Desert Storm, co-author of a book with Condoleezza Rice in the mid-90s, and would go on to be part of George W Bush's transition team, as well as the author of National Security Strategy 2002 AKA the ""Bush Doctrine"" of pre-emptive warfare. Despite these conflicts of interest, he would become the executive director of the ""independent"" 9/11 Commission.

In 1998 -- nearly three years before 9/11 -- with Defense Department bigwig Ash Carter and former CIA Director John Deutch -- Zelikow co-authored a paper in *Foreign Affairs* entitled ""Catastrophic Terrorism"": 

&gt; If the device that exploded in 1993 under the World Trade Center had been nuclear, or had effectively dispersed a deadly pathogen, the resulting horror and chaos would have exceeded our ability to describe it. Such an act of catastrophic terrorism would be a watershed event in American history. It could involve loss of life and property unprecedented in peacetime and undermine America's fundamental sense of security, as did the Soviet atomic bomb test in 1949. Like Pearl Harbor, this event would divide our past and future into a before and after. The United States might respond with draconian measures, scaling back civil liberties, allowing wider surveillance of citizens, detention of suspects, and use of deadly force. More violence could follow, either further terrorist attacks or U.S. counterattacks. Belatedly, Americans would judge their leaders negligent for not addressing terrorism more urgently.

## Emergency Crew Arrived in NYC For Terror Drill Day Before 9/11
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was holding a terror drill set for 09/12. Personnel arrived in NYC on 09/10.

FEMA Member Tom Kenney on CBS:

&gt; To be honest with you we arrived on late Monday night [Sept 10th] and went into action on Tuesday morning...""

Video: https://youtu.be/5EVIfwYKbM8

Mayor Rudy Giuliani: 

&gt; The reason Pier 92 was chosen as the command center is because on the next day, on September 12th, Pier 92 was going to have a drill. It had hundreds of people here from FEMA, from the federal government, from the state, from the state emergency management  office, and they were getting ready for a drill for a bio-chemical attack... The equipment was already there, so we were able to establish a command center there, within 3 days, that was 2 1/2 to 3 times bigger than the command center that we had lost at 7 World Trade Center.

Video: https://youtu.be/vmPwwd1NdiU 

## Drills Simulating Hijacked Planes Confuse Air Traffic Control
War games diverted much of the Northeast US air defense to Alaska, while other war games simulating hijacked airplanes flying into buildings confused radar operators on 9/11.

Video: http://dai.ly/x26mumq?start=1422

## The Lone Gunmen Pilot 
In March 2001, 6 months before 9/11, the pilot episode of the X-Files spin-off series The Lone Gunmen aired. The premise: the heroes unravel a government conspiracy to fly a commercial airliner into the World Trade Center to increase arms sales.  

Just an odd coincidence? Make of it what you will.

## WTC 7 Evaluation
Structural engineer Dr. Leroy Hulsey and his students at the University of Alaska Fairbanks are in the midst of conclusively debunking the bogus official claims of the NIST report with their two-year WTC 7 Evaluation. Using a sophisticated computer model of WTC 7, down to each beam and rivet, they have concluded that ""normal office fires"" could not have caused the collapse that occurred. Their report will be released August 2017.

# Pentagon - Flight 77

## Official Story
The official story tells us American Airlines Flight 77 was hijacked at 8:51 (5 minutes after the first WTC strike) and, piloted by terrorist Hani Hanjour, flew without being intercepted for 45 minutes. Over the Pentagon, it pulled a high-speed 330-degree turn before knocking over five light poles, accelerating to 853 km/h, skimming above the Pentagon lawn to strike into the first floor of the building at 09:37. 64 died on the plane, 125 in the Pentagon.

## Hani Hanjour's Flying Skills
Pilots say this would be an extremely difficult manoeuvre and would be nearly impossible for an inexperienced pilot like alleged hijacker Hani Hanjour, whose flight instructors said he could barely handle a Cessna weeks earlier in August. 

US Navy Top Gun and 27-year commercial pilot Ralph Kolstad has studied the official flight path and says, 

&gt; I have 6,000 hours of flight time in Boeing 757s and 767s and I could not have flown it the way the flight path was described... Something stinks to high heaven!

Newspaper articles quote Hanjour's flight instructors saying he ""could not fly at all"" and was ""a terrible pilot."" In the summer of 2001, a New Jersey flight instructor ""declined a second request"" to take the alleged would-be hijacker in on a small-plane flight ""because of what he considered Hanjour's poor piloting skills.""

(Quotes from David Ray Griffin's book, The New Pearl Harbor: Revisited)

## Pentagon ""Plane Crash"" Surveillance Video
Although the Pentagon was arguably the most secure building in the world, this is the only publicly available footage of the alleged crash of Flight 77, released almost five years after the incident in May 2006. (A second camera right next to this one captured nearly identical footage that was also released). This footage does not prove that a plane hit the building.

Video: https://youtu.be/zac9vt3a4Ug

## Unmarked Lawn 
Considering the supposed rapid descent to ground level and the low first-floor impact site, it is odd that the plane didn't leave any marks on the Pentagon lawn.

## Lack of Plane Debris
CNN Reporter on 9/11:

&gt; from my close-up inspection, there's no evidence of a plane having crashed anywhere near the Pentagon... The only pieces left that you can see are small enough that you could pick up in your hand. There are no large tail sections, wing sections, fuselage, nothing like that anywhere around which would indicate that the entire plane crashed into the side of the Pentagon...

Interview with April Gallop – A Pentagon employee who experienced the blast and crawled out of the blast hole to the lawn. Gallop says she 

&gt; didn't see any evidence of metal, airplane seats, no luggage. Nothing that would give me any indication that it was a plane that had hit the building... There was nothing on the inside that would give me any indication that there was a plane.

## Gas Station Security Camera Footage Confiscated by FBI 
December 11, 2001 National Geographic Article, ""Three Months On Tension Lingers Near the Pentagon"": A CITGO gas station employee who worked on 9/11 says the gas station's security cameras were close enough to the Pentagon to have recorded the moment of impact: 

&gt; I've never seen what the pictures looked like... The FBI was here within minutes and took the film.
 
Richmond Times-Dispatch Article, 11 Dec 2001: http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/12/1211_wirepentagon.html

## C-Ring ""Punch-Out"" Hole
Alternately described in official government accounts as being created by the nose of the plane or the landing gear, this large round hole was located on the inside of the Pentagon's C-ring, several layers inward from the outer wall. Is this plausible? What really caused this?

## Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta's Testimony
### Dick Cheney's Timeline
Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta testified to the 9/11 Commission about his experience in the Presidential Emergency Operations Center (PEOC) bunker under the White House on 9/11.

Mineta said he arrived in the PEOC bunker at 9:20, and Vice President Cheney was already there at that time.

The 9/11 Commission Report ignored Mineta's testimony and wrote that Cheney arrived 38 minutes later at 9:58 (and thus AFTER the Pentagon attack). Multiple others have also made statements suggesting Cheney was in the bunker earlier.

### Stand-Down Order?
Most importantly, Mineta mentions 
&gt; a young man who would come in and say to the Vice President, 'the plane is 50 miles out'... 'the plane is 30 miles out'... When it got down to 'the plane is 10 miles out,' the young man also said to the Vice President, 'do the orders still stand?' And the Vice President turned and whipped his neck around and said, 'of course the orders still stand! Have you heard anything to the contrary?'

Video: https://youtu.be/qjR0gGXV-04

Were they talking about a stand-down order telling the fighters or anti-air not to engage?

At the very least, while the 9/11 Commission Report attempts to paint a false narrative suggesting US leadership was unaware, confused, and unable to make decisions in time that morning, the facts seem to suggest they had a lot more knowledge and control than is admitted.

### Video Removed From 9/11 Commission Website
Video of Mineta's testimony was originally available on the 9/11 Commission website, but it was removed. When questioned about this the National Archive said it must have been lost in a ""snafu."" It has since been recovered and is now widely available on the internet.

## Wedge 1 an Unlikely Strike Location
Why would the terrorists strike Wedge 1 of the Pentagon? The section directly opposite would have been a much richer target and easier to approach. It was public knowledge that the Defense Secretary's office and the office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and those of other top-ranking officers, were located on the opposite side of the explosion zone.

Instead, Wedge 1 had obstacles on its approach (a raised street with signs, light posts, the Pentagon control tower), and was, according to the LA Times: 

&gt; a portion of the building that had already been renovated. It was the only area of the Pentagon with a sprinkler system, and it had been reconstructed with a web of steel columns and bars to withstand bomb blasts. The steel reinforcement, bolted together to form a continuous structure through all of the Pentagon's five floors, kept that section of the building from collapsing for 30 minutes--enough time for hundreds of people to crawl out to safety.

&gt; The area struck by the plane also had blast-resistant windows--2 inches thick and 2,500 pounds each--that stayed intact during the crash and fire. It had fire doors that opened automatically and newly built exits that allowed people to get out... While perhaps 4,500 people normally would have been working in the hardest-hit areas, because of the renovation work only about 800 were there Tuesday, officials said.

Is this the spot terrorists would have chosen to strike?

## Citizen Investigation Team's (CIT) Study
With a series of straightforward interviews with 13 independent eyewitnesses of the low-flying plane at the Pentagon on 9/11, who are certain about what they saw, Citizen Investigation Team demonstrates that the government's oft-repeated official story of a southern Flight 77 approach was impossible. All 13 witnesses -- including two police officers -- are sure the plane flew directly over the Navy Annex and **North** of the CITGO gas station. This suggests the official flight path is false, and the knocked over light poles on the bridge south of the Pentagon and the path of internal damage were staged. 

Images of CIT Witness Flightpaths vs. Official Story:

In the section from 59:40 to 01:13:30 in the video ""National Security Alert"" below, CIT interviews a cab driver, Lloyde England, whose cab was supposedly hit by a light pole knocked over by Flight 77 during its approach along the official-story southern flight path. Featured on the news, his cab windshield was smashed but his hood was oddly undamaged considering the forces at play. After persistent questioning by CIT, England eventually **admits his role in a conspiracy to stage the incident**: 

&gt; This is too big for me, man. This is a big thing... I'm not supposed to be involved in this. This is for other people. People who have money... **It was planned**.

# Shanksville, PA - Flight 93

## Barren Crash Site
Many witnesses remarked on the lack of debris at the Shanksville crash site. Like the Pentagon, there were no bodies, no identifiable pieces of fuselage, wing, or tail section, no luggage, or seats visible at Shanksville. News mentions a second crash site, 6 miles away, adding to the confusion.

Video: http://dai.ly/x26mumq?start=3981

## Flight 93 Shot Down?
Witness John Fleegle mentions he saw the lights flicker, then heard engines roar, heard a large boom and saw a ""big ball of fire"" in the air. 

He saw a plane flying away that might have been a fighter, but it was flying into the sun and difficult to see.

Later he told his story to a retired Air Force member who suggested: 

&gt; that plane was shot down... they zap the radar frequency on everything before they shoot. That's why your lights flickered.""

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWcdSyyppHI

Furthermore, while the 9/11 Commission Report claims that shootdown authorization was not received until 10:25 -- well after the crash of Flight 93 at 10:03 - 10:06 -- other accounts dispute this. 

National Coordinator for Security and Counter-terrorism Richard Clarke wrote that shoot-down authorization was received between 9:45 and 9:50, and a CNN report that aired before the Commission Report was released suggested a similar timeline. 

(The official story is that the passengers, inspired by passenger Todd Beamer's phrase ""let's roll"", stormed the cockpit and attempted to reclaim the aircraft before the hijackers drove it into the ground.)

## Debris Photos
There are some pictures of supposed Flight 93 debris that were released during the 2006 trial of Zacarias Moussaoui. They don't look very convincing of a plane crash either.

Photos: https://www.nps.gov/media/photo/gallery.htm?id=C7A45234-155D-451F-67A019C294E6A905

A lot of the 9/11 evidence released during the 2006 Moussaoui trial is sketchy, nonsensical, or contradictory to previously touted official storylines.

# 9/11 Commission

## Commission Delayed
Historically, when major disasters have occurred, governments have quickly created independent commissions to investigate.

formed:


 Titanic – 6


 Pearl Harbor – 9


 JFK Assassination – 7


 Challenger disaster – 7


 **9/11 – 411**


## Barry Zwicker's Criticism
Media Critic Barry Zwicker, author of Towers of Deception, on the 9/11 Commission: 

&gt; the term 'whitewash' doesn't do justice to the report of the 9/11 Commission. 'Omission-riddled inventive cover-up,' maybe.

## Executive Director Philip Zelikow
The widows of 9/11 victims complained publicly after the Bush administration appointed Henry Kissinger as the 9/11 Commission Director. Kissinger was replaced with Philip Zelikow, a man with many conflicts of interest. This video explains Zelikow's deep connections to Bush and how he was a key member of the 9/11 cover-up.

## Indira Singh and Ptech
Indira Singh was senior risk management consultant at JP Morgan Chase bank in 2001. She was seeking to equip the bank with enterprise architect software that would provide ""god's eye"" visualization, mapping, and analysis of transactions, interactions, systems, processes, and personnel in the bank. Many recommended a small Quincy, MA company called Ptech. Their list of clients included the White House, Secret Service, FBI, IRS, NATO, IBM, the Postal Service, and the FAA.

However, Singh became reluctant to use their software when she discovered that Ptech's top investor was Saudi Al-Qaeda financier Yassin Al-Qadi, who had been placed on the US terror list in October 2001. Singh's research further linked Ptech to the CIA network that armed the Mujahideen in the 80s. When she told the FBI, they weren't particularly alarmed. In fact, they even actively blocked an investigation against Al-Qadi.

Ptech's relationship with the FAA is particularly interesting. 

&gt; *Bonnie*: Could you describe the relationship of PTech with the FAA? PTech worked with the FAA for several years, didn’t they?

&gt; *Indira*: Yes... They were looking at, basically, holes in the **FAA’s interoperability with responding with other agencies** – law enforcement – in the case of an emergency such as a hijacking.

&gt; ... how they would respond in case of an emergency... **if anyone was in a position to understand where the holes were, PTech was, and that is exactly the point: if anybody was in a position to write software to take advantage of those holes, it would have been PTech.**

&gt; *Bonnie*: Was there a reference to PTech having **operated in the basement out of the FAA?**

&gt; *Indira*: Yes. Typically, because the scope of such projects are so over-arching and wide-ranging, when you are doing an enterprise architecture project, you have access to how anything in the organization is being done, where it is being done, on what systems, what the information is. You have carte blanche.

&gt; If it is a major project that spends several years, the team that comes in has, **literally, access to almost anything that they want** because you are operating on a blueprint level, on a massive scale. So, yes, they were everywhere, and I was told that **they were in places that required clearances**. I was told that they had log-on access to FAA flight control computers.

## FBI Agent Robert Wright's Investigation Into Al-Qaeda Financier Al-Qadi Impeded
&gt; In the mid-1990s... two Chicago-based agents were assigned to track a connection to Chicago, a suspected terrorist cell that would later lead them to a link with Osama bin Laden. Wright says that **when he pressed for authorization to open a criminal investigation into the money trail, his supervisor stopped him**.
 
&gt;""**Do you know what his response was? 'I think it's just better to let sleeping dogs lie,'**"" said Wright. ""Those dogs weren't sleeping. They were training. They were getting ready."" ...
 
&gt;The suspected terrorist cell in Chicago was the basis of the investigation, yet Wright, who remains with the FBI, says he soon discovered that all the FBI intelligence division wanted him to do was to follow suspected terrorists and file reports — but make no arrests.
 
&gt;""The supervisor who was there from headquarters was right straight across from me and **started yelling at me: 'You will not open criminal investigations. I forbid any of you. You will not open criminal investigations against any of these intelligence subjects,'""** Wright said.
 
&gt;Even though they were on a terrorism task force and said they had proof of criminal activity, Wright said he was told not to pursue the matter.
 
&gt;In 1998 al Qaeda terrorists bombed two American embassies in Africa. The agents say some of the money for the attacks led back to the people they had been tracking in Chicago and to a **powerful Saudi Arabian businessman, Yassin al-Kadi**. Al-Kadi is one of 12 Saudi businessmen **suspected of funneling millions of dollars to al Qaeda and who had extensive business and financial ties in Chicago.**
 
&gt;Yet, even after the bombings, Wright said FBI headquarters wanted no arrests.

# A Warning From History - President Eisenhower 1961

17 January 1961, in his presidential farewell address, Dwight D. Eisenhower decided to warn the American people about the potential dangers of the military-industrial complex. Considering the state of the country since 9/11, his words are more important than ever. 

&gt;We have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, 3 and 1/2 million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. 

&gt;Now, this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience.
The total influence: economic, political, even spiritual, is felt in every city, every statehouse, every office of the federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development, yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. 

&gt;Our toil, resources, and livelihood, are all involved. So is the very structure of our society. 

&gt;**In the counsels of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence -- whether sought or unsought -- by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes.
We should take nothing for granted.**

&gt;**Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals.** So that security and liberty may prosper together.

Hooligan8,2017-06-22 08:55:49+00:00,Airplane ettiquete breached,"TLDR: something about Crimea

Background: 

My grandfather is turning 85 this weekend so I'm flying from Seattle to New Jersey on a red eye so I can go to his birthday party and see my extended family. Normally I fly Alaska and book my own flights always choosing seats in emptier rows  in the back of the plane, but since my dad generously bought my ticket home for me this time, I ended up on a United flight (thankfully I am neither a doctor nor a guitar)

 Unfortunately, I ended up in the aisle seat of the worst possible row - the one directly in front of the emergency exit row. This row never reclines because in case there is an emergency evacuation of the plane, they don't want to have a bunch of chairs leaned way back blocking the exit in any way.

 Frustratingly, I only discovered this about 30 minutes into the 5 hour flight after spending a couple minutes fiddling with with impotent recline button. To make matters slightly more irritating, the flight was cranked up to an uncomfortable warm temperature (to lull the passengers to sleep?). Lastly, it's worth mentioning that I'm 6'3"" and about 180lbs and while I'm not fat, I do have fairly broad shoulders so I don't fit into airplane seats perfectly. In summation, the flight was already mildly uncomfortable before the story starts in earnest.

The slight:

I was seated next to a tiny girl about my age (mid 20s). When we sat down and settled in, we exchanged the traditional travelers' nod of recognition then proceeded to politely ignore each other by escaping into my music and her Sudoku. 

Fast forward about 30 minutes, shortly after discovering that we were in the nightmare row, I noticed the arm rest between me and the middle seat was raised to about 45 degrees. Unsure of how it got there, I lowered it and went back to stewing over how uncomfortable this flight was shaping up to be. A minute later I noticed it was up to the same spot again. I realized that my neighbor probably wanted it up so I raised it all the way up only for her to instantly bring it back to it's halfway up position. 

She then told me matter of factly that she put it there so that my shoulder didn't extend past my seat.  Now I'm no savage, I recognize that the middle seat is entitled to the *use* of two arm rests to make up for being boxed in but this misuse of the armrest felt a bit over the top. 

I recognize some people might disagree with me on this point, but in my opinion, positioning the armrest to wall out your neighbors is a dick move. You get the surface of the armrest, not the armrest *and* all the air space above and around it. What's more, this girl didn't even have the courtesy to give me a heads up that I was encroaching on her space or even acknowledge what she was doing until the 3rd time she did it. It felt like my own personal Crimea, and it, in addition to the other mild inconveniences of the flight, had me feeling some type of way.

Revenge:

I'm not one for direct confrontation with strangers in potentially  awkward  scenarios.

I contemplated releasing some silent farts in her general direction, but the potential for friendly fire and collateral damage to innocent passengers was far too high.

Instead I waited until we landed and started to deplane to raise the arm rest all the way and start to type this post. 

She's already standing up in her seat, antsy to get off the plane, clearly irritated that I'm still buckled in and tapping away with my headphones in. I plan on letting a couple rows behind us get out before I let her out. Build an armrest wall? Feel the wrath of row 15's aisle gatekeeper.

Post Script:

I'm sorry for subjecting you to my revenge, window seat girl. The quest for revenge is not always a righteous one.

--------------------------

Edit:

On an unrelated note, TIL some people have really strong opinions about whether or not reclining your seat on an airplane makes you human trash. I didn't realize it was such a hot button issue and I look forward to the Supreme Court's official ruling on the subject.",pettyrevenge,1846

Cymoril_Melnibone,2017-06-11 18:31:31+00:00,The Most Beautiful Graveyard,"Almost every place is famous for something.  
Some have grand landmarks that are known world-wide, that grant their locations a form of immortality; the Eiffel Tower, the Seattle Space Needle. Others are more low-key; the oldest wooden building in the country, the greatest number of bridges.  
And then you get the downright ridiculous – usually in small places, ‘famous’ for growing the biggest carrot on record, or having a town clock shaped like a fish.  
Our town, although certainly small, is not in that last category, our claim to fame more saturnine than most. You see, we have something that is unusual, beautiful and macabre all at once, making our notable feature perhaps the most unique of all.  
We have the most beautiful graveyard.

&amp;nbsp;  
I’m sure some people would dispute our claim, but if they do, I’d guess they haven’t seen the graveyard. It nestles in a small valley between two low hills, a deep, cold stream burbling along the west side, banks lined with weeping willows. They droop like perpetual mourners, trailing their slender, blossoming fingers in the current that carries their tiny seeds downstream.  
Poplars grow on the hills, tall and proud compared to the layered wicker-work of willows; but it isn’t the trees, the stream or the vibrant green grass that make our graveyard special.  
It’s the statues.  
Two of them flank the thick granite wall that faces the road, each guarding their side of the wrought iron gates. On the right stands an angel, and on the left, a demon, their fingers touching to form an arch, like a perversion of *The Creation of Adam*.  
To describe them as exquisite doesn’t even begin to give them their due. Both are so beautifully carved that it’s hard to say which captures your heart more. The angel is softer, cherubic and boyish, but the demon is a *man*, with an aquiline nose and high cheekbones – like a conquering Greek god of old. The detail and realism is such that at any moment you expect them to stir; to draw breath and turn, the angel full of love and kindly advice, and the demon beckoning to tempt you to explore your darkest desires.  The first time I fell in love, I was but a child, and it was with one of the two cemetery sentinels. I won’t tell you which.  
But the wonder didn’t stop there.  
Almost every grave was marked by a statue, each as beautifully detailed as the guardians. Here stands a farmer with a calloused hand shading his eyes, looking to the horizon to check on the weather as he toils forever in the field with a mattock in hand. The moment is so perfectly captured that you can *feel* what his next move would be, and you expect ruddy colour to flood back into his pale stone cheeks at any second.  
Row upon row they stand, people caught so exquisitely by the sculptor’s chisel that it almost defies belief. When people come to visit the dead, they often weep openly and touch the stone faces of their loved ones, drawing comfort from the fact that something so eternal remains. It’s a very tangible kind of immortality; their father or sister or child will never *truly* be gone while the stone effigies stand.  
But not only that; for people like myself who never met their grandparents, it’s a timeless record. I know *exactly* what my grandfather looked like, saluting the rising sun in his army uniform, the creases in his pants and shirt still as sharp as if ironed yesterday. I can read the determination and courage writ over those handsome features, and even the faintest hint of fear – fear that he’d never return home to his family.  As a child, I once held his cold stone hand in my warm one, to comfort him, to let him know that in a very real way, he came back to us; that eighty years later he was still here.  
Those leaf-strewn pathways traverse time itself, going all the way back to the founding of the town. I can walk amongst my frozen ancestors, seeing how much of them was in me, comparing my face to theirs and marvelling at the magical skills of the people who had carved them.  
But there are some citizens who are missing. There are no statues of the artists themselves, for they have their own private graveyard.

&amp;nbsp;  
The house that belonged to the artists was a staid looking manor, unusual for our region, of the sort that wouldn’t be out of place in a Southern US period drama. On the rare occasions we drove past it when I was young, I would conjure visions of sad-eyed African maids bringing iced tea to some white-clad plantation owner, sitting in the shade and twirling a silver-topped walking cane as he squinted over his fields.  
It had been built not long after the town was founded; the Costas family moving in and immediately beginning to blast out the quarry that would become the foundations of smalltown wealth. My own family had no such illustrious claim to fame, little more than traders who had set down here, some two hundred years ago. The only things we were known for were our olive-tinted complexion and a familial propensity for producing multiple births. I was myself one third of triplets, absolutely identical to my sisters in every way. We even shared the same birthmark – a smear of biological pigment on the curve of our left hip – and we each had a single crooked front tooth, making it hard for even our own mother to tell us apart.  
Growing up, we became weary of hearing all the urban myths and half-truths about identical siblings; that they often developed their own dialect, that they could finish one another’s sentences. *We* had no such commonality, often finding each other mildly intolerable to downright irritating. Strangers would joke about how we could cause such trouble if we wanted to, or how formidable a team we would make against bullies, but the truth of the matter was that we were more likely to sell each other out than anyone else, should it be to our own advantage.  We determinedly fostered our differences rather than exploiting our obvious similarities.  
But we *did* love each other – and fiercely. We just weren’t practically symbiotes like the fabled siblings in all those documentaries and clickbaity articles.  
And when the eldest-by-one-minute, Sarah, died unexpectedly during an unseasonably cold winter, my remaining sister and I were inconsolable. I’d have sold my soul to bring her back.  

&amp;nbsp;  
Anabel and I clung to each other as Sarah’s casket was lowered into the freshly turned earth of the graveyard, the stalwart presence of all the family statues surrounding us. Though nobody said it, we all knew what the other families were thinking – there were still two of us left, so it wasn’t as big a tragedy as if a child from a singular birth had died.  
And I wanted someone to *say it*, so I could scream in their face that they were a monster for speaking such a thing; that we weren’t each one third of a whole person, we were people *in our own right*. But they kept their traps shut, so I just grew angrier and angrier, the impotent rage simmering inside my tiny frame, as pink roses thudded soft and oddly insincere onto the equally tiny coffin of our departed sister.  
Her statue would not appear for another month or so, not until the artist resident at the Costas manor had finished carving it. He was present at the funeral, as he always was when someone local died, his wide-brimmed black hat and heavy black coat the only clothes I’d ever seen him in. Below the hat he wore mirrored aviators, masking his eyes, and within the neat margins of a spade-point goatee nested a grim, downturned mouth. When he removed his hand from a coat pocket to push the glasses back up the bridge of his nose, I marvelled at how long, supple and dextrous those digits were.  
The hands of a true artist, bred from generations of artists.  
Of those artists, he was the only one who still graced the town. It was rumoured that his elderly father and mother still crept about like revenants in the austere manor, but all the others had long passed, their immortality preserved by their own peerless statues hidden away somewhere in that ancient demesne.   
That he had no wife and children was a cause for speculation and concern amongst the townsfolk. But it wasn’t that anyone truly cared about the peculiar introvert as a person; they were all worried for the future of their graveyard. Dozens – if not hundreds – of attempts to set him up with a wife had failed, leading many to gossip that he did not care for women, and that the talents unique to the Costas family line would die with him.  
It hit me, standing by Sarah’s open grave and watching him, that most of the children in our town would outlive him. My own statue would likely never grace the eerie tableau of the perfectly copied dead, and that meant I would never stand by my sister’s side again.  
Deep and ineffable sadness stole my rage, and I felt cast adrift in time.  

&amp;nbsp;  
The death of Anabel, six months later, hit the family hard.  
But none took it harder than me.  
After Sarah’s death, we’d grown much closer – in a deeply unhealthy sort of way, which prompted our parents to broach the prospect of medication and counselling. Anabel was the only other person who truly *understood*, the only other person who was just as disturbed as I was by the statue over Sarah’s grave, albeit for different reasons.  
“It’s like looking at your own death,” she had whispered, not two weeks before her heart failed in the dead of night, in the bed across the room from mine.  
Finding your twin cold and lifeless feels like drowning.  
Every aspect of my life suffered, from my school work to my hygiene. Everything was pointless and grey. I didn’t leave my room much, and plates of barely-touched food piled up next to my bed as my mother indulged my need for solitude. I’d lie in bed, staring at the space where Anabel had slept, where her last breath had floated into the night. She had always been afraid of the dark.  I became terrified of going to sleep in case my pulse ground to a thready halt while I lay there, unconscious.  
Nine weeks later, it was time to unveil her statue.  
My feelings tumbled over each other like willow pods in the current, standing there looking up at the twin statues of my sisters, forever beside each other. Sarah’s stone eyes rested on the weeping trees near the water’s edge, one hand hanging loose at her side, as though about to rise and point out a sparrow making a nest or a duck diving for nymphs. Anabel looked toward the chiselled guardians of the graveyard, her expression vaguely uneasy, her perpetual nervous smile caught so perfectly that it stole my breath. She’d always said the angel and demon creeped her out.  
Mikhail Costas folded away the black cloth that had covered Anabel’s statue, his white, delicate hands juxtaposed starkly against the fabric. Now as always, he wore those huge aviator glasses, as though he didn’t want anyone to see his eyes.  
*Something* niggled at my awareness, a kind of half-remembered story or legend, something from my childhood. I chased it into the vault of my thoughts, but it eluded me, stuck somewhere behind my eyes in the murk of memory. I stayed on after everyone else left, pulling myself up onto the stone plinth and closely inspecting the statues of my sisters, as though their unyielding stone presence, their newly-minted immortal wisdom, could somehow turn the key in my mind.  
How Mikhail had captured the essence of each girl so perfectly I couldn’t fathom. He’d never even spoken to us, let alone been introduced to us. Even with the most perfect artist’s eye, it should have been *impossible* for him to have created such flawless simulacra.  
And when I noticed an almost invisible cut mark through the new-grown turf over Anabel’s grave, I knew something was deeply and horribly wrong.  

&amp;nbsp;  
I should have told someone what I found, but I wanted to be *sure* that what I suspected was true. Looking through archived newspaper articles gave me purpose back, and my first clue. Every unveiling of every statue had been recorded in photograph and print, and with them, every Costas sculptor that had been present. Here was Mikhail again, his eyes covered as always by his mirrored glasses; then a picture of his father. Wearing identical eyewear.  
That couldn’t be a coincidence.  
Fear and a strange excitement thrilling through me, I went further and further back, until I found the oldest, grainy photos of the Costas ancestors.  
In every picture, they all wore darkened lenses which completely covered their eyes.  
It was in that moment the memory broke free; the snippet of mythology I’d absorbed as a child.  
*The Gorgon!*  
It seemed so impossible, but it explained everything so perfectly; it explained how realistic the statues were, and how a stranger like Mikhail could capture in stone the different personalities of virtually identical girls so effortlessly.  
But most of all, it explained why the family was so reclusive, and why they always covered their eyes.  
The rage and grief that had simmered inside me for so long finally came to a head then, as I sat in the dimly lit back room of the town library.  
How *dare* he desecrate the bodies of my sisters!

&amp;nbsp;  
The earth of Anabel’s grave had indeed been recently disturbed, which also made my task easier. I didn’t even *think* as I dug in the moist earth; consequence be damned, I *had* to find out what had happened to my sister.  
It was near midnight when I finally cracked the lid of her casket, buried oddly shallow, and braced myself for the stench of decomposing flesh.  
Instead, the worst I smelled was leaf mould, wet earth and a hint of bad breath, my own teeth not brushed for weeks. Angling the flashlight to shine through the crack, my fears were confirmed:  
Anabel’s coffin was empty.  
I sat there in the cold dirt, unable to move, my emotions caught up in a battle so fierce that it all but paralysed me. I feared for a moment that Mikhail had crept up behind me, lowering his glasses and turning me to stone as I sat. But my hands started to shake in the cooling night air, letting me know that I was still alive, still a fragile and impermanent being of blood, lonely flesh and bone.  
I made as much effort as I could to resettle the disturbed grave, stamping down the loose soil and then laying the turf back over it. It was not nearly as good a job as Mikhail had done, but then, I didn’t have the sheer amount of practice at grave robbing that he had.  
As I ran back home, I smelled the pungent effects of neglect on my body, every swish of my hair greasy over the nape of my neck. Not caring if I woke my parents, I all but fell into the shower, furiously scrubbing away the grime and gunk that I had accumulated in my hermithood.  
Then the tears came, just as hot and fast as the water from the showerhead.

&amp;nbsp;  
In the legends of old, Perseus had slain Medusa with a mirrored shield, either able to turn her to stone with her own gaze, or able to look upon her via the trickery of angled light. Our bathroom mirror was hung via a length of string on a hook, and by tying that to a leather belt, I managed to fashion myself a crude shield. It went into the car along with a heavy carving knife, and with the righteous rage still smouldering hot inside me, I gunned my mother’s tiny Toyota down the willow-lined lanes. I coasted up to the gates of the Costas manor with the headlights switched off.  
Fear mingled with the anger now, attenuating my resolve. No longer did I want to hack off the head of Mikhail Costas for desecrating the graves of my sisters; instead I wanted him on his knees, tearfully explaining why his family had done this to our town, what perverse pleasure they gleaned from turning our dead into statues you could fall in love with.  
The gates weren’t locked, and neither was the front door. I pushed it open gingerly, expecting at any moment that a serpent-haired head would rear, hissing, from the darkness, snake-like eyes intent on petrifying my flesh.  
But nothing greeted me other than echoing silence and a distant, unpleasant smell, like garbage left to rot for too long.  
The house was as silent as the proverbial tomb.  
Creeping around in the half-light, clutching my makeshift mythic shield and my ridiculous excuse for a sword, I suddenly felt very young, very foolish and very frightened.  
At the top of the landing stairs, far past the foyer, the smell was much stronger; almost fruity, but with an acrid undertone of dirt and something *wet*, like humid compost or meat gone green with shiny rot and maggots. When a door opened to my left, it spilled not just brilliant white light, but also such a rush of the stench that I dropped the mirror with a clattering, shattering *crash*, then fell to my knees and vomited. It was so immediate and forceful that my eyes filled with water and stars and my temples ached.  
“What are you doing here?” The calm voice of Mikhail Costas found my ringing ears.  
Still heaving at the power of the smell, I tried to force a reply through my gasps, but every indrawn breath pulled more of the fetid stink into my lungs. I could taste it, like a layer of rancid oil on my tongue. Delicate, strong hands picked me up and wound a heavily perfumed handkerchief around my vomit-flecked face, blocking out some of the smell.  
My knife was somewhere amongst the mess of mirrored pieces, another bright slice of jagged light on the too-bright landing.  
And as I looked around frantically for a suitable shard to use as a weapon, I looked up – and straight into the beautiful brown eyes of Mikhail Costas. I waited for the heavy weight of stone to claim my limbs, for his strange and eternal gift to descend upon me.  
But nothing happened.  
“You need to leave,” he said quietly, pushing me towards the stairs, then tugging the door closed behind him.  
“No,” I managed, the heavy menthol perfume hitting the back of my throat like astringent alcohol, “I need to know what’s going on here!”  
Before he could protest, I had shoved past him and into the brightly lit room.  

&amp;nbsp;  
The dead were *everywhere*.  
In times past, the room must have been some vast dining hall or grand ballroom. Now it was a grisly mausoleum, filled with corpses in various states of stinking rainbow decay.  
But just as they would have been, were this room a window into its own history, they had all been carefully posed and dressed, each laid out as though still-frame attendees at a rollicking party. Glasses of wine were wired to rotting fingers, the leathery jaws of desiccated skulls hanging open as if laughing at the witty repartee of the other guests.  
I recognised Anabel and Sarah immediately; one intact but skinned gunmetal grey with death, the other already flirting with decomposition, mottled patches of rot discolouring and puckering her flesh.  
Confusion muddied my thoughts as I cast my eyes down the rank generations of the dead, each elegant tableau formed of corpses from further and further backwards in time. At the far end of the hall, only artfully wired-together skeletons stood, dressed in formal rags of faded chiffon and mouldering, tatty velvet.  
“Why?” I groaned, the unholy stench twisting its fists in my gut all over again.  
Apparently immune to the smell, Mikhail strode forward and tenderly pulled the ichor-soaked sleeve of a black-eyed, rotting monstrosity back over the sagging slurry of her shoulder.  
“When people speak of necrophiles, they always refer to *sex*,” he explained, as though speaking to a small child. “They never understand that a *true* necrophile doesn’t feel lust for the dead. What he feels is *love*.”  
Approaching another figure, the gape-mouthed husk of an old man, he gently caressed the paper-thin skin stretched over his forehead, touch as reverent as a mother soothing a child.  
“*Monster!*” I croaked, leaning on the doorjamb, my eyes watering.  
“No,” he told me with a sad, small shake of his head, “I’m not a monster. There isn’t anything wrong with loving death. It’s as natural as birth, as fundamental as breath.”  
“But you dug up my sisters and… and *posed* them like, like fucking *dolls*, making them part of your sick little fantasy.”  
His soulful brown eyes were full of love and pain as he shook his head.  
“It’s a trade,” he said, gesturing in the direction of the graveyard, “I give your loved ones an immortality that *you* can enjoy. And I care for their true selves, right here.”  
Even through the kerchief around my nose and mouth, he must have read my expression.  
“Oh, don’t be a fool, Megan. Everyone in the town *loves* the work my family has done. Once the statues are up, nobody cares about the lovely thing lying in the soil. No-one except me. I *rescue* them from their cold, dark graves, and I *love* them, and everything they continue to become, while the rest of you pretend they no longer exist.”  
“I’ll tell everyone,” I hissed, but my voice sounded reedy and toothless in my own ears – a child threatening a grown man who was immune to everything, so desperately in love with death.  
“Why would you tell them, Megan? Tell me honestly, *what harm have I done?*”  
And as my heavy tongue fumbled with rote words like ‘desecration’ and ‘immoral’, he made a dismissive gesture with those beautiful fingers, silencing me as I groped for the language to describe my unease.  
“As long as nobody knows, everyone is *happy*. Don’t you see that? They get their pretty statues, their beautiful forever memories, and I get to add to my family. Why would you want to ruin everyone’s happiness? Wouldn’t that be *truly* evil?”  
“Are you going to kill me unless I promise not to tell?”  
“Oh, you poor, stupid child. I don’t *cause* death. I just wait for it to happen.”  
For a long moment, only the buzzing of a lonely, fat fly filled the silence.  
“I need to think about it,” I said, the dead eyes of my sisters pinioning me, heavy with reproach and sadness and things unsaid.  *Don’t leave us*, said Sarah’s. *Don’t make me go back into the dark*, said Anabel’s. Suddenly I was very unsure of myself.  
“Take all the time you need.”  
Before I left, he pressed the kitchen knife back into my hand, then helped me down the stairs on wobbling legs.  
I drove back home, utterly numb, still breathing the heady fumes of the handkerchief.  

&amp;nbsp;  

----------

&amp;nbsp;  
It took me two weeks to pluck up the courage to return.  
As I replayed the events over and over, I started to doubt my own sanity, that what I’d seen was real. But the missing belt and bathroom mirror told me that *something* had happened, no matter what my confused mind was telling me.  
When I did go back, he was kind and genial, listening to me tearfully telling him that I was going to notify the police, that even though he didn’t think he was doing any harm to the living, his dishonesty was immoral and it couldn’t be allowed to continue. People have belief systems and rituals that should be honoured, and he shouldn’t be disinterring the dead without their permission. He didn’t even argue with me, he simply closed his beautiful dark eyes for a long moment, then nodded.   
“Before you go,” he said, “I would like to show you something that no one outside the family has seen before.”  
“What is it?”  
“Telling you would spoil the surprise.”  
I don’t know why I trusted him so, but I knew he’d spoken the truth in the ballroom when he said he didn’t cause death. There wasn’t a hint of killer instinct in him, only a macabre, almost endearing kind of weirdness.  
Through the musty manor we walked, until eventually we emerged into a cloistered courtyard, rampant with climbing vines. The musk of jasmine hung in the air like a sunset.   
In the middle of the open space were the most beautiful statues I’d ever seen – far *more* exquisite than even the ones in the graveyard; divinity made real.  
Spellbound, I drank in the painfully exquisite lines with hungry eyes; eyes that had not realised before then that I wanted – no *needed* to have such beauty in my life.  
“I can teach you,” he said, “I can make you a peerless artist, I can give you your purpose, and make this beauty a part of your life *always*.”  
And with that, all thoughts of exposing him faded away, dust to dust.  
“I think you’ll make a very fine apprentice,” he said, as the chisel and hammer slid into my waiting hands.

Dhaecktia,2017-06-07 19:16:31+00:00,World's best XIs by alphabetical order,"Since the season is finally over (at least in Europe) and there is not much left to discuss, I have decided to share with you this thing I did in my free time. I tried to create some line-ups composed exclusively by players whose names start with the same first letter.

In order to make it more palatable for our American friends, I decided to organise the teams in franchises: they will be based in the first city that came into my mind and named after the first thing I could think of.

Eligibility criteria: I decided that those (mostly Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish) players who sometimes are called with their names and sometimes with their surnames (Alex Sandro, Xabi Alonso, Felipe Anderson, etc.) are eligible to play in both teams (name’s or surname’s), so that things were also easier for me.

Of course, many of my choices are debatable due to four main reasons:

1.	My knowledge of football is limited
2.	I had to make some players play out of position not to exclude them
3.	When in doubt, I chose the one I found nicer
4.	Football skills are not math

Cut the chatter, let’s see the XIs.

EDIT I: Beautiful /u/Johhog made a FM save with this. [Click here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/vge68okav6pbc60/ABC.rar) to download it and [here](http://imgur.com/a/mq3mU) to enjoy a few screenshots.

Isuckatthesethings1,2017-06-07 19:01:30+00:00,r/NFL Roast of: The Los Angeles San Diego Chargers of Anaheim (16/32),"**Guidelines**

1.	Let’s try to be more creative than “lul cowboys” or “no rings” jokes. These jokes are unfunny and unimaginative and we all know we are better than that.

2.	This is a roast thread, please take all jokes as well…..a joke. I saw a few cases of retaliation and arguing. Jokes are Jokes, don’t like it? Move on.

3.	NO OTHER TEAM BASHING, save that precious ammo for when that teams time to be roasted comes.


4.	No malicious posts, trolling, or over the top comments attacking r/nfl users. As i said before this is supposed to be light hearted and fun, lets keep it that way.

5.	The next team up will be posted in the thread the day before, so you guys will have time to come up with material and decent jokes referring to the team.


6.	Have fun! This is meant to be lighthearted thread and they are to be taken as such. The off season can be long and hopefully this series will provide some fun to pass the time. So roast away!!






Please be sure to PM me any jokes you think would be good enough to make it into the “Best of” series!

-	Be sure to send me the permalink to the comment, please do not copy and paste jokes into the PM

-	Also please label the message in the PM something along the lines of Best of Roast of “Team name being roasted” It just makes things easier for me as I will be compiling it all.

And as always feel free to reach out with any questions you may have about the series.

JaguarGator9,2017-05-31 13:25:35+00:00,[OC] JaguarGator9's Weird Stat Thread- NBA Finals Edition,"For the most part, I’ve done the Weird Stat Threads in the NFL subreddit and once or twice in the college football subreddit. But I figure now that it’s the NBA Finals, and since [everyone](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6e4cbm/since_2011_when_rihanna_is_in_the_top_13_during/?st=j3awoz3t&amp;sh=6ca9da62) is now [jumping](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6e41o9/there_is_a_prized_bird_award_in_a_county_fair_in/?st=j3awpglt&amp;sh=8546d2cb) on the [weird stat](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6e26ne/lebron_james_has_never_won_a_championship_if/?st=j3awpvdq&amp;sh=5bd2d967) bandwagon, I figured I might as well bring this over to /r/nba for the finals (and maybe some stuff in the offseason).

Basically, this is the thread where I point out completely unrelated things and how that will translate to the upcoming event, which in this case, is the NBA Finals. [Here’s one I did comparing the NFL to the Eurovision Song Contest](https://np.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/6ar0b0/oc_jaguargator9s_weird_stat_thread_eurovision/?st=j3awsiw9&amp;sh=75273700). This one is [a week 1 prediction with weird stats](https://np.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/5251bo/jaguargator9s_weird_stat_thread_week_1_part_i_100/?st=j3awtoy6&amp;sh=e25d0254). And this one [is my most recent one](https://np.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/6dhlpg/oc_jaguargator9s_weird_stat_thread_stanley_cup/?st=j3awujdo&amp;sh=d8c15ac4), comparing the NFL to the Stanley Cup. I’m doing one of these threads every Friday on /r/NFL, so check that out if you’re interested.

With that being said, let’s dive right into the weird stats.

- The #2 seed in the Eastern Conference has won the NBA Finals six times (1966 and 1968 when the Boston Celtics did it, 1973 when the New York Knicks did it, 1993 when the Chicago Bulls did it, and 2006 and 2012 when the Miami Heat did it). All six times, in the most recent NFL Draft, the Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts chose an offensive player with their first round selection.

Year | Pick | Position
--- | --- | ---
1966 | Sam Ball | Tackle
1968 | John Williams | Tackle
1973 | Bert Jones | Quarterback
1993 | Sean Dawkins | Wide Receiver
2006 | Joseph Addai | Halfback
2012 | Andrew Luck | Quarterback

This year, the Colts chose Malik Hooker with their first round pick, a safety from Ohio State. Since that is a defensive player, the advantage goes to the Warriors.

- After winning their first ever NBA Finals, a team has repeated as champion four times. After winning their first title in 1949, the Minneapolis Lakers won again in 1950, and after winning for the first time in 1991, the Chicago Bulls won again in 1992. After winning their first title in 1989, the Detroit Pistons won again in 1990, and after winning for the first time in 1994, the Houston Rockets won again in 1995. All four times that the team has repeated (1950, 1990, 1992, 1995), the most recent Winter Olympic silver medalist in the men’s slalom had exactly 5 different English letters in their last name. This might be the weirdest stat I have ever come up with.

Year | Most Recent Winter Olympics | Silver Medalist | English Letters in Last Name | Number of Letters
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1950 | 1948 Winter Olympics (St. Moritz) | James Couttet | C, O, U, T (x3), E | 5
1990 | 1988 Winter Olympics (Calgary) | Frank Wörndl | W, R, N, D, L | 5

The most recent Winter Olympics was in 2014 at Sochi. The silver medalist was Austrian skier Marcel Hirscher. He has 6 different English letters in his last name (H, I, R, S, C, E), so advantage to the Warriors here.

- After winning their first ever NBA Finals, a team has repeated as champion four times (1950, 1990, 1992, 1995). All four times that the team has repeated, the most recent Winter Olympic gold medalist in the women’s slalom had a last name that ended in the letter “R”.

1950 | 1948 Winter Olympics (St. Moritz) | Gretchen Fraser | R

1992 | 1992 Winter Olympics (Albertville) | Petra Kronberger | R
1995 | 1994 Winter Olympics (Lillehammer) | Vreni Schneider | R

Good news for America? The gold medalist in the 2014 Winter Olympics was Mikaele Shiffrin of the USA, the first winner in this event for the USA since Barbara Cochran won it in 1972. Bad news (depending on what part of America you live in)? Her last name does not end in R, so advantage to the Warriors here.

- After winning their first ever NBA Finals, a team has repeated as champion four times (1950, 1990, 1992, 1995). All four times that the team has repeated, in the pairs figure skating competition at the most recent Winter Olympics, the gold and silver medalists were from Europe, while the bronze medalists were from North America.

At the 2014 Winter Olympics, Russia won the gold and silver medals, but Germany won the bronze medal. Since Germany is not in North America, this stat goes against the Cavs, and is in favor of the Warriors.

- The Warriors have won the NBA Finals four times (1947, 1956, 1975, 2015). All four times, the winning league of the previous MLB All Star Game was the home team.

2015 | American League | Target Field (Minnesota Twins) | AL

The most recent MLB All Star Game was held at Petco Park in San Diego, and was won by the American League. This is not good for the Warriors.

- The Warriors have won the NBA Finals four times (1947, 1956, 1975, 2015). All four times, in the most recent NRL Grand Final (rugby in Australia), exactly one team ending in the letter “N” ended up playing in the Grand Final.

2015 | South Sydney &amp; **Canterbury-Bankstown** (1)

This is not a common occurrence; since the 2005 NRL season, this has only happened twice (2012 and 2014), and since 1999, this has only happened three times. Last year’s NRL Grand Final was between Cronulla-Sutherland and Melbourne, so advantage to the Cavaliers with this one. Note that last year, the 2 teams were North Queensland and Brisbane, so the Cavs had the advantage with that weird stat last year.

- LeBron James has played in the NBA Finals seven times prior to this year. When the Golden Boot winner in La Liga (the person that scores the most goals in Spain’s top soccer league) has a first name starting with the letter “L,” then LeBron’s team wins the NBA Finals. When he does not have a first name starting with the letter “L,” then LeBron’s team loses the NBA Finals.

Will Fuller’s full first name is William, so that counts for last year. This year, the Texans chose quarterback Deshaun Watson out of Clemson. There are 7 letters in Deshaun’s first name. Advantage to the Cavaliers.

- LeBron James has played in the NBA Finals seven times prior to this year. If the previous US Open Cup Final finished with exactly 2 goals scored prior to penalty kicks, then LeBron’s team won the NBA Finals. Any other number, and LeBron’s team lost.

This season, the Packers lost to the Falcons in the conference championship. They got past the divisional round with their dramatic last-second victory over the Dallas Cowboys, so because of this, advantage goes to the Warriors.

- A team has represented the Western Conference in the NBA Finals three straight years in a row 6 times before (1954 with the Minneapolis Lakers, and then 1970, 1984, 1989, 2002, and 2010 with the Los Angeles Lakers). All six times during the three-peat year, the outcome of the series was determined by the most recent Summer Olympics and the 200m dash. If the gold medalist in the men’s 200m dash at the most recent Summer Olympics had a first name containing the letter “N”, then the Western Conference team in their third straight Finals appearance won. If he did not, then the Western Conference team in their third straight Finals appearance lost.

2010 | 2008 Olympics (Beijing) | Usain Bolt | Yes | Los Angeles Lakers win (def. Boston Celtics)

In the most recent Summer Olympics down in Rio de Janeiro, Usain Bolt won. Since he has a letter “n” in his first name, this bodes well for the Golden State Warriors.

- A team has represented the Western Conference in the NBA Finals three straight years in a row 6 times before (1954, 1970, 1984, 1989, 2002, 2010).

- A team has represented the Western Conference in the NBA Finals three straight years in a row 6 times before (1954, 1970, 1984, 1989, 2002, 2010). All six times during the three-peat year, the outcome of the series was determined by the most recent Summer Olympics and the winner of the men’s 400m hurdles at the most recent Summer Olympics. If the gold medalist’s number of letters in the first and last name add up to exactly 12, then the Western Conference team in their third straight Finals appearance won.

2010 | 2008 Olympics (Beijing) | Samuel Sanchez | 7 | Los Angeles Lakers win (def. Boston Celtics)

In the 2016 Summer Olympics, the winning cyclist was a Belgian named Greg van Avermaet. Whether you count it as 8 letters or 11 letters, it still is not 7, so the advantage goes to the Cavaliers here.

- Prior to this season, a Western Conference team with at least 67 wins in the regular season has happened six times; the Warriors did it last year at 73-9, the Lakers did it in 1972 at 69-13, the Lakers did it in 2000 at 67-15, the Spurs did it last year at 67-15, the Mavericks did it in 2007 at 67-15, and the Warriors did it in 2015 at 67-15. All six times, the outcome was determined by the MLB All Star Game. If the most recent edition of the Midsummer Classic was held in an American League ballpark, then the Western Conference team with 67+ wins won the NBA Finals. If it was held in a National League ballpark, then the Western Conference team with 67+ wins did not win the NBA Finals.

This year, the Golden State Warriors went 67-15. However, the most recent MLB All Star Game was held at Petco Park, home of the San Diego Padres. The Padres are a National League team. Advantage to Cleveland here.

- Prior to this season, a Western Conference team with at least 67 wins in the regular season has happened six times (1972, 2000, 2007, 2015, 2016). All six times, the outcome was determined by the most recent gold medalist in the men’s 100m freestyle at the Pan American Games. If the winning swimmer was from Argentina, then the Western Conference team did not win the NBA Finals. However, if the winning swimmer hailed from any other country, then the Western Conference team won the NBA Finals.

Year | Most Recent Pan American Games | Gold Medalist | Country | Team | Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1972 | 1971 Pan American Games (Cali) | Frank Heckl | USA | Los Angeles Lakers (69-13) | Win NBA Finals (def. New York Knicks)
2000 | 1999 Pan American Games (Winnipeg) | Fernando Scherer | Brazil | Los Angeles Lakers (67-15) | Win NBA Finals (def. Indiana Pacers)

2016 | 2015 Pan American Games (Toronto) | Federico Grabich | Argentina | San Antonio Spurs (67-15) | Lose in second round to Oklahoma City Thunder
2016 | 2015 Pan American Games (Toronto) | Federico Grabich | Argentina | Golden State Wariors (73-9) | Lose in NBA Finals to Cleveland Cavaliers

Seeing as the Pan American Games happen once every four years in the summer and the next one isn’t until 2019 in Lima, Peru, Federico Grabich is still the most recent gold medalist at this event. Advantage to the Cavaliers here.

- Prior to this season, a Western Conference team with at least 67 wins in the regular season has happened six times (1972, 2000, 2007, 2015, 2016). All six times, the outcome was determined by what the Chicago Bulls did in the season prior. If the Bulls played in a playoff series in the previous year that ended 4-2, then the Western Conference team did not win the NBA Finals. However, if the Bulls did not do this, then the Western Conference team won the NBA Finals.

Year | Previous Chicago Bulls Season | 4-2 Series? | Team | Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1972 | 51-31 (1970/71) | No (lost 4-3 in conference semifinals vs. Lakers) | Los Angeles Lakers (69-13) | Win NBA Finals (def. New York Knicks)
2000 | 13-37 (1998/99) | No (did not make playoffs) | Los Angeles Lakers (67-15) | Win NBA Finals (def. Indiana Pacers)
2007 | 41-41 (2005/06) | Yes (lost 4-2 in first round vs. Heat) | Dallas Mavericks (67-15) | Lose in first round to Golden State Warriors
2015 | 48-34 (2013/14) | No (lost 4-1 in first round vs. Wizards) | Golden State Warriors (67-15) | Win NBA Finals (def. Cleveland Cavaliers)
2016 | 50-32 (2014/15) | Yes (won 4-2 in first round vs. Bucks; lost 4-2 in second round vs. Cavaliers) | San Antonio Spurs (67-15) | Lose in second round to Oklahoma City Thunder
2016 | 50-32 (2014/15) | Yes (won 4-2 in first round vs. Bucks; lost 4-2 in second round vs. Cavaliers) | Golden State Warriors (73-9) | Lose in NBA Finals to Cleveland Cavaliers

Last year, the Bulls missed the playoffs and did not play a series that ended 4-2, so advantage to the Warriors. However, next year, if a Western Conference team finishes with 67+ wins, this stat will work against them, as in this year’s playoffs, the Bulls lost 4-2 to the Celtics in the first round. But for this year, the Warriors get the edge.

- And finally, prior to this season, a Western Conference team with at least 67 wins in the regular season has happened six times (1972, 2000, 2007, 2015, 2016). All six times, the outcome was determined by the Milwaukee Bucks. If the Bucks made the playoffs, then the Western Conference team won the NBA Finals. If the Bucks missed the playoffs, then the Western Conference team did not win the NBA Finals.

Year | Milwaukee Bucks Record | Playoffs? | Team | Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1972 | 63-19 | Yes | Los Angeles Lakers (69-13) | Win NBA Finals (def. New York Knicks)
2000 | 42-40 | Yes | Los Angeles Lakers (67-15) | Win NBA Finals (def. Indiana Pacers)
2007 | 28-54 | No | Dallas Mavericks (67-15) | Lose in first round to Golden State Warriors
2015 | 41-41 | Yes | Golden State Warriors (67-15) | Win NBA Finals (def. Cleveland Cavaliers)
2016 | 33-49 | No | San Antonio Spurs (67-15) | Lose in second round to Oklahoma City Thunder
2016 | 33-49 | No | Golden State Warriors (73-9) | Lose in NBA Finals to Cleveland Cavaliers

This year, the Milwaukee Bucks finished 42-40, making the playoffs. Advantage goes to the Warriors here.

After these 19 weird stats, there are 10 in favor of the Cavaliers, and 9 in favor of the Warriors. Assuming all the weird stats cancel each other out, the weird stats pick the Cavaliers to win the NBA Finals.",nba,1290
CanuckBacon,2017-05-30 17:37:40+00:00,"My name is Skyler, I have played Minecraft for the last 6.5 years. I have spent the last 9 months walking across America, to meet friends I've made while playing Minecraft.","I just wanted to apologise at how long this is.

---

I started playing a little before the Nether update, way back in Alpha. I started playing in middle school, and continued in highschool, and for my entire adult life I've played this game. I'm 20 years old and have spent 1/3 of my life playing Minecraft. Although I mostly stopped, about 10 months ago to do something.

Over the years I've been in many Minecraft communities. I've logged thousands of hours. I'd spend several hours a day on school nights and most of my weekends playing. Addiction is a term that might fit. Through this game though, I've made many friends. People I've only talked to online, some I had seen some pictures of, but I'd never met them in real life. Despite that, I still considered them to be friends. A several years ago that was a pretty weird sentiment. It's becoming more and more acceptable these days though.

Throughout my time playing this game I built countless castles and bases, and redstone contraptions. I ran my own UHC server for about two years (shout out to the /r/ultrahardcore subreddit), and I played on the Jsano Fan Server. One day while me and my friends were messing around, I jokingly said I was going to visit them. I even found a map of the US and in MS paint I drew up ""my route"". It was entirely a joke.

Out of the innumerable jokes I've made in my life, that one really stuck with me. It bounced around my head and would randomly come up. In my last year or two of high school I started running out of time to play. I'd sometimes just log onto the server and sit there and do homework rather than actually play. For those of you who have completed highschool, you know how the last two years there's a big pressure on what comes next. What will you do after you finish high school? Which university will you go to? Have you applied yet? What about scholarships? How are your grades you're keeping them up right? What are you doing playing Minecraft all the time don't you have homework to do? I work hard in highschool, and I was almost valedictorian. I was part of many extracurriculars as well. By the end there I was really afraid of burning out. I worried that I'd go to university and then all that pressure that had been building up would finally just explode like a bed in the Nether. So I realized I needed a year off before university. So what do you think was still bouncing around in my mind, like Steve on a slime block? 

So in my final year of high school I decided to do it. I got a job and saved up the money, I more thoroughly planned out the route. I messaged people that I had fallen out of contact with. (My parents are separated, dad in San Francisco, and I live with my mom in Toronto). So when I was in California for Christmas with my dad I mentioned it to him very casually as if it wasn't even a real plan. He actually really liked the idea. After I had gotten back home to Canada, I fine tuned my plan a bit more and in February told my mom. She took it okay. She was far from pleased that instead of going to university I was going to walk across the US to meet some people I played videogames with, but she understood me as a person and could see I was dedicated to this. 

I graduated high school June 28th, 2016. I got a second job a few days later and worked 60 hours a week until I quit both jobs. On August 14th I set off walking, from the small town of Waterdown, Ontario, to the American border. I crossed it and began my walk across America.

Over the last 9 months of walking I met 9 Minecraft friends. In Ohio, Kentucky, Louisiana, Utah, Idaho, and Washington. In that time I walked 3,600 miles. I also met tons of other people along the way, I had experiences I never dreamed I could, I've been on TV, the radio, and even a newspaper. It's all because of that one joke, those friends I made, and this game. 

It's impossible to quantify the impact this game has had on my life. I'm posting this now because I met up with my last Minecraft friend in Seattle about a week ago. I'm not quite finished with my trip. I will finish in San Francisco in about a month from now. I'm currently in Portland, Oregon. 

TL;DR I kinda like Minecraft, it's fun.

I’m prepared for an all-day affair here. As long as you all keep asking new questions, I’ll keep pumping out answers. For those who don’t know me, I’ll include some background below.

---

**My Background**: I practiced law at one of the largest law firms in Seattle, wrote a white paper about LoL-esports and the law that [rose to the top of this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1x0c07/just_how_big_has_lol_become/), and spring-boarded that into a practice focused on esports law. In January, I founded the world’s first dedicated esports law firm, ESG Law (www.esglaw.com), where I exclusively represent esports-related clients. I work with about 25-30 esports teams, including 7 from the NA LCS (TSM, C9, TL, P1, IMT, DIG, and NV) and 1 from EU (Fnatic), major esports talent (including Monte, DoA, and Voyboy), and esports-focused businesses (most notably Unikrn, a leader in regulated esports betting, where I am outside general counsel). I don’t represent any active pro players for conflicts reasons.

I have a second full-time job at Catalyst Sports &amp; Media, where I am an EVP and co-manage our esports advisory division with a former Rioter (Avi Bhuiyan). Catalyst serves as the bridge between traditional sports and esports, advising major sports teams and owners, brands, and investors on how to successfully enter and navigate the esports space. It’s a really fun job, and we’re at the forefront of a lot of the mainstream interest regarding esports right now. In addition to consulting, we’re building a few esports initiatives ourselves, the first of which launched yesterday – it’s a [training facility designed for esports](https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrenheitner/2017/05/23/new-athletic-training-facility-for-excelling-in-esports/#7a40de5f2248). CLG is actually boot camping there as we speak.

I’m also fairly active on [twitter](https://twitter.com/esportslaw?lang=en) and as a content creator surrounding legal and business issues facing the industry. I’ve written a wide array of op eds for ESPN, appeared on various esports talk shows including a couple episodes of [Thorin’s Esports Salon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si-BPQwPoac), and recently went on [Outside the Lines](http://www.espn.com/video/clip?id=18518940) to talk about skin betting. Here are a couple recent examples of pieces that are pertinent to LoL: 

- [It's time to recognize esports as individual entities](http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/19187756/opinion-recognize-esports-individual-entities)
- [Esports ecosystem will level up from sports investment](http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/17651762/esports-ecosystem-level-sports-investment)

artjomh,2017-05-09 22:22:06+00:00,v1lat: 5 questions and 5 answers,"**v1lat has posted some thoughts regarding the RuHub/PGL situation. Below are his translated words verbatim.**

**This is the original text: https://twitter.com/v1lat/status/862062957961805824**

With regards to the publication of the open anonymous letter I received a lot of questions, which I will try to answer.

- v1lat, are you the author of the letter?

Maybe I am, maybe not. It was an anonymous letter, so the name of the author is unknown.

- Is it true what was written in that letter, or was it the author's subjective opinion?

It's true. This can be confirmed by anyone who worked on the Russian-speaking broadcast, who was in our ""inside"" chat; we discussed everything, how to tell the world about what's going on, because everybody was incredibly mad. The idea to write something and defend our position was supported by everyone with no exception. I don't know if everyone will come out publically though, since some may be afraid.

Goblak has already supported us on Twitter and Dread on his stream, as well as NS, myself, Godhunt and Faker.

- Politics, politics, politics. This is a conspiracy against PGL.

We don't give a hoot about your politics, we just want good working conditions. We don't ask PGL and Valve for some extraordinary things during events. Give us warm food (we physically don't have time to go look for it), give us time to sleep between broadcasts (a bit more than 5 hours), pay us a decent wage, and don't hinder our work. These are simple things. We want to know why some of us are not being invited to tournaments, we want to know why some of us have virtual bans from Valve tournaments, we want to have our work DISCUSSED WITH US, and not just have someone tell us that this is the way you will do your job. Simple and transparent things.

We are not against PGL, let them do all the majors until the end of time. We just want NORMAL attitude.

- Why do you agree to work under these conditions if they are not satisfactory?

Read the letter. None of us agreed to it. We were kept waiting, got answers once a week until the final list was announced. Refusing then would be absolute disrespect toward our viewers.

- This is a RuHub letter and RuHub together with ESForce wants to steal the Majors from PGL.

RuHub does not make money when their staff and talents work at the majors. All broadcasts are done via Valve streams, staff and talents work 2 weeks there for Valve, but RuHub still pays their salary. When I used to work for Starladder, I didn't understand why my management was angry when we left for Seattle for 3 weeks. Now I understand. When its staff and talents work at the Major, RuHub loses the opportunity to use them during regular broadcasts in other eSports events. Major brings ZERO revenue to RuHub itself. During the month of the Major, RuHub has a massive financial loss.

Why would we want to hold the Major? We already organised Boston Major broadcasts and 5 qualifiers for Majors and TI. This was very expensive and not at all self-sustainable. The only benefit we get are the viewers and each such broadcast is an opportunity to prove what we can do and how we improve. Is there any reaction of Valve to this? Of course not. We work 100-hour marathons, do multicasts, have round-the-clock broadcasts, nobody gives a hoot, nobody is interested. We have Epicenter which we will make awesome, an absolute standard for how to hold Dota events, as we have already done in 2016. Why do we need to do this at another Major? What's the point?

Someone please translate this for Reddit, those guys don't seem to understand what's going on.

Be well.",DotA2,1091

wellwellsky,2017-05-09 11:31:47+00:00,Open letter to Valve: do not work with PGL again,"Hi everyone. I’m one of the talents from the Russian-language commentating studio at large Valve tournaments, and this is an open letter to them and to PGL. I don’t find it necessary to introduce myself, as most of the viewpoints and opinions expressed in this letter are in no way my personal ones, but rather collective. The central message of this letter can be summed up as follows: Valve, please, take action and deal with PGL.

Now to specific points. I think it will be reasonable to split this letter into several segments dedicated to each of the Majors. That will be the best approach.

The Manila Major

Last season, Valve was actively testing various contractors, apparently in order to find the optimal one for cooperation on a permanent basis. That was how ESL got Frankfurt, PW got Shanghai, and PGL got Manila. At the time, it was PGL’s first Dota tournament; the tournaments they’d organized previously were in other disciplines, which was why we were a little worried here: firstly, on account of the long traveling distance, and secondly, because the organizers might not have an entirely clear idea of what Dota was, what made it different from other disciplines, and what product the viewers would like to see. However, our doubts were gone almost the minute we began cooperating with them.

First, we were told that our plane tickets to the event venue were business class. This was a real gift to us, as business class is significantly more pleasant than economy when your flight takes half a day. I suppose it’s fairly obvious. Thus we traveled comfortably to the venue, were accommodated at Manila’s best hotel, were treated to food, drinks and themed events such as Oktoberfest (although that was perhaps a disputable choice, seeing as Oktoberfest coincided with the last night before the playoffs—but it was there nonetheless), an American cuisine night, a Chinese one, etc. etc.

The organization of the tournament itself was also top-notch, and we were more than satisfied. The absence of delays or lengthy pauses, or communication issues between talents and organizers, made for an unforgettable tournament, the best of the three Majors in the 2015/16 season. 

I don’t think there’s a point in describing PGL’s work at TI, as most of the work there was done by Valve and MCW events, while PGL’s resources were focused specifically on the English-language livestream. Everyone was OK with that—PGL, Valve, and ourselves. This looks like a very positive letter so far, doesn’t it? Well, not really. Problems would begin later.

The Boston Major

Valve cut its Majors budget for the 2016/17 season. Thus while during the debut season, the contractors had been given a blank check and could ask for however much money they needed, this time the budgets were fixed. Nevertheless, they were more than enough to create a comfortable environment for everyone while also turning a profit. Not as large as in the previous season, but a decent one too. However, PGL decided it should make just as much money, and went into saving mode. This is where it gets interesting.

Firstly, business class flights were out of the question now—which was indeed clear to everyone by that point. We’re no superstars who’d complain about something like that—although granted, it was something of a letdown to go back to economy having tasted all the perks and comfort of business class. There were, however, other and more serious issues.

Besides slashing the budget, this year Valve decided to test a system where analysts would work from home. 

Essentially, the experiment disappointed no-one. Many analysts said it was nice to not have to travel to the other side of the world when you could stay at home. Jetlag and acclimating are after all difficult things that everyone experiences in their own way.

However, introducing this practice created the need for an assistant contractor to help PGL set up analyst panel for the Russian broadcast and establish communication between commentators and analysts, in Boston and Moscow/Kiev respectively. As many of you know, there were only two obvious options here: to entrust this task to either Starladder or RuHub. PGL made up its mind and announced a bidding procedure for an assistant contractor. Bids were written up and sent to Romanians for consideration.

I was in touch with RuHub staff at the time, and they were a little worried, as they wanted very much to organize an event of this kind, while realizing that the head of PGL is a good friend of the head of Starladder. Thus there were misgivings, and they eventually proved not unfounded.

A few weeks after the “consideration” (the reason for the quotes will become clear later), PGL wrote a letter to RuHub saying they had chosen Starladder as the contractor. 
During that time, Valve was deciding on a list of commentators, analysts, and the presenter who were to take part in the event. The list was made, and invitations were sent out to commentators. “Sent out” isn’t perhaps the right term. MCW Events, who were in charge of travel, accommodation and other things related to commentators, asked them to fill in requests which could be used to book plane tickets, hotels, etc.

The personalities who were to be involved in the analyst panel received nothing. A few days after PGL’s choice in favor of Starladder, a Starladder employee contacted Goblak, XBOCT, PGG, NS, and Faker, the folks Valve had decided to invite for covering the tournament. Each of them got a different wording. Some were addressed in an official style; with others, the format was “Hiya, you are from Kiev aren’t you, so I suppose you won’t need accommodation?” To say those people were surprised would be an extreme understatement. For instance, Goblak, who wasn’t an employee of either RuHub or Starladder, might have no idea what they were even talking about.

Everyone unanimously declined to participate. The following day, a group chat was set up on Skype with a certain Silvio, who was one of the top people at PGL (or the top person, I’m not sure). The chat included all the people who’d declined to participate, Silvio, and a Starladder employee. Silvio introduced himself, said that Starladder had been chosen as the contractor, and that the people were invited to work on December 2–11. “Any questions?” was the last sentence of that message. It sounded as if decisions had already been made and no-one had a choice. This is hardly how an official invitation to a tournament ought to look like. Over the course of the following hour, the same thing happened all over again: all the analysts and the presenter declined to participate. “OK”, Silvio wrote, and the conversation ended.

That same evening, it turned out Valve had been entirely out of the loop on the bidding prodecure and PGL’s choice of Starladder. This is not to complain about Valve, who had after all handed over the organization of the tournament to other people. Nonetheless, the matter was investigated, as it was in no-one’s best interest to leave viewers without analysis at an official livestream. In a conversation, RuHub found out that the bid had actually never existed. The bids had been a pure formality, and PGL had ALREADY handed over the organization of the analyst panel at the point when RuHub had only just sent their bid in—Starladder hadn’t even written theirs. The absurdity of the situation was at its peak.

Valve’s decision was to give the livestream to RuHub, which PGL had no choice but to accept. The viewers won out, as besides the invited analysts, it was now possible to get together a full-fledged analyst panel in Moscow. RuHub provided the money that was paid to the unofficial analysts. In total, RuHub took pretty much money out of its own pocket, even though setting up the Russian stream was initially supposed to be funded by PGL. With the amount they’d provided, however, if not a penny had been spent on RuHub’s part, the analysts would’ve been sitting on stools in front of a coffee table with an old Soviet portable TV set to watch the matches on.

Speaking of money, PGL naturally decided to cut the salaries too. Compared to Manila, where everyone was paid what we can designate as 1.3k gold, the Boston salary was 1.0k gold for everyone, with no distinctions. Moreover, people would only find out how much they were paid upon checking their bank accounts a month after the tournament. Meaning that PGL didn’t have a definitive notion of a salary in mind. Not as far as Russian talents were concerned, anyway. English speakers always engage in personal dialog with the organizers and negotiate their salaries themselves. For instance, the absolute top-tier commentators and analysts can earn 4k gold for a tournament; for talents in a league below them, the figure is 2–3k gold; and for the presenter, 5–6k. In a handful of cases, with the young and inexperienced, the organizers are able to pull off paying what they pay the Russian speakers. The organizers didn’t want to discuss the issue of salaries with our representatives; they weren’t interested.

It was time for the tournament to begin. Out of the entire coverage staff, 6 commentators traveled to it at PGL’s expense (Lex had been refused a visa), along with 3 or 4 tech people, and that was it. Whereas earlier, any organizer would provide the budget for a content maker and a cameraperson, this time, the suggestion was to bring them along at one’s own expense, or not at all. Doesn’t that sound like a good idea.

Upon arriving at the tournament, the commentators and players began to feel the austerity. “You only get food if you work/play on that particular day” is a really strange formula. And while an organization like EG might not particularly care who paid for their lunch, it could be a problem for teams without an organization or sponsor. Thankfully, the commentators did work every day, so they got food every day too. Its quality, however, left something to be desired. There were other small organizational nuisances, but they weren’t critical and it’s hard to remember most of them by now. 

The Kiev Major

You might think those were the juiciest and most interesting bits of this letter, but wait, there’s more. Quite likely, if the Kiev tournament had gone well, this letter wouldn’t have had to be written in the first place. This time, however, the organizers went even further. 

People started getting invitations to the tournament at the end of March. A new system was introduced. Besides the main invites, there was a list of backup commentators and analysts: those who would be invited if some of the core ones were for some reason unable to go to the tournament. People began to wonder what Valve’s selection principles even were.

There was information that Valve put a certain “committee” in charge of selecting people for large tournaments. Said “committee” consists of a certain number of people who assess the quality and working style of various personalities, and come up with a list of required invitations based on their own judgement. Here another question arises: who selected the “committee” members themselves, and on what basis? No names are provided, for no apparent reason. That is to say, there is of course one obvious reason, and that’s to prevent any attempts at influencing these people to get them to pick personalities that would otherwise not have been invited. But there are two sides to this coin. A member of the “committee” may also be inherently biased against a specific person and be a factor in their absence from tournaments. 

In and of itself, putting a group of people together is a very good idea, since it immediately precludes any bribery on the part of competing organizations. However, in order that the group itself doesn’t raise any questions, their identities ought to be disclosed and an explanation provided as to what merits and/or accomplishments earned these particular people the honor of assessing the work of talents. 

Another problem with the issuing of invites was their quantity. An odd number of commentators and an odd number of analysts made planning our work and schedules complicated. I’m going to skip ahead here and show you an ordinary example: here we have 7 invited commentators (with 4 parallel livestreams during the group stage), and 5 analysts (so there’s no sensible way to split them into shifts). What was the problem with inviting one more commentator and one more analyst? We never got an answer to that question. The funniest thing about it all was that the number of people invited to the “home major” was one-and-a-half times smaller than the number of talents at the English-language studio. And while that system hadn’t raised too many questions before, this time the decision was quite baffling. 

But enough about invites already. They invited who they invited, even if it did cause a number of problems. After the invites were issued, discussions began between PGL and the Russian-language talents concerning payment and everything else. Shouldn’t the very fact that an inviter doesn’t bring a specific salary offer to the table, raise some eyebrows in 2017? It certainly raised ours.

v1lat was chosen to speak on behalf of the Russian-language talents, as there was no point in discussing it all individually. We were on friendly terms with each other and wanted to present a united front rather than be disparate voices. For the first few weeks, PGL was evasive, didn’t name any sums and was generally trying to avoid clearly answering the remuneration question. Finally, they said everyone would have the same salary as in Boston (1,000 gold), regardless of their workload. In the meantime, the English-language talents were each discussing their salaries individually, and there was talk of the organizers paying certain personalities 500 gold per work day + 300 gold for flight days, adding up to about 4,000/5,000.

A situation like that suited pretty much no-one. Firstly, working in the hall is a bit of a different story from sitting back and just working for the internet. When you see people behind your back, when you’re in the same room with them, you can’t help feeling that much more nervous. 

Meanwhile, an option discussed with v1lat was for him to not be a commentator at the tournament at all, but instead, to be the presenter, interviewer, and interpreter for the official Russian livestream. The discussion got stuck as Vitaly didn’t want to do that, and PGL forgot about that conversation. However, the topic of money continued to be discussed. PGL were actively insisting, “This is all the budget you’ve got, there won’t be any more money.” The talents started to get annoyed; PGL’s indifference was stupefying for many. A week before the official announcement, the Romanians simply ceased all communication with the Russian-language talents, ignoring them completely. Nice business tactic there, present them with a fait accompli and then just ignore them. Many considered pulling out of the tournament. Perhaps if that decision had been made, we’d have been able to break PGL. But this being a domestic Major who everyone, with no exceptions, wanted to work at, the pressure was much too strong for us to be able to gather our willpower and walk out. In the end, PGL’s tactic worked. While they were ignoring our folks, and we for our part couldn’t reach a consensus, the official announcement was made, and there was nothing more to be done. PGL had won.
 
People stopped thinking about money; the important thing was after all to make sure the domestic Major goes well, to prove that the CIS deserved to see a return of Valve’s tournaments in the seasons to come. A few days before the tournament, the talents from Russia found out that there’d be no invites from the organizers, i.e. PGL didn’t care at all whether people would get to Kiev or not, it just wasn’t their concern. Visas are another matter, where no-one is protected from a potential refusal. But people have always been getting invitations. Here, however, the approach was “sort it out on your own”. It’s very fortunate that RuHub and Starladder are based in Kiev, as it was they who sent the invitation to the Russians. However, PGL’s indifference started to get positively irritating at that point.

The talents from Russia were scheduled to arrive on April 20. And accommodated at a $400-a-night hotel. Yet again, one is left wondering: what’s the point of bringing people in four days in advance, when they could arrive a day or two before the tournament (the Kiev/Moscow difference is indeed greater than, say, the Moscow/Seattle one) and bring in another person with the money saved (13 x 400 x 2 = $10,400). In the end, they didn’t have to book a hotel for the Kiev folks (v1lat, Faker, GodHunt and Goblak), and that would have given them the money to bring in another person or even two. Yet PGL has a certain problem reasoning logically. 

After everyone arrived and was accommodated, the Romanians decided to have a private conversation with v1lat so that an earlier, unfinished chat on Skype could be brought to a meaningful conclusion. In the course of that meeting, it turned out PGL had FORGOTTEN that a tournament required a presenter on stage, an interviewer and an interpreter. No big deal, you know, just the main organizer of a tournament forgetting to invite three extra people, happens all the time. Vitaly was told the following: “It’s your crowd, and frankly, we don’t care what you’re going to do. Have the interviews interpreted if you wish, or don’t. This is your business, it’s got nothing to do with us.” I suppose it goes without saying that Vitaly was not going to get any additional payment for taking charge of these tasks.

Naturally, Vitaly wasn’t satisfied with this arrangement, and refused it (although he did act as an interpreter in the end). Salary raises continued to be discussed that same evening. PGL only agreed to give some extra coin (1,200 gold instead of 1,000) to a single person: Faker, the main host. The following explanation was provided: “We took a look at the schedule and didn’t expect there to be so much work.” Towards the end of the tournament, they’d go back on their promise and say he’d be getting as much as the others, seeing as there was no budget for anything else after all––hence 1,000, and that’s the end of that.
A new catering strategy was also tested at the tournament: people ordered food from restaurants with MCW Events twice a day, and the latter was in charge of delivery. I don’t want to go into detail on that situation, but long story short, half of the orders took 4 hours to be delivered, some weren’t delivered at all, some people had their orders mixed up, etc. Overall, no-one was surprised, as that system had looked flawed from the outset.

It was tournament time. The English broadcasters were working from Romania, and the Russian ones, from the CyberArena in Kiev. First game; everything’s fine. Except the English stream had live reporting with cameras at the hotel, and the Russian one didn’t. Why not? Because the Romanians had forgotten there was a Russian stream. Thankfully, the head producer of the Russian broadcast took to flooding the Romanians’ inboxes until, starting from the second game, the live reports were there. 

Also people might have noticed that the look of the Russian stream was quite different from what PGL was showing. The problem was that the tournament’s chief organizer was acting as if they were exclusively a contractor of the English stream and no-one else. For this reason, plans concerning the content of the English stream were never put forward. 

But that wasn’t the problem. Our analysts’ biggest complaint was the absence of ordinary laptops. This was something that had never been seen at a tournament before. Of late, folks had stopped bringing their own laptops, seeing as organizers often ask not to put them in shot, since some models would not fit in and would ruin the visual cohesion, etc. That was why there were no personal laptops at the tournament. Neither, however, had any been provided by the organizers. And that problem wasn’t dealt with before the end of the tournament, even though there were some hopes. The absence of laptops adversely affected the quality of analysts’ work, as they had to analyze matches based solely on what the observer was showing, and nothing else.
 
The group stage trudged to its conclusion; streams were on for 15 hours a day, but everyone was preparing for the playoffs, so there weren’t any particularly strong misgivings. Everybody wanted to focus their attention on what was the main event of the year for the CIS. 

The plan for the analysis room was to make it very impressive-looking and “swanky”. But then on the night before the broadcast, the table that was supposed to be inside it broke, so we had to fetch the one from the CyberArena. No-one went into details on how and why it had broken, but it already was a bit of a disappointment. Later, there was information that the broken table story was made up, and there’d been no table to begin with. That information, however, is an unconfirmed rumor, so we’ll leave it at that. There were also no laptops, but you could already see that on our streams. 

The following directions came from the Romanians during the playoff stage: “Anyone who wasn’t officially invited to cover this tournament CANNOT take part in activities.” You’ve seen live segments with Dendi, XBOCT, ArtStyle, Resolut1on, and Fly. That was initially forbidden. PGL itself stopped bothering about its own rule on the second day of the playoffs, and we made use of the opportunity. Aside from that, the credit for what did go on the stream—what there was of it—should go to the talents and the Russian production team. PGL was entirely fine with just having an “analysis, match, analysis” type of broadcast, without any video content if need be. 

All of the camera people, editors, interviewers and others worked pro bono here; they received no payment for their work. And, most importantly, PGL had complaints even there. In the CyberKiev video where v1lat was sitting on the CyberArena stage talking about the history of Dota and the Kiev esports scene, the Romanians spotted a half-covered Blizzard logo behind his back. Notably, Valve wasn’t particularly bothered about it, while PGL simply couldn’t live it down. Here we see them no longer completely unconcerned about what was going on the Russian stream. They simply sought to complicate things for everyone, and they were willing to use any petty pretext for that. 

There was a clear problem with the schedule and match times. Playing would go on for 16 hours, partially due to large pauses between individual games and the series themselves. However, on the third day, PGL shortened the airtime of various interview at its own discretion, so games now took a little less time to begin. Nevertheless, it did not crucially affect the schedule, as the third matchday still finished long past midnight. However, the organizers showed understanding in responding to this situation (their only appropriate response during the tournament), and thus they allowed the analysis panel to finish working earlier and get at least 5–6 hours of sleep (here we ought to point out that these people woke up an hour and a half before going live, and went to bed half an hour after broadcasting ended). 

The problem of PGL’s indifference to the Russian-language talents manifested itself in every kind of small details. For example, on the first day, the talents asked for juice to be added to the selection of drinks, where Red Bulls and sodas were on offer. PGL ignored that request for two days. At the tournament itself, there were several Valve representatives, and when on the third day the talent asked the same of Valve, juice and ice tea were available at the canteen a mere hour later. A small but very telling detail. 

As workers, we were left with an ambivalent feeling after the tournament. The home crowd had certainly saved the event; everybody was pleased to work for their own audience, and gave it their best. But many of us strongly resented PGL’s indifference and complete lack of interest in delivering a good product to the local audience. We’re anything but spoilt, but none of us had ever encountered an attitude like that at a Valve tournament. It was this indifference, this couldn’t-care-less mindset, that led me to write this letter.

I’d like to end my letter on the same note I started it with. Dear Valve, please make sense of this situation and conduct your own investigation. The Russian-language talents and production staff are at the end of their strength and willingness to work with PGL on any future event. I hope you will take steps and we’ll once again be able to bring joy and positivity that will not only be characteristic of our work, but also felt by us when we aren’t facing the cameras. 
For their part, readers and ordinary viewers will probably be able to draw a lot of interesting information from all that’s been written here.
To summarize, let’s go through the main points of this letter:

1.  The Manila Major was fantastic; we were endeared by the comfortable working environment the organizers had created.
2.  Ahead of Boston, Valve implements a new system of studio operation, with on-site commentators and stay-at-home analysis panels. There is a need for an additional contractor for the analysis panel.
3.  PGL announces a bidding procedure, but makes its own choice in favor of Starladder even before the deadline for the bids, as the head of PGL is good friends with the head of Starladder.
4.  Valve finds out about this manipulation and hands organizing Boston over to RuHub. Meanwhile, the budget PGL was supposed to provide for setting up the studio is virtually nonexistent, and RuHub spends a big amount of money out of its own pocket.
5.  Information appears ahead of The Kiev Major about a talent-selecting committee whose members’ names are not disclosed. It’s never established who these people are and what gives weight to their votes. 
6.  PGL present everyone with their invitations as a fait accompli, without any mention of salaries. Over the two weeks that follow, the Romanians dodge the question, and then say the pay will be the same as in Boston; when an attempt is made to discuss a raise, they cite a limited budget and begin to ignore all attempts at contact.
7.  Kiev Major becomes the first tournament whose organizers refuse to send invitations to talents and say it isn’t their problem.
8.  After everyone has gathered in Kiev, PGL organize a meeting with Vilat, at which they mention in conversation that they are completely indifferent to what happens on the Russian stream, whether it will have translations of interviews, live reporting, or anything else. This is not the concern of the tournament’s chief organizer. 
9.  Every request made during the course of the tournament, even a small one, is completely ignored by PGL. Meanwhile, Valve staff present at the same event resolve the same issues in minutes. 
10.  PGL’s indifference to Russian coverage is haunting people throughout the event. Instead of the tournament’s chief organizer, PGL look like a contractor of the English stream.

I just wrote a book called DEVIATE about the science of seeing differently and am here to talk about it. AMA!","Hello Reddit! I am Dr. Beau Lotto, a neuroscientist fascinated with human perception for over 25 years now.
Originally from Seattle, Washington, I have lived in the United Kingdom for over twenty years and is a Professor at University College London. I received my undergraduate degree from UC Berkeley, my PhD from the University of Edinburgh Medical School, and was a fellow at Duke University. I’m Founder / CEO of Ripple Inc, which is a NY based company which owns IP (and patents) in AR
Ripple has two products: Meego and Traces. The former is a Social platform and the latter an Enterprise platform … both in AR.
 
I am also the Founder and CEO of Lab of Misfits Studio, the world’s first neuro-design studio. The lab creates unique real-world ‘experiential-experiments’ that places the public at the centre of the process of discovery. By spanning social and personal boundaries between people, brands and institutions, our aim is to create, expand and apply their insights into what it is to be perceiving human.  
 
What is perception? Perception is the foundation of human experience, but few of us understand why we see what we do, much less how. By revealing the startling truths about the brain and its perceptions, I show that the next big innovation is not a new technology: it is a new way of seeing!
 
What do we really see? Do we really see reality? We never see the world as it actually is, but only the world that is useful for us to see.
Our brains have not evolved to see the world accurately. In my new book DEVIATE, and what I’m here to talk about today, is the science of perception, how we can see differently, and how to unlock our ability to create, innovate and effect change. You can check out my recent TED Talk on the subject, or poke around my website to see some optical illusions, and feel free to ask me questions about things like dressgate, and how to use perception in nature, groups, while using technology and in solitude – and how we can unlock  our creative potential in every aspect of our lives.

Well, today I have the pleasure as a Patriots fan, to talk about how great the New England Patriots are.

In case you were not aware, the team is meeting with President Trump today because the New England Patriots won the Super Bowl. 

And also, if you aren't big into the NFL, this is the [fifth Super Bowl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNe8MnTgc34) championship for Tom Brady and the New England Patriots.

#Super Bowl LI Overview

If you aren't aware of how great Super Bowl LI was, here's [a highlights video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=016LXFHpFCk). Before this game, the largest comeback in Super Bowl history was 10 points, achieved by Tom Brady and the New England Patriots in 2015 agains the Seattle Seahawks.

This Super Bowl involved the Patriots being down 28-3 with a little over 1 quarter left in the game. The New England Patriots had to come back from a deficit 250% more than the largest come back in Super Bowl history, and they only had 17 minutes to do it. They ended up needing a little extra time to fully win the game in OT, but this was the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history.

This Morning MAGAThread won't talk so much about this Super Bowl, but we will talk about how much of [winners Tom Brady, Bill Belichick, and Bob Kraft are.](http://i.imgs.fyi/img/e3s.png) 

#Robert Kraft

Robert Kraft is the owner of the New England Patriots. He bought the team in 1994 and saved the New England Patriots from being relocated to another city.

Unfortunately in 2011, Robert Kraft's wife of 48 years, Myra Kraft, passed away. While Robert Kraft was in the lowest point of his life, his good friend Donald J. Trump [would call him every month and try to keep him active](http://archive.is/3fh67).

Donald J. Trump has remained good friends with Robert Kraft even through the massive fake news around our President. 

After winning his fifth Super Bowl, Robert Kraft celebrated a little afterwards with [President Trump and the Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzō Abe, in Mar-a-lago.](http://i.imgs.fyi/img/e3w.jpg)


#Bill Belichick

Bill Belichick is the head coach and general manager of the New England Patriots. He has a 237-115 record in the regular season and a 25-10 record in the post season as a head coach. He has coached the Patriots since the year 2000. 

He has set the record for most Super Bowl wins as a head coach and he is further cementing his legacy as potentially the greatest head coach of all time.

On top of being the greatest head coach of all time, he also is great friends with Donald J. Trump.

The following is a [transcript of a letter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSCfbMPY7EI&amp;t=91s) he wrote to Donald J. Trump on November 7th, a day before the general election that elected Trump to be our 45th President of the United States.

&gt; ***""Congratulations on a tremendous campaign. You have dealt with an unbelievable slanted and negative media, and have come out beautifully – beautifully. You’ve proved to be the ultimate competitor and fighter. Your leadership is amazing. I have always had tremendous respect for you, but the toughness and perseverance you have displayed over the past year is remarkable. Hopefully tomorrow’s election results will give the opportunity to make America great again. Best wishes for great results tomorrow.***

&gt;***Bill***""


Yes, Bill Belichick confirmed that he did write the letter and that he and Donald J. Trump are great friends.

#Tom Brady

Tom Brady is the Greatest Quarterback to ever play in the NFL. He has long been called the comeback kid, and he proved it once again in Super Bowl LI. 

Tom Brady's career started as a 6th round pick (pick 199 in the draft to be exact) back in the 2000 NFL draft. Everyone wrote him off. SIX OTHER QUARTERBACKS were drafted before Tom Brady. 

You can watch one of the best documentaries on Brady and the 6 people drafted ahead of him (titled the Brady 6) [right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHJMfF-3FD0).

Tom Brady told Robert Kraft that he was the best decision the organization will ever make, and he has proven himself right.

He has the most Super Bowl wins for any QB in history at 5 and he has the most Super Bowl appearances with 7. He has the most wins in the post season with 25, which is 9 more wins than the next closest in Joe Montana. He has the most yards ever thrown in a Super Bowl game and he led the Patriots to the top 2 largest come backs ever in Super Bowl history.

Tom Brady is a winner in every way possible. And like all winners, he is on the winning train as he is great friends with Donald J. Trump.

Not only was he spotted [with a MAGA hat in his locker](http://i.imgs.fyi/img/e43.jpg), and not only does he [hang out with Donald J. Trump](http://i.imgs.fyi/img/e44.jpg), Tom Brady also [voted for Donald Trump to be President!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSCfbMPY7EI&amp;t=19s)

---

So today, at 1:20 PM Trump Time, the New England Patriots will be greeted by the President of the United States. At 2:30 PM President Donald J. Trump will welcome the team at the White House to the Press.

If these stories don't make you love winning and respect the fact that you can achieve anything and that anything is possible, I don't know what would!

It feels fitting that the first team that President Trump welcomes to the White House consists of three close friends in Robert Kraft (the Owner), Bill Belichick  (GOAT coach), and Tom Brady (GOAT QB) and not only are they all friends, they are all TRUE PATRIOTS.

JaguarGator9,2017-04-18 01:18:20+00:00,[OC] Why 58.5% is the magic number for QBs in the NFL Draft,"With the NFL Draft coming up in just a few days now, a lot of teams are looking to find that franchise quarterback. When people look for traits in a quarterback, it varies. Some look for intelligence. Others look for mobility. Others look for pocket presence and ability to throw under pressure. Others look for leadership. And some look at how many people attended their birthday party.

But the most important trait a quarterback can have, without a doubt, is whether or not they can complete a pass. I know it seems obvious, but you want a quarterback that can actually throw the ball and complete his passes.

Amazingly enough, there are teams that don’t look for this. There are some teams that take quarterbacks that, in college, had insanely low completion percentages and magically hope they’ll be able to turn it around. There are very few players that did nothing in college that magically turned it around and played well at the professional level, and the same applies for quarterbacks. Despite this, teams have taken chances on quarterbacks that can’t complete a pass, but display some sort of potential or intangible that ends up being completely meaningless when all is said and done.

Is there a magic number for college to determine the baseline of quarterbacks? Is there a number where you can flat out say they will not be good, and where you can save yourself the trouble of looking at the tape? Let’s find out.

**Part I: The Formula**

I looked at every NFL Draft since 2002, when the Houston Texans joined the league. The magic number I came upon was **58.5%.** Simply put, if a QB completes above 58.5% of their passes in college, they’re at least worth a look (for me, the bar is set at 60%, but there are some exceptions to this rule). If a QB completes 58.5% of their passes or less, then in all likelihood, they’ll be complete garbage.

I took a look at a few things when creating this list:

- If a QB got injured that season and didn’t have a large enough sample size, I don’t count that. For that reason, Sam Bradford does not make this list, as he barely threw any passes his final season before getting hurt twice (in games against BYU and Texas). The QB had to play at least a substantial portion of the season before getting hurt for it to count.

- If a QB was a backup in college, it’s fair game. Doesn’t matter how many passes they threw- if they were a backup and didn’t get a whole lot of playing time, that’s fine. For this list, this ended up not applying

- I did not count any QBs playing at the FCS (I-AA) level or lower. The reason for this is not me cherry-picking, but rather, because after a certain year, I was unable to find any stats on some QBs at that level. Only FBS (I-A) quarterbacks are on this list

- If a player got drafted into the league as a QB but got converted after the fact (like BJ Daniels), they’re on the list. If a player played QB in college but converted beforehand (like Matt Jones and Denard Robinson), they’re not on the list.

- I am only counting what they did for the team that they got drafted by. That’s how you evaluate a draft pick- by how well they play for your team. If there’s a QB on the list that got drafted by Seattle, did nothing for Seattle, but then went on and dominated with Philadelphia, I’m only looking at the Seattle stats. This only (and barely) applies to one QB on the list (Luke McCown)

- I am excluding the 2015 and 2016 drafts, because part of this is retrospective. If it takes 3 years to truly evaluate a draft class, then I’ll give it 3 years. For this reason, we are looking at the NFL Draft from 2002-2014

So, with that being said, what quarterbacks from 2002-2014 ended up fulfilling this criteria?

**Part II: The Historic List**

Again, I am only counting their completion percentage in their final year of college. If they threw for 70% in their sophomore and junior seasons but just 52% in their senior year, they’re on here. Likewise, if they threw for 30% in their junior season but went 67% in their senior season, they’re exempt.

Year of Draft | QB | College | Final Year Completion Percentage | Draft | Result
---- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | -----
2014 | Logan Thomas | Virginia Tech | 56.5% | R4, P120- Arizona | Went 1-for-9 with Arizona in 2014 before being released at the end of the 2015 preseason after just 1 season
2013 | BJ Daniels | South Florida | 56.9% | R7, P237- San Francisco | Never made the active roster with the 49ers. Switched to WR in 2015
2012 | Ryan Lindley | San Diego State | 53% | R6, P185- Arizona | Finished career with 3 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. Threw 0 touchdowns and 7 interceptions his rookie season. Currently in the CFL with the Ottawa RedBlacks
2011 | Jake Locker | Washington | 55.4% | R1, P8- Tennessee | Retired after suffering numerous injuries. Finished with just 27 touchdown passes in 4 seasons, and never had a completion percentage above 61% in any season. Titans go 9-14 under Locker
2011 | Nathan Enderle | Idaho | 56.7% | R5, P160- Chicago | Never threw a pass in the NFL. Cut after 1 season with the Bears
2010 | Jonathan Crompton | Tennessee | 58.3% | R5, P168- San Diego | Never made an active roster at the NFL level, and was cut after the 2010 preseason by the Chargers
2010 | Rusty Smith | Florida Atlantic | 57.3% | R6, P176- Tennessee | Finished his career with 0 touchdown passes and 4 interceptions. Lone start in his career was a 20-0 shutout to the Texans
2008 | Chad Henne | Michigan | 58.3% | R2, P57- Miami | Finished 4-year career with the Dolphins with 31 touchdowns and 37 interceptions. Currently is the backup on the Jaguars
2008 | Kevin O’Connell | San Diego State | 58.5% | R3, P94- New England | Threw a grand total of 6 passes during his NFL career for 23 yards
2008 | Matt Flynn | LSU | 56.3% | R7, P209- Green Bay | One of the few on this list to work out, but this is speaking strictly as a value pick in the 7th round for a backup QB. Highlight of career- throwing for 480 yards and 6 touchdowns in the 2011 season finale against Detroit
2007 | Isaiah Stanback | Washington | 53.4% | R4, P103- Dallas | Converted to WR. Never threw a pass in the NFL
2006 | Reggie McNeal | Texas A&amp;M | 53.2% | R6, P193- Cincinnati | Converted to WR. Never threw a pass in the NFL
2006 | DJ Shockley | Georgia | 55.8% | R7, P223- Atlanta | Never threw an NFL pass. Only passes in professional football came as a member of the Omaha Nighthawks in 2010 of the UFL, where he went 2-for-5 with an interception
2004 | Luke McCown | Louisiana Tech | 56.9% | R4, P106- Cleveland | Played 1 season with the Browns before being traded in 2005. Threw 4 touchdowns and 7 interceptions, failing to win a game in any of his 4 starts
2004 | Craig Krenzel | Ohio State | 55% | R5, P148- Chicago | Started 5 games for the Bears, throwing 3 touchdowns and 6 interceptions. Cut by the Bears in 2005
2004 | Jim Sorgi | Wisconsin | 56.5% | R6, P193- Indianapolis | Never started an NFL game (in fairness to Sorgi, Peyton Manning was the QB ahead of him on the depth chart)
2004 | Cody Pickett | Washington | 56.6% | R7, P217- San Francisco | Started 2 games for the 49ers in 2 seasons, throwing 0 touchdowns and 4 interceptions. Traded to the Texans in 2006
2004 | Casey Bramlet | Wyoming | 56.7% | R7, P218- Cincinnati | Never played a down for the Bengals, and was released in 2005
2003 | Kyle Boller | California | 53.4% | R1, P19- Baltimore | Want to preface this by saying this was Boller’s **highest completion percentage in college.** It was the first year he threw above 50%. No idea what the Ravens were thinking here, even with the benefit of hindsight. He winds up completing just 56.9% of his passes with the Ravens, and finished with 45 touchdowns on 44 interceptions. He started double-digit games for the Ravens just once over 6 seasons
2003 | Rex Grossman | Florida | 57.1% | R1, P22- Chicago | He made a Super Bowl as a starting QB… but not because of his play. He finished his 6 seasons in Chicago with 33 TDs on just 35 interceptions, and only started 8 games in a season once in 6 years with the Bears
2003 | Dave Ragone | Louisville | 53.7% | R3, P88- Houston | Spent 3 years with the Texans, and never threw a touchdown pass. Played in just 2 games, where he lost both of them and completed just 50% of his passes for 135 yards
2003 | Seneca Wallace | Iowa State | 55.1% | R4, P110- Seattle | This pick actually worked out for Seattle. Not a good starter, but a serviceable backup. Played 7 seasons with the Seahawks, and when called into action, threw 25 touchdowns on 14 interceptions. Never started more than 8 games in a season for any team
2003 | Brian St. Pierre | Boston College | 58.2% | R5, P163- Pittsburgh | Threw just 1 pass for the Steelers in 2 seasons. Got cut at the end of the 2005 preseason
2003 | Brooks Bollinger | Wisconsin | 53.5% | R6, P200- NY Jets | Played 3 seasons for the Jets, where he went just 2-7 and threw a grand total of 7 touchdown passes in 12 games over 9 starts. He was named the UFL MVP in 2009, though, so at least he’s got that going for him
2003 | Gibran Hamdan | Indiana | 51.9% | R7, P232- Washington | First player of Pakistani descent to ever play in the NFL. Finished his career with just 2 passes thrown and 7 yards, playing just 1 season with Washington
2003 | Ken Dorsey | Miami (FL) | 56.5% | R7, P241- San Francisco | Went just 2-8 with the 49ers and 2-11 over his career. Played 3 seasons with the 49ers, throwing 8 touchdowns on 11 interceptions, and finished his career with 8 TDs on 18 INTs. Had a career completion percentage of just 52.5%
2002 | Patrick Ramsey | Tulane | 57.1% | R1, P32- Washington | Completed just 55.7% of his passes with Washington, only starting 8+ games in a season once over 4 years. Started just 24 games, despite being a first round pick
2002 | David Garrard | ECU | 56.6% | R4, P108- Jacksonville | Hands down, the best player on this list. Solid starting QB for the Jaguars before his release after the 2011 preseason. Threw 89 touchdowns for the Jaguars while starting 76 games, and made the Pro Bowl in 2009 (don’t know how he made the Pro Bowl that year, but it makes up for 2007, when he didn’t make it despite throwing just 3 interceptions, and none before the start of December)
2002 | Randy Fasani | Stanford | 51.5% | R5, P137- Carolina | Played 4 games for the Panthers and started 1. In that start, he went 5-for-18 with no touchdowns, 3 interceptions, 46 yards, and a 0.0 passer rating. Not surprisingly, he did not play for the Panthers after 2002
2002 | Kurt Kittner | Illinois | 55.3% | R5, P158- Atlanta | Played 2 seasons for the Falcons, where he completed 38.6% of his passes, threw 6 interceptions, and had a passer rating of 32.5. For comparison, if I entered an NFL game and threw nothing but incomplete passes, my passer rating would be higher than that
2002 | Steve Bellisari | Ohio State | 53% | R6, P205- St. Louis Rams | Converted to safety for some reason. Never played a game with the Rams
2002 | Ronald Curry | North Carolina | 46.3% | R7, P235- Oakland | Why you’d draft a QB that had a career completion percentage of 49.6% and threw just 8 touchdowns in 10 games in his senior year on a 46.3% completion percentage, I don’t know. He got converted to WR straight away

**Part III: The Analysis**

From 2002-2014, there were 31 quarterbacks that had a completion percentage of 58.5% or worse, but ended up getting drafted. Of those 31 quarterbacks, only one of them (David Garrard) ended up becoming a decent starter. Some, like Seneca Wallace, Matt Flynn, Chad Henne, and even Jim Sorgi to an extent, became quality backups. Most flamed out in a blaze of glory, or didn’t even make the roster initially, or changed position despite getting drafted into the league at quarterback.

If you’re a team and you’re drafting a QB that has a completion percentage of 58.5% or worse, the best possible result you will get is David Garrard. Garrard was a good quarterback (frustratingly inconsistent, but a solid quarterback nonetheless), but he should never be used as the benchmark for anything. If David Garrard is the best possible situation (not the average, but the best situation), then that should tell you all you need to know about drafting a QB with a completion percentage along those lines.

Four teams drafted a QB under these criteria in the first round (Tennessee with Jake Locker, Baltimore with Kyle Boller, Chicago with Rex Grossman, and Washington with Patrick Ramsey). All four of those teams moved on from their quarterback before the second contract. Jake Locker had some injury history and maybe had a chance to be decent, but none of those quarterbacks even came close to working out.

Two quarterbacks were drafted in the third round (Kevin O’Connell and Dave Ragone). The two third round quarterbacks combined for a grand total of zero touchdown passes across their NFL careers. Not exactly what you want out of your third round pick.

Some teams never learn, and the 49ers are a prime example of that. Since 2002, they’ve drafted 3 quarterbacks with completion percentages below this magic number. BJ Daniels never made the active roster for the 49ers, and now plays wide receiver (he was not drafted with the intent of this conversion; that happened once he joined a different team). Cody Pickett didn’t throw a touchdown pass. Ken Dorsey had a TD:INT ratio that was worse than 1:2. These 3 quarterbacks combined for 8 touchdowns and 22 interceptions over the course of their entire NFL careers.

**Part IV: Who to Avoid**

With all of that being said, what QBs in this year’s draft at the FBS level threw for a completion percentage of 58.5% or worse last season? I took a look at the top 1,000 prospects according to CBS and just looked at the quarterbacks. There are some QBs not on this list that meet these criteria even though they are draft eligible, but that’s because they were not on the list of prospects, and therefore, have an incredibly slim chance of even stepping on an NFL 90-man roster. 

Nobody at the top of the draft meets these criteria (though Kizer came awfully close at 58.7%), so for teams thinking about taking Trubisky or Watson, don’t worry. There’s plenty of other flaws for you to worry about that don’t involve completion percentage with those two. Here’s a look at the quarterbacks that you want to avoid at all cost in this draft, because their ridiculously high ceiling is David Garrard, their normal ceiling is a serviceable but not great backup, and their floor is a guy that won’t even make the roster or will be thrown into a game and have a passer rating that’s laughably bad.

QB | School | Completion Percentage
---- | ----- | -----
CJ Beathard | Iowa | 56.5%
Trevor Knight | Texas A&amp;M | 53.5%
Seth Russell | Baylor | 54.7%
Jeremy Johnson | Auburn | 57.4%
Wes Lunt | Illinois | 54.7%
Mitch Leidner | Minnesota | 56.4%
Patrick Towles | Boston College | 50.5%
Gunner Kiel | Cincinnati | 52%
Mike Fafaul | UCLA | 52.1%
Phillip (PJ) Walker | Temple | 58.2%
Matt Johns | Virginia | 57.1%

**Part V: Conclusion**

If a quarterback can’t complete a pass, it’s probably not the best idea to draft said quarterback. If a quarterback has a poor completion percentage, that will not change in the NFL. The switch will not be flipped, and no amount of coaching or mechanic-fixing will change this. Bad completion percentages stay bad, and bad quarterbacks at the collegiate level stay bad.

If, in a sample size of 31, David Garrard is the unquestionable best quarterback on the list (it’s not even up for debate; nobody else on that list comes close to David Garrard. The gap between Garrard and the next best QB on the list is like the gap between Joe Flacco and the next best QB to ever play for the Ravens- there’s no reasonable debate whatsoever), then maybe it’s not a good idea to draft someone who will fall into that group.

SPEZ: Here's some 'feminist' littrachaw that'll show you just how much feminists these days just love luring women and young girls into porn and prostitution.

Interestingly, the SAME prof who wrote the NYT 'scholarly' Op-Ed piece on how porn empowers women teaches a class at UC Santa Barbara ... on porn. And guess what? She was arrested in 2014 for ASSAULTING a pro-life activist who was ... a teenage girl. Interesting how this feminist woman apparently had no qualms about inflicting violence on a young girl simply because the young teenage girl was opposed to abortion.

I'm in Australia. Dating a guy. 

While dating, the house he owned got sold, and to celebrate he decided that we should go on a holiday to the States. So, I planned it, booked it, and he paid for it. 5 weeks throughout the States.  
After about 4 months of dating, and just before we left for the holiday, it became quite apparent that he really like his alcohol...alot.  

Moving forward, we go on our holiday. On the flight from Australia to L.A., he got soooooo drunk, and then his true colours came out. He was making absolutely horrid derogatory remarks to me (calling me a slut, a worthless woman...etc). I sat there, leaned up against the window and tried to sleep.  

I managed to get the flight attendants attention, and motioned to her to cut his alcohol service. She did this. It didn't really make much of a difference...he had alcohol stashed from earlier.  

I had to get up to use the bathroom, and when I came back I noticed that my handbag had been opened. I checked everything, and found that he had taken my credit card out and broken it up, and also taken the $600US I had in there as well. Basically he now held me hostage as I had no access now to my other funds.  

We landed, and I stuck to his side. He had started to sober up, and when I told him what he had done he was so apologetic. He gave me the cash back, and all the cash he had, plus the spare pre-paid credit card he had. I would be ok.  I wasn't going to let him out of my sight. Plus, all hotel bookings we had were in his name. I really didn't have a choice. 

We had our holiday, Seattle, San Francisco, Vegas (where he got really really drunk again and I ended up sleeping in the bathroom on the floor), Anaheim, New York and Nova Scotia.  

I put up with stuff that I would not normally put up with, but I was not going to let shit get on top of me while I was in a foreign country. I'm strong, but I also know when I've had enough.  

On our last night in New York City, he got so ridiculously drunk, that he couldn't even stand up. We are both smokers, so rather than have him yelling at the top of his voice at me in the unit, I took him downstairs to the smoking area to try and get me and him into the public eye. I actually felt safer doing that.  

It was while we were sitting there, (and I didn't want to look him in the eye at all as to not provoke him) he said something to me that just made me know in that instant that this dickwad was not going to be in my life. I already knew, but this was the final straw. He said to me that ""your father is a cowardly poofta"". My father served in the Australian Army for 21 years, and trust me...he likes women and not men.  

Moving forward, we are back in Australia, I've kicked him out of my life. One thing I did know about him was that he really wanted to move to Canada and go work for his friend who had a business relating to solar panels. While we were together he had been ""doctoring"" letters and information required for him to obtain the correct visa to work in Canada. Now I used this against him.  

I contacted the Canadian Embassy in Canberra, and gave them every single detail I could about him and his soon to be travels to Canada. Even had his passport number from when we travelled together.  

They were very receptive of the information, including the email account he used to send the ""documents"" to his friend in Canada, and the password to the email account too. Also, flight numbers and dates. He was screwed.  

I find out that when he got to Canada, presented everything that he needed etc.... he was taken into a room and spoken to. I do know that about 8 hours later or so, he was on another plane heading back to Australia.  

Don't fuck with me, don't treat me like shit and especially don't say horrid things about my father who served this country.  

Enjoy your very expensive visit to the Canadian airport!  

TL;DR He did and said horrible things to me while we dated, so when he wanted to move to Canada, I made sure he couldn't.

Also furies for some reason.","This will take some explaining and since the event itself is still unfolding and will be for the foreseeable future, I think it's best to explain everything from the ground up and provide a jumping off point for any future popcorn that comes from this.  I will be writing it recap style and providing links to the major slapfights over several subs.

/r/NFL is one of the largest sports subs on Reddit. but one of the lesser known quirks of the sub is how smaller subs formed based on similarities of team logo's and mascots.  /r/CatTeamBrotherhood, /r/ungulateteams, /r/theplunderhood are all examples.  One sub came together from a combination of not having any similar logo's to other teams, but also out of sharing a tradition of winning, greatness and having a smug sense of superiority to the other teams.  /r/EvilLeagueOfEvil is the star of today's story.  It is a sub made up of fans the New England Patriots, The Dallas Cowboys, The Green Bay Packers, The New York Giants, the San Francisco 49ers, the Chicago Bears and the Pittsburgh Steelers.  Together it is some of the largest fan bases and they represent some of the largest individual team subs on reddit.  Until last week this sub was used reveling in the hate other teams have for the ELoE members and not letting anyone forget that the Falcons blew a 28-3 lead in the last Super Bowl.  That all changed when someone in the ELoE noticed that /r/NFL was copying /r/baseball's survivor pool and the power that such a bloc of fans could wield in anything involving offsite polls.

The game is simple.  All fans vote and the team left standing is the team /r/NFL hates the least.  However, the ELoE quickly used this to start voting out teams that they not only hated themselves, but posed the biggest threats to their 7 teams.  The Patriots are the most hated team league wide and it was quickly assumed they would be the first to go.  Using that [hate as a shield](http://i.imgur.com/qLEbEMC.jpg) the ELoE realized as long as they vote as one, they could completely control the game.  [The first team to feel the wrath of the ELoE was Seattle](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/61a904/rnfl_survivor_round_1_redone/).  Over the next few days, the game grew in popularity, mostly because of the ELoE going full heel and #PurgeTheBirds.  [Philadelphia, Atlanta were the next to go](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/627bad/rnfl_survivor_round_6/).

For every memaction an equal and opposite memaction must exist and due to the Law of Conservation of Shitposts, the /r/CoalitionAgainstEvil formed to try and stem the brutal domination the ELoE is currently enforcing on /r/NFL.  The Beacons of Gondor were lit and several teams answered the call to throw their axe into the fellowship.  However, the ELoE is not only in possession of the One Ring but [several others](http://imgur.com/gallery/oYmVvYH).  They also have several [trophies](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mcB_fVj2Vh0/TjnAvoSBAGI/AAAAAAAAF-c/XquhN9khn7k/s1600/IMG_5852.JPG), [cups](http://nflshop.frgimages.com/FFImage/thumb.aspx?i=/productImages/_2695000/ff_2695454_full.jpg&amp;w=340), chalices and other [dark horcrux's](http://archive.boston.com/sports/blogs/thebuzz/july12sports/300gronk.jpg) to hold off pretty much any coalition.  The ELoE in its quest for [Unlimited Power](https://media3.giphy.com/media/K3X9P8I343FLO/giphy.gif) sought out alliances with The Houston Texans and New Orleans Saints, promising not to immediately vote for those teams and to vote out their rivals in exchange for voting with the ELoE. 

[One Brave Bronco Fan](https://www.reddit.com/r/furry/comments/61t76s/fellow_furry_needs_help/) reaches out to the furry community for their help.

This lead the denizens of /r/minnesotavikings to seek outside help and where our drama really starts.  [I've posted drama from the Vikings sub before](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/5ogzaa/what_if_i_told_you_hating_another_team_was_more/) and to put it mildly they take their sports very seriously.  Not only do they love their team, but they have a hatred for the Green Bay Packers that is really unmatched in American Sports.  /r/minnesotavikings put out the call to all the other Minnesota sports subs, [including the Twins sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesotatwins/comments/61tsbx/rminnesotavikings_needs_your_help/.)

[A deal is made with /r/minnesotatwins](https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesotavikings/comments/61t67g/minnesota_vikings_are_targets_for_rnfl_survivor/dfh7iiy/) to not only secure their vote in the NFL poll, but to help the twins survive in their poll. [Additional Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesotatwins/comments/61tsbx/rminnesotavikings_needs_your_help/)

The /r/EvilLeagueOfEvil finds out about this deal and reacts exactly how you would expect a group of fiends proud of being evil would.  They not only voted the Vikings out of the NFL poll, but helped contribute to the Twins defeat in /r/baseball 's poll.  The actual effect was rather minor, and there is such a cross over between all the subs its unclear how much impact the action had, but there is no doubt it had an impact

/r/Baseball is [rather annoyed](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/626oqe/baseball_survivor_round_25/) at all of this and starts discussing recounts and revotes due to ELoE influence.  The question of brigrading and banning ELoE for it also brought up.

/r/NFL [calls out](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/627bad/rnfl_survivor_round_6/dfk8rz0/) the ELoE for interference in another subs game and leads to small slapfights.  However it's agreed for everyone to stick to their own sports.

/r/EvilLeagueOfEvil [corrects the record](https://www.reddit.com/r/EvilLeagueOfEvil/comments/6285s3/setting_the_record_straight_about_rminnesotatwins/) and tightens the reigns while making their position of who started it clear.  The Vikings and Twins were the first to start voting in both polls.

I've linked to the major highlights, but they are really just jumping off points to multisub drama like this.  The /r/Texans sub [has fully embraced evil](https://www.reddit.com/r/Texans/) while their /r/ungulateteams sub [calls for their banishment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ungulateteams/comments/61t1pf/future_of_the_texans_as_an_ungulate_team_vote/).

I've tried to make this as clear as possible for people not familiar with American Football and I think the drama translates into delicious popcorn for everyone.  Just remember that no matter how confused you feel, the [Atlanta Falcons blew a 28-3 Lead in the Super Bowl](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/016/212/manning.png)

Edit 1; Added additional links.  Apparently /r/minnesotavikings went private at some point but I have nothing to link to for that.

Edit 2: /r/EvilLeagueOfEvil has updated their sidebar image to make it clear how they feel about the Twins involvement.

Edit 5:  The Raven's were targeted today due to it being the 33rd anniversary of the Colts leaving Baltimore.  The Browns are being targeted tommorow.  The Browns left Cleveland to form the Ravens in 1995.  After the Browns are eliminated, the ELoE will be targeting the team with the lowest vote total from the previous day.

chrisjoe1992,2017-03-28 23:46:05+00:00,All Time Teams Part 1,"Alrighty so I've been incredibly bored by the NFL offseason. Also suffered a back injury this past December so I've been sidelined and have watched a metric fuckton of old games the past few months. There was also a recent post somewhere along the lines of ""What would your All Time 53 man roster look like?"". Yeah, NFL offseason everybody. But it got me to thinking, this might be fun for me to spend some time doing. So here's what I'm going to do:  
  
I'm going to make an all-time roster for each of the 32 NFL teams. There will be a couple of rules. Firstly, if there's an all-time great like Demarcus Ware who spent time with two different teams, Dallas and Denver, the team where he spent the most time gets dibs (Dallas in this case). Secondly, if there's a player who spent the same amount of time at two teams (Eric Dickerson spent 4 and a half years with both the Colts and the Rams), the player goes to the team where he performed better (Dickerson was better for the Rams). Thirdly, there's the issue of athleticism and conditioning. A player from the 60s would not be nearly as athletic as a player from today. However, I'm going to assume if those players were playing today they'd have access to the same conditioning and resources as all players today. Plus it makes it more interesting. I'll also try to give reasoning for each player. I'll also go through the teams based on when the teams were founded.  
  
Alright well here's the Green Bay Packers, founded in 1919. Packers statistics are in parentheses. Also, Reggie White and Charles Woodson don't qualify for the Packers in this scenario because they spent more time with the Eagles and Raiders respectively. But they will most definitely be making an appearance once I get around to doing those two all-time teams.  
  
**Head Coach: Vince Lombardi.** No real argument here, won 5 championships in 7 seasons. Dominated the league at that time. Extreme motivator, and also crucial in fully integrating the NFL. Brought true excellence to Green Bay, and never coached a losing season. *1959-1967, 3 NFL Championships, 2 Super Bowl Wins, Pro Football Hall of Fame, 98-30-4 overall record, 9-1 postseason record*  
  
**Offensive Coordinator: Mike Holmgreen.** Absolute offensive genius. Led the Packers to a Super Bowl win without ever coaching a losing season. Also ran the offense that gained Brett Favre 3 MVP awards. Second best postseason record among all Green Bay coaches. *1992-1998, 1 Super Bowl win, 84-42 record, 9-5 playoff record*  
  
**Defensive Coordinator: Earl Lambeau.** A powerful motivator and strict disciplinarian. One of only 7 NFL coaches with more than 200 victories. Lambeau coached Green Bay for 29 years and led the Packers to 6 championships. *1921-1949, 6 championship victories, 212-106-12 overall record*  
  
**QB1: Brett Favre.** [Favre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWlrjsJRiFI) was one of the most dominant Packers of all time. At the time of his retirement, he had the NFL career records for passing yards, passing touchdowns, and passing completions. He led the Packers to two Super Bowls, winning one. He started 298 consecutive games, and was arguably the toughest QB to ever play the game. Certainly the toughest I remember seeing. Favre also won 3 MVP awards, was a 3x 1st Team All Pro, 3x Second Team All Pro, and an 11x Pro Bowler. *1991-2010 (1992-2007), 71,838 (61,655) career passing yards, 508 (442) TDs, 336 (286) INT, 6300 (5377) completions, 1844 (1786) Rush Yds, 14 (13) Rush TD, 3x MVP, OPOY, Super Bowl Champion, 6x All Pro, 11x (9x) Pro Bowl, 186 wins, 4x Season TDs leader, 2x Season Yds leader, Hall of Fame*  
  
**QB2: Bart Starr.** [Bart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ0Qbq90MJo) led the Packers to 5 championships in 7 years. He had a phenomenal playoff record, and was the face of the Packers dynasty in the 1960s. Also had a 3-peat from 1966-1968 where Green Bay won the NFL Championship and then Super Bowls I and II. He spent his entire career with Green Bay, and then went on to coach there as well. *1956-1971, 24,718 career passing yards, 152 TDs, 1,308 Rush Yds, 15 Rush TD, 5x NFL Champion, 2x Super Bowl Champion, 2x Super Bowl MVP, NFL MVP (1966), 3x All Pro, 4x Pro Bowl*  
  
**QB3: Aaron Rodgers.** [Aaron Rodgers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACSeL6rAwfE) is currently writing his story for the Packers. He is one of the most efficient QBs to play the game of all time. He has the highest passer rating of all time. He is absolutely one of the 4 greatest QBs playing right now, along with Brady, Roethlisberger, and Brees, and many would argue him and Brady are the best QBs in the league. His efficiency is his hallmark, having thrown 297 touchdowns to only 72 interceptions. Since taking over for Favre, Rodgers has kept the Packers as perennial contenders and more often than not they have won the NFC North. *2005-Present, 36,827 passing yards, 297 pass TD, 2,544 Rush Yds, 25 Rush TD, 99-52 overall record, 9-7 playoff record, 2x MVP, 3x All Pro, 6x Pro Bowl, Season Passing TDs leader (2016), Super Bowl Champion (XLV), Super Bowl MVP (XLV)*  
  
**HB1: Ahman Green.** [Ahman Green](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnBYN_1rA8c) was traded to Green Bay from Seattle in 2000, and quickly proved himself to be a dominant force. From 2000-2004, no other player had more rushing yards (6,848) or yards from scrimmage (9,036). He set a Green Bay franchise record in 2003 by rushing for 1,883 yards in a single season. After a short stint in Houston, Green returned to the Packers in 2009 and became the all-time leading Packers rusher. *1998-2009 (2000-2006, 2009), 9,205 (8,322) Rushing Yards, 60 (54) Rush TD, 2,883 (2,726) Receiving Yards, 14 (14) Receiving TDs, Second Team All Pro, NFC OPOY (2003), 4x Pro Bowl*  
  
**HB2: Paul Hornung.** Hornung was an incredible player for the Packers in the 1950s and 1960s. Having the versatility to play Fullback, Safety, and Kicker, and Quarterback, he was a true asset to the team. He led the NFL in scoring for 3 straight seasons from 1959 to 1961, and in 1960 set the record for most points scored in a single season (only 12 game seasons at the time, as well) with 176. This record stood until 2006. He also hit 66 field goals and 190 extra points for Green Bay. *1957-1962, 1964-1966, NFL MVP (1961), 3,711 Rush Yds, 50 Rush TD, 1,480 Receiving Yds, 12 Receiving TD, 3x All Pro, 2x Pro Bowl, 4x NFL Champion, Super Bowl Champion, Season Rushing TD's leader (1960), Pro Football Hall of Fame, 66/140 Field Goals, 190/194 XP*  
  
**FB1: Jim Taylor.** Jim Taylor was a phenomenal fullback for Green Bay, and was at the time Green Bay's all time leading rusher. Taylor was one of the toughest players of his generation, frequently seeking out contact and developing multiple rivalries with defensive players. He has the most rushing TDs in Packers history, and was the first NFL player to have 5 consecutive 1,000 yard rushing seasons. *1958-1967 (1958-1966), 8,597 (8,207) Rush Yds, 83 (81) Rush TD, 1,756 (1,505) Receiving Yds, 10 (10) Receiving TD, 4x NFL Champion, Super Bowl Champion, 6x All Pro, 5x Pro Bowl, NFL MVP (1962), Single Season Rushing Yds Leader (1962), 2x Rush TD leader (1961, 1962), Pro Football Hall of Fame*  
  
**FB2: Clarke Hinkle.** Hinkle was one of the most versatile and toughest offensive players of his generation. He also played safety and linebacker on defense, though he was primarily a fullback. During his 10 year tenure with Green Bay, he was the team's leading rusher. He retired as the NFL's all time leading rusher (at the time), and held the record rom 1941 until 1949. *1932-1941, 3,860 Rush Yds, 35 Rush TD, 537 Rec. Yds, 9 Rec. TDs, 2x NFL Champion (1936, 1939), 4x All Pro, 3x Pro Bowl, Pro Football Hall of Fame*  
  
**WR1: Don Hutson.** Don Hutson was perhaps the best receiver of the 1930s and 1940s. He was also extremely versatile, playing as a defensive back. He led the league in receing yards 7 times and receving touchdowns 9 times in his 10 year career. NFL.com has his rated as the 9th best player of all time.

Yds leader, 9x Rec. TD leader, Interceptions leader (1940), Pro Football Hall of Fame*  
  
**WR2: Sterling Sharpe.** Sterling Sharpe was one of the most dynamic receivers in NFL history, let alone Packers history. Unfortunately his career was cut short by injuries, only playing for 7 seasons. He became one of only 7 players to lead the league in receptions, receiving yards, and receiving TDs for a season. He also set the (at the time) record for most receptions in a single season twice. If he would have had a longer career, he might have climbed to number 1 on this list. As is, he makes a fine starting WR for the All-Time team. *1998-1994, 595 Receptions, 8,134 Rec. Yds, 65 Rec. TDs, 3x All Pro, 5x Pro Bowl, 2x Rec. TDs leader, Receptions Leader (1992), Rec. Yds Leader (1992)*  
  
**WR3: Donald Driver.** Donald Driver is the all time receiving leader for Green Bay, and is the only receiver to rack up over 10,000 yards for Green Bay. He was an incredibly consistent receiver for many years, having 7 1,000 yard seasons. He was a key veteran presence in mentoring Greg Jennings and Jordy Nelson. *1999-2012, 743 Receptions, 10,137 Rec. Yds, 61 Rec. TDs, 4x Pro Bowl, Super Bowl Champion (XLV), All Time Packers Receiving Leader*

In his 7 full seasons for the Packers, he topped 1,000 yards 5 times. At the time of his retirement, he was Green Bay's all time leading receiver (since surpassed by Donald Driver). *764 (530) receptions, 14,004 (9,656) Rec. Yds, 75 (49) Rec. TDs, 4x (4x) All Pro, 8x (7x) Pro Bowl, All-Rookie Team (1978), Pro Football Hall of Fame*  
  
**WR5: Jordy Nelson.** [Jordy Nelson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V—4o2G9EBc) is only our second active player on this list, and he's got plenty of reasons to be here. He's been Aaron Rodgers's go-to guy for several years now (when he's healthy), and led the league in receiving TDs last year with 14. He learned from Packers greats Donald Driver and Greg Jennings, and has a chance to end up becoming the Packers All Time Leading Receiver if he keeps up his pace from last year for a couple of more years. In his 6 seasons where he's played all 16 games, he's topped 1,000 yards 4 times. He's also totalled over 1,300 Return yards on special teams. *2008-Present, 497 Receptions, 7,366 Rec. Yds, 63 Rec. TDs, Super Bowl Champion (XLV), 2nd Team All Pro (2014), Pro Bowl (2014), Comeback Player Of The Year (2016), Rec. TDs leader (2016)*  
  
**TE1: Ron Kramer.** Ron Kramer was a phenomenal blocking tight end for Vince Lombardi's early championship teams. He was also an adept receiver. Of his 10 pro seasons, 7 were with Green Bay. He was the key piece for the famous ""Packer Sweep"" play. He was incredibly tough and meshed incredibly well in Vince Lombardi's offense. He would also form a dangerous tandem with Marv Fleming later Kramer's Packer career. *1957, 1959-1967 (1957, 1959-1964), 229 (170) Receptions, 3,272 (2,594) Rec. Yds, 16 (15) Rec. TDs, 2x All Pro, 2x NFL Champion, Pro Bowl (1962)*  
  
**TE2: Marv Fleming.** Fleming was both the counterpart and successor to Kramer in the Packers offense. Though they only teamed up for 2 seasons, they were a dynamic combination. Like Kramer, Fleming was a phenomenal run blocker and an adept receiver, paving the way for future tight ends. *1963-1975 (1963-1969), 157 (109) Receptions, 1,823 (1,300) Rec. Yds, 16 (12) Rec. TDs, 4x (2x) Super Bowl Champion (I, II, VII, VIII), NFL Champion (1965)*  
  
**TE3: Mark Chmura.** Mark Chmura was a 3 time Pro Bowl selection for the Packers during the 1990s, with Favre at QB. He was a powerful, physical TE that had no problem challenging defensive players both on the line and in the secondary. He was an extreme mismatch in both blocking and receiving, and was an elite TE of the 1990s. *1992-1999, 188 Receptions, 2,253 Rec. Yds, 17 Rec. TDs, 3x Pro Bowl, Super Bowl Champion (XXXI)*  
  
**TE4: Paul Coffman.** Paul Coffman is statistaclly the most productive Packers TE in history. However, he was undersized and went undrafted. He managed to be a safety valve in the passing game, and ended up catching 39 TDs and going to 3 Pro Bowls while at Green Bay. In a modern NFL offense, he would probably end up lining up as a slot receiver/TE mix. *1978-1988 (1978-1985), 339 (322) Receptions, 4,340 (4,223) Rec. Yds, 42 (39) Rec TDs, 3x (3x) Pro Bowl*  
  
**RT1: Forrest Gregg.** Gregg was the ""Iron Man"" of his generation, starting 188 consecutive games. Vince Lombardi once said he was ""the finest player he'd ever coached"". He was absolutely dominant during the 1960s, going to 8 Pro Bowls during that decade. He primarily played RT, but occasionally played Offensive Guard. Though under-weight compared to today's offensive linemen (only 250 lbs), with today's conditioning and training he could have bulked up as his 6'4"" frame was plenty big. His mental toughness was also unquestionable. He would be a real leader on this O-Line. *1956-1971 (1956-1970), 3x (2x) Super Bowl Champion (I, II, VI), 5x NFL Champion, 8x All Pro, 9x Pro Bowl, Pro Football Hall of Fame*  
  
**RT2: Mark Tauscher.** Though never selected to a pro-bowl, Tauscher was an anchor on the offensive line for the Green Bay Packers for a decade. He started 126 of 134 games from 2000 to 2010, and protected both Favre and Rodgers. *2000-2010, Super Bowl Champion (XLV)*  
  
**RG1: Jerry Kramer.** Kramer was a dominant force on Vince Lombardi's offensive line. He would need to put on about 60 lbs to play in today's NFL, but he was incredibly athletic and strong for his time at 245lbs. Drafted in 1958, he became an anchor on offense. He was also incredibly tough, coming back from 22 total surguries throughout his career. *1958-1968, 2x Super Bowl Champion (I, II), 5x NFL Champion, 6x All Pro, 3x Pro Bowl*  
  
**RG2: Mike Michalske.** Mike was the first truly great offensive guard in the NFL. He also started on the defensive line. His nickname was ""Iron Mike"" because he often played all 60 minutes of a game. He was a prototype player who would also have likely been a good defensive end in today's NFL. *1926-1937 (1929-1937), 3x NFL Champion (1929, 1930, 1931), 6x All Pro*  
  
**RG3: Marco Rivera.** Rivera was a very effective offensive lineman for the Green Bay Packers, starting 111 of 125 games. He was a major boon to the offensive line during Favre's career, and earned multiple trips to the Pro Bowl. He was also able to move arount the line almost at will, so could sub in at pretty much any offensive lineman position on this list, providing great depth. *1996-2006 (1996-2004), Super Bowl Champion (XXXI), 3x (3x) Pro Bowl, 2x (2x) All Pro*  
  
**C1: Jim Ringo.** Jim Ringo was one of the most athletic centers of his generation. He was a major leader in Lombardi's offensive line during the early 1960s. Though undersized, he would be able to bulk up to fit into today's modern offense, and is used to using his athleticism to overcome size deficiencies. He was arguably the best center of his generation. *1953-1967 (1953-1963), 2x NFL Champion (1961, 1962), 9x (7x) All Pro, 10x (7x) Pro Bowl, Pro Football Hall of Fame*  
  
**C2: Larry McCarren.** McCarren has the Packers 4th longest streak of consecutive starts with 162. He was a solid blocker in the middle during the 1970s and 1980s. He would have to put on weight to survive today's NFL (246 lbs), but he had the skills and consistency to do so. *1973-1984, 2x Pro Bowl*  
  
**LG1: Gale Gillingham.** Gale was a very strong blocker for the Packers towards the end of the Lombardi era and into the 1970s. He was primarily a run blocker, but was also a great pass blocker. He was integral in making Green Bay's rushing attack a success, and many years was their best offensive lineman. *1966-1976, 2x Super Bowl Champion (I, II), 6x All Pro, 5x Pro Bowl*  
  
**LG2: Fred ""Fuzzy"" Thurston.** Dominant offensive guard for Lombardi's Packers. He played at an elite level for nearly a decade, and was one of the best run-blockers of his generation. He also demonstrated an athletic ability that would have enabled him to possibly play Offensive Tackle as well as guard. *1958-1967 (1959-1967), 2x Super Bowl Champion (I, II), 6x (5x) NFL Champion, 2x (2x) All Pro*  
  
**LT1: Chad Clifton.** Clifton was a dominant offensive lineman for Green Bay during the 2nd half of Brett Favre's Green Bay career and the start of Aaron Rodgers'. He guarded both their blind sides, and was considered by experts to be one of the best offensive tackles in the game throughout his career. However, he was relatively unheralded by the public. He started 160 games for Green Bay over 11 seasons. *2000-2011, Super Bowl Champion XLV, 2x Pro Bowl*  
  
**LT2: Ken Ruettgers.** Ken started 140 of 156 games for the Packers during the 1980s and 1990s. He guarded Favre's blind side after being selected as the 7th overall pick in the 1985 draft. He was the Green Bay Packers Offensive MVP in 1989. *1985-1996, Super Bowl Champion (XXXI)*  
  
**DE1: Willie Davis.** Willie Davis was a dominant player for Lombardi's Packers. He played before sacks were recognized as an official statistic, but his presence on the field was mammoth. Experts believe he had well over 100 sacks, as he averaged in the ""teens"" per year. He was also a chief leader for the Packers on several title runs. *1958-1969 (1960-1969), 22 Fumble Recoveries, 2x (2x) Super Bowl Champion (I, II), 3x (3x) NFL Champion, 5x (5x) All Pro, 5x (5x) Pro Bowl, Pro Football Hall of Fame*  
  
**DE2: Kabeer Gbaja Biamila.** [""KGB""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fhlkNpgLQ8) was a dominant force on the defensive front for the Packers during the 2000s. He was drafted in the 5th round in 2000, and quickly became a key part in the Packers defense. He is the Green Bay Packers all time sacks leader, and a member of the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame. *2000-2008, 286 Tackles, 74.5 sacks, Pro Bowl (2003), NFC Sacks leader (2004)*  
  
**DE3: Aaron Kampman.** Kampman was drafted by Green Bay out of Iowa in the 5th round of the 2002 NFL draft, and spent most of his career as a solid member of Green Bay's defense. He had an impressive 2003 postseason with 3 playoff sacks. He is 4th all time on the Packers' sacks list. *2002-2011 (2002-2009), 2x All Pro, 2x Pro Bowl, 336 (320) Tackles, 58 (54) Sacks, 11 Forced Fumbles*  
  
**DE4: Ezra Johnson.** Johnson spent the first decade of his career with the Packers, and is 5th all time on the Packers' sacks list. He had an amazing 20.5 sack season in 1978, including a 5 sack performance against the Detroit Lions. However, he only made 1 Pro Bowl in his career. *1977-1991 (1977-1987), 55.5 (41.5) Sacks, 8 (7) Fumble recoveries, Pro Bowl (1978)*  
  
**DT1: Henry Jordan.** Jordan played alongside Willie Davis and was a dominant defensive tackle. He too began his career in Cleveland, but was only truly dominant in Green Bay. This Packers legend was a 7x All Pro and helped Lombardi win his championships in Titletown. He was a major force to be reckoned with, and was very quick to the QB, even though sacks weren't a statistic at the time. *1957-1969 (1959-1969), 21 (20) Fumble Recoveries, 2x Super Bowl Champion (I, II), 5x NFL Champion, 7x All Pro, 4x Pro Bowl, Pro Football Hall Of Fame*

He started 160 games out of a possible 164 during his career in Green Bay. He was also the first Packers defensive lineman to be selected to a Pro Bowl in 1953. *1952-1964, 2x NFL Champion, 2x Pro Bowl, Green Bay Packers Hall Of Fame*  
  
**DT3: Gilbert Brown.** Brown was a dominant run stuffer for the Packers during the 1990s and early 2000s.

In 10 seasons, he started 103 games and made 15 playoff appearances, second to only Brett Favre (22). *1993-1999, 2001-2003, 7 Sacks, 292 Tackles, Super Bowl Champion (XXXI)*  
  
**DT4: B.J. Raji.** ""The Freezer"" was a recent nose tackle for the Packers. He was adept at stuffing the run and competent at getting to the quarterback. Raji also was used occasionally as a fullback, which led to his nickname. *2009-2015, 151 Tackles, 11 Sacks, 10 Pass Deflections, Super Bowl Champion (XLV), Pro Bowl (2011)*  
  
**OLB1: Clay Matthews III.** Another current player on this team, [Clay has proven several times in his career already that he is a Hall of Fame caliber player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN1bcXf_O74) who is a true leader for the Packers. He has had success at both outside and inside linebacker positions, though many believe he is better outside. His ferociousness and quickness after the quarterback are his true talents. He has at least 6 sacks in each of his NFL seasons. *2009-Present, 396 Tackles, 72.5 Sacks, 38 Pass Deflections, 6 Interceptions, 13 Forced Fumbles, 3x All Pro, 6x Pro Bowl, NFC Defensive Player of the Year (2010), Butkus Award (2010), Super Bowl Champion (XLV)*

He was a key piece in the Packers finishing 10-6 in the 1989 season, their only winning record since 1972. During that year he recorded a dominating 19.5 sacks. He was an extremely potent defender and was a huge anchor on the defensive side of the ball for the Packers. *1986-1995 (1986-1990), 81 Sacks, Pro Bowl (1989), 2x All Pro (1988, 1989), Super Bowl Champion (With the 49ers in Super Bowl XXIX)*

**ILB1: Ray Nitschke.** Nitschke is arguably one of the best NFL players of all time. He is one of the top linebackers to ever play the game, and arguably the best Packers defensive player to ever set foot on the field (Yes, including Reggie White). He had skill, leadership, and athleticism in such a rare blending, and was one of the largest pieces in Lombardi's championship defenses. He had 48 total Interceptions and fumble recoveries throughout his 15 year Packers career. *1958-1972, 25 Interceptions, 23 Fumble Recoveries, 2x Super Bowl Champion (I, II), 3x NFL Champion (1961, 1962, 1965), Pro Bowl (1964), 7x All Pro, Packers Hall of Fame, Pro Football Hall of Fame*

He also had 15.5 sacks, 9 Interceptions and 7 Fumble recoveries for the Packers. *2003-2013 (2003-2010), 1,041 (787) Tackles, All Pro (2007), Super Bowl Champion (XLV)*  
  
**ILB4: Fred Carr.** Carr was a lifetime Packer throughout the late 1960s and into the 1970s. He was a very crucial player on special teams and was one of the most physically gifted inside linebackers in franchise history. *1967-1977, Super Bowl Champion (II), 3x Pro Bowl, Pro Bowl Co-MVP (1970), Packers Hall of Fame*  
  
**CB1: Herb Adderley.** Green Bay's best qualifying cornerback (Woodson belongs to ~~Oakland~~ Las Vegas for these purposes), Adderley was a truly dominant corner. He actually began his career as a running back, but was buried in the depth chart behind Paul Hornung and Jim Taylor before being switched to defense. Adderley would go on to be nominated to 7 All Pro teams as a cornerback and record 48 interceptions. *1961-1972 (1961-1969), 48 (39) Interceptions, 3x Super Bowl Champion (I, II with Green Bay and VI with Dallas), 3x NFL Champion (1961, 1962, 1965), 5x Pro Bowl, 7x All Pro, Packers Hall of Fame, Pro Football Hall of Fame*  
  
**CB2: Bob Jeter.** Like Adderley, Jeter also played during the Lombardi years. Also like Adderley, he was originally an offensive player that was moved to cornerback in 1965. He quickly became dominant on the defensive side of the ball, becoming part of perhaps the best secondary of his day. He had 26 career interceptions. *1963-1973 (1963-1970), NFL Champion (1965), 2x Super Bowl Champion (I, II), 2x Pro Bowl, Packers Hall of Fame*  
  
**CB3: Willie Buchanon.** Drafted in 1972, Buchanon began making immediate contributions, eraning the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year award. He also holds a share of the record for most interceptions in a single game with 4. Buchanon was a dominant ball-hawk who stepped up in big moments, and his skills would most likely have translated well into today's NFL. *1972-1982 (1972-1978), 2x Pro Bowl, All Pro (1978), DROY award, NFC Interceptions Leader (1978), Packers Hall of Fame*  
  
**S1: Willie Wood.** One of the best safeties to ever play the game. Though not drafted, Wood tried out for the Packers in 1960. Lombardi signed him as a free agent originally as a receiver, but quickly he was moved to safety, where he would start for 11 seasons. He was one of the most productive and consistent safeties throughout his tenure, and helped win Super Bowl I with a crucial interception in the second half. He also was an absolutely dominant returner on special teams. *1960-1971, 48 Interceptions, 8x Pro Bowl, 7x All Pro, 3x NFL Champion (1961, 1962, 1965) 2x Super Bowl Champion (I, II), Packers Hall of Fame, Pro Football Hall of Fame*  
  
**S2: Leroy Butler.** Butler was a dominant back for the Packers throughout the 90s. He was the first defensive back in NFL history to reach the 20 sack/20 interception club. He was a key piece of the Super Bowl XXXI defense. He also is credited with inventing the Lambeau Leap in 1993 on a fumble return for a touchdown. *1990-2001, 889 Tackles, 38 Interceptions, 20.5 Sacks, 13 Forced Fumbles, 4x Pro Bowl, 4x All Pro, Super Bowl Champion (XXXI), Packers Hall of Fame*  
  
**S3: Darren Sharper.** Sharper was a dominant safety throughout the late 90s and the entire 2000s. He is 3rd all time in Pick 6's with 11 behind only Charles Woodson and Rod Woodson. He is also 6th all time with INTs. He is one of the best defensive backs of his generation, and absolutely worthy of a spot on the Green Bay Packers All Time Roster. (Shoutout again to [/u/TheSportsPanda](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheSportsPanda) for correcting my mistake and getting Sharper the credit he deserves) *1997-2010 (1997-2004), 63 (36) Interceptions, 11 (5) Int. TDs, 942 (605) tackles, 5x (2x) Pro Bowl, 6x (2x) All Pro, 2x (1x) NFL Interceptions Leader (2000 with Green Bay, 2009 with the Saints), NFL 2000s All Decade Team* 
  
**K: Ryan Longwell.** Longwell is the fifth most accurate kicker in league history with a field goal percentage of over 82 percent. He is also the Packers all time leading scorer with 1,054 points, and a franchise record 226 field goals made. *1997-2012 (1997-2005)*  
  
**P: David Beverly.** Beverly was the Packers punter during a dark time in franchise history. He holds the franchise records for career punts (495) and season punts (106). He also had 3 games with 10 punts each, tied for 2nd in franchise history. *1974-1980 (1975-1980)*  
  
**KR: Willie Wood** (See S1)  
  
Hybrid 3/4 and 4/3 defense, with the strength being in the versatility of the linebacker corps and defensive ends. Offense is run-heavy and utilizes 1-2 TEs/FBs and multiple backs on most formations. Passing game is primarily deep threat, very few short routes unless those are out of the backfield. Heavy amounts of play action and the occasional QB scramble. 
  
**Edit/Update (Marcy 29 at 8PM EST):** Firstly I'd like to thank everybody who's enjoyed this series so far, I've really enjoyed making it. It's gotten way more support than I expected. I do have a couple of updates going on though that I'll detail below, as well as a couple of shoutouts. 
  
Okay guys so I screwed up a little bit and Green Bay should have been the 3rd team done on this series (after Cardinals and Bears). Sorry, It'll be right from here on out.  
  
Also I'm going through and making the players position and name bold at the start for better visibility. Thank you [/u/WombatMuffins](https://www.reddit.com/user/WombatMuffins) for the suggestion, I love it. 
  
I also would like to note something I didn't note in the original article. This roster has compiled up a total of 9 MVPs, 140 All Pro selections, and 150 Pro Bowl berths. I plan on releasing a power rankings after I've finished all 32 teams, and these metrics will be pretty relevant when that time comes. 
  
Additionally, [TheSportsPanda](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheSportsPanda) pointed out to me that Darren Sharper isn't on this roster and he is very very deserving. I scoured this roster a couple of times to see whose spot he gets, and I decided he'd get Lionel Aldridge's spot. (DE) I've placed Aldridge's old writeup below so you guys can still access it. 
  
I'm also listing the entire roster in one quick-read location for people to skim through easier, as [/u/Bix_Brecht](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bix_Brecht) suggested.  
  
**QB:** Brett Favre, Bart Starr, Aaron Rodgers 
  
**HB:** Ahman Green, Paul Hornung 
  
**FB:** Jim Taylor, Clarke Hinkle 
  
**WR:** Don Hutson, Sterling Sharpe, Donald Driver, James Lofton, Jordy Nelson 
  
**TE:** Ron Kramer, Marv Fleming, Mark Chmura, Paul Coffman 
  
**RT:** Forrest Gregg, Mark Tauscher 
  
**RG:** Jerry Kramer, Mark Michalske, Marco Rivera 
  
**C:** Jim Ringo, Larry McCarren 
  
**LG:** Gale Gillingham, Fred ""Fuzzy"" Thurston 
  
**LT:** Chad Clifton, Ken Ruettgers 
  
**DE:** Willie Davis, ""KGB"" Kabeer Gbaja Biamila, Aaron Kampman, Ezra Johnson 
  
**DT:** Henry Jordan, Dave Hanner, Gilbert Brown, B.J. Raji,

**ILB/OLB Hybrids:** Lee Roy Caffey, Bill Forester, Dave RobinsON 
  
**ILB:** Ray Nitschke, Dan Currie, Nick Barnett, Fred Carr

**S:** Willie Wood, Leroy Butler, Darren Sharper 
  
**K:** Ryan Longwell 
  
**P:** David Beverly 
  
**KR:** Willie Wood 
  
&amp;nbsp; 
  
Here's Lionel Aldridge's old write-up. 
  
**DE5: Lionel Aldridge.** Aldridge was an integral anchor for the Packers during the Lombardi era. He started as a rookie on Lombardi's dominant defense, and maintained his starting role throughout nine seasons. He missed only 3 starts out of 126 games and was part of the Packers 3-Peat in 1965-1967. *1961-1973 (1963-1971), NFL Champion (1965), 2x Super Bowl Champion (I, II), Green Bay Packers Hall Of Fame*  
  
**Edit/Update 2, April 3 at 7AM EST:** Added some highlight videos. Also adding a link to [Part 2: The Arizona Cardinals](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/62980p/part_2_of_the_all_time_teams_the_cardinals/). ",nfl,1034

VestedJester,2017-03-18 22:07:15+00:00,Cook and Dota player offers services to pro teams/casting houses. Not a shitpost.,"I am a cook, former low tier competitive player and avid Dota fan who would like to avail his services to the community. As the scene has grown over the years and progressed more and more towards an NBA or EPL type model, there has been a greater consolidation of talent in specific areas. Casters, observers, producers and the like have setups like the BTS Studio in L.A. or Moonduck or 2GD etc.. Professional teams by and large have team houses where the players live and practice together replete with pools, workout rooms, and sexy kitchens. Many of these are seemingly over the top for the benefit of 5 guys who spend 90% of their day in a chair or bed. I have nothing against any extravagance because I just want to see the best Dota possible and whatever is necessary to bring about optimum comfort is certainly justified. For example: EE should have someone massaging his hands between games to promote better circulation so he isn't a slave to the hand warmer.

I think I could be of great use to a team house or casting studio as a cook/motivator. I know there are a lot of nice kitchens out there being wasted and a lot of unhealthy and expensive take out being ordered in routinely. I propose to take care of all food related business in a cost effective and thoroughly scrumptious manner. Players and casters and coaches hail from all over the world and these days everyone has their own unique dietary needs. I can create meals specialized for each individual based on personal and dietary preference. I come from the Seattle area and am all too used to accommodating every random preference. Everyone can have their eggs cooked as they like, same goes for meats, pastas, cocktails, you name it and I'll slap it in the pan. You can also save on food by having me do bulk shopping and ordering from restaurant suppliers.

Now I know that's enticing as is but add in the fact that if your mid player wants to practice 1v1's at 4am and everyone's asleep, easy, bang on the pantry door and I'll log into my low but respectable 5.8k account and get you warmed up on target the forge spirit in lane with psi blades as TA. You want a cook that understands DOTA and I've been playing and following the pro scene for 8 years. You're going to find that the drive through guy at Taco Bell's knowledge just doesn't go that deep.

My needs are simple. A pantry or large cupboard where I can work on recipes without distracting the talent. An occasional ""Hey, that was really delicious"" to keep the ol confidence up. Aside from that you can pay me criminally low wages with fake health insurance because money isn't a big interest of mine and I never get sick.  

Just something to think about in the coming months as you all vie for top placements and your legacies hang in the balance. You are what you eat and nice home cooked meals free from potentially debilitating bacteria that you'll find outside is surely going to give your guys the best shot at TI7.

Where I rank the NBA's 30 franchises based on their front office competence and on-court success the past several years (weighed slightly more towards the present), from best to worst.  Hope you enjoy!

By: /u/25_Star_General_

#Lord of the Rings Trilogy Tier


30) **San Antonio Spurs**

The gold standard.  547 consecutive 50-win seasons, dating back to their time in the Mesoamerican League where they dominated the Mayan hoop ball game. Timoteo Duncano led the league in their first year with 7000 points and 3 ritual sacrifices.  The addition of conquistador Gonzalo Ginobili in their 7th year really helped establish a dynasty.

29) **Golden State Warriors**

This silicon valley darling is light years ahead.  Their entire franchise is run by their proprietary SkyeNet^^TM supercomputer, removing human bias and fallibility, and drafts/trades are determined by an algorithm combining PER, TS%, BPM, ORPM, DRPM, RAPM, WAR, WS/48, 3pAR, VORP, and the Ashe Conformity experiment to determine level of malleability when the AI takes over.

28) **Boston Celtics**

The winningest franchise in NBA history.  Power couple Danny Ainge and Brad Stevens (henceforce known as BrAingelina) continue to run the model franchise after a 2008 title.  The Nets and Kings should be placed in a Battered Women's Shelter because they've been repeatedly abused by the Celtics in some of the worst trades I've ever seen.  

#Jurassic Park Tier

27) **Houston Rockets**

We all know MoreyBall.  It's where you try to win a trade with Houston, and you end up juggling Daryl Morey's balls in your mouth.  You wake up the next morning hungover, hoping you didn't have unprotected ~~sex~~ picks on the table last night.  Harden is a revelation at PG, D'Antoni's *Seven Seconds or Less* has been vindicated, and the Rockets' black magic has resurrected the corpses of Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon.

26) **Toronto Raptors**

This team is deep, and they convinced two All-Stars to stay -- something they never managed with Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady. Lowry and DeRozan are pluses, but Drake being their mascot is a minus.  I watched a 10-minute interview on TSN during a Raptor's game and Drake is the phoniest basketball fan I've ever seen.  They asked him to go through the entire roster and what they bring to the team.  He answered ""hustle and teamwork"" for all 15, like a kid in front of the class discussing his [book report](https://youtu.be/Mp_EArT4H_E) on a book he didn't read.  I think he went a little too hard with that lint roller and cut off the circulation to his brain.



25) **Oklahoma City Thunder**

That this team never won a Championship is completely insane.  Drafting Durant, Westbrook, Harden and Ibaka might be one of the greatest feats in NBA history.  The league shot them in the left foot grandfathering Durant's contract, causing gangrene. Then OKC said ""we'll take it from here"" and amputated their right foot by mistake and let Harden go to avoid the luxury tax.  That trade produced Steven Adams, and OKC was the best team in the NBA last season, where Klay Thompson recreated the [debate scene](https://youtu.be/_yYDzLUH1NE?t=1m5s) from Old School and singlehandedly ended a dynasty.  Sam Presti is a great GM, but it's hard to feel sympathy for cheap crooks who [stole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9Dp20ydm1E) the team from Seattle.

I'd ask Clay Bennett what defeat smacks of, but that would imply he could ever get the taste of David Stern's ass out of his mouth.

24) **Atlanta Hawks**

The Atlanta Hawks have been a great organization for years now, as the Mike Budenholzer era produced great ball movement and unselfish play that produced a 60-win season and an ECF berth.  The franchise was recently sold off due to racist comments, with the sale being handled by Goldman Sachs, while trading away Jeff Teague and putting their faith in Dennis Schröder to run the team.  There's nothing more reassuring than a German ascending to power while a bank hiding gold in Switzerland is brought in due to racially-motivated remarks.

#Forrest Gump Tier

23) **Cleveland Cavaliers**

That look when you're a dumpster fire franchise but the best player in the world happens to be born in your state.  Only 3 of the 7 best-run franchises have won a championship in the past 20 years, but hey, who needs organizational discipline, good scouting, a strong analytics team, trust, and a lack of dysfunction when you can luck into three #1 picks in four years and get LeBron back for free?  This is the most undeserving franchise, in the most deserving city.  David Griffin has done a very good job, but so have the GMs of at least a dozen other franchises.  

Never underestimate the power of bungling incompetence to produce high draft picks that reward stupidity.

#French Connection Tier
^Yes, ^there's ^a ^French ^Connection ^sequel.  ^No, ^you ^shouldn't ^watch ^it.



22) **Utah Jazz**

Man, the Utah Jazz are looking really good! Although I may be overly excited about them since I just saw *Book of Mormon* on Broadway. How about that Gordon Hayward, though?  Is this the year he hoists the Larry O'Brien Trophy? I haven't seen Utahans this excited following a white guy's quest for shiny metal since Joseph Smith found the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates).  Rudy Gobert is an absolute beast.  Quin Snyder is a great coach.  Their front office has loaded the team with talent.  ESPN is [gushing](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18273165/zach-lowe-utah-jazz-gordon-hayward-rudy-gobert-nba) about them.  

Not only are they a small market team, but most of us have a place in our heart for the Jazz as our default team in *NBA JAM*.  I could probably only name 8 NBA players in the mid-90s, and one of them was Jeff Hornacek.  When your jerk friends shoved Stockton and his INJURY stat became too high, you had to swap in [The Horny GOAT](http://spreegoogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/picture-31-e1300167872288.png) for a quarter.

21) **LA Clippers**

2017 is the year I stopped believing in the Clippers.  Every year I talk myself into it, and every year they disappoint.  Chris Paul is a point god.  Nothing you say will ever convince me Blake Griffindor wasn't the best player in the NBA through the first month of the 2015 playoffs.  He destroyed the Spurs.  He made Houston look foolish.  Then he just completely ran out of gas. He would disappear in the second half of games. Now he's punching people. And his quad has the structural integrity of the Death Star.  No matter how many times you rebuild it, it keeps blowing up.  Their bench has been a constant disappointment.  Doc Rivers has not gotten it done on the GM end, and the team has had full of drama with the infamous *DeAndre Does Dallas*.  They're still a great team with three All-Stars, but it's either Finals or bust for them this season.


#Blade Runner Tier

20) **Milwaukee Bucks**

Giannis Alphabetsoupo is a legitmate superstar. Jabari Parker and Khris Middleton are great pieces, and Malcolm Brogden, Tony Snell, Greg Monroe, Thon Maker, and Delly make this team interesting as hell.  Parker tore his ACL, and they were already (Khris) middling this year, but nevertheless they're still young, and I'm optimistic.  If Jason '*The BillieKingslayer*' Kidd can avoid the temptation to make another coup, I'm confident in his ability to lead this team to greatness.


19) **Portland TrailBlazers**

If the TrailBladerunners manage to snag the eighth and final spot in the West, the Spurs better watch out, given Kawhi is likely a replicant.  If there's one thing ~~Deckard~~ Lillard is good at, it's retiring powerful foes (Just ask Houston.)

Neil Oshley went from being the NBA front office equivalent of Ari Gold on *Entourage* to Charlie Runkle on *Californication* in the span of one year, because spending $150,000,000 on Evan Turner and Allen Crabbe is a lot like getting caught masturbating in your office.  You're still one of the most talented execs in the business, but now people are definitely kinda sorta looking at you funny when you walk by them in the hall.

The most popular safe word in Oregon is ""DON'T SIGN EVAN TURNER"" because there's only so much pain BDSM enthusiasts can take.

#Rocky VII: Adrian's Revenge Tier

^No ^longer ^contenders, ^yet ^still ^refuse ^to ^quit.

18) **Dallas Mavericks**

I love Dallas.  Everything they do is just so ballsy and entertaining.  They tore down their 2011 title team believing they could do better (they couldn't).  They gave up a ton of assets making a swing for the fences with Rondo (they whiffed).  They almost orchestrated the signing of DeAndre Jordan (they didn't.)  Oh, Brave, Brave Sir Cuban.  Who nearly fought the Dragon of Angnor...  Who almost stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol... And who had personally wet himself at the [Battle of Badon Hill](https://youtu.be/d-6kuVhKzmk?t=12s).

Despite all this, they still managed two Finals appearances, culminating in a Championship.  Their head coach, Rick Carlisle, is a dark wizard.  Their owner is genuine and kind.  And unlike the Miami Heat, they paid Dirk.  It's a classy franchise with a winning culture, and even when it would be easier to tank, they're still grinding it out for a playoff spot, throwing Harrison freakin' Barnes  the max, and giving us the Curry/Bogut/Barnes lineup we craved.  

17) **Miami Heat**

They finally did it.  The maniacs.  They really did it.  They blew it up.  They disrespected the shit out of Dwayne Wade over and over and he finally left, proving definitely *La Familia* was always complete bullshit.  They amnestied Mike Miller.  LeBron left. Bosh's career is over.  The stories of ""you're making the biggest mistake of your life"" with Bron and the falling out with Shaq are now public record.

Despite all that, the Heat are still one of the best franchises in the NBA.  Four straight finals, 3 rings, one of the best coaches in the league, and Pat Riley is still a mastermind.  He orchestrated getting LeBron and Bosh, nabbed Ray Allen, traded for Dragic, turned Whiteside into a max guy, swindled Justice Winslow in the draft, and found diamond in the rough Tyler Johnson.

As their 13 game win streak proves, never underestimate a winning culture to get the most out of players.  As for getting the most out of their fans? Well... if ever there's a fire at American Airlines Arena while they're down 10, there's no need to worry, because they've all already left.  Safety first!

#Alien Quadrilogy Tier

^Might ^scare ^a ^favorite ^in ^the ^first ^round ^or ^two, ^but ^will ^decline ^as ^they ^progress.

16) **Memphis Grizzlies**

The Memphis Grizzlies are a solid organization.  Marc Gasol is an excellent basketball player -- and quite loyal!  Ditto Mike Conley.  Zach Randolph has been a key piece for years.  Vince Carter keeps defying father time.  The Grit and Grind Grizzlies have been a post-season fixture for awhile now, giving the 2015 champs a run for their money.

They've done well for a small market team, and I don't really have anything bad to say about them.  They gambled on Chandler Parsons and lost, which sucks, but a franchise in Tennessee has to take chances since they won't lure big ticket Free Agents.

I should say at least one bad thing about them.  I guess that Memphis Grizzlies fan was a giant [douchebag](http://www.totalprosports.com/2017/03/13/grizzlies-fan-trolls-chandler-parsons-right-to-his-face-say-i-ruined-the-grizz-season-baby-video/) to Parsons.  That guy looks like he lives in a frat house, takes intramural sports too seriously, and causes girls keep their hands over their drink cups at parties.

15) **Washington Wizards**

The Washington Wizards are on an absolute tear right now.  They're #3 in the East. Their starting five of John Wall, Otto Porter Jr., Bradley Beal, Markieff Morris, and Marcin Gortat is fantastic.  Things are finally looking up!

Except their bench may have, some certain, minor, you know, peripheral flaws, that in the wrong light, may, you know, sort of, ^kind ^of, ^be ^^interpreted ^^as, ^^^uh, [^^^^slightly ^^^^flammable.](http://i.imgur.com/2fdXFcW.png)  But I want to stay positive, so I'd say their secondary unit has a certain bucolic, roasting-marshmellows-by-the-fire quality, which I would in no way describe as a flaming dumpster of a bench.

The Wizards also have the distinction of leading the NBA in arrests since 2000 (honorable mention to the Jailblazers, who ranked second).  By that metric, the franchise has featured about as many guards as it has criminals. Who needs the Princeton Offense when you have the Stanford Prison Experiment!

14) **Indiana Pacers**

Paul George is having a down year, and probably heading to Lakerland after next season.  Meanwhile, Monta Ellis has fallen off a cliff, and is locked in for 3 seasons. Ditto Al Jefferson, who is a minus -- both at 10 million a pop.

They still have Myles Turner on a rookie scale contract, and he seems quite good, but I'm not sure what Indiana's plan is.  They treated Roy Hibbert badly.  Bird also fired head coach Frank Vogel despite his successful tenure there.  Not a good look for the franchise.

Hell, David West set **fire** to 11 million dollars to get away from the Pacers.  Then he got eliminated by the **Thunder**, only to join a team on the **water** in the Bay Area.  He's either chasing a ring or filling out a Pokédex. 

13) **Charlotte Hornets**

Charlotte created a lot of buzz last season, with an epic playoff battle against the Heat, featuring a classic battle between Dwayne Wade and his Pokémon [Rival](http://i.imgur.com/6nQmjCe.png).

While they've regressed this season, they still have a great coach, their front office has been noticeably better the past few years, and Kemba Walker is a monster on wheels.

It seems they'll have to wait until next season to have another go at it, as FiveThirtyEight only gives them a [2% chance](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2017-nba-predictions/?ex_cid=rrpromo) of making the playoffs.

#Jason Bourne Tier

^The ^franchise ^reboot ^tier!

12) **Minnesota Timberwolves**

CAT (Caterpillar Inc.) stock may be down due to a federal raid, but KAT (Karl-Anthony Towns) stock is up. Way up.  Sell your condo on Waiters Island and buy some KAT equipment while you can, this kid is going to be a freakin' superstar.  The T-Wolves are finally turning it around.

Rubio is on fire as a distributor (how stupid would that Derrick Rose trade have been?), and Wiggins is a legit scorer.  It appears Thibodeau may indeed be the right man for the job.  They're all on cheapo contracts and locked up for next season, too.

The only danger is Thibs running the team into the ground like he did in Chicago.  When it comes to his own players' knees, it's like he's on an Inigo Montoya [revenge spree](http://i.imgur.com/g7PElFn.png).

11) **Detroit Pistons**

Detroit is fighting for the 8th and final playoff spot in the East.  My general policy is the more Van Gundy's in the NBA, the better.  The Pistons have some nice pieces, but can't seem to get over the hump.  They played great against the Cavs in the playoffs last year, so I'm surprised they haven't improved.

I'd say just tank and wait it out until LeBron James retires in 2024, but that's the same year LeBron Jr. is coming into the league. Piston's LeBron-induced PTSD should see us well into 2045, when Detroit fans will finally emerge from their underground caverns petting their 2004 replica rings whispering *my precious*.

The Eye of LeBron is ever watchful.



10) **Philadelphia 76ers**

Trust the Process. I'm a huge Sam Hinkie fan.  The man gave 76ers fans hope, and a future.  Embiid is a superstar if he can stay healthy.  Saric is going to win ROTY.  Ben Simmons is a #1 pick.  They're flush with assets, cap space, and could even land the #1 and #4 picks [this](http://i.imgur.com/DzYHO4d.png) draft.  

What could possibly go wrong?

BRYAN: ""Once we trade away Okafor and keep Noel -- or was it keep Okafor and trade Noel? Gosh, it's so hard to remember who's who!  One is a centerpiece in the mold of Tyson Chandler, and the other is a defensive sieve who gives zero effort and can't play in a modern offense?  I just can't seem to remember, dad!""

JERRY: ""I'm busy pushing the guy who acquired all these assets in astute trades and long-term planning, you handle it, son!""

9) **Denver Nuggets**

They have the Joker, a 21 year old phenom and franchise centerpiece.  'Nuff said.

8) **LA Lakers**

The Lakers lack what Minnesota, Denver, New York, and New Orleans have -- an All-Star caliber player to build around.  [Tank Commander Byron Scott](http://i.imgur.com/0Z37ale.jpg) is gone, but his mission lives on.  Los Angeles has a 55.8% chance of keeping their pick if it falls in the 1-3 range, and they've shut down all their veterans except for Nick Young (to avoid looking too shameless).  Instead, they'll just play Iggy Azalea music every time he goes to shoot.

Don't want Swaggy P accidentally making one!

7) **Orlando Magic**

They say every time the Orlando Magic draft a Center, a 30 for 30 *'What If'* documentary gets its wings.

Orlando seems like it's in a pretty bad place.  Their Ibaka trade was a bust, they have the third worst record in the NBA, and they are the only team in the NBA without a single player over 1.0 RPM. How is that even possible?  How do you not have a single player worth 1 extra point per 100 possessions over the average NBA player?

It's hard to have any confidence in a team paying Jeff Green and Bismack Biyombo a combined $32,000,000 a year.

Hopefully they can get a great pick in this deep draft and turn things around.  The Magic's 2017 Team Photo doesn't exactly [inspire](http://i.imgur.com/eipugIu.jpg?fb) confidence.

6) **New Orleans Pelicans**

New Orleans is the world capital of Voodoo, yet for some reason it was the Houston Rockets that reanimated the corpses of Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon.  Ouch.

You know what Anthony Davis could really use?  Some three-point shooters spacing the floor to open up the offense.  Pelicans fans will defend letting them go due to the fact they were oft injured, but nevertheless, those guys sure look good in the Lone Star State right now.

Instead, they made a splash and traded for Demarcus Cousins for cheap, a move which I like and they very much had to make.  It has worked out horribly thus far, but we'll see if they can figure it out next season.  There's definitely some inherent risk, given their 1st round pick could be quite valuable this year and Boogie might walk in 2018.

To keep him, they'll need to re-sign Jrue Holiday, the only other good player on the team, but given that they're already at $89,000,000 without him for the 2017-2018 season, will they have any money left over to sign FAs?

That contract they gave Omer Asik was fucking terrible, and will hurt their ability to put a team around their two All-Star bigs.

5) **Phoenix Suns**

The Suns' three best players are Devin Booker (age 20), Eric Bledsoe (age 27), and Tyson Chandler (age 34).  That's some perfectly normal spacing between births -- if you're a Vulcan mother going through [Pon farr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pon_farr) every 7 years.  It's fucking terrible if you're an NBA franchise.

For comparison, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green are all between the ages of 26 and 28.

I don't know what the hell the Phoenix Suns are doing, but signing Brandon Knight to a 5-year, 70 million dollar contract through 2020 doesn't seem like the answer.  They have some serious issues to address, both in terms of shot creation and nacho bowl creation, at least according to [Charles Barkley](https://youtu.be/uTOzKTxckd0).

4) **Chicago Bulls**

The Fire GarPax [movement](http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/chicagoinc/ct-garpax-protest-chicago-inc-spt-0303-20170302-story.html) is in full swing in the windy city.  The pair reportedly [lowballed](http://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/244760/Bulls-Threatened-To-Cut-Jimmy-Butlers-Minutes-If-He-Didnt-Sign-Extension-In-2014) budding superstar Jimmy Butler and told him ""if you don't sign this extension, we're going to play Tony Snell over you. We are going to give you his minutes and that's going to drop your numbers"" in order to depress his market value as an RFA, in true piece of shit fashion.

Butler also warned new players about Randy Brown being a front office rat reporting on players, something Rip Hamilton [confirmed](http://www.thescore.com/nba/news/1223297-rip-hamilton-coaches-warned-me-about-bulls-front-office-snitch) in February.  They also unceremoniously pushed former coach Tom Thibodeau out the door.

The franchise is a complete disaster at the moment, the team is dysfunctional, and the players have zero trust in the Bulls' Tony Soprano-wannabe front office.

But hey, they've shaken up things a bit, and GarPax has hired a [new assistant coach](http://i.imgur.com/Lay7rBq.jpg) to regain the player's confidence, so things are looking up!




3) **Brooklyn Nets**

The Nets don't have their own first round pick until 2019.

Billy King traded away 7 first round picks in 3 years in exchange for 1 second-round playoff berth.

Everything about this franchise makes me sad.  I feel like Horatio on the castle platform at the beginning of *Hamlet*, watching the dispirited corpse of Nets fans, their flair faded, crying out for justice against the King who slew them and forfeited their picks.

It's fitting the Brooklyn Nets official color is black.  Even Hamlet's mother loved Brook Lopez so much she wished him to another team, saying ""Good [HamLopez], cast thy nighted colour off.""  To which the ever-loyal Brook replied:

HAMLOPEZ

*'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,*


*Nor customary suits of solemn black,*

[...]


*But I have that within which passeth show;*


*These but the trappings and the suits of woe.*


2) **Sacramento Kings**

The only thing that keeps this franchise out of the #1 spot is that Vivek Ranadivé helped keep the team in Sacramento, and that there doesn't seem to be the same level of evil fucking assholes and front office snitches that permeate the Bulls and the Knicks.

It seems to just be sheer levels of staggering incompetence.  The Kings are like *The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo*... if the movie ended after he unchains her from the bed 30 minutes in.  No wonder Adam Silver intervened and sent Sam Hinkie packing.  What he did to Sacramento via trade was pretty unforgivable.

On top from the revolving door of coaches and political infighting, they let Isaiah Thomas and Seth Curry go for nothing, sent Boogie packing for peanuts, whiffed on almost every draft pick, got repeatedly trade-raped, and according to Zach Lowe, were reportedly **unaware of the stretch provision**.

How is that even fucking possible?  I've never been within 500 feet of an NBA front office (or Angelina Jolie, for that matter, thanks to a very unfair restraining order), and even I know about the stretch provision.  And that judge completely misunderstood the fan fiction I sent her.  I was biting Angelina's neck to Sire her, not injure her, so we could be together forever as Vampires.  It was completely innocent.

What were we talking about again?

#Braindead Tier

1) **New York Knicks**

Fitting that we begin and end with Peter Jackson-directed films, as intelligence and success, like [George and Elaine](https://youtu.be/1AjxoQA7EcE?t=30s), shift between the two P. Jacksons the longer Phil remains championship abstinent with the Knicks.  Constantly harping about how the triangle would help NYK win without the right personnel doesn't make sense.  The only triangular-shaped object that would make the Knicks champs is a flux capacitor inside a DeLorean traveling back to 1973.

The centerpiece of this shitcicle, of course, is Knicks owner and Sackville-Baggins hobbit James Dolan.  Petty and vindictive, he is constantly banning people from MSG, because that's what insecure trust fund babies do.  From Woody Allen to Charles Oakley, no one is safe from this poster child for nepotism.  Deeply mistrustful, he has spies everywhere in the organization, and has played a key role in the ~~Scouring of the Shire~~ Knicks' playoff drought.

Their treatment of former players is embarrassing, their conduct shameful, and their basketball decisions (outside of drafting Porzingod) have been just as bad.  This is the worst franchise in the NBA, something I didn't think possible with Sacramento existing, but here we are.  Their PR machine tweeting ""hope he gets some help soon"" put them over the top for me.

It takes some seriously braindead and malicious front office behavior to top the Kings and the Nets, so congrats to the New York Knicks.  You truly are a dumpster fire of a franchise.

#EDIT:

&gt;What he's trying to say is that the disclaimer that it's only ""slightly more towards the present"" is inaccurate and that it's heavily more weighted towards the present.

Err, yes, I misspoke. I meant weighted more towards the present while looking **only** at the last few years.  I should have clarified.

Otherwise the Heat would be in the Top 5 looking ten years back, the Lakers would be Top 3 going back forever (at the very least), and Golden State would be in the Bottom 3.

&gt;There are people in this thread getting angry for the inaccuracy of their team's description/ranking made by a dude who described Spurs as a franchise with 547 consecutive 50-win seasons, dating back to their time in the Mesoamerican League where they dominated the Mayan hoop ball game. Stop what you are doing for a moment and just think about this.

Yes, I should have expanded my opening paragraph to better explain this isn't meant to be accurate, and was purely for entertainment purposes.

inibrius,2017-03-17 20:26:19+00:00,I don't have to be nice.,"So this was just fun.  

At lunch a few minutes ago, had to run by a local sporting goods store.  (Apparently every new sport my kid does requires new clothes and accessories).  So I'm perusing volleyball kneepads (who even knew that was a thing for 9 year olds) got my phone googling to figure out what size I need, and this woman walks up next to me, snorts, and says 'well that's not very professional'.  I ignored her, as in this area there's a thing called the 'Seattle freeze' where we don't talk to random people in stores, as they might either be a. crazy, or b. want to start a conversation with you.  

Well she proceeds to stick her hand in front of my phone screen and say 'didn't you hear what I said?'  I looked up, and big surprise, middle aged woman, wearing spandex that's screaming 'ow ow ow stop I give up', a $200 workout jacket over it, and a foul look on her face.  Said 'please don't do that.  What do you want anyway?'  

She starts in about my outfit, and how unprofessional it is.  In honor of St Patty and him hating snek, I'm wearing a green flannel shirt, a t-shirt with shamrocks that says 'converve water drink beer' on it, jeans, and a hat with a green triforce on it.  I look down and say 'ok, but who cares?  My boss doesn't give a shit, so why does it matter?  You should really mind your business.'  And I look back at my phone trying to understand why a 4'6"" kid wears a medium but a 4'7"" kid wears a small.  She puts her hand on my phone and tries to knock it out of my hands.  

""Lady, I appreciate your concern, but I'm really not interested in your opinion.  Now get your hands the fuck off of me before you lose them."" 

Well she shrieks.  ""WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME?  YOU CAN""T TALK TO ME THAT WAY! GET ME YOUR MANAGER NOWWWWWW!""

At that point I got where she was coming from, and quickly said 'ah.  I see your problem.  I don't work here.'  Well she's beyond listening.  She's got a whole rant going.  

Store manager comes up to see what's going on, I totally ignore her and before she can say anything ask 'hey bro, do you know anything about kids volleyball pads?  I'm lost here, and this chick freaking out isn't helping.'  

You could literally watch the gears in her head churn.  She finally realized that I didn't work there, and turned purple in the face.  Wasn't even red.  PURPLE.  Thought she was gonna die.  I asked 'lady, you ok?'  She squeeked and ran out of the store.

Told the manager what happened, he laughed.  Gave me 10% off.  ",IDontWorkHereLady,1774

Sidekicknicholas,2017-03-17 17:56:04+00:00,Lateral job move with 2x the salary ... you have to take it right?!,"I'll try and be brief -

Really like my current job (Engineer), LOVE my current manager, like where I live, and other than not saving as much as I would like, life is great.  I live in an extremely low cost of living part of the Midwest and make good pay for the area ($80k + ~7-10% bonus).  Problem is there is no room to grow where I'm at besides my current manager's job and I'm pretty certain he has at least 6-8 years before he retires... and even then I'm by no means promised that role.

I received a message two weeks ago on Linked In from a talent person from this new company (not a generic headhunter).  I spoke to their talent person twice, and what would be my manager once.  Everyone seemed great, the position seemed like something I'm certain I could do well, and its large enough company where I'm not worried about it going out.  The next step would be potentially flying out to the location of the new job, touring the facility, etc etc.  Its essentially what I do now but I would working with two manufacturing plants vs. currently I oversee one. I would be working / looking to move to Seattle, WA .... so a much much more expensive cost of living.

Assuming things keep rolling forward, we've sort of sussed out that for me to be interested I would need $150k to make the move worth while, they seemed agreeable to that.  I would be almost doubling my current pay, which to me is 2x my 401k contribution + 2x match right off the top.  Washington also doesn't have state income tax (sales tax is higher though) so that would be like another free 6% raise.   

After we sell our current house, buy an a home for $600k or less in Seattle (my current number I use to budget), after all pre and post tax deductions, assumed bills for heat/electric/cell phone/cable/etcetc, current car payments and 2x the cost for car insurance,  giving us $500/wk for my wife and I to live on, I could stick ~$5k/mo away.  Right now we save ~$1k a month on top of the 401ks.  Roughly $60k extra a year in the bank would be quite nice.

At 29, this much of a bump makes a huge difference on when I could retire... If I get offered the job, I pretty much have to take this right?!

**EDIT**

Thanks for all the info, I really appreciate it!

I should clarify a few things - the ""buy a home"" section was sort of for reference for budget sake... I would plan on leasing for probably a year, maybe 6-months if I found one.  Also when it would be time to buy I would not be looking near downtown or east.  Most likely West Seattle or stretching south to Kent, Renton, Des Moines, etc.,... I would think $600k get it done in those areas.

And my budget numbers were including my wife's salary assuming she doesn't make a dime more than she currently does.

Thanks again!

PocketOxford,2017-03-12 20:18:15+00:00,My worst motel experience ever,"Last year, my best friend Ally and I went on this great American roadtrip, trying to ski in as many states as possible in the month we had taken off from work. We did a lot of skiing, a lot of driving, and a lot of sleeping on various couches, truck stops, and of course, in motels. Most motels were fine. Some had great free breakfasts, some had dirty hot tubs that left us scrubbing ourselves in the shower and joking about getting pregnant from the water, some had weird stains we tried not to think about, some were spotless but cold, a few were amazing. Only one was terrifying. 


We stopped at the motel around 10:30 after a long day of skiing followed by a good six hours of driving. We were tired and sore and ready for bed. We had made some wrong turns, and were not exactly sure where we were. We didn’t want to use data on our Canadian phones, so we were navigating old school with a map. It was mildly unsuccessful, but we were pretty sure we had a few more hours of driving until the next town, and we were not looking forward to it. So when we saw the glorious neon sign that blinked “Motel” and “Vacancy” at us, we didn’t need to say anything. We both knew that was where we were staying for the night.


As we pulled up in front of the office, I noted that we were the only people staying there. I told myself that it wasn’t creepy, we were stopping close to a summer tourist spot midwinter, of course there would be an excess of rooms. In fact, we should consider ourselves lucky that they were open at all. It was definitely not creepy.


We entered the office, and a shrill little bell announced our entry to the world. We waited for someone to come to the front desk. Then we waited a bit longer. We shared looks with lifted eyebrows, and tapped our fingers impatiently on the desk. 


“Hello?” Ally called out in the silence. “Somebody here?” 


We waited a few more minutes, then the door behind the counter slowly opened. An old man poked his head out, spotted us, and his face split into a wide grin.
 

“Guests!” He said. “You know, I thought I heard something, but I told myself it was just my imagination. Just my imagination. We don’t get a lot of visitors around this time. And two beautiful young ladies too. Ah. I’m sorry I kept you waiting. I just couldn’t believe that I had such luck. Welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome.”


He was certainly an odd duck, but I used to work long lonely night shifts, I know how excited you get when something happens. 


“So, travel weary strangers, can I offer you a bed to rest your head?” He smiled.


“Yeah, how much is a double room?” 


He looked at us, grin not wavering. 


“$99 for two beds. $79 for one bed.” 


I was ready to splurge for the two beds. Ally moved a lot in her sleep, and hogged the covers. Last night she had kept waking me up. 


“Let’s do two beds.” I looked at her pleadingly. 


She gave me a quick look filled with annoyance. 


I looked back at the man. His grin had faded. He looked as annoyed as Ally for a moment. When he noticed me looking at him, his grin snapped back into place.


“Ah, actually, it seems we only have the one bed rooms ready. I’m so sorry.”


“Wait, what?” I couldn’t help but burst out. “There are like no people here!”


“Oh, yes, that is the problem, isn’t it. Sometimes we don’t keep all the rooms prepped in winter. Saves costs, you know.”


I considered that. It didn’t make sense at all, but I was too tired to argue. 


“You know what, for such pretty ladies, I give you a discount. How about $69 for the one bed room?”


“We’ll take it!” Ally responded before I had time to think. “Thank you! We can pay by card, right?” 


“Ah, no, I’m afraid not. We don’t – well, we never got around to that modern stuff. Gotta stay off the grid, right? Haha!” He laughed at his own joke. I shuddered involuntarily. 


We had cash. It was fine. He was creepy, but we were tired. We paid, got the keys, and drove up and parked in front of the room. I grabbed my stuff from the car, unlocked the door, and surveyed the room. It looked clean enough, the bed was big, and I was tired as hell.


“Hey, I’m gonna go for a little walk, actually. My legs are so stiff.” Ally said from behind me. “Wanna come?”


I eyed the bed. It looked too comfortable. Ally had a good point, but that bed was speaking to me. 


“Nah, I’ll just shower and crash.”


“Ok, cool. I won’t be very long.” 


She turned and left. I slammed the door shut behind me, and stripped out of my clothes as fast as I could. I jumped in the shower, and the luxurious feeling of hot water run down my body. I had to force myself to get out. I went into the room, put on my PJ’s, and laid down on the bed. Ally wasn’t back yet, but her nighttime strolls sometimes lasted as long as an hour, even when she was this tired. She had a hard time falling asleep, and those walks apparently helped. 


I got my phone out, and tried connecting to the wifi. It didn’t work. I immediately got annoyed. Not because I really needed the wifi, but because I had paid for it, and I wanted it. 


So I just laid there, getting annoyed, glaring at the ceiling fan. It was a weird model, something black sticking out from the bottom. I had never seen that before. I wondered idly what it did. 


Then I thought about how we were the only people staying here, how Ally was walking somewhere alone in the dark, how I didn’t know where she was, how creepy that guy had been when he laughed at his joke about staying of the grid. Then the familiar feeling of fear started creeping into my guts. I knew where my mind was going. I have an overactive imagination, I tend to turn every situation into a horror movie in my head. It’s a real problem in my dating life. I think most guys are serial killers. Ally always makes fun of me for it. 


I thought about how the guy had offered us two beds, and then refused to give it to us. Did he want us in this room specifically? Why? He probably had some creepy fantasy of two young girls sharing a bed. Urgh. I shook my head, trying to stop my mind from spinning out of control. I go of the bed, and went over to the huge mirror on the wall. I got my hair out of the towel, and started brushing it. I couldn’t quite get rid of the uneasy feeling at the pit of my stomach. I knew I wouldn’t sleep well that night. 


For some reason, I thought of the one way mirror scene in Cabin in the Woods. God, why do I watch horror movies? They always come back to me at the worst times. So creepy. I vaguely recalled that there’s a way to check if it’s a real mirror. What was it again? You touch the mirror, and if there’s no gap between your finger and the mirror finger, it’s fake? 


I touched the mirror. There was no gap. I could see my eyes widening in fear in the mirror. 


No wait, that can’t be it, I tried to reason with myself. That’s ridiculous. This is fine. We’re fine. It’s gotta be the other way around. But maybe…


I realized I could check the bathroom mirror. It was one of those medicine cabinet mirrors, that one was clearly real. 


I walked slowly into the bathroom. Please be the same, please be the same, please be the same, I muttered. I wiped the fogged mirror, took a breath, and slowly pressed my index finger against the surface. Ice filled my veins. A gap. I took a deep breath, trying to clear my mind. We needed to get out of there. Where was Ally? I felt panic bubbling. I needed to get out of there. Ok. But play it cool. They could be watching. Who the hell are they? I can’t let them know I know. I have to get out of here. 


The black thing on the fan. My breath caught in my throat. It had to be a camera. 


I went back into the bedroom, and started putting my stuff back in my little bag. I hoped it looked innocent enough. Maybe we wanted an early start, right? Maybe I had OCD and liked all my stuff in my bag. It was fine. I went to put the bag in the car. I turned the doorknob. 


It didn’t move. 


I tried to stay calm, not to panic. They could be watching.


Maybe it was jammed. I tried the handle again. Nothing. I used all my force. Nothing. 


I got my phone out, figured I’d text Ally, call the police. Something.  


No signal. I wanted to cry. I looked around the room for a window. For the first time, I noticed they had bars in front of them. I’ve seen that before, of course. It’s a safety precaution, my ground floor apartment in the city also had them. So that people can’t break in. I had never before considered that they also very effectively stopped people from breaking out. 


I figured the door must unlock from the outside only. Once you’re in the room, you’re stuck there. I pinned all my hopes on that idea. Ally would come back, unlock the door, and we’d get out of there.  


The next ten minutes were the longest of my life. I kept trying to come up with a plan, with something, but my mind was drowned in adrenaline. Finally I heard steps outside. 


Ally was back! 


I got up, standing right next to the door. She put the key in the lock, turned it, and it opened.


“Ally, get in the car right now.” I said as I pushed her out of the room. 


“W-what? Why?”


“Fucking camera in the room.” I hissed as I pushed her back.


Her eyes went wide, and she immediately obliged. I unlocked the car, threw my bag in the back, and we both jumped in.


The door to the adjacent room burst open, and the old man came running out. He slammed his hands on the hood, as if to try to hold us back with his bare hands. 


We both screamed as I skidded out of there. 


Even in my panic I could see several shapes behind him, in the room. He had not been alone. 


I just kept driving, praying that they weren’t following us. 


“We have to call the police.” Ally said after an hour of driving. “We have to.”


I nodded. 


She used her precious data to find the number of the local sheriff’s office, and called them up. Only heard half the conversation.


“Hey, I want to report a – an almost crime, I’m sorry, I’m not quite sure what –”


“No sir, it’s not a joke.” 


“We were staying at this motel, and there was a … a camera.”


“And one of those one way mirrors!” I interjected.


“What?” She turned to me. 


“Yeah, tell him!”


“And a one way mirror. And the door didn’t unlock from the inside.” She said, looking to me for confirmation. I nodded. 


“And there were people in the room behind that mirror, too.”

Her eyes went wide in fear as she repeated the information. Then she described the location of the motel. 


“Yes.”


“Mm, no.” She sounded uncertain.


“We’ve been skiing.” She frowned.


“Yeah?”


“No, that’s fine, we’d rather not.”


I looked at her quizzically.


“No really, we’re already out of state. We just wanted to let you know.”


She abruptly hung up. 


“What was that?”


“I don’t know, he wanted us to come back and give a statement.”


“Shouldn’t we?”


She didn’t say anything for a little while. “I don’t know, I got a really bad vibe. I just, let’s not, please? And small town American sheriff’s office? That’s like totally how you die in the horror movies.”


“We’re not in a horror movie though.”


“Aren’t we?”


I shrugged. I wasn’t really stoked on the idea of going back either. Frankly, I was still worried that they were following us. I really didn’t want to get pushed off the road by some psycho hillbilly motel manager. And we had told the police, we had done our part. Or so I thought.



But yesterday, there was a story in the news about a three young girls going missing. They were roadtripping. In that area. Never made it back to Seattle.


I can’t help but wonder if they stopped at that same motel. I can’t help but wonder what would have happened if Ally didn’t take that walk. If we both got locked in that room. What the people in the other room expected. What they were gonna do. If they’d just watch, of if … well, if Ally and I could have been that missing persons story.

Due to the darkness and haze, the pilot could not determine the helicopter's position and course to get back to the airport.

The pilot saw a tall building with lights on and flew toward it, the pilot had the passenger draw a handwritten sign reading, ""WHERE AM I?"", and hold it up for the building's occupants to see.

People in the building quickly responded to the aircraft, drew a large sign, and held it in a building window.

Their sign said, ""YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER.""

The pilot smiled, waved, looked at his map, determined the course to steer to SEATAC airport, and landed safely.

After they were on the ground, the passenger asked the pilot how the ""YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER"" sign helped determine their position.

The pilot responded, ""I knew that had to be the Microsoft support building, they gave me a technically correct but entirely useless answer.""

For years, I've had 2-3 plastic pink flamingos a corner of my front yard, as an homage to my hometown. Occasionally, the flamingos would get stolen, but I'd always replace them.

With the most recent theft, I bemoaned it on Facebook. One of my friends from 30 years ago (she's still in Florida) commented that she ""didn't realize I was into that lifestyle."" When I asked her privately, she told me it was a way for swingers in a neighborhood to find each other.

Needless to say, I didn't replace the flamingos this time. Not that there's anything wrong with that lifestyle, but it's just not mine.

But...how and when did pink plastic flamingoes become a symbol of swingers? 
Also, I'm guessing these churches and other groups who ""flock"" homes as fundraisers/pranks don't realize this, either...?",OutOfTheLoop,3195

Since I have covered the history of MLS and the league structure over the past two years, I will save the characters and instead provide new updates for this year. For anyone looking for a brief run down on the league's format, [you can find last year's post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/48dame/2016_guide_to_mls/). If you are interested in the history of MLS, [check out the guide I wrote two years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/2wzjr3/2015_guide_to_mls/).

To recap, the 2016 MLS Champions were the Seattle Sounders. FC Dallas won the Supporter's Shield (best regular season record) and the US Open Cup. Toronto FC won the Voyageurs Cup (Canadian Championship).

------------------------------------------------------------------

**What's new this year?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Last year, MLS announced that teams would be receiving ""targeted allocation money (or TAM)."" In a nutshell, teams would be receiving $800,000 annually to spend on players who made more than the league maximum salary ($480,625). The money could be used to buy down the impact a player's salary had against the cap, open up Designated Player spots by buying down a player's salary, or traded as a form of currency.

In practice, TAM has two major impacts. First, it keeps successful players in the league. In the past, star players would have to go abroad if they wanted a fair wage for their talent. Now, teams can compensate their talent with a more competitive salary through TAM and keep them in the league.

Second, it helps improve overall squad quality. With the Designated Player Rule, teams were able to sign star players like a David Beckham, Kaka, or David Villa who was instantly the best player on the team. With TAM, teams are now able to fill out the middle of the squad with successful international players who may otherwise not be worth a Designated Player contract. For example, my team used TAM to sign Bosnian international Haris Medunjanin this off-season. He does not have the star quality to be a top 2 player on the squad and to warrant a DP investment, but he should be a top 5 player on the team. TAM allows a team to improve the middle of the squad, raising the overall quality of the team more than a single DP player could.

This year, MLS has increased annual TAM to $1.2 million. This allows more signings and an overall increase of the quality of MLS squads while allowing teams to hold onto their best players. The inevitable goal is to finally be able to compete with Liga MX teams in the CONCACAF Champions League and to raise the quality of MLS league wide.

Additionally, MLS has introduced new inititatives to help develop Canadian players. Canadians who were in youth academies prior to the age of 16 will now count as domestic players who will no longer require international spots for US teams. As well, MLS will pursue signing young Canadian players to Generation Adidas contracts prior to the draft, exempting their salary from the salary cap. Finally, MLS has set aside funds to help MLS teams sign Canadians abroad such as Atiba Hutchinson.

Otherwise, the other major off-season initiative has to been to reward youth development. Last year, MLS announced an additional $125,000 in for Homegrown Players Funds for teams over the next two years. This year, MLS teams will be provided with two extra roster spots reserved solely for homegrown players, bringing the roster up from 28 spots to 30. This will provide extra value to teams such as FC Dallas who have prioritized building their roster through academy youth.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Future**
-------------------

Expansion is the major focus in the near future. [Minnesota United](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e8/Minnesota_United_FC_\(MLS\)_Primary_logo.svg/1200px-Minnesota_United_FC_\(MLS\)_Primary_logo.svg.png) and [Atlanta United](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bb/Atlanta_MLS.svg/1024px-Atlanta_MLS.svg.png) join the league this year while [Los Angeles FC](https://lafc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFC_logo.png) joins next year. David Beckham's Miami project is in doubt as he has hit roadblock after roadblock from the city.

Currently, MLS has announced four expansion spots are open, but don't be surprised to see the number increase to five if Beckham's Miami project finally falls through. This has been the strongest round of expansion bids with several robust markets and ownerships competing for the spots. The 12 bids are:

* Charlotte, North Carolina: The Queen City is the largest city in North Carolina, and the city's location allows the team to brand itself as the team for both of the Carolinas. It fills a major geographic gap in the American South, establishes a top level team in a traditionally major American sports market, and sets up a rivalry with Atlanta.

* Cincinnati, Ohio: In FC Cincinnati's first season last year, the team surprised everyone by averaging an attendance of over 17,000. The immediate success rocketed them into expansion discussion as one of the favorites. Cincy would make natural rivals with Columbus who shares the same state.

* Detroit, Michigan: The past few decades have not been kind to Motown with the city making headlines for corruption, crime, and economic crisis. However, the city has remained a major sports market and a staple on the professional sports scene. A strong ownership ground, a rich soccer scene, and its major market status are the crutch of the expansion bid, but a questionable stadium plan could leave the bid dead in the water.

* Indianapolis, Indiana: A few years ago, Indy Eleven began play to a large fanfare but early growing pains hurt their attendance. A strong owner, natural potential rivalries, an established fan base, and a recognizable brand solidifies their expansion bid.

* Nashville, Tennessee: Seen as a long shot, Nashville has a few factors working in its favor. The prospective owner is a billionaire with the money to throw around to help the team hit the ground running while the city, itself, fills a geographic hole in the American South, has a growing millennial population, and is a fast growing metro area.

* Phoenix, Arizona: Based around the fantastically named Phoenix Rising FC, the bid benefits from Phoenix's status as the largest market currently bidding for a team. An eclectic but influential ownership group, large Latino population, and history of youth soccer help the bid. Additionally, Phoenix would fill a wide open hole in the Southwest. However, the failure of lower league teams in the past and logistical difficulties of playing a summer league in the desert may hurt Phoenix's chances though there was been talk of a climate controlled stadium.

* Raleigh/Durham, North Carolina: The other North Carolina bid looks to distinguish itself from Charlotte. While the latter could bill itself as the team of the Carolinas, Raleigh would focus on the Research Triangle. In its favor are a rapidly growing market with a larger millennial population, and an owner who has quickly developed clout in American soccer.

* Sacramento, California: Sacramento Republic is as close to a sure thing as any of these teams based on their lower league support. Owner in-fighting seemed to derail the bid, but the owners seemed to have settled their differences. Sacramento should attain one of the four spots.

* San Antonio, Texas: Though one of the smallest markets bidding for a team, San Antonio has a few advantages working in its favor. The only sports competitor in the city (the Spurs) owns them, ensuring the two teams will work hand-in-hand to promote and support each other. Additionally, the owners are among the most respected in American sports, building a very strong team in San Antonio. Perhaps the dark horse bid in this round of expansion, San Antonio will hope to make some waves moving forward.

* San Diego, California: The relocation of their NFL team to Los Angeles opened up the door to San Diego. Very little major sports competition and an attractive city to foreign talent should help their bid, but Sacramento's near certainty should hurt their bid.

* St. Louis, Missouri: A historical hotbed for soccer in America, the lack of a strong ownership group has been the main factor that has kept St. Louis from joining the league sooner. Another NFL relocation to LA may finally be the opening the city needs, but the bid will come down to whether the ownership group can nail down their stadium plan.

* Tampa/St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa's success likely hinges on Beckham's Miami bid. Should Beckham finally make some progress, a third Florida bid would be a much harder sell. However, Tampa could make a case for being a better option than Miami. The former is a larger market and the largest market in the expansion bid, has a very ambitious if eccentric owner with large clout in the city, and has lower league success. The bid has only gotten stronger over time, and they should make a strong run for one of the four spots.

------------------------------------------------------------------


F.A.Q.
--------

(I can update this with new questions.)
*Why is there no relegation/promotion?*

* Unfortunately, it is not economically feasible at present. The fear is that if a team gets relegated, fans will stop coming to matches, and the owner will fold the team. The average American sports fan is used to supporting the best teams in the world at their sport (NFL, MLB, NBA, etc.). We aren't at a point yet in popularity or financial stability where the risk of promotion/relegation is worth taking. I do hope to see it within a few decades.

*Why does MLS run spring to fall?*

* It's the same reason that Scandinavia runs spring to fall. The northern part of our country gets bombarded with snow in the winter unlike most of Europe. Even in March, a handful of MLS cities are still covered in snow. Plus, we don't want to compete against the NFL, NBA, and NHL.

*Isn't MLS a retirement league?*

* Not at all. The league has generally been moving more towards signing players under 30 like Giovinco, Nicolas Lodeiro, Miguel Almiron, and Romain Alessandrini.


*Why is the Supporter's Shield less prestigious than the MLS Cup?*

* In part, America values playoffs far more than the regular season. Also, the unbalanced schedule makes it an unfair comparison between teams. Where's the fairness in playing the Union three times compared to playing LA three times? The East is typically worse than the West, meaning Eastern teams have a better shot at winning the Shield.

*Who is an attacking team in MLS?*

* Your best bet would be Dallas who has put together a fun, swashbuckling side. Otherwise, Giovinco and Toronto are a clear choice.",soccer,1274

iltdiTX,2017-02-12 19:44:23+00:00,"18 states offer in-state college tuition for illegal immigrants. Many of those states, WA being one of them, also offer state financial aid to illegal immigrants.","Illegal immigrants will almost always get approved for state financial aid and need-based tuition assistance, up to and over 100%, because they have no IRS documented income to declare (employers aren't allowed to hire you legitimately if you are illegally in the country). 

Now add that on to Plyler v. Doe U.S. Supreme Court decision where  states are required to provide all students with K-12 public education, regardless of students' immigration status.


This cost matters.  In 2011 the Supreme Court ordered Washington's legislature to produce a plan for fully funding education by April 2014.  The state couldn't do it and the court found the state in contempt. 

When the state of WA still couldn't produce a plan a year later, so the justices added a fine of $100,000 per day to the state until they produce a plan which fully funds education in the state. [1](http://hechingerreport.org/owed-to-washington-state-students-100000-a-day-in-fines-for-a-year-without-school-funding/)


They still haven't produced that plan.  They promised to have it done by the end of 2017, which probably wont happen in democrat WA.  By that time, the tax payers will be on the hook for nearly $60 million in federal fines. 


In 2012, the state of WA paid about $9,672 per pupil in public schools. [2](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2015/06/02/the-states-that-spend-the-most-and-the-least-on-education-in-one-map/)


There are 1,088,959 pupils in WA public schools. [3](http://www.k12.wa.us/AboutUs/KeyFacts.aspx)

7.1% of pupils in public schools are undocumented. [4](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/11/21/how-many-k-12-students-are-illegal-immigrants/)


Therefore, using the cited numbers, there are 77,316 undocumented students.  

Using the 2012 per student cost, this is a **$747,800,352** financial burden for k-12 education for WA state simply **for undocumented k-12 students**.


Now in 2017, WA state has a budget shortfall for education of $74,000,000. [5](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/education/seattle-schools-project-74-million-shortfall-next-year-biggest-since-1970s/) This is the shortfall the state is in contempt of the Supreme Court about, and paying a $100,000 per day fine over. 

The entire state budget will have a shortfall of $500,000,000 in the next budget cycle [6](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/state-budget-outlook-predicts-big-shortfall-in-next-budget-cycle/)



The state of Washington could adhere to the Supreme Court ruling of fully funding k-12 education by **removing just 10% of the illegal undocumented students** in this state.  

**If they removed 50%, they would eliminate the entire state budget shortfall** for the next budget cycle (2 years).  

If they removed 100% the state would have a windfall of money and could give that back to the citizens, businesses, and legal residents of this state in the form of tax cuts.  Or just put it back into the education system to give our state the best education in the country.

""Remember Amherst College student ""John Doe,"" who was expelled for sexual misconduct, even though he had good reason to believe that his accuser had actually assaulted him? A judge recently blocked Doe's attempt to subpoena his female accuser's text messages on grounds that re-litigating the matter ""would impose emotional and psychological trauma"" on her.

Consider the implications of this decision. According to Seattle District Judge James Robart, a student who believes Amherst violated his due process rights, wrongfully expelled him, and ignored subsequent evidence that his accuser, ""Sandra Jones,"" was the actual violator of the college's sexual misconduct policies, does not deserve the opportunity to make his case because someone else's feelings are more important.

Whatever happened to believing the victim?

The incident in question took place years ago, during the late night / early morning hours of February 4-5, 2012. Jones was Doe's girlfriend's roommate at the time. Jones went to Doe's dorm room and sexual activity ensued: Jones performed oral sex on Doe.

But Doe was blackout drunk at the time—a detail that Amherst administrators deemed ""credible,"" on subsequent review. Of course, it's questionable whether a blackout drunk student can actually provide the level of consent that Amherst's sexual misconduct policy requires.

Other factors cast doubt on the idea that Jones was the victim and Doe the perpetrator. After leaving Doe's dorm room, Jones texted another male student and asked him to come to her dorm room for sex. She also texted a residential advisor about her ""stupid"" decision to engage in sexual activity with her roommate's boyfriend. In these text messages, Jones admitted that she was ""not an innocent bystander."" She also complained about how long it was taking this second male student to do anything sexual with her. She did not file a complaint against Doe until two years later.

It's certainly possible that Jones was forced by Doe to give him oral sex without her consent, left the encounter with a fervent desire for another hookup, mischaracterized her own level of responsibility in a message to the RA, and didn't realize she had been sexually assaulted for another two years (after befriending a number of victims' advocates). It just doesn't seem like the most probable explanation for what happened. But, based on a preponderance of the evidence presented to Amherst administrators, Doe was expelled.

Keep in mind that administrators never reviewed the text messages, and when Doe asked the administration to re-open the case in light of this error, Amherst refused. Doe was given just seven days to appeal the finding of responsibility, but he didn't find out about the texts until months later.

Doe has filed suit against Amherst for mistreating him. He has not sued Jones, although maybe he should have. As part of his case against Amherst, Doe's legal team subpoenaed Jones to testify at the trial and turn over certain documents and records of statements she made about the alleged assault. Jones refused to cooperate.",TheRedPill,1181

At the time, her husband was the sole earner while my sister didn't work for religious reasons even though she has like 2 masters degree. I had pretty good credit while they had very bad credit. At the time, I was saving money along with my then girlfriend to buy a home. I initially turned down the request from my sister but my family pressed me and I stupidly relented and signed the contract which cost me my relationship with my then girlfriend. At the same time, I also signed a contract to rent a home in Texas for them (i lived in DC at the time and now Seattle) because of their bad credit. They kept up with the payments on the car and home until about 19 months ago. Due to financial issues, they started slipping up in their payments eventually leading up to them being evicted (and I only found out about the eviction after the fact due to an alert on my credit report). The landlord sued them (me) and got a default judgment against me for about $5000. In addition, the financial institution I got the car loan for contacted me today trying to repossess the car. My sister and her husband failed to inform me that they were 96 days past due to the tune of $4,000. I had to pay $4000 to have the repossession activity halted. 

Here's my bind. My sister and her husband can't make payments so I have to now. The car loan is valued at $29000 with a monthly car note of $1054. I make above $4500/ month with my biggest expense being rent of about $1500. I lead a pretty streamlined life so this new expense feels overwhelming. Question, how can I get this debt under control? How long will it take to fix my credit? I used to be in the low 700s and now my credit is hovering at 615 and the credit bureaus have not yet reflected the late payment of the car note. Can I rent with the civil judgement showing up on my credit report? Please help me.

USCFO,2017-01-25 03:10:13+00:00,I believe I have enough proof to confirm Lane Kiffin and Daniel Tosh are the twin sons of Bill Nye the Science Guy,"Now hear me out. Don't you think it's just a little weird Daniel Tosh and Lane Kiffin look so much alike? Act so much alike? That's when it hit me. They are twin brothers who were separated at birth by a 20 year old Bill Nye who panicked about being a father.

On a rainy day in St. Petersburg, Florida shortly after being hired by NASA, NASA was forced to scrub a launch because of the weather giving Bill Nye the opportunity to explore his new city. After a night out on the town Bill meets a beautiful woman in which he engages a sexual act with. A few months later he gets a call from that same woman. She is pregnant...with twins. Bill panics knowing there is no way he can be a father with his hectic job and youth. The woman does not go through with an abortion and Bill is mad. Bill decides he has no choice but to steal one son and send him on the West Coast and keep the other close by just so he has the satisfaction of watching him grow up. Bill flies with baby Lane to Seattle where he has some family but an engine failure stops the plane short and is forced to land in Nebraska on May 9th, 1975. Lane Kiffins birthday.

While this is all happening, Bill Nye has already killed the mother of the twins before leaving for the West Coast and has hidden baby Daniel with a Cuban gang who hides him for Bill until he returns to Florida. After a short stay in Nebraska finding Lane a new home and waiting out the search of his now deceased lover, Bill returns to Florida where he gives Daniel to a family in Titusville, FL on May 29th, 1975 which happens to be Daniel Tosh's birthday.

Lane and Daniel have no idea of one anothers existence but they have their fathers charismatic personality which leads them on different career paths. Lane becomes a star football player and that leads into a coaching career but Lane feels something is missing. After spending time at USC in Los Angeles, he spent time in Florida stealing away recruits. He realized he was often better recruiting Florida than he was California. Why was this? He also had a feeling that he never really wanted to leave..It was almost as if he had Tampa 2 in his veins.  Meanwhile, brother Daniel who also has his fathers personality becomes an outgoing comedian who is born for the limelight. Growing up in Florida Daniel knew where he belonged and was not held back by being out of place. He was comfortable in his own skin. 

When the opportunity came, Lane moved back to Florida the first chance he got. While Daniel swapped places with Lane and now lives in Los Angeles.

What happens to Bill Nye in all of this? He gets disrespected on the Larry Wilmore Show all while his two kids who don't know of their brotherhood make fun on one another on TV and Social Media.

Mjothnitvir,2017-01-25 00:25:55+00:00,The difference between the 4-3 and the 3-4 fronts,"With Wade Phillips moving to the Rams and Gregg Williams moving to the Browns I've seen a lot of comments on how your players are going to fit by switching between the 4-3 and the 3-4. So I've decided to compile the different 7 man fronts NFL teams run to hopefully help everyone understand how there new look will be different and how it will most likely look very much the same.

**The 4-3**

The [""Miami front""](http://imgur.com/a/PxVK4). The Miami front got it's name from the success of the University of Miami under the coaching of [this man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Johnson_(American_football_coach\)#University_of_Miami) and the defense is focused primarily on speed. The location of the nose tackle and the 3 technique protect the Mike so that he can make plays without worrying about being blocked by the lineman. The 2000 Ravens are a prime example of how good this defense can get.   
Teams who run this and it's sister, the [wide 9](http://imgur.com/a/rHRKN) are the Dolphins, Eagles, Giants, and now the Browns under Williams.

The [Over](http://imgur.com/a/sBYNV) front is very similar to the Miami front except it swaps alignment and responsibility of the strongside end and linebacker. This front offers even more protection to the Mike linebacker and makes it easier on the strongside 3 technique because it is very difficult to double team him due to the nose and defensive end. The over front is not a popular base defense because the Sam linebacker can't help much on weakside plays. An example of a team who uses this front would be the [Jets](http://imgur.com/a/yaBTs)

The [Under](http://imgur.com/a/R1nBP) [front](http://imgur.com/a/zvZvr) is the most popular 4-3 front in the NFL because it makes it very difficult to double team the weakside 3 technique and the weakside defensive end leading to very effective pass rushing through only the front 4. This front has stood the test of time because it was the base defense of 3 of the greatest defenses of all time. The Steel Curtain, the 02 Buccs, and the 2013 Seahawks all used this as there base defense and swarmed opponents with it. Current teams to run this as there base are the Jaguars, Vikings, Seahawks, Falcons, Buccs, Panthers, Raiders, and nearly every other 4-3 team out there.

**The 3-4**

The 3-4 doesn't have as many base fronts as the 4-3 primarily because 3-4 teams are more willing to base in the nickel defense if required and remove the nose tackle. 

The alignment I think most people think of when they hear 3-4 is [this](http://imgur.com/a/sS9qZ) one, and while it is still used today, example [Patriots](http://imgur.com/a/ERU9a), it isn't used as a base that often. The reason is there aren't many 2 gap players anymore and the straight up 3-4 requires 3 of them. It has some great advantages when blitzing because there is no predetermined person who should rush and if you have the players for it the defense can be devastating but it is a dinosaur in terms of every down defense.

The 3-4 that is most used is the [Under front](http://imgur.com/a/tbBEG). It is nearly identical to the 4-3 version and in fact the only difference is the spacing of the Leo vs weakside defensive end. Seattle is known for running a 4-3 but using 3-4 personal and the reason is the now standard 3-4 is the same as the 4-3 under. 

**Similarities**

The Under and Over fronts from both personal groups surround the 3 technique player and give him the opportunity to win his 1-1 matchup and force other 1-1 matchups with 1 defensive end. It gives either the Mike or Will freedom to roam and make plays using there speed

**Differences**

The Miami and base 3-4 cannot be more different. They use different personal at basically every position other than the nose tackle. 


**TLDR:** The defenses are very similar in the modern NFL and if you have the personal to run a 4-3 you are most likely 1 player away from the switch to the 3-4 and visa versa ",nfl,1523

Do you know what this means?

Donald J. Trump is the first President to come directly from the people *ever*. He hasn't played the fucking games and kissed ass to become the president. He **KICKED ASS** to become president. The people have become the rulers of this great nation!

He hasn't had his face buried in a political science textbook since he was a freshman in college. He hasn't written a thousand papers and kissed the ass of liberal progressive professors to gain his credibility.

He hasn't been through the Franklin School of Marxism to learn how to bullshit people into feeling guilt for being good at something.

He's Howard **motherfucking** Roark- he sees and he builds and he makes deals. He has produced buildings and as proof of his success he has made **BILLIONS**. Because he loved doing it- he loved being a developer.

I've watched and listened to Donald J. Trump for almost 40 years- he has had the same vision for our nation the entire time- he has always known its problems and he has always known how to fix them. He knows America- we build shit, we go to the moon, we conquered a continent, we met and fucking defeated the NAZI's in Europe, we proved the Soviets wrong, we changed the world and we loved it. We love to see the world play catch up- not only because it makes our lives better- but it makes everyone's lives better- everyone on the planet. When America is truly first we change the fucking world- we aren't the ship- **America is the tide**- we shall lift all by being great **for ourselves**- for the American people. Americanism is our credo!

**WE MUST SET THE EXAMPLE FOR THE WORLD AND DONALD J. TRUMP IS THE MAN FOR THE JOB.**

Now we have to remind some folks who ain't from Trump country who we are. 

You gotta remember where you come from- they can't starve us out and they can't make us run- so here is some Bocephus!

Irishpersonage,2017-01-21 00:49:19+00:00,I Should Not Have Posted That CIA Document,"I made a terrible mistake.

Some of you might remember the [disclosed CIA document]( https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5p0oi1/i_found_something_in_the_cias_declassified/) that I posted here yesterday. Please, *don’t read it*.

I don’t know what’s going on, but I think something’s trying to kill me.

 It started a couple hours after I posted it. I work in downtown Seattle, and was just leaving the office (because what better place to mess about on Reddit), to catch a bus. At the intersection outside of my building, the lights turned and I headed across. Nothing unusual. But when I was about half way into the intersection, something happened. 

All the lights turned green. 

If I hadn’t been paying attention, I would have been geography. I managed to dodge a barreling semi-truck, and I just made it across when the collisions started. I counted seven as I watched from the curb. I told myself it was a freak accident. It had to be.

I kept walking as the sirens lit up. After a few uneventful blocks I reached the bus stop, boarded, and plugged in my headphones, still a bit shaken. 

The bus ride went as usual, winding its way through the financial district and out onto the freeway. I pulled up my phone and checked for any news of the faulty traffic lights, but it must have been too recent, there was nothing. 

A few minutes went by and I settled into the music, watching the world fly past. A few minutes later, however, I was interrupted by a jolt. People were rustling, all staring at the driver, and I looked over to see her fighting the steering wheel, rattling off a stream of jargon into her radio. The bus lurched, groaned, and picked up speed. 

People were murmuring, and I could see out the windshield as the bus blew past commuters, easily breaching seventy, then eighty miles per hour. The bus driver was cursing as the radio blared a steady stream of crackling, worried voices. I held my breath.

Then there was a bang, smoke started pouring into the cabin, and the motor cut out. People were screaming as we coasted to a halt along the shoulder. A shrill claxon filled the cabin. The bus driver, after several heavy breathes, stood up to address the passengers. 

We were told that there had been a mechanical problem, the bus was filling with carbon monoxide, and we needed to disembark immediately. Another bus would be around shortly to continue the route. Several Citizen-Hero types jumped to action and herded us off the bus and onto the side of the road. Traffic was steady, the rain had picked up, and I had forgotten my umbrella. 

We stood on the side of the road for a few minutes, and I got thoroughly soaked. This really wasn’t my day. The replacement bus rolled up, we boarded, and the rest of the ride went by peacefully.

After reaching my stop, I decided to walk over to the nearby grocery store and grab some dinner before heading home.  So i ducked out of the rain, loaded up a hand basket, swiped everything through the self-checkout, and went to pay. 

My card was declined.

I don’t want to sound pompous, but I’ve got a decent job, and knew I had money in the account. Maybe it was a glitch. So I tried a credit card. Declined. Another credit card. Declined.  A message flashed across the screen.

**ATTENTION: FRAUD SUSPECTED. REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE. POLICE HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED.**

Well shit.

And so I did what any sensible person would do in the situation. I left.

As I was walking out of the store, empty handed, heart pounding, I saw the stares of the employees. They each carried a radio, and in unison they each put a finger to their ear. I quickened my pace. When I was out the front doors, I heard someone shout from behind me. There were sirens in the distance. I pulled up my hood, hunched my shoulders, and darted out into the rain, trying my best to blend into the darkness.

Several minutes later I was back in the shelter of my apartment. I locked the door, shut the blinds, and collapsed into my desk chair. I was about to pull out the bottle of scotch I keep tucked away for special occasions, figuring that my night so far definitely counted as some sort of “special”, when my phone buzzed. A text message. My heart skipped a beat.

This is the message that I received (with some personal information removed, of course). 

*Robert Morgan. Social Security Number (nope). Mother’s maiden name: Carlisle. Personal computer password: (also nope). Warning: remove all mentions of Project Bloodhound and the Network Entity from the internet immediately. You have been warned.*

I figured that one of you must have read the story, somehow gotten hold of my phone number, and was playing a prank. Not funny.

I plugged the phone in to charge, uncorked the scotch, and poured a healthy dram. 

After losing myself in the whisky and catching my breath, I powered up my PC. The boot menu flashed, but instead of fading into the log-in screen, my monitor went dead. Well, not dead, exactly. The screen went black, except for a small line of text at the top left. I leaned closer, squinting.

It was the same message from the text.

I pulled the plug from the wall as my heart nearly beat out of my chest.

Another glass of scotch, several minutes of deep breaths, and I started to calm down. It was just a prank, a very elaborate prank. But what about the intersection? And the bus? And my money?

I was shaken from my thoughts by an ear-rattling blast of music. 

I have one of those Amazon Alexa things, a small black obelisk crouched innocently in the far corner. They can be buggy, yes, but it’s never started on its own. Now it was blaring some sort of death metal at full volume. 

Covering my ears against the aural assault, I tried to shout her quiet. When that didn’t work, I stumbled across the room and mashed the power button with my elbow. Nothing. 

Trying to cover one ear with my shoulder, I reached around back and pulled out its power cord, and thankfully the music stopped. 

The silence left in its wake was deafening, or perhaps my ear drums blew out. You have to give it to Amazon, they build a loud speaker.

I was starting to think I was going crazy. I had to be. 

My phone rang.

I nearly jumped out of my skin. The ringtone played, muted through my still-aching ears, and I approached it tentatively.

Incoming call. No number.

Nope. Just… nope.

I canceled the call with a swipe, refilled my scotch, and took a deep breath. My phone sat there, silent, mocking me. I took the moment to run through all that had happened, desperately searching for an answer. 

The phone rang again.

I was about to yank out the battery and toss it across the room when I saw the caller ID. It was my mother. I picked up with shaking fingers, answered the call, and held it up to me ear. But there was only static, building from a low hiss to a thunderous torrent. 

“Mom?”

*“No. My name is not important. You were warned. Goodbye, Mr. Morgan.”* 

The voice sounded thin and sharp, and somehow too... melodic. 

""Wait..."" I shouted. It hadn't even been thirty minutes. But the voice was gone.

As the static grew, my fingers started to feel warm. Then hot.

I pulled the phone away from my face, thankfully just in time. A thin stream of acrid yellow smoke snaked out of the headphone jack. The phone was burning up. I threw it across the room, and it caught fire before it hit the wall, exploding in a shower of molten slag. 

The final lines of the disclosed email echoed in my head, and I lost it.

As the sprinklers opened, spraying their murky brown water across my worldly possessions, I dashed out of the apartment, down the stairs, and onto the street. Smoke was billowing from my open window.

I ran through my quickly-diminishing options; no phone, no credit card, no apartment. Something was after me, I was certain. I had to warn people.

I needed internet access, *public* internet access. If I was going to die, there would be someone around to witness it. But where? 

The library! I still had my old library card, and they had a bank of archaic computers nestled somewhere among the shelves. So I hopped in my car and drove off into the night.

It had been years since I had visited the library, and for the life of me I couldn’t remember where it was. So I pulled up the in-dash GPS and punched in the name. The navigation found the destination and laid out a route.

As I drove, I thought through the events of the past several hours. Something was out there. Something terrible. And it was trying to kill me.

The GPS chimed, telling me to take a left at the light. Lost in thought, I started to turn the wheel. Directly onto a one-way street, into a line of waiting cars.

“Hey,” I shouted, smacking the dash, “stop that.”

The speakers crackled to life, and a familiar voice filled the cabin. *”You were warned, Mr. Morgan.""*

The deafening music started again, and it was all I could do to shelter my ears while keeping one hand on the wheel. Thankfully, I pulled into the parking lot shortly after.

It was late, and the lot was nearly empty, but the library was open, and I could see light filtering out of the high windows. 

I must have looked like a wreck as I stumbled into the lobby, judging by the ancient librarian’s disgusted glance. “Where are the computers?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. I was pointed to the back by a skeletal finger.

I found the old machines sitting in a line against a far wall, hidden behind a shelf of large, dusty encyclopedias. They were venerable, their fading white cases covered in doodles and stains from a decade of hard use. I pulled out my library card, slid it into the card reader, and powered on the machine.

I spent the next hour or so writing this down. I had to tell somebody, anybody. 

If you’re reading this, it’s too late for me. I wrote a quick program, a dead-man’s switch, that should post this if I don’t stop the timer. Wish me [luck]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Irishpersonage/comments/4i1vq9/welcome/).",nosleep,1010

jaimage,2017-01-19 16:34:51+00:00,Reddit helped my brother get a special visit to Nintendo to play Zelda. Here's the end of the story.,"A few months ago in October, I made [a post on /r/Nintendo some might remember](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/58bidw/trying_to_get_in_touch_with_nintendo_for_my/) about my younger brother and his wishes to play Zelda: Breath of the Wild. He was 26 at the time, and due to the life long effects of a congenital heart defect (CHD) his body was beginning to completely shut down. He was worried that he would not make it to the game’s release date, and so I turned to Reddit to see if I could make something happen for him. When I originally made the post, I tried to keep low expectations in regards to what could be done. I could not have imagined the incredible response it got, and the joy my brother felt as I read him the wonderful replies from people. It blew my mind when I was actually contacted by Nintendo, and we were quickly able to set up a visit for a couple weeks later.

Unfortunately, I had to fly back to NYC and was unable to stay longer and be with him for the experience, but he and my mom filled me in on all the details. Since they had a photographer, I wanted to wait to make this post until we [received their photos so that I could share them](http://imgur.com/a/fD8NO). He got a tour of the facilities (he was really into the conference rooms, lol), lunch with staff, a bunch of goodies (including a Zelda backpack, signed poster, 3D shadow box), and he got to sit down and play an early build of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I just keep pulling up this photo of him playing the game and looking at his face, knowing the difficult life that he had and the magic that video games were to him, the deep joy he got from exploring other worlds. It was an unforgettable day for him, and the Nintendo staff was incredibly kind and supportive. I have to throw out huge thanks to Kate, Ken, Hana, Gil, and many others at Nintendo for doing this for Gabe.

Sadly, on January 14th, a few weeks after his 27th birthday, Gabe suddenly but peacefully passed away. I am still at that point where I feel like I am in some sort of bizarro alternate dream universe where my brother is just missing, but I’ll wake up any moment and he’ll be calling me to tell me about some new video game. It still astonishes me that he fought so hard to stay on this planet for as long as he did, because it was a true battle for him everyday. Many born with CHDs don’t make it out of their teens. Getting to share his story and maybe bring some awareness to his condition as well is all I can hope for at this point.

Everything happened so fast with the first post, I honestly don’t even know who to specifically thank on this sub for making this happen. I’ll just thank every person who gave an upvote, left a kind reply, or just read our story. It’s been a a difficult and emotional year, but there was a lot of joy in there as well. Gabe was not given nearly as much time on this planet as he deserved, but I am going to think about him every single day for the rest of my life, and I know there are so many other people who will do the same. This entire experience was unforgettable, my mom and I will cherish these memories forever.

Edit: Someone suggested that since this post is getting a lot of visibility, I promote the [Children's Heart Research Guild](https://www.childrensheartresearchguild.org/). My mother actually helped to start this non-profit in 2008 to bring awareness about CHDs and raise funds for research through Children's Hospital in Seattle, Washington. Gabe spent a lot of time in Children's Hospital as a child, I remember wandering the halls as a young boy while he underwent various procedures. Thank you to everyone for the kind replies and encouragement, this is obviously a difficult time for my family but the support we've gotten from this community as well as Nintendo has been nothing short of magical. Gabe may be gone from this earth, but he will never be forgotten.",nintendo,8840

NerdyOrDirty,2017-01-11 09:50:12+00:00,Examining the effects the moon has on the Crimson Tide,"The effects the moon has on the oceanic tide are well known and heavily documented, but for some reason there is almost no analysis of the effects the moon has on the Alabama Crimson Tide. I don't know why this is exactly, but I think it might be because our top minds are too focused on less important things, or maybe there's like a government cover up or something. Whatever the reason may be for this information not being out there before, it's out here now and your life is better for it.

For this inquiry, I looked at the games Alabama has played during the Saban years (2007-present), noted the time they were played, and looked at the phase of the moon if the game was played at night. I've included a picture of each moon phase in case you're a complete idiot and don't know what a waxing gibbous is.

**Day Games**

Nothing surprising here, Alabama's good and wins a lot of games by a lot of points, which you can see by that ridiculous average point differential (APD).

Gonna be honest, none of these games are interesting and there weren't enough of them to make any interesting statements except for the fact that they avoided playing under a new moon from 2009-2015.

Bama isn't just undefeated under the waning crescent, they are dominant. The smallest margin of victory was 11 points over Georgia in 2008. The largest was 45 points over San Jose State.

The 2010 National Championship against Texas was played under this type of moon, which Bama pretty easily won, just like the rest of their games under a third quarter moon.

Full moons cause werewolves to become their beastly form, and waning gibbous moons cause Saban to go [Super Saban](http://i.imgur.com/RlxNhhP.jpg) and just eviscerate any team in his way, including Notre Dame in the 2013 National Championship.

Finally! A moon phase Alabama can lose in! The losses here are the 2017 CFP National Championship Game and the 2007 Iron Bowl. Alabama is great under full moons when the games aren't important, though.

Alabama under Saban with a losing record in anything, regardless of the arbitrary frame you use, seems really hard to believe. But it's true, Alabama has lost more games than they've won under a waxing gibbous moon. Why Saban is so different under waxing and waning gibbous moons, I don't know, so once again I'll blame government cover ups. The losses are the 2015 Sugar Bowl, the 2011 Game of the Century, and an 26-23 OT loss to Georgia in 2007. Their victories were a 34-0 romp of Vandy and a 63-7 dismantling of the still-FCS-at-the-time Georgia State Panthers in their inaugural season.

Losses here are to Ole Miss in 2015 and the Florida Tebows in the 2008 SECCG, and there aren't really any notable victories.

Their losses here are from the 2009 and 2014 Sugar Bowls. They won the 2016 CFP NCG against Clemson under a waxing crescent.

With ocean tides, the fuller the moon is, the stronger the effect it has on tides. That doesn't seem to carry over to the Crimson Tide however, probably because they are humans and not water and this was a major waste of time for me to make and a minor waste of time for you to read. But, if you think about it, is it really a waste of time if you enjoyed it? Yes, yes it is. This information is useless. But wait! Here's even more useless information for you!

**Even More Useless Information For You**

* The most common opponent-moon phase combination is Mississippi State under a full moon, a match up played 4 times. Alabama won all four of these contests, holding MSU a single TD in each game.

* Under Saban, Bama has played Mississippi State and LSU under the lights 6 times each, tied for the most of any opponent.

* Alabama has not played Missouri at night while they've been in the SEC, but they did play at night in 1975, which Mizzou won 20-7.

* I like college football

* Kickoff times haven't been announced for the 2017 schedule, but Fresno State is slated to face Alabama on a Waning Gibbous night, so they're fucked, and Ole Miss is scheduled to play them on a Waxing Gibbous night, so we could be looking at another Ole Miss victory over Bama.

* *The Twilight Saga: New Moon*, which was given a B grading from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, features actor Cam Gigandet in the role of James. Cam graduated from Auburn High School in Auburn, Washington. Both Auburn and Washington are the names of universities that played in college football games against the Alabama Crimson tide in the 2016 season.

* If you want to learn about moon phases, check [this site out.](http://www.moonconnection.com/moon_phases.phtml) If you want to know what phase the moon was or will be on a certain date, [go here.](https://stardate.org/nightsky/moon)

EDIT: It has come to my attention that Alabama has a player named Trey Moon on their roster, but [according to Fox Sports](http://www.foxsports.com/college-football/trey-moon-player-stats) he has recorded no stats, so it appears that Moon's impact on the Tide is negligible as well.",CFB,3658

1.  Seattles offensive dysfunction is no one player's fault.

2.  The smashmouth, run-it-down-their-throat identity of Seattle is gone...perhaps permanently.

3.  Cmike is not fit for a starting job...anywhere...

4.  Prosise has a strong argument to be Seattle's most valuable runningback next year.

So ok, before Rawls hurts himself again and cmike get's cut again, let's have one more bickering fight about who's fault it is Seattle's run game was a joke this year.  Or maybe we can all just agree,the offensive line pretty much blows.",fantasyfootball,1932

I went up the coastal route and am now returning the ""express"" route via I-5.  I crossed into California around 6 this evening and stopped at a gas station just past the state border to top off the tank of my little car.

So, there I am, standing at the pump, nozzle in car, watching the numbers get closer and closer to $20 (I drive a tiny 20 year old manual Toyota Tercel, so a full tank is just under $20) when this minivan with Oregon plates pulls up to the pump next to me.  I ignore the other car, my mind on finishing fueling so I could get out of the %$#@ cold. (What can I say?  I've lived in SoCal for waaaay too long!) 

""Excuse me!""

I turn to see the minivan's driver's side window rolled down and an elderly woman glowering at me from the driver's seat.

Woman: ""Are you going to pump my gas or what?""

Me: ""Um..excuse me?""

Woman, waving credit card at me: ""Hello!  I need gas!""

Me: ""Okay?  And?""

Woman: ""You're supposed to pump my gas!  HELLO!!!  It's state law!""

Background info #1: for those that have never visited the great state of Oregon, they have a law on the books forbidding people from pumping their own gas.  An attendant is always on hand to run your CC/take your cash and pump the gas for you.

Background info #2:  I'm a middle-aged woman  dressed in black pants and a black hoodie with the WoW horde insignia on the front.  (Yes yes...""FOR THE HORDE!!!"")  If any gas station allowed their people to dress like that...well, you know how that goes.

Me: ""Ma'am?  Do you know where you are?""

Woman: ""--town just over the OR state border--, of course!!!""

Me: ""No, ma'am.  You're in --town just over the CA state border--.""

Woman glances around: ""How the hell did I get in California?""

I wondered that too, considering that she had to cross a major mountain pass AND go through a agricultural check point when she crossed the state line.  

My pump clicked off, so I busied myself with returning the nozzle and getting my receipt.  Then I headed into the station to ""use the facilities"".  When I returned to my car, she was standing at the pump, card in hand, staring at the gas pump.  

She flagged me down as I walked to my car, ""I'm sorry.  I...I've never had to do this before.  My husband always gets the gas when we go to CA.  Can you help me?""  

Me:  ""Sure.""  

So, yes, I may not have worked there....but I did do my good deed for the day.  ;-)",IDontWorkHereLady,1824

marisam7,2016-12-21 08:59:50+00:00,Islamophobic Myths Debunked,"#Myths about the proportion of Islamic Terrorist Attacks on U.S Soil

So I was on Facebook recently and saw a post claiming that, ""Islam has carried out more than 100,000 terrorist attacks against Americans since 9/11"" with no citations what so ever.

Looking at the Facebook group that posted this, I assumed from the fact their profile picture is a stock image of an interracial couple inside of a snipers crosshairs with the caption ***""Race mixing and Liberalism is a mental illness but we have the cure""*** that most people would be able to see this group isn't the most trustworthy source but despite that, the post had hundreds of upvotes and comments. Not from Neo-Nazis and White Supremacists but from average people.

I saw dozens of comments from people like Susan (*A retired school teacher and grandmother from Indiana*) who responded by talking about how the liberal media refuses to even acknowledge Muslims are a problem despite them killing thousands of Americans every day and how when Obama finally dies the Lord Jesus will send him to hell for him helping cover up the evil deeds of Muslims. 

Or people like Gary (*A small business owner and NRA member from South Carolina*) Who responded to the graph by making a long incoherent rant where he talked about how when he was a kid during Vietnam the liberals tried so hard to go after our soldiers calling them rapists and baby killers and just because they didn't like the methods didn't mean someone had to them and because they did what they did we won the war and the Vietnamese realized they could never take over America so they didn't try and bring the fight to the US. 

His post then goes on to argue that we need to put someone with balls in the White House who will let soldiers do what they did in Vietnam and when that happens the terrorism will stop. 

Now its very frighting that people like Gary who not only for some reason believe that the U.S won the Vietnam War (which they didn't) and who thinks that the Vietnamese wanted to take over the United States  (which they didn't) but also ontop of that thinks the reason the US won the war is because U.S soldiers raped women and murdered children and that if the U.S started committing war crimes again the terrorism would stop.

Ignoring the fact of how scary it is that a person like Gary is allowed to own firearms. And the fact that [U.S soldiers have raped and murdered children while deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmudiyah_rape_and_killings) The main thing I learned from this post is how people just making up numbers can incite hatred and violence.

I looked more into Facebook and found other lists that actually do go through all the Islamic terrorist attacks. Yet these lists will cite things like: 

&gt; **Nation of Islam member robbing a convenient store in 1975** 

as a terrorist attack. Or 

&gt; **Turkish man who was in prison for bank robbery in New York stabbing a prison guard in 1981** 

as an ""Islamic terrorist attack on law enforcement."" 

Going through these lists more, many of the examples they give just didn't happen. They will give a name or a description of an event or a location or a date and when I google the info I don't find any results for it being real or in many cases it did happen but the perpetrator wasn't even a Muslim.

Some of these lists all of which are poorly put together and without any real citations circulating on Facebook and other known Islamophobic websites have even been republished by actual news sources such as [WorldNetDaily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldNetDaily) to the response in the comment sections of paranoid delusional rants by people who use obscure biblical passages and sources of Islamic text to falsely claim Muslims truly worship Satan and Islam translate directly into ""the religion of the devil""

**So I decided to go through the list starting with the World Trade Center bombings in 1993 and create a coherent list of all the successful Islamic terrorist attacks which resulted in at least 1 death that occurred on US soil.** 

I found soon after that it didn't take long to make this list. Due to the fact that since 9/11 there have only been 9 successful Islamic terrorist attacks. 


1. 2016 Orlando Night Club Shooting	
1. 2015 San Bernardino Shooting	
1. 2015 Chattanooga, TN Military Shooting	 
1. 2014 Oklahoma Beheading

1. 2006 Seattle Jewish Federation Shooting

**Before 9/11**

1. 1993 World Trade Center bombing 

So in 15 years out of the 3.3 million Muslims in the United States only 11 of them have committed a terrorist attack. That means only 1 out of every 300,000 Muslims is a terrorist in the United States. 

**Looking more into this I decided to do the same research but on terrorist attacks committed by Right Wing Extremists in the same time frame to see how many terrorist attacks they committed which resulted in one or more casualties.** 

**I found they committed 45 successful terrorist attacks**

At this point I thought even though [you are 7 times more likely to be killed by a right wing extremist then a Muslim terrorist in the United States](http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/11/30/3725562/you-are-more-than-7-times-as-likely-to-be-killed-by-a-right-wing-extemist-than-by-muslim-terrorists/) and even though [Non-Muslims Carried Out More than 90% of All Terrorist Attacks in America.](http://www.globalresearch.ca/non-muslims-carried-out-more-than-90-of-all-terrorist-attacks-in-america/5333619)
This is just one country. 

So I decided to look at another country with a significantly higher per capita Muslim Population. Canada, which has well over a million Muslims who make up 3% of its population, and instead of doing a small 20 year timeline I decided to look into the entire history of the country to get the most accurate results.


#Number of Terrorist Attacks in Canada by motive.

**Freedomites**

* Number of terror attacks: 300+

* Number of injuries: 6

* Number of deaths: 3

**Quebec Nationalists**

* Number of terror attacks: 64

* Number of injuries: 29

* Number of deaths: 12

**Fenians:**

* Number of terror attacks: 10+

* Number of injuries: 37

* Number of deaths: 32

**Communist:** 

* Number of terror attacks: 10

* Number of injuries: 100+

* Number of deaths: 0

**Sikh:**

* Number of terror attacks: 7

* Number of injuries: 6

* Number of deaths: 324

**Christian:** 

* Number of terror attacks: 7

* Number of injuries: 3

* Number of deaths: 1

**Environmental:** 

* Number of terror attacks: 6

* Number of injuries: 0

* Number of deaths: 0


**Armenian Nationalists:**

* Number of terror attacks: 3

* Number of injuries: 1

* Number of deaths: 2

**Anarchist:** 

* Number of terror attacks: 3

* Number of injuries: 10

* Number of deaths: 0

**Feminist:** 

* Number of terror attacks: 3

* Number of injuries: 0

* Number of deaths: 0

**Islamic:**

* **Number of terror attacks: 2**

* **Number of injuries: 2**

* **Number of deaths: 2**

**Financial:**

* Number of deaths: 52 

**Pro-America:**

* Number of terror attacks: 1

* Number of terror attacks: 1

* Number of injuries: 4

* Number of deaths: 0

**Jewish:**

* Number of injuries: 1

* Number of deaths: 0

**So to put this into comparison there are half the number of followers of Sikhism in Canada than Islam.**

**Yet Sikhs have killed 162 times more people in the name of their religion than Islam has in Canada alone.**

Despite this, no one is calling for Sikhs to be deported like they calling for [the 37,402 Syrian Refugees in Canada to be.](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/refugees/welcome/) 



Now to the people out there saying, 

&gt; ***You only look at terrorism, what about all the other crimes muslims commit!***

#Well lets look at a few places around the world:

**The first place I'm going to look at is the city with the highest Muslim population in the United States,  Dearborn Michigan.** 

Dearborn has a population of around 100,000 people half of which are of Arab Decent.

[*Last year Dearborn had 3 murders and 35 rapes.*](http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/mi/dearborn/crime/)

**Lets look at other cities in the United States with the same population but instead of being populated by Muslims lets look at cities populated by White Christians.** 

Billings, Montana is a city with a population of around 100,000 people same as Dearborn. 90% of these people are white. 

And the city has such a small Muslim population that there isn't even a mosque in it. 


[*Last year Billings had 10 murders and 72 rapes*](http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/mt/billings/crime/)

Just in case that one example was an outlier I looked up a few cities with the same population as Dearborn to compare the crime rate:

City | Number of Murders 2015| Number of Rapes 2015
---|---|----
Dearborn MI | 3| 35
Sandy Springs GA| 6 | 40 
Pueblo CO | 10 | 152
Billings MT | 10| 72
West Palm Beach FL |15 | 45

I could keep going but I think you get the point. 

Dearborn Michigan despite having more Muslims living there than anywhere else in the US is below the average national crime rate.

[Dearborn  is 16% safer than the average city.](http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/mt/billings/crime/)

And statistically speaking 64% of the people reading this right now are more at risk where they are live currently than if they moved to Dearborn and surround themselves with Muslims.

Chances of being a victim of crime:

&gt; In Dearborn
1 in 275

&gt; In Michigan
1 in 234

But forget about the U.S lets look at cities outside of America. Last time we looked at Canada lets look at the U.K this time.

###**Birmingham has one of the largest Muslim populations in England.**

[One out of every 5 people in the city of Birmingham is a Muslim.](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html) 

It is one of the highest Muslim Populations in the country.

[Let's look at the crime rate there:](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/crime-statistics-for-birmingham-3217262)


City | Crime Rate Per 100 Residents
---|---
Birmingham | 5.15
UK Average | 6.57
London | 42.53

###But maybe that isn't good enough for you lets look at the rest of Europe:

**Amsterdam has been cited as having one of the largest Muslim populations in Europe. Pretty soon 20% of the city will be Muslims.** 

You would think this influx of immigrants would cause the crime rate to sky rocket right? 

I myself assumed it would when I was researching this and honestly was shocked to see news articles titled: 

&gt; [AMSTERDAM’S 2015 HOMICIDE FIGURES HIT RECORD LOW](http://www.nltimes.nl/2015/12/30/amsterdams-2015-homicide-figures-could-hit-record-low-point/) 

But the fact of the matter is its true that they did. 

* In 2015 there was 15 murders in Amsterdam 

* In 2013 there was 22 murders in Amsterdam

* In 1998 there was 65 murders Amsterdam

The higher the Muslim population has been getting in Amstredam the lower the murder rate gets.

&gt; ***But how can that be?!?! Multiculturalism is a failure just look at the rape rate in Sweden! What about all those Muslims raping children? I read about on Breitbart and Infowars!***


Many news headlines about Muslim refugees raping and killing people are fake. Infowars and Breitbart, in particular, have reported outright lies, such as the time they (along with many other right wing news outlets) reported the story about Syrian Muslim refugees gang raping a little girl in Idaho.""

[Local officials and police even had to have a press conference afterwards to explain not only did the story never happen but there aren't even any refugees who live in the entire county.](http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/state/idaho/article84829787.html)

[And no, none of the right wing news sites ever apologized for spreading false info or even redacted the stories. They still have them up on their site without even acknowledging it was proven to be false.](http://www.infowars.com/report-three-syrian-refugees-rape-little-girl-at-knifepoint-in-idaho/)

Reasons like this are probably why so many media watchdog groups and committees into the ethics of journalism have time and time again ranked Breitbart as one of the most dishonest journalist outlets ever created. And when I say ever created, they get a lower ranking than North Korean State Run Propaganda Media.

But for the stories that are true where it turns out a Muslim did kill someone or molest a child, even though these cases are rare they still do happen. The only thing the media never talks about is how they **happen at a lower rate than the native born population.** 

If you were to randomly pick 100,000 American Citizens born in the US and then pick 100,000 Americans originally born in other countries, [you would discover that that the number of immigrants who had committed crimes is lower than the number of native born Americans who committed crimes.](http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mythical-connection-between-immigrants-and-crime-1436916798) 

The same is true for Europe as well. [The Crime rate in Germany for instance is lower than it was 10 years ago according to police documents](http://www.dw.com/en/germany-has-become-safer/a-19444826) [and that is in part due to the fact that refugees are less likely to commit crimes then native born Germans. And out of the crimes they do commit less then 1% of them are sex crimes.](http://www.thelocal.de/20151113/police-refugees-commit-less-crimes-than-germans) 

The only difference when a Muslim refugee molests a child and when a Catholic Priest does the same thing. Is that when the Muslim does it you don't see the Catholic Church covering it up. 

[And Muslim groups aren't spending millions of Dollars to lobby against sex crime laws like Catholics groups are.](http://www.ibtimes.com/new-york-catholic-church-spent-2m-lobbying-against-child-sex-abuse-accountability-2376078)

But in response to common claims that multiculturalism is a failure because Sweden has the second highest rape rate on earth and allows refugees in I just want to remind everyone that the rape rate didn't sky rocket in Sweden after they started allowing refugees into the country. [The rape rate skyrocketed in 2005 when Sweden reformed its sex crime legislation to make the definition of rape much much wider. Ontop of that the Swedish police trained to improve the handling of rape cases which led to more victims coming forward to report assaults. This is why the rape rate appears to be so much higher than it is. Even though Criminologists say that the number of rapes that occur in the country aren't above average and surveys from The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights discovered that instead of being the rape capital of the world Sweden is actually below neighboring countries of Denmark and Finland in terms of the number of rapes.](http://2static2.fjcdn.com/comments/Inb4+quot+look+at+their+rape+levels+you+cuck+quot+_473d0e13a7742baf9aa976bb534e1457.jpg)

&gt; ***But the Qur'an is violent!***

Here are a few quotes:

&gt; ***""If a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father.  Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her.""***

&gt; ***""If within the city a man comes upon a maiden who is betrothed, and has relations with her, you shall bring them both out of the gate of the city and there stone them to death: the girl because she did not cry out for help though she was in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbors wife.""***

&gt; ***""You may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you.  You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land.  You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance.""*** 

&gt; ***""When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are.  If she does not please the man who bought her, he may allow her to be bought back again.  But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her.  And if the slave girl’s owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his daughter.  If he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his wife.""***

&gt; ***""If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.""***

&gt; ***“A man or a woman who is a medium or a necromancer shall surely be put to death. They shall be stoned with stones; their blood shall be upon them.”***

&gt; ***""If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you love, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, “Let us go and worship other gods” do not yield to them or listen to them. Show them no pity. Do not spare them or shield them. You must certainly put them to death. Your hand must be the first in putting them to death, and then the hands of all the people. Stone them to death, because they tried to turn you away.""***


* Punishing Women for Being Raped
* Promoting Sexual Slavery
* Stoning Gays
* Stoning Witches
* Murdering Infidels

**These seem like quotes from a barbaric stone age death cult right?**


Well you would be correct because **these quotes are from the Bible.** ^(The same book the Republicans and Trump want to use to govern the country.)

&gt; ***But the difference between Christians and Muslims is Christians don't follow those quotes and would never do that! They don't have child brides or commit honor killing or any of those evil Muslim things!***

&gt; ***But women in Somalia aren't allowed to drive***

The idea of showing the treatment of women in Somalia or other parts of the Middle East as proof that Islam is evil makes as much sense as showing the treatment of women in the Congo as proof that Christianity is evil.

Lets look at a Muslim nation that isn't torn by war as see how they treat women:

Kyrgyzstan is a landlocked country located in Central Asia with a population of 5 million people. In this country close to 9 out of every 10 people are Muslims.

In 2010 after large opposition protests caused the President to resign the Muslim majority population voted and elected [Roza Otunbayeva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roza_Otunbayeva) as the country's new leader. [Roza Otunbayeva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roza_Otunbayeva) is not only a woman but an atheist. 

Why is it that in Kyrgyzstan and Somalia they both read the same holy book ^(The Qur'an) but in one country an Atheist woman would be stoned and in the other elected president. 

It's probably the same reason why in both Italy and the Congo they read the same holy book ^(The Bible) but in one an Atheist woman would be stoned and in the other elected president. 

&gt; ***But still why is the Middle East so war torn to begin with? Why can't you get your stuff together and stop oppressing women?***

I wish you could post pictures on reddit but you can't so I'll just link them with a description:

[Or if you actually did research into the famed Section 377 in the penal codes of countries like Malaysia, Singapore and India and Pakistan and Palestine that criminalized ""sodomy"" you can find that all of those laws were not only created by British Administrators during colonization since they had a much bigger problem with gays then any of the native Muslim or Hindu or Buddhist cultures ever did. But actually justified using the Bible and citing religious morality as the reason for the law.](http://www.lawyerscollective.org/vulnerable-communities/lgbt/section-377.html)  

&gt; ***So what changed? To make it the way it is today?***

* The same thing that changed Latin America to make it a violent cesspool of Drug Cartels.

* The same thing that changed Southeast Asia that allows the rise of anti-government rebels. 

**The United States government came into the region, destabilized it, overthrew their democratically elected leaders and replaced them with Islamic extremist dictators who would sell oil for a cheap price, and denounce the Soviets.**

The Middle East didn't even have Muslim countries before. Most were secular nations where people elected leaders. 

In Saudi Arabia the monarchy the country has is literally only 60 years old. They didn't have a King before that they had a President.

So you know the the CIA replaced him with? 

[The Taliban.](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/who-is-responsible-for-the-taliban)

Before these Coups there wasn't widespread terrorism. Look at Syria in 1948 and look at America. One of those countries had groups of religious extremists going around dragging people from their homes and lynching them solely because of their race. 

* Those religious extremists were the K.K.K and that country was America.

Look at Afghanistan in 1975 and look at Ireland. One of these countries had groups of paramilitary religious extremists kidnapping and murdering innocent people. Bombing hospitals and public places, killing dozens at a time. 

* Those religious extremists were the IRA and that country was Ireland.

There isn't even a counterpart to compare the groups to because none existed in these countries. No one was doing these things before the CIA got involved. 

&gt; ***But like you said the CIA did the same thing in Latin America and Africa and South East Asia. So why is it only Muslim countries who become terrorists? Why don't those countries have terrorism?***

* [In Myanmar Buddhist Terrorists have been targeting religious minorities and killing hundreds of them](http://world.time.com/2013/06/20/extremist-buddhist-monks-fight-oppression-with-violence/) Though they target all non-Buddists. They have been going after Muslims especially hard [massacring dozens in a single attack.](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/un-dozens-of-rohingya-muslims-massacred-by-buddhists-in-rakhine-burma/)

* In Israel there are unprovoked and well organized attacks by Jewish Terrorists. [Things like the Duma attacks which happened last year where a group of Jewish Terrorists decided to pick  a random Muslim home and firebombed it, killing an 18 month old child and two other people.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duma_arson_attack) Even outside of Israel in the United States groups like [The Jewish Defense League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Defense_League) are responsible for acts of terrorism. Whether it be the time they tried to assassinate a US congressman in 2001. Or the time [one of their members massacred 29 people.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_the_Patriarchs_massacre)  

* Hindu terrorism is so common that there is even a word for it. It's called Saffron terror. And not only are [there more Hindu extremists than Muslims.](http://scroll.in/article/718458/most-extremists-in-india-are-not-muslim-they-are-hindu) but [the Indian government considers Hindu Terrorists a much larger threat as well.](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Rahul-Gandhi-told-US-Hindu-extremists-are-a-bigger-threat-to-India/articleshow/7115703.cms)

* For Christian terrorists I could go on and on about this, pointing out examples of groups like The Lord's Resistance Army who are still active in Uganda and South Sudan and who are [still claiming child sex slaves in the name of Jesus.](https://www.rt.com/news/kony-children-sex-slavery-396/) But I'm going to try and put this into numbers. [ISIS has killed a total of 18,800 people \(almost all were other Muslims\) so far. According to the latest UN figures.](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isis-terror/isis-death-toll-18-800-killed-iraq-2-years-u-n499426)
In that same amount of time [Christian Terrorists in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have killed a total of 300,000.](https://www.hrw.org/africa/democratic-republic-congo)

**Christian terrorists in a single country kill 16 times more people than ISIS has world wide.** 

* Muslims make up 1% of the U.S population and commit 1 terrorist attack every 1.6 years. 

* [Christians make up 1% of India's population and are committing 800 terrorist attacks a year. 
It’s that simple.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Front_of_Tripura)

[According to the Global Terrorism Index:](http://economicsandpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Global-Terrorism-Index-2015.pdf) If you look at the top 50 countries with the most terrorism you would find. 

* 21 are Muslim majority countries.
* 20 are Christian majority countries.
* 3 are Buddhist majority countries. 
* 3 are Hindu majority countries. 
* 2 are Atheist majority countries. 
* 1 are Jewish majority countries.

That would mean 60% of the Muslim majority nations on earth **do not** rank in the top 50 countries for terrorism.   

Yet 100% of the top Hindu majority nations do.

It's that simple.

&gt; ***Why isn't the media talking about this?***

The short reasons is that there isn't any oil in the Congo or India so no one cares.

**But back to the main point of this post:**

#Islam isn't causing terrorism. 

* If it did, you would expect to see Muslims in Canada reading the Qur'an and bombing buildings

* You would expect that back in the 60s Syria would of had terrorists doing the exact same thing they are doing now.

* You would expect Muslims in Kyrgyzstan not voting for a woman as President.

* And most of all you would expect that if it did cause terrorism there would be more terrorism and violence in Muslim countries as opposed to the opposite which is the case if you compare Muslim communities in the west with non-Muslim communities and compare the Middle East with Christian Nations in Central Africa.
&gt; ***So what is the reason for terrorism then?***

The reason for terrorism is there being nothing to stop it.

If anyone has watched Walking Dead or Mad Max or any post apocalyptic movie then you understand the idea of those raving bands of killers and rapists going around doing whatever they want because there isn't anyone to stop them. 

Now if we put that into a real life scenario what happens is you get ISIS, you get the The Lord's Resistance Army and the Catholic Drug Lords in Honduras with their own Patron Saints and the Atheistic Rebels murdering missionaries in Thailand for being Christians and so on... 

&gt; ***But I heard that X% of Muslims want to murder infidels and kill innocent people? And force Islam on everyone.***

I've seen this a lot before. Anyone who is reading a poll that claims things like:

&gt; 80% of Muslim Americans told us they want to take over the country.

I urge you to actually find out who did this poll and look into their sample size and methodology because the weird thing is the people who are putting out these polls are always the same people. They are groups like [the Gatestone Institute which has been discredited time and time again as an Anti-Islamic propaganda mongerer.](http://www.alternet.org/investigations/one-americas-most-dangerous-think-tanks-spreading-islamophobic-hate-across-atlantic) They are people like [Frank Gaffney who was literally banned from all of the other conservative think tanks for being to racist and crazy even for them.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gaffney)

And always these polls are never Primary Sourced or Peer Reviewed. How about we look at some actually well established and cited polls.

**Here is one such example below:**

*Some people think that for the military to target and kill civilians is sometimes justified, while others think that kind of violence is never justified. Which is your opinion?*

 | Muslim | Protestant | Catholic | Jewish | Mormon | No religion/Atheist/Agnostic
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
Never justified | 78% | 38% | 39% | 43% | 33% | 56% | 
Sometimes justified | 21% | 58% | 58% | 52% | 64% | 43% | 
Depends | 0% | 0% | 2% | 3% | 3% | 0% | 

Keep in mind that the question was not asking about ""collateral damage"" but rather **targeting civilians**.

* http://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/njiym7x7nkuh2cnawawxka.gif

&gt;Gallup analysis suggests that one's religious identity and level of devotion have little to do with one's views about targeting civilians. According to the largest global study of its kind, covering 131 countries, it is human development and governance - not piety or culture - that are the strongest factors in explaining differences in how the public perceives this type of violence.

&gt;While the majority of world citizens agree that military attacks targeting civilians are never justified, a decade after 9/11, there is a wide range in the level of support for this view. A clear majority in Asia and MENA find military attacks against civilians unacceptable. This is not surprising considering the acute conflicts raging in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, and other parts of the Middle East.

&gt;In contrast, regionally, residents of the U.S. and Canada are most likely to say that military attacks against civilians are sometimes justified. **Americans are the most likely population in the world (49%) to believe military attacks targeting civilians is sometimes justified, followed by residents of Haiti and Israel (43%).**

* http://www.gallup.com/poll/157067/views-violence.aspx

One of the most cited anti-Muslim statics I see was made by Pew Forums in 2013. 

* https://believervsnonbelievers.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/gjpdwjjapa.jpg

This poll and many like it have been picked apart by numerous people for the lazy methodology and lack of diversity in the countries they poll.

And I could show those detailed arguments or compare the surveying they did to basically if a group of researchers went to a single small town in Texas and polled 10 people on social issues. Then used that to claim, “9 out of 10 Americans are against gay marriage.” but I’m just going to explain this in the exact terms of what happen.

[In 2013 Pew Forums](http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf) put out ads in the local newspapers in either a single city or either the top two or three largest cities in the country, for 39 different countries. These ads basically said, “Are you a poor Muslim and you wanna make 10$? Then come out to the offices of this survey polling company we subcontracted to get data for us and fill out forums for 6 hours then you can get your $10.”

And in each one of these countries between 500 and 1,500 people showed up for that 10$ and 4 hours into filling out the surveys when they got to the question on page 243 where it said, “Do you think all non Muslims should be killed? Yes or no?” around 1/3 of them just checked the yes box. 

That does not mean that 1/3 of all Muslims think the 6 billion non-Muslims alive should be killed. 

I find it especially ironic though that same people who are touting methodology like this to justify bigotry are the same people who try and debunk the surveys that claim 1/4 women have been victims of sexual assault as “feminist propaganda.”

Now if you do find polls that are well cited saying: 

&gt; X% of Muslims in this country want Sharia Law

Then the number would have to be pretty high to beat the number of Christians in the U.S that want Biblical Law.

[**Since 57% of Republicans want Christianity to be the national religion of The United States.**](http://www.politicususa.com/2015/02/25/57-republicans-dismantle-constitution-christianity-national-religion.html)

**-Edit-**

Looking more into disproportionate representation of Muslims I found that despite Muslims making up 23% of the worlds population [they account for 5 out of the past 12 Nobel Peace Prize winners.](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/) (Which is 42 percent.) 

Just a curious note on how Muslims are earning Nobel Prizes at twice the rate they proportionally should. ",islam,1896

Like most of you, I ignore live basketball games and opt instead to download a weekly excel spreadsheet from FiveThirtyEight that breaks the NBA down into what it’s really all about: *numbers*. With advanced analytics, nerds have finally tricked us into letting them be involved in sports, and it’s great, but it doesn’t go far enough. I do. Welcome to Advanced Advanced Analytics.

[After my previous foray into using numbers to look very dumb](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/53ieec/dwight_howards_shoulders_an_indepth_analysis/), I’ve decided to take the leap. I’m a numbers guy now, [so I’m officially retracting this statement](http://imgur.com/NkHM5mY). Math is great, and I am not a liar. With my newfound love for numbers, I have poured the past month into developing a series of analytics so advanced, they make regular analytics look like something Jalen Rose understands. Check em out.

***TPS (Teams Per Season)***

This is a pretty straightforward measurement of how many teams per season each NBA team has had since The Seattle Supersonics were founded in 1967. It’s calculated by dividing the years a franchise has actually existed by the seasons the NBA has had since 1967. Hope it’s helpful.



Team | Teams Per Season
---|---
Seattle Supersonics | 0.84 TPS
Almost every other team | 1.0 TPS

***KD% (Kbad Decision)***

KD% is an advanced, unbiased way to determine whether or not a player’s free-agency decisions are, as mathematicians put it, “bitch moves”. The formula starts by ranking a player’s loyalty, then adding how much anybody gives a shit about where they play basketball. After taking into account how bad the abandoned team’s situation is, and whether or not the player has faced their new team in the playoffs, you multiply that number x2 if the player’s name rhymes with “Shmevin Shmurant”. Once you’ve done all that, the number is converted to a percentage somehow. Here’s the KD% for some offseason moves from the past couple of years.




Year/Player | KD%
---|---
2010 LeBron James | 67KD%
2015 Jeremy Lin|18KD% 
2016 Shmevin Shmurant|100KD% 

***SCALABRINE***

In the mold of Nate Silver’s CARMELO, I’ve named this model after a generational talent who no longer tries to play basketball. Where CARMELO looks to map the trajectory of specific player’s careers, SCALABRINE simply looks to map how much a specific player looks like Brian Scalabrine. Using an image analysis tool, I’ve calculated key visual similarities between various players and Brian Scalabrine. Here are a few examples:

**Michael Jordan**:
Comparing two chicago bulls legends whose respective games on the court are so similar, you would think they’d probably look alike too. Wrong, idiot! According to my metrics (feel free to double check, dummy), [Michael Jordan and Brian Scalabrine have a SCALABRINE resemblance percentage of only 26.88%, outlined by the grey areas in this image](http://imgur.com/h94mZ33). To put that in perspective, [Brian Scalabrine and this picture of Kyle Lowry’s butt have a resemblance percentage of 53.45%](http://imgur.com/O0YVHrB). Wow. Thank you, analytics.

**Blake Griffin**:
As far as redheads go, Blake Griffin is great, but he is certainly standing on the shoulders of a giant version of Brian Scalabrine. Scalabrine is actually a lot like Blake Griffin, he’s like if Blake Griffin quit basketball to instead eat pudding full time, and also converted from Christianity to pudding as a religion. If Blake Griffin did those two things, and also won an NBA championship, I don’t think it’s far fetched to say that we’d be looking at Scalabrine V2. [Also, Blake and Brian have a SCALABRINE resemblance of 31.88%.](http://imgur.com/QepGHaR)

**Kyle Singler**:
If you didn’t want me to do this, you shouldn’t have invented Google you fucking morons. I used the SCALABRINE model to compare the two basketball players most likely to enjoy the music of 21 pilots. As a result, [I also created this crime against God](http://imgur.com/eZ1wpWW). According to my SCALABRINE software, [Kyle Singler and Brian Scalabrine are 88.87% similar](http://imgur.com/4ZlQbpD). Nothing has ever made more sense than that.

***ERNEH (charles barkley’s opinions quantified mathematically)***

We all love Charles Barkley for the simple fact that he’s bald, but he doesn’t brag about it. Chuck is a simple man, the kind of guy who uses “gay” as an adjective and misses the way basketball used to be played (in ancient Mexico, with human heads instead of basketballs, no girly 3-pointers allowed). He’s a very curious person with a whole lot of opinions that make little-to-no sense, so I figured I’d try to quantify them. Using some Cool Math™, I’ve devised a rating system for things that Charles Barkley probably has an opinion on, scored from 0 (doesn’t like) to 100 (does like) Here’s some examples of things, and then Charles Barkley’s opinions on those things, shown by their ERNEH numbers



Thing | ERNEH number
---|---
Dessert Scented Candles  | 87
The Golden State Warriors |No he does not like this thing at all
Fake News on Facebook |73
Bubble Wrap |96

***eSTR (Effective Shit Talk Rating)***

eSTR is an advanced analysis of a player’s ability to talk trash on and off the court. The model varies from the standard STR (Shit Talk Rating) model, because this one has an “E” in front of it, which stands for “effective”. Ability to talk shit is rated on a 10 point scale.

**Enes Kanter — (-8.2)**

Throughout his career, Enes has had an incredibly hard time talking shit, because his name is Enes. If you, as someone with the name Enes, try to talk shit to really anybody who knows that your first name is Enes, you will regret talking said shit. Example: [in this video, Enes attempts to talk shit to Kevin Durant, and fails miserably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FkWlwqZosc), because all Durant had to do is turn around and say “dog ya name is Enes”, and that’s exactly what he did. Durant is a pretty easy target as far as shit talk goes, because he looks like one of those inflatable noodle guys in front of car dealerships, but Enes is a much, much easier target. After Kevin Durant states Kanter’s first name, Enes gets his feelings hurt, and Steven Adams gives him a reassuring pat on the leg before going back to being a guy with a really bad tribal tattoo. What a sequence.

**Lebron James — (+5.9)**

I’m not sure where exactly to place LeBron on the shit-talk spectrum, because he mostly engages in a very strange and specific kind of shit-talk wherein he invokes his familial situation as a retort. For example: if you said to LeBron “son your hair plugs look like Luis Guzman’s pubes”, he would probably fire back with “I have been happily married for three years”, somehow thinking that makes sense in the context of shit-talking. Truly perplexing stuff.

**Boban Marjanovic — (+9.1)**

This one seems too high at first, but hear me out. Yes, I know Boban looks like the BFG, and that is something you can certainly make fun of him for. But, what you may not know is that Boban Marjanovic is not a single grown man, but instead three 13-year-old boys stacked on top of one another, wearing a giant Pistons jersey and a paper-mache head. The whole thing started out as a joke for Darren, Ben, and Colin, but now they’re somehow in the NBA, and it’s hard to turn down that Van Gundy money. Part of why they’ve made it so far is because, as 13 year olds, they have a superior ability to talk shit. Anytime an opposing player tries to point out that Boban is in fact a group of teenagers in costume, Darren yells from the middle of the Boban-stack that he and that player’s mother had intercourse the previous night. Ruthless.

***Quick Questions:***

Since I’ve started posting my guides and analysis here, I’ve gotten a lot of questions from people pertaining to the NBA (which I am an expert on). To end this post, I’d like to quickly answer the questions that are asked most frequently:

**Dear Caleb, which basketball player has the most shoes?**

This topic has been one of much debate over the years, but I think the clear answer here is Michael Jordan. The reason is obvious; Nike’s “Buy One, Give One” policy. Similar to how Tom’s shoe brand donates one pair of shoes to a child in need for every pair bought, Nike donates one pair of Jordan’s to Michael Jordan for every pair purchased. You probably didn’t know this, but that’s what I’m here for!

**Hey Caleb, How Are The OKC Thunder like actual thunder?**

In many, many ways, child. The number one way would be the name, as they are both called “thunder”. The other way they are similar is that neither has won an NBA championship, and probably never will. The list of ways in which they are similar is too long to post here, so I’ll leave it at that.

**Yo, Caleb! What’s your nickname for Klay Thompson’s 37-point quarter?**

The “Ay-Klay-37”.

Hope that answers all of your questions! Feel free to use any of the mathematics in this post, what’s mine is yours. [If you’d like to keep up with my writing or ask me a question for me to answer next time, check me on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/calebarmpits)",nba,1317

**[Week 13 Quick Thoughts]( https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/5fryut/quick_thoughts_on_every_week_13_game/)**

This is it folks, the first week of the playoffs! If you’re reading this, congratulations, you’ve made it! Well, either that or you’re trying to avoid the Sacko. Either way, now it’s time to get serious. Make safe choices with high floors - you don’t want to lose because you took an unnecessary risk. The exception to that rule would be if your opponent’s team completely outclasses you on paper – in that case, choose a few of those boom or bust guys with ridiculously high ceilings. They might just put you over the top. Most of all good luck, and I hope my thoughts can help to break some ties for you!

----

##**Raiders @ Chiefs**

•	Kansas City has been quite generous to opposing passers, allowing the last five QBs to face them throw for 250+ yards. **Derek Carr** is a QB1 caliber play against them. Pass catchers have also thrived against the Chiefs, a good sign for **Amari Cooper** and **Michael Crabtree**.  Since the bye, Crabtree has been targeted 7, 13 and 11 times. In those same games, Cooper has been targeted 5, 7 and 4 times. Perhaps Carr prefers Crabtree, or perhaps it’s due to better coverage being assigned to Cooper. This week, however, Crabtree should face the tougher coverage of the two against Marcus Peters who held him to just 2 catches for 10 yards in Week 6. Crabtree will be more of a low end WR2 in this situation, and Cooper will be a high end WR2. **Latavius Murray** has successfully shed the RBBC that plagued his owners early in the season – Kansas City is tough on the run game, but based on usage he is at worst a high end RB2 with upside for more.

•	Even in extremely favorable matchups, **Alex Smith** has proven he can’t be trusted as more than a back end QB2. That will also be the case this week. He hasn’t thrown for more than 300 yards since Week 1. **Travis Kelce** has caught over 100 yards worth of passes in three straight games, and faces and Oakland defense that is vulnerable to the position. He’s a elite TE1 play. **Spencer Ware** will be in the RB1 discussion against a middling Raiders run defense which has allowed nearly 100 yards on the ground to its last three opposing backs (only Jonathan Stewart failed to reach 100, but he got to 96). **Tyreek Hill** stayed involved, but as usual his targets fluctuated – I think he’s an excellent WR3 play, with a solid enough floor and a sky high ceiling. I don’t feel that **Jeremy Maclin**, who hasn’t seen the field in weeks, is a serious threat to him in Week 14. Maclin will be just a WR4 in his return – he hurts Hill’s outlook a little bit.

##**Cardinals @ Dolphins**

•	**Carson Palmer** has shown signs of life against Atlanta and most recently Washington – the Dolphins have recently been pulverized by the likes of Colin Kaepernick and Joe Flacco. Palmer is worth a shot as a low end QB1. **Larry Fitzgerald** regained a good portion of his volume last week, netting 11 targets – with DJ more and more involved in the passing game, Fitzgerald is more of an upside WR2 than low end WR1. **Michael Floyd** has settled in as a low upside flex/WR4. That’s as far as I would go in considering Arizona pass catchers, with one very exceptional exception of course. Raise your hand if you think **David Johnson** will get, at a minimum, 20 points in PPR? If you did not raise your hand please exit this thread. David Johnson is Marshall Faulk born again. David Johnson is often targeted more than this team’s WR1. David Johnson is a golden god. Not a one of us is worthy. Not a one. If you face him in the playoffs this week, please know that what happens next is not your fault. Know that I weep for you.

•	**Ryan Tannehill** played badly at Baltimore last week, and he should play even worst at Arizona this week – it is a brutal defensive matchup for the entire Dolphins’ offense. Tannehill is a back end QB2. **Jarvis Landry** got his groove back with 14 targets last week, but Arizona will reduce him to mere WR3 status – I’m not sure we can count on that volume sticking around. **DeVante Parker**, hampered by an injury and potentially shadowed by Patrick Peterson, will be a low end WR3 – your only hope is busted coverage allowing a big play. **Jay Ajayi** faces the toughest fantasy run defense – based on workload I’m still fine starting him as a low end RB2. Low end only because of the matchup and the chance that the game gets out of hand quickly and the run game is abandoned.

##**Chargers @ Panthers**

•	Carolina’s defense hasn’t given up many huge games to opposing quarterbacks recently, but they’ve given up plenty of serviceable ones and I’m confident that **Philip Rivers** can take advantage for low end QB1 numbers. **Tyrell Williams** saw only 4 targets in his first game since his shoulder injury but played nearly all available snaps. He was able to save his day with a nice touchdown, on which he did not look in any way hampered by the injury. I’m labeling Williams a solid WR2 with extreme upside against Carolina’s torpedoed secondary. **Dontrelle Inman** continued to be a consistent performer, and had a great game last week – he’s worth WR3/flex consideration in any league format, particularly in this nice matchup. It goes without saying that **Melvin Gordon** is an every week RB1 – his usage is elite. The offense truly depends on him. **Antonio Gates** received only 4 targets last week, but that was still preferable to **Hunter Henry**, who received just 1. Gates will be the low end TE1 play moving forward – Henry cannot be trusted as anything more than a boom or bust TE2.

•	**Cam Newton** should be able to put up low end QB1 numbers against the Chargers in this middling matchup. I have concerns for **Kelvin Benjamin**, who will likely face CB Casey Hayward, who was able to mostly  shut down god-king Mike Evans last week. Benjamin, who hasn’t had a truly standout performance since Week 2, will be just a WR3. **Tedd Ginn** stands to benefit from the coverage on Benjamin; he is firmly in play as a WR3/flex option. He has been fantastic the past two weeks, and startable since week 6. **Greg Olsen** has been a disappointment to owners for multiple weeks, but he is still getting the volume to succeed. Keep starting him as a TE1 and hope for better returns on that volume this week. **Jonathan Stewart** will be an RB2 based on workload against a solid run defense.

##**Vikings @ Jaguars**

•	The Jaguars’ have been surprisingly good against opposing QBs, and **Sam Bradford** is not someone you want to be starting anyways. He’ll be a QB3 against Jacksonville. **Stefon Diggs** was passable but not exceptional last week, but bear in mind he was still recovering from a knee injury. With 10 days of rest, he should be full go as a strong WR2 against the Jaguars adept pass defense. **Kyle Rudolph** didn’t light up the stat sheet last week, but he does have 22 targets through the last two games. Keep firing him up as a solid TE1. **Adam Thielen** has a legitimate role in this offense and he’s in play as a middling WR3/flex in PPR formats. The Vikings finally got **Jerick McKinnon** involved in the passing game, highlighting his strengths. The result was his best game since week 4. Is it a sign of things to come? Possibly, I certainly hope so. But I wouldn’t bet on it on this team with such uninspired play calling. Still, the possibility is enough to elevate McKinnon to RB3 consideration. **Matt Asiata** is a low end, TD dependent RB3. 

•	Just as **Blake Bortles** was swallowed up last week by Denver’s defense, I expect him to be limited again by Minnesota. He’ll be a low end QB2 against this very good defense. This matchup is just as awful for **Allen Robinson** who, despite considerable volume, is suffering from Bortles’ regression. He’ll be just a WR3 against this defense. **Marqise Lee** has about the same chance of return WR3 value as Robinson, shockingly. **TJ Yeldon** could have the backfield to himself if **Chris Ivory** and **Denard Robinson** remain sidelined with their injuries. The increased workload would elevate Yeldon to a low end RB2 in PPR. 

##**Texans @ Colts**

•	**Brock Osweiler** remains the Texans’ QB for reasons unknown – he’ll be a middling QB2 against an atrocious Colts defense. **DeAndre Hopkins** continues to get the volume of a WR1, but the quality of targets are so low, he’ll remain a low end WR2 even in this cupcake matchup. **Lamar Miller** should bounce back and have no trouble running all over a bad Colts’ run defense for solid RB2 numbers. **CJ Fiedorowicz** is a PPR machine – in this great matchup he’s a bona fide TE1. **Will Fuller** is only a boom or bust flex play. 

•	I trust **Andrew Luck** as a solid QB1 play against the Texans despite the tough on-paper matchup – he has a number of weapons, and he’ll be playing at home. **TY Hilton** is a no brainer WR1 with Luck under center. **Donte Moncrief** is an incredibly consistent WR2, and a constant threat in the red zone. I would not expect **Dwayne Allen** to  catch three TDs again, or even one – he’s a mere TE2 despite last week’s explosion. **Jack Doyle** is no better – these two TEs limit each other’s upside immensely. **Frank Gore** is a high quality RB2 each and every week – outside of a dud in Week 12, he has been incredibly consistent. 

##**Redskins @ Eagles**

•	The Philadelphia defense has been a shell of its early season self, and **Kirk Cousins** has been an excellent QB. I’m confidently starting him as a QB1. **Jamison Crowder** should continue to be a relatively highly targeted, highly consistent WR2, especially in PPR. If **Jordan Reed** can return from his injury this week, he’ll be a no brainer TE1. If Reed cannot go, **Vernon Davis** would be a low end TE1. **Pierre Garcon** is a worthy WR3/Flex play in this pass happy offense. **DeSean Jackson** is, as he’s always been, a boom or bust WR3. With so many mouths to feed I’d err on the side of caution with him. **Rob Kelley** has disappointed in two tough matchups, but he should rebound as an RB2 in this matchup – he’s still getting volume and should handle all goal line situations.

•	**Carson Wentz** has been a disaster – the lack of actual weapons outside of **Jordan Matthews** and **Zach Ertz** is a major issue. There is no running game to help him either. Also, he’s just a rookie. I think he has a bright future but for now he’s a QB3. Jordan Matthews will be a WR2 if he is able to go – he should be fed plenty against this defense. Ertz will be a solid low to mid range TE1 – his role is definitely increasing. I feel like there will never be clarity in the Eagles’ backfield. Here’s what I think: the Eagles will be in catch up mode for most of the game, making **Darren Sproles** a viable RB3 with RB2 upside in PPR. **Ryan Mathews** and **Wendell Smallwood** fill essentially the same role, so if Mathews is starting, plug him in as a very iffy RB3. If Mathews is not starting, Smallwood serves the same purpose.

##**Steelers @ Bills**

•	The Big 3 have become the Big 4. **Ben Roethlisberger**, **LeVeon Bell**, **Antonio Brown** and now introducing **Ladarius Green** will all serve as QB/RB/WR/TE1s in this explosive offense. I love Ladarius Green – I wrote an article about him taking on the WR2 role in Pittsburgh this season. Well, it took long enough but it looks like that is finally happening. Pick him up if he’s out there.The only hesitation I have about any of them is Big Ben, who has very concerning home/road splits. Being on the road, if you have another viable QB1 to start over him, consider it strongly.

•	**Tyrod Taylor** should bounce back as a low end QB1 in a game where I expect the Bills will be keeping up with the Steelers’ offensive production. **LeSean McCoy** is a no brainer, every week RB1 – he is the offensive centerpiece. **Sammy Watkins** is being slowly brought back from injury – his increasing snaps and the fact that he suffered no setbacks are grounds for him to be treated as a WR3 with extreme upside this week. **Mike Gillislee** is flexable in a pinch – he’s always a threat to vulture McCoy and he gets a decent number of carries all on his own.

##**Bengals @ Browns**

•	The entire Bengals offense will get a boost against the Browns. **Andy Dalton** is worthy of low end QB1 consideration. **Tyler Eifert** will be an elite TE1. **Brandon LaFell** is certainly worth a look in your WR3 or flex spot – he did very well last week and the matchup just got a lot better. **Jeremy Hill** will be a strong RB2, pushing the bounds of RB1 in this prime matchup in which he faces no competition in the backfield. **Tyler Boyd** is also in the flex range, although below LaFell, as a consistent target for Dalton who gets a boost from the matchup.

•	Word has it that **Robert Griffin III** might be starting at QB for the Browns. Whoever it is, they will not be more than a low end QB2. Cincinnati has been surprisingly stout against opposing wide receivers. **Terrelle Pryor** is still a strong WR2 option, but **Corey Coleman** will be just a low end WR3 in this matchup. **Gary Barnidge** is a very tough to trust, low upside TE2. **Duke Johnson** is a low upside RB3 with a downgrade in standard formats. **Isaiah Crowell** could be the only offensive bright spot outside of Pryor this week – Cincinnati has been weak against the run game and Crowell should receive plenty of carries. Crowell is on the low end RB2 radar this week. 

##**Bears @ Lions**

•	The Lions defense has been successfully playing keepaway against opposing offenses recently, but even if they weren’t, **Matt Barkley** would still be a bottom barrel option at QB. **Jordan Howard** is the offensive star here, and there’s no reason not to expect low end RB1 numbers from him. I can’t honestly say that **Cameron Meredith**, **Joshua Bellamy** or **Marquess Wilson** are startable options – whoever scores points is anyone’s guess.

•	**Matthew Stafford** is a safe QB1 play against a disintegrating Bears team. **Theo Riddick** was barely used in the running game last week, but he remains a viable low end RB2/flex in PPR thanks to his use in the passing game. **Golden Tate** is the most consistent pass catcher in this offense and he’ll be a safe WR2. **Marvin Jones** can barely be trusted as a WR4 if he is able to play at all. **Anquan Boldin** is a mid level WR3 with solid touchdown upside. **Eric Ebron** has been a disappointment in recent games - he’s just a TE2 with limited upside in this offense with many mouths to feed.

##**Broncos @ Titans**

•	Whether it’s **Trevor Siemian** or **Paxton Lynch**, neither Broncos QB will be a viable fantasy start. Siemian would drastically improve the outlook of the entire offense however. In the Siemian world, **Emmanuel Sanders** and **Demaryius Thomas** will be solid (and nearly identically used) WR2s. **Devontae Booker** has been painfully inefficient, but stands alone in the backfield carrying a huge workload and goal line duties. That’s enough to treat him as a low end RB2.

•	**Marcus Mariota** will face a real challenge against the Denver Broncos’ elite defense which has limited all but two quarterbacks to less than 16 fantasy points. He’ll be just a QB2, but should keep his floor by rushing a bit more than usual. I’ll also be avoiding all Titans’ receivers, **Rishard Matthews** being the most fantasy relevant of the bunch. Matthews will be just a WR3. **Delanie Walker** can still be relied upon as a TE1 as Denver’s defense is not as potent against tight ends. **DeMarco Murray** will be an elite RB1 against a questionable run defense.

##**Jets @ 49ers**

•	**Bryce Petty** and the Jets get the infinitely generous San Francisco defense this week. Petty obviously cannot be trusted, and his effect on this offense has been profoundly disturbing for **Brandon Marshall** and **Quincy Enunwa** owners. Petty came in last week and promptly peppered **Robby Anderson** with targets to the exclusion of all others. Marshall will be a WR3 with upside while we wait to see how he meshes with Petty after a full week of practice. Enunwa is impossible to trust. Anderson is an intriguing flex in a desperation situation – the matchup is as good as it gets and if he keeps last week’s target share under Petty, he could pay dividends. **Matt Forte** will likely be the best start on the Jets against the 49ers’ historically bad run defense – fire him up happily as an RB2. **Bilal Powell** is a desperation flex play – his one touch last week was a strange and concerning aberration. 

•	I’ll open this section by sincerely apologizing to each and every one of you who I advised to start **Colin Kaepernick**. The process was correct, he had four QB1 games in a row under his belt going into Week 13, but we all got burned by the results. If you’re feeling lucky, the Jets present a good matchup for Kaep, but obviously he has a short leash. I don’t have the stones to start him again. **Carlos Hyde** faces a stout Jets run defense, but has the workload and the skills to turn out a solid RB2 outing. **Vance McDonald** faltered last week, as did the entire offense. I’m not ready to discount the steady stream of quality low end TE1 production he had strung together prior to last week. Obviously not the sexiest option, he is nonetheless a low end TE1 for the desperate. The WRs are unstartable, after all, and someone has to catch passes.

##**Seahawks @ Packers**

•	**Russell Wilson** will be a mid-range QB1 option against a faltering Green Bay defense. Get your Seahawks in your lineup. I like them all this week. **Doug Baldwin** will be a high end WR2, **Jimmy Graham** will be a TE1, and **Thomas Rawls** will be a low end RB1. **Tyler Lockett** will be a boom or bust WR3 – his production last week was fantastic but he did it on only 6 targets. I need to see more volume before I’m truly confident plugging him in.

•	The entire offense faces a big downgrade thanks to a tough matchup with the Seahawks. Regardless, **Aaron Rodgers** is a QB1 and the good news is he’s playing at home. This will be more of a floor game for him but it won’t be a disaster. **Jordy Nelson** should be held relatively in check, but given his weekly target share, I’d still be comfortable with him in my WR2 slot. **Davante Adams** laid a massive deuce last week, however, he still had the second most targets (7) and this week should avoid the toughest coverage. I still trust him as a lower end WR2. **Randall Cobb** has been a low upside WR3/flex play for weeks; he will remain in that range against Seattle. **James Starks** has begun to lose his job due to horrible inefficiency; **Christine Michael** and **Ty Montgomery** will now mix in as well, forming a dreaded three headed monster RBBC. None of them will be viable RB3s against Seattle’s tough defense.

##**Saints @ Buccaneers**

•	Shootout alert! I like everyone in this game. The Buccaneers defense has been better of late, but the Saints are still an offensive powerhouse and **Drew Brees** will be a sure-thing QB1. **Michael Thomas** should be in the high end WR2/low end WR1 range as New Orleans’ most targeted, most talented receiver. **Brandin Cooks** is a nice mid-range WR2 option, and **Willie Snead** is the perfect WR3/flex with a decent floor and a high ceiling. **Coby Fleener** is back on the TE1 radar with this matchup and the loss of **Josh Hill** to injury. His snaps should increase and he’s worth a start if you’ve got him. **Mark Ingram** will be an RB1 in this matchup – he is clearly ahead of **Tim Hightower** in the pecking order at this point. Hightower is a desperation RB3/flex with a rock bottom floor.

•	**Jameis Winston** and **Mike Evans** are both on their way to beautiful days against New Orleans. As I said, this is a likely shootout, and Evans has a monopoly on the target share in Tampa. If you’ve been holding Winston for his playoff schedule as I have, prepare to reap the rewards. Winston and Evans are a locked in QB1/WR1 pair for the rest of the season. **Cameron Brate**, as Winston’s number two target and a favorite in the red zone, is a locked in TE1. **Doug Martin** may or may not be injured – if he starts, he’ll be solid high end RB2. There are workload concerns for him with **Charles Sims** returning. Sims should be picked up in all leagues with Martin’s health in question. Sims will be a high end RB2 in PPR for the rest of the season in Martin misses time. He has standalone flex value as the Bucs’ third down back even when Martin is healthy.

##**Falcons @ Rams**

•	**Matt Ryan** will be a very solid QB1 play against a so-so Rams’ defense that has given up big performances to explosive offenses such as Atlanta’s. **Julio Jones** is questionable with a toe injury but seems likely to play. He’s a WR1 whenever he sees the field. **Devonta Freeman** has a definite edge over **Tevin Coleman** for the moment. Freeman will be an RB1 while Coleman remains merely in RB3/flex territory. **Taylor Gabriel** is on the lower end of the WR3/flex map, but his value and that of **Mohamed Sanu** would skyrocket if Jones were to somehow sit out this game.

•	**Jared Goff** gets a very nice matchup against a generous Atlanta defense – he’s streamable as a QB2 but I wouldn’t go any farther than that. I really like **Kenny Britt’s** outlook as a solid WR2 against this defense. No other pass catcher for this team can be trusted outside of deep leagues. **Todd Gurley** should be able to produce one of his better games of the season against Atlanta’s defense. I’d be content starting him as my RB2.

##**Cowboys @ Giants**

•	The Giants’ defense has given up the 2nd fewest fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks, but that is largely due to an excellent strength of schedule. **Dak Prescott** should be a lock for QB1 numbers in an important divisional game. **Dez Bryant** should be, at worst, a high end WR2. **Cole Beasley** continues to be a reliable WR3/flex and should be started as such. **Jason Witten** dropped a 9 reception 66 yard game on the Giants in Week 1 and the Giants have been weak to the tight end position for most of the season – Witten is a viable TE1 streamer this week. **Ezekiel Elliott** has everything going for him – fire him up as a top end RB1.

•	I love **Eli Manning** and **Odell Beckham** this week. Obviously you’re starting Odell as your WR1, but if you have a decision to make about Eli and another QB, Eli’s pretty high up on my list. He’s a top half QB1 in this potential shootout. **Sterling Shepard** got back involved last week and continued his mid-range WR3/flex ways. He has a touchdown in four of his last five games – not bad for your flex spot. **Rashad Jennings** had a great week in fantasy last week, however, he had a season low in carries. The bright spot was his involvement in the passing game. The split with **Paul Perkins** is concerning to me, so for me Rashad will be just an RB3 against the Cowboys. 

##**Ravens @ Patriots**

•	Despite the blow up last week, **Joe Flacco** has been below mediocre all season and he’ll be just a QB2 against the Pats. New England has been excellent in limiting wide receivers, so **Mike Wallace** and **Steve Smith Sr.**, who are splitting targets fairly evenly, will be just WR3s in this tough matchup. As the goal line back, **Terrance West** has high RB3/low RB2 value which he demonstrated very well last week. He is definitely in an even split with **Kenneth Dixon** at this point, however, so the floor is low if he cannot get in the end zone. Dixon himself is a middling RB3/flex getting fewer carries and not getting too involved at the goal line. **Dennis Pitta** unexpectedly exploded last week but he should return to his average low upside TE2 status this week. 

•	This will sound crazy, but temper expectations for **Tom Brady** on Monday night against the Ravens. The Ravens are a very tough defense, perhaps the toughest in football, and without **Rob Gronkowski**, Brady has historically been a worse fantasy performer. Fire him up as a low end QB1. Baltimore has the league’s best run defense at the moment, so I’d consider **LeGarrette Blount** a low end RB2 with limited upside – his floor is lower than usual here. **Julian Edelman** can be safely started as a strong WR2 – the passing game will be the conduit through which the Pats attack the Ravens, and Edelman leads that charge. I wouldn’t expect much from **Martellus Bennett**, he will be asked to block a lot with Gronk out of the picture and he has not done well in his absence – Bennett’s a TE2. **Malcolm Mitchell** is a very strong WR3/flex play – he has burst onto the scene as one of Brady’s favorite targets. I’d be happy to start him, even against a tough defense. **Chris Hogan** is a 5 target, low upside flex kind of guy – there are too many other targets for him to thrive. **James White** and **Dion Lewis** are in a straight up timeshare for the pass catching back role, which is awful for fantasy. However, this matchup sets up well for pass catching backs, the Ravens having allowed a ton of receptions to RBs, so there is volatile upside here. Unfortunately I don’t think either is startable outside of PPR, and even there they are merely a boom or bust flex plays with Dion having the edge in touches. If Dion Lewis is going to take over the role, this would be the week to do it so we can start him in Week 15. Fingers crossed!

Welcome back!

We have now had two awesome weeks in a row. Going to have to keep this one brief again because I've found myself with three (!) exams this week and finals start next week. Someone needs to tell my university that the fantasy football playoffs are here, because this is downright un-American. Like the last time, if you feel like you have a strong grasp on D/STs, please help out your fellow users with questions. I'll do my best to hop in after Thursday or when I have some downtime this week.

Some dud games, but overall the projection model's rank correlation was almost as high as the record high last week. On the season, we have beaten Fantasy Pros ECR in all but 3 weeks, and for each of the last 5 weeks. It's been a very kind season, and hopefully that continues for another few weeks.

**[Defense Wins Championships, Week 13](https://empeopled.com/p/96311)**

This week's top teams (MFL Standard scoring):

Rank | Team | Points | Tier | Notes
:--------: | :-------- | :--------: | :--------: | :--------
1 | Denver Broncos | 10.1 | 1 | Please
2 | Seattle Seahawks | 10.0 | 1 | Read
3 | New England Patriots | 9.7 | 1 | The
4 | Baltimore Ravens | 9.6 | 1.5 | Full
5 | Philadelphia Eagles | 9.3 | 2 | Article
6 | San Diego Chargers | 9.0 | 2 | Linked
7 | Arizona Cardinals | 8.0 | 3 | Above
8 | Green Bay Packers | 8.0 | 3 | !

**(The top 16 teams, and whichever extras are on the same tier as #16, can be found in the link above)**

Most ""Should I start Team A or Team B!?"" questions can be answered very simply by the rankings. There's no magic to it. If you have the option of Team A or Team B, and both teams are on the same tier, then the distinction between them is very marginal! Do not stress yourself out about choosing between them. Look at the following week's matchup to see if either option has an edge, and then go from there. Remember, if your league uses different scoring from MFL (which is similar - but not exactly the same - as ESPN, Yahoo!, CBS, et al), then you may need to use some of your own intuition to parse two similar choices.

**Best of luck in Week 13!**",fantasyfootball,1088
tjayrocket,2016-11-29 14:01:36+00:00,Howdy /r/Seattle - I am your Mail Man and let's talk about Holiday Packages and theft!,"Hey guys!  

So, as stated in the title, I am one of the **many** delivery people coming to your door this holiday season with packages, amazon orders, gifts, mail and more. And especially in the recent times, a guy who knows how *frustrating* things can get this time of year ordering online and being shocked to find your amazon and packages missing. So let's talk packages.  

First of all - I work for the United States Postal Service - I am a Letter Carrier at the Seattle Carrier Annex and from our building in SoDo, we service most of the downtown and surrounding areas and our volumes of packages are exploding currently. We know that at this time of year there are people who are actively trying to steal your hard earned packages and gifts and we want to help in keeping your items secure. **I can't speak in an official capacity, I am not H.R. or Public Affairs, just a guy who wants to help all of you and here are my tips to avoid package theft this time of year:**  

1) Track Your Packages - Be it the USPS, UPS, FedEX, DHL, Amazon or other - we all offer tracking. Keep an eye on your tracking and anything you order, ask for Tracking when you order your items. Amazon automatically tracks all their packages but some people don't offer this automatically. Don't be shy about it, get the tracking info and watch for your packages. A lot of companies send packages with 'Carrier - Leave if no response' and that tells us, leave it at the door if you are not home. That's the easiest way for people to get your stuff. Amazon **mandates** this if your item is coming from the USPS so be aware, we will be leaving the package if you are not home. Leading to my next point...  

2) Communicate with us - If you leave us a note, we will see it as long as it's clearly visible to us. (Leave it in your mailbox, that's the easiest way for us to see it because that is what we are trying to find on your property.) As mentioned earlier, we at the USPS have to leave any Amazon packages or 'Leave if No Response' packages regardless of requests because at this time of year, we just don't have the space to hold onto all of it at our office, and Amazon does not allow us to delay your package for any reason short of a legitimate emergency. Want us to deliver behind your house or to a neighbor? We can do that as long as no one has to sign for it *with ID* but we don't know unless **you tell us.**  

3) Going out of town? **Put a hold on your mail** - We offer this for free on the USPS website located [Here](https://holdmail.usps.com/holdmail/) and we can hold all your items for up to 30 days. If you think it's okay to go a day or two without holding your mail - you are wrong. Those packages are the first to get stolen. We get a printout everyday of our temporary holds so use it. It's a free service that you can do from your home, tablet or phone so if you don't use it... Sorry. :/  

4) Check your mail - it is standard policy that if a mail box is full or unsecured - we hold your mail and stop **ALL** delivery to your residence if your box is stuffed with mail or left open to potential theft. No Mail, Amazon, Priority, Express... Nothing. Empty your mail box. It delays the mail for us to fight with it and delaying the mail is **[ILLEGAL](https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov/aboutus/laws.aspx)** so we have to skip your residence if it is full or unsecured. To resume service you must collect your mail from the Post Office that services your house. If you live downtown, that typically means you have to drive to the Seattle Carrier Annex in SoDo, bring I.D. and collect it from a clerk or supervisor. Note - we don't have a standard customer service window and getting the carriers out on their routes is our priority. You can wait for up to an Hour sometimes to get your mail so, just keep your mail box clear and secure because that wait can SUCK!  

4) Amazon Lockers -If for whatever reason, you just don't feel secure with packages arriving to your house or apartment, Amazon does offer Parcel Locker deliveries located at places like 7-11 and QFC/Safeway. We drop the packages there, in a secure area and you get a code sent to you so when it's convenient for you, you can get your package there. If I remember correctly, you have 3 days to go get your package from when we drop it off. For more info on that, Amazon offers a list of Amazon Locker locations [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201117850)  

5) Amazon Theft - This comes as no consolation, I know, but - All Amazon packages are insured from theft. Believe me they are a part of the process from when you order until we at the USPS, deliver. That Goes for UPS and FedEx as well. If your package is lost, stolen etc - please call us at 1(800) ASK-USPS. You hate having your packages stolen, and we hate it too, especially during the holiday season.   

6) Sunday Delivery of Amazon - the USPS and Amazon both deliver Amazon packages on Sunday. This can be problematic for those who live in an apartment with *Codes, Key-fob or Security Card* entries. If we can't get in your building, we cannot deliver your items and they will be returned to the station to have your regular carrier deliver on the next business day. These carriers are **not** your regular carrier and may not be able to get you package to a secure location. They will not have any unique keys, fobs, cards or codes *usually* and If they can't reach you via the call box, **we will not deliver it**. No amount of complaining will change that. If you order for Sunday delivery, make sure they can reach you because they will attempt delivery **only once**.  

In summation - we WANT to get your packages and mail to you as fast and secure as possible. Life can happen and we can't prevent all theft but to ensure that we did our best, keep us informed of your particular needs. A call to the delivery agent can help immensely in avoiding this. Listed Below are the Customer Service numbers for the top five Delivery Companies for your purposes:  

USPS - 1(800) ASK-USPS  
UPS - 1 (800) 742-5877  
FedEX - 1 (800) 463-3339  
DHL - 1 (800) 225-5345  
OnTrac - 1 (800) 334-5000  
Amazon 1 (888) 280-4331  

And that's the best advice I can offer you! Happy Holidays /r/Seattle! Feel free to ask any questions you may have!

I have never had a post gilded so I am a tad lost to the etiquette here so I won't say their name unless they say it is okay - But, I did this post because I love my work, I love my city and after seeing posts about stolen packages I thought this post could help. Thank you again.**  

**EDIT 5 - Time for some sleep, I have been at this all day, gonna answer a few more and then I will answer more in the morning, if need be, before I go back to work. Thank you all for the great questions, thoughts, ideas, Reddit Gold and I hope you all have a great night! If you have a pressing question, there is a USPS subreddit, feel free to ask anyone there!

camly75,2016-11-21 17:38:50+00:00,A Team of 25 Jose Cansecos in OOTP (A Phil Coke prequel),"The year is 1988. The Oakland Athletics are bought by a new owner who promises to make sweeping changes throughout the organization. His moves were not immediately popular. His first order of business was to release 24 of the 25 players on the A's major league roster. The only player left was 23-year-old Jose Canseco. The team then signed 24 more players to fill out its roster, each one an identical copy of Canseco. Fans were intrigued. Then, the owner moved the team south of the bay, to a city that had boomed over the past few decades, and he rebranded the team to something more fitting. Thus...


The [San Jose Cansecos](http://imgur.com/Z13Eh5m) are born!


Here is the team's lineup:


**LF: Jose Canseco 6'3 240 Lb; Havana, Cuba; Bats R Throws R**


**1B: Jose Canseco 6'3 240 Lb; Havana, Cuba; Bats R Throws R**


**RF: Jose ""The Original"" Canseco 6'3 240 Lb; Havana, Cuba; Bats R Throws R**


**CF: Jose Canseco 6'3 240 Lb; Havana, Cuba; Bats R Throws R**


**DH: Jose Canseco 6'3 240 Lb; Havana, Cuba; Bats R Throws R**


**C: Jose Canseco 6'3 240 Lb; Havana, Cuba; Bats R Throws R**


**2B: Jose Canseco 6'3 240 Lb; Havana, Cuba; Bats R Throws R**


**3B: Jose Canseco 6'3 240 Lb; Havana, Cuba; Bats R Throws R**


**SS: Jose Canseco 6'3 240 Lb; Havana, Cuba; Bats R Throws R**


I personally think the funniest thing about this team is Canseco's [personality rating](http://imgur.com/nuiooyC).


[Here](http://imgur.com/cWEAGsB) are the preseason predictions. The Cansecos are projected to go 4-158, winning twice as many games as the [Philadelphia Coke](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/484med/philadelphia_coke_a_team_of_25_phil_cokes_in_ootp/) did. The pitching, unsurprisingly, will be awful. However I would've thought the hitting would be much better than OOTP predicts. We are projected to hit nearly 100 more home runs than the next-best team, but we still won't score a ton of runs. I still think there will be a lot of high scoring games.


Let's get this season underway! Jose Canseco will be the opening day starter, as he hopes to improve on his 22.98 ERA from Spring Training.


**April:**


April has come and gone, and the Cansecos are 0-24. They rank [last](http://imgur.com/zqmj1nh) in every pitching category, but they're first in home runs and stole bases. The team's closer is the only pitcher who has pitched enough innings to qualify for the ERA title. He has pitched 24.1 innings, with a 31.07 ERA, 5.51 WHIP and -3.5 WAR. He has also struck out three batters. The original Jose sent me [this message](http://imgur.com/gCx0MIC). He is upset about the team chemistry and lack of leadership. He has also been the best player on the team.


**Biggest Loss:** 30-5 April 14th @ Seattle. The Mariners walked 17 times in this game, and Ken Phelps alone walked 5 times. Mickey Brantley drove in 7 runs. Our 5th starter Canseco gave up 8 runs in 2 innings, and the closer gave up 11 runs in an inning of work in the middle of the game. The team's DH had to come in to get the final out.


**Closest Loss:** 10-9 April 10th @ California. The Angels were down 9-4 going into the 8th, but they scored 3 runs in each the 8th and 9th to win the game. Our 2nd starter gave up 4 unearned runs in 2 innings, lowering his ERA to an almost respectable 5.08. It is currently a team leading 12.88. Our DH, LF, and SS all homered, but Wally Joyner's walk-off double lifted the Angels.


**May:**


The Cansecos drop to 0-52, 34 games out of first. The Red Sox have won 16 games in a row, with only 6 of those coming against us. Our closer still leads the team in innings pitched; he is on pace to post a -20.8 WAR. The pitching seems to have [improved](http://imgur.com/w8iVJXf) slightly, but the hitting is worse.


**Biggest Loss:** 30-5 May 31st vs New York. The Cansecos lost for the second time this season by this score. We made 6 errors, including 2 from 3B Jose Canseco. He is tied for the most in the league, with Cardinals 3B Terry Pendleton. Claudell Washington and Don Slaught each homered twice.


**Closest Loss:** 13-8 May 1st @ Cleveland. Yep, the closest game the team played in was a 5 run loss on the first of the month. The Tribe scored 6 in the first off of our ace Jose Canseco, but we responded, scoring 8 off of Rich Yett in 3 innings. Cleveland eventually pulled away, giving San Jose their first loss in a brutal month of May.


**June:**


The losses continue to pile up for San Jose, as they now fall to 0-79 on the season, 53.5 games behind the first place Twins. 3B Jose Canseco has been the team's best hitter, batting .283 with 20 homers, but he leads the majors with 34 errors. Speaking of fielding stats, Catcher Jose Canseco leads the MLB with 46 passed balls. In second place? The team's backup catcher with 25. Dave Valle of Seattle leads all non-Cansecos with 9. The original Canseco has been the league's third best RF by zone rating, but 5 of his teammates are in the top 7 in errors. On the bright side, we have turned the most double plays as a team in the league, presumably because of how many runners we allow to reach base.


We are dead last in tickets sold, but are 11th in merchandise sold. The original Canseco sent me [this message](http://imgur.com/8OAOioM) about disruptions in the clubhouse. It was kind of him not to name any names. The team's backup SS Jose Canseco leads all pitchers with 15 strikeouts. He has pitched in mop-up duty in 14 games, posting a 9.74 ERA.


**Biggest Loss:** 38-2 June 19th vs Texas. The Rangers never took their foot off the gas, scoring 11 in the 7th and 10 in the 8th to blow out the Cansecos. 40-year-old Charlie Hough pitched a complete game, and Canseco pitchers walked 22 Texas batters. Closer Jose Canseco allowed 13 earned runs in the 7th and 8th, and 13 pitchers took the mound, including 4 position players.


**Closest Loss:** 3-0 June 26th vs Minnesota. This was the first time the Cansecos were shut out all season. There's not much to say about this one, other than the fact that it was the first game of a doubleheader. The Twins won game 2 26-5.


**July:**


It was another winless month for the now 0-105 Cansecos. The team is still first in home runs and stolen bases, and 5th in runs scored, but they are last by a mile in every pitching category. 3B Jose Canseco was selected to the All Star Game after batting .283 with 26 home runs. He played right field in the game and went 1-3.


Each player celebrated his 24th birthday on July 2nd. They celebrated with a 17-8 loss in Toronto.


**Biggest Loss:** 38-12 July 6th @ Cleveland. Ron Kittle hit 2 home runs, and Joe Carter went 5-6. Closer Jose Canseco, still the only Canseco qualified for the ERA title, gave up 16 runs in 1.1 innings of work. His ERA is 31.29, and his WAR is -13.8. His WHIP is 5.38. Only 3 other starters have ERAs higher than Canseco's WHIP: Oil Can Boyd, Rod Nichols, and future Padres manager Bud Black.


**Closest Loss:** 21-16 July 4th @ Cleveland. This one comes from the same series. The Cansecos scored 8 runs off of Cleveland starter and future Boston manager John Farrell. The team homered 7 times, with CF Canseco hitting 2 and going 5-6. However, Cleveland scored 9 runs in the 8th, all off of closer Jose Canseco, to pull away.


**August:**


They finally won one! The San Jose Cansecos broke through in August, and now sit at a modest 1-133, 82 games out of first. 3B Canseco is 3rd in the majors in home runs and putting up an impressive season at the plate, despite his MLB-leading 51 errors.


**Biggest Loss:** 56-5 August 29th vs Boston. 11,372 fans showed up in San Jose to watch their beloved Cansecos get thrashed by 51 runs against the Red Sox in a game that lasted nearly 5 hours. Jim Rice went 5-6 before mercifully being pulled. Dwight Evans went 3-4 with 7 walks. Ellis Burks went 4-6 with 4 walks, and was a triple shy of the cycle. His OBP against us this season is .671! ""They licked us pretty good"" said manager Jose Canseco.


**The Big Win:** 13-9 August 16th vs California. We won! We won! The 117-game losing streak is over! Dave Stewart, released by San Jose to make room for a Canseco, and the California Angels are the victims. Closer Jose Canseco blew the save in the 8th and allowed 5 more in the 9th, but was bailed out and picked up the win after the Cansecos scored 9 in the bottom of the 8th. It is ironic in a way, as his -18.0 WAR and 20.5 BB/9 are league worsts. His ERA is 27.83, and including unearned runs, it would be 47.30. I'll include a list of stats at the end.


**SEASON END:**


What a month it was! The Fightin Cansecos won not one, not two, but three whole games in September! They finish the season at a respectable 4-158, only 98 games out of first.


**Biggest Loss:** 24-1 September 25th @ Milwaukee. #1 starter Jose Canseco gave up 11 runs in 2 innings. 3 relievers came in to pitch. Dale Sveum homered twice, and BJ Surhoff hit two doubles. I also learned that Gary Sheffield began his career with the Brewers.


**Biggest Win:** We won **3** times this month, so I think you deserve to hear briefly about all of them.


The team's second win of the season came in a 7-4 win against the Royals on September 10th. #1 starter Jose Canseco pitched 5.2 innings, allowing only 2 runs and 5 hits, and improving to 1-23. CF Canseco homered twice, raising his total to 25 on the season. Bret Saberhagen was the losing pitcher.


Win #3 came only 4 days later against the Rangers. They won in a 10-9 slugfest, and reliever Jose Canseco got the win, a bright spot in a 15.28 ERA, -5.4 WAR season. Charlie Hough, who had pitched a complete game earlier in the season, got the loss, allowing 7 in 3 innings. 3B Jose Canseco hit his 33rd and 34th home runs, and he would finish with 38. No Canseco hit the 42 homers that he hit in real life in 1988.


The 4th and final win came on September 30th against Milwaukee in a 3-2 victory. #1 starter Jose Canseco pitched 5.2 shutout innings, picking up his second win of the season to finish at 2-25. Closer Jose Canseco picked up the save, pitching a shutout inning. His ERA peaked at 34.07 in July, but it was now down to a much better 27.52. Future Cubs pitching coach Chris Bosio got the loss for Milwaukee, but he is still one of the leading candidates for Cy Young despite this humiliating line.


And so it ends. A team of 25 Jose Cansecos would be really bad. Their pitching would be godawful, and their hitting would be average, brought down by the absolutely terrible team chemistry. 22 Cansecos are ""angry"", while the other 3 are merely ""very unhappy."" They would still hit a lot of home runs though.


[Here](http://imgur.com/eoXjRWS) are the pitching stats, and [here](http://imgur.com/fM1qmj7) are the hitting stats. The team's best hitter was 3B Jose Canseco, who hit .292 with 38 home runs. His WAR was only 2.0, however, because he led the league with 54 errors. In fact, the top 3 and 6 of the top 9 in errors were Cansecos. The other two were LF Jose Canseco and RF Jose ""The Original"" Canseco. They both won Gold Gloves. The catcher, first baseman, and third baseman all won Silver Slugger awards.

Christine_Stawitz,2016-11-20 18:42:37+00:00,"Science AMA Series: I'm Christine Stawitz, a PhD candidate at the University of Washington, Seattle, I recently published a study that found up to 30 percent of seafood served in restaurants and sold in supermarkets is actually something else, AMA!","Thanks all for the great questions. The full manuscript is now online: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12328/full

I'm Christine Stawitz, and I study fishery management and population dynamics at the University of Washington. (More about that at: http://students.washington.edu/cstawitz/)

I'd like to talk about a recent publication of mine, ""[Financial and Ecological Implications of Global Seafood Mislabeling](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12328/full)"", in which I, with my co-authors, try to quantify how seafood mislabeling affects the conservation status and value of finfish seafood that people consume. In this study, we found that substituted seafoods were of slightly lower value (-2.98% ex-vessel price), but of a slightly higher conservation status (+9.51% IUCN status) than items they were labeled as. However, there's a lot of heterogeneity across types of finfish. For example, items substituted for skipjack tuna and dolphinfish are actually of higher value than these fish themselves. This suggests mislabeling has benefits for consumers, financially. In contrast, items substituted for red snapper, hake, eel, smooth-hound shark, and croaker are of lower conservation status than the items themselves. I've noticed [the paper getting a lot of attention on r/science](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5clxou/up_to_30_of_all_seafood_sold_in_markets_and/) and want to clear up some of the detail of the findings.

IEatDrugsButPukeIDK,2016-11-07 23:02:26+00:00,Shrooms changed my entire life.,"I was 22 years old. I was working at Burger King and living in my moms basement. Any free time I had was usually filled with smoking weed and playing video games. I didn't own a car so anywhere I went I had to borrow my parents or have them drop me off. 

It was December. My friends in high school had graduated in May of that year and walked in June. Around this time they all started getting big boy jobs and moving away from our shitty town. Of course none of that mattered because none of them hung out with me anymore. Once they saw I wasn't going anywhere in my life, they stopped inviting me out and ignored my text messages and calls. My current friends were all like me; losers.

A week before I took the shrooms was probably my lowest point. I found out my best friend in high school(Who doesn't talk to me anymore) got a software engineer job out in Seattle making a great salary. While I was over here trying to find a job that would pay me $9/hour or more and work me more than 20 hours a week.

I was alone and lost. I had no direction in life and didn't know where to start. I was a goldfish in this ocean we call life and I was surrounded by sharks. Very hungry sharks. 

Until one night when I went to pick up a couple grams of bud my dealer just so happened to have shrooms, something my town never had. Of course I jump on them and buy an eighth. This made my night a little better. I didn't know much about shrooms at the time besides that they ""fucked you up"" and made you see shit. Little did I know I was in for a wild night.

When I got home it was already dark. I rolled a couple joints and smoked one while I was eating the shrooms(The entire eighth). I had no idea what to expect so my heart was beating a little fast and I caught myself pacing around the room so I decided to go for a walk to the park. 

The first hour of the trip was spent playing in the snow, giggling the entire time, and tripping my balls off. I felt like I was 8 years old again. The only worry in the world was just to have as much fun as possible. Nothing else mattered.

I remember falling in the snow and looking up at the sky. The stars were so bright and felt so close that I felt like I was pressing my face on glass while watching a astronomy documentary. It was so amazing. I kept trying to grab at the stars and every time I came up emptied handed I would get so confused. I eventually got out of the trance and ended up walking home. 

When I got home I decided to call my friend and congratulate him on the job and just to see how he was. I didn't expect an answer but even if he didn't answer I would leave him a message so I called and to my surprise he actually answered. 

We ended up talking for the rest of my entire trip and things were just beautiful. We re-connected like we had never fell out of friendship before. I cried on the phone and confined in him about my life and everything that went wrong with it. I laughed harder than I laughed in months. 

During the call I was tripping balls. It was a very intense experience but it was so indescribable. It was just pure bliss. At the end of the call I was coming down quite a bit and everything just kind of pieced itself together. There were options and ways and help and everything I needed to get my life on track. I was just too prideful to go for them. I felt like it was college or nothing but in reality that was the opposite of what life is. College is ONE OPTION out of thousands! In my head thoughts were just connecting like puzzle pieces and all I knew was that I needed to throw my pride away and realize that I couldn't do this on my own. I needed help.

The very next day I went into a electricians union that was about a 30 minute drive from me and got an apprenticeship. It started 2-3 months later but I took the test and passed with flying colors and I was accepted a couple weeks before the program started.

That was almost 9 years ago.

Today I own my own commercial and residential electrical company, I own my own house, I own my own car, I have a wife and 2 kids, and life is looking great! Me and my best friend from high school hang out regularly and our families actually went on vacation together this year.

I don't know where my life would have gone had I not done shrooms that night but I don't think I would have been too far from my parents basement.

It was a rough ride up but once you find the path, at least there's direction. ",Drugs,2046

**[Week 8 Quick Thoughts]( https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/59j8n6/quick_thoughts_on_every_week_8_game/)**

In response to some feedback last week, I’ve made a greater effort to give more context to each defensive matchup. Hopefully this leads to a better product and more accurate advice!

----

##**Falcons @ Buccaneers**

•	**Matt Ryan** will be a top QB1 against a Buccaneers defense that has given up 300+ passing yards to every competent quarterback they have faced, including Ryan himself back in week 1. Tampa Bay is giving up big games to just about every WR they face, so you can fire **Julio Jones** up safely as a WR1. **Mohamed Sanu** has been up and down in terms of targets, but against this defense he’ll make a good boom or bust flex. The Bucs have not been awful against the run, allowing not a single 100 yard rusher and boasting the 5th fewest RB receptions allowed on the season. **Tevin Coleman** is likely to miss another game with a hamstring injury, however, and so based on volume, talent and red zone carries **Devonta Freeman** will be a strong RB1 play. **Austin Hooper** is a viable TE streamer against a poor defense. He'll have increased opportunity with **Jacob Tamme** out.

•	**Jameis Winston**threw for 281 yards and four touchdowns in week 1 against the Falcons on the road. While he may not reach such lofty heights this week, there is plenty of reason to be optimistic about a strong QB1 performance from Winston. **Mike Evans** is an every week WR1 against a defense that has allowed several strong weeks to WR1s including Jordy Nelson, Tyrell Williams, and Evans himself. **Cameron Brate** has target numbers of 3, 3, and 5 in the last three games which is the bad news. The good news is that the Falcons have given up 5 touchdowns to tight ends, 4th most in the league, and Brate is used quite a bit in the red zone. Brate will be a TD dependent TE1 streamer. With **Jacquizz Rodgers** going down to a foot injury, Tampa is down to its 4th starting RB. **Antone Smith** out snapped and out touched **Peyton Barber**, suggesting Smith could lead the backfield on TNF. Atlanta has allowed a middling number of rushing yards; it is through the air that RBs are killing them. They’ve allowed the most receiving yards (476) to running backs on the season. I’m not confident in either Smith or Barber in the passing game, so the outlook is not as bright as it seems. Still, I expect plenty of red zone opportunities in this shootout. As of now Smith is the preferred RB3 based on last week’s usage, but this situation is very uncertain; Barber flashed a lot more potential in Week 7 and he is the more talented back in my opinion. The addition of **Mike James** to the committee only serves to muddy things further. Keep an eye on the situation as the week progresses.

##**Eagles @ Giants**

•	**Carson Wentz** faces a challenge in the New York Giants’ defense which has not allowed a standout performance to any QB despite facing Aaron Rodgers and Drew Brees; the Giants’ defense is allowing an average of 1 passing TD per game. Wentz will be a mid to low end QB2. The Giants have allowed solid PPR performances to slot receivers Cole Beasley, Willie Snead, Jamison Crowder and Randall Cobb. Next up, **Jordan Matthews**, who is coming off of a resurgent 14 target game – fire Matthews up as a WR2. The Giants are middling against the run, and displayed some vulnerability to pass catching backs in weeks 6 and 7 when facing Terrance West (4 catches, 36 yards) and Todd Gurley (6 catches, 35 yards). Therefore, I’d expect another strong game from **Darren Sproles**, who out touched supposed starter **Ryan Mathews** 20 to 4 last week. Mathews kept himself from the void with a goal line TD, but playing just 10% of snaps, he cannot be trusted in any lineups. Sproles will be a low end RB2 with extra appeal in PPR. 

•	**Eli Manning** has not been great this season, he hasn’t even been good. With only one top-12 performance under his belt, he can’t be trusted in 1 QB leagues this week against one of the league’s top defenses. If you’re in a 2 QB league, however, there is some reason to hope. The Giants’ are coming off a bye where their offensive struggles had to have been the focus. If they have sorted those out, Eli could get back on track. Rookie Dak Prescott did just manhandle this defense in the second half of Sunday Night Football, after all. The Eagles are good, but far from a shut down defense for wide receivers; Antonio Brown did great against them, and many other WRs, most recently Dez Bryant, have had solid to good fantasy performances against them. **Odell Beckham’s** performance is tied to Manning’s and the offenses in general, but I believe he will turn in a solid WR1 performance as the Giants try to get their offense back on track by involving their best player. **Sterling Shepard** is getting WR2 targets but has not been turning them into WR2 numbers; he is a desperation flex in this matchup, same as **Victor Cruz**.  The running game is a bit of a mystery coming out of the bye, with **Rashad Jennings** increasingly inefficient it has been speculated that dynamic rookie **Paul Perkins** may get more involved. Jennings will be an RB3 with a chance to score at the goal line. Perkins isn’t startable yet but he is my recommended stash of the week for those hurting at RB.

##**Lions @ Vikings**

•	Minnesota is coming off of one of their poorest showings defensively, but I’m still not comfortable starting **Matthew Stafford** as anything more than a QB2 against the Vikings at home – on the season they have been very, very solid at shutting down opposing passing games. For the time being at least, **Golden Tate** has surpassed **Marvin Jones** in terms of targets. I’m not sure who Xavier Rhodes will be covering, though my guess would be Marvin Jones. If that is the case, Jones will be a low end WR3 this week. Tate will be a stronger WR3 start, but keep your ear to the ground for news on who Rhodes will be lining up against. **Theo Riddick** is an every week PPR RB2 – I’m not worried about the matchup, as teams have had some success chucking passes to their RBs out of the backfield against Minnesota (see: Bobby Rainey, Fozzy Whittaker, Paul Perkins (one big play)). **Eric Ebron** returned to an immediately solid workload of 10 targets and should be grabbed and used as a TE1 in a middling matchup for his position – with the WRs overwhelmed, Stafford might look to him more often as an outlet, and he’s always a threat in the red zone if the Lions can get there.

•	**Sam Bradford** will be on the streaming radar against the Lions’ league worst QB defense; that stat is padded by bouts against Andrew Luck and Aaron Rodgers, but this defense also vaulted the likes of Case Keenum to QB1 status. If you’re in need at QB this week, Bradford should be able to turn in low end QB1 numbers. The Vikings’ finally got a clue and fed their best offensive player, **Stefon Diggs**, 13 targets on Monday Night Football. The Lions’ have not been able to limit any teams’ receivers aside from the Osweiler-led Texans – call that an outlier. Diggs is in the WR2 discussion. **Adam Thielen** will be a boom or bust flex for the truly desperate; the matchup gives him some upside but the floor is rock bottom if things don’t work out. **Kyle Rudolph** was quiet last week but you’re going to want to start him again; the Lions’ are getting absolutely wrecked by tight ends, allowing strong performances to the likes of Jack Doyle, Lance Kendricks, Vernon Davis and CJ Fiedorowicz. Rudolph is a firm TE1. If **Matt Asiata** continues to get the backfield to himself then I like him as a solid RB2 in this matchup where goal line chances should be more plentiful. If McKinnon returns then his floor is lowered, but his ceiling remains high. **Jerick McKinnon** would be a tough to trust RB3 coming off an injury in an uncertain timeshare, though I remain a truther.

##**Steelers @ Ravens**

•	**Ben Roethlisberger** has some nasty home/road splits and is coming off of knee surgery. My suggestion? If you had a solid backup filling in for Big Ben last week, roll with them for one more week, just to be safe. With Ben back, **Antonio Brown** is a top WR1 play (as if that was ever in doubt) against a Baltimore defense giving up huge games to WRs all season. Baltimore shows up on paper as the 6th best fantasy run defense, but they have faced very little talent so far. LeSean McCoy, Isaiah Crowell, and Matt Forte all had solid games against them. **LeVeon Bell** should have no trouble at all – he’s an RB1. With Ben back, **Sammie Coates** is back on the flex radar against a Baltimore defense that is giving up big plays, Coates’ specialty. **Ladarius Green** will be activated soon; he may be a vital tool for the Steelers’ who have historically used their TE often, and are still looking to fill the WR2 void left by Martavis Bryant. Stash him if you’re desperate at the position.

•	The passing volume has been there for **Joe Flacco**, averaging 44 pass attempts per game, but the touchdowns have not, with only 5 through 7 games. With this much passing volume, positive TD regression has to be coming. If you need a streamer this week, or a solid QB2, you could do a lot worse than Flacco at home this week. **Mike Wallace** is quietly having a great season – with 33 targets through his last 4 games, he is getting great volume with **Steve Smith** hampered by injury. The Steelers are a tough on-paper matchup for WRs, but have given up plenty of solid performances to teams’ WR1s; with this kind of volume, Wallace is a low end WR2. **Terrance West** is coming off a dude week, but to his credit it was the stout Jets’ run defense. The good news is that no other RB got significant work so his job seems secure for now. **Kenneth Dixon** is worth a stash if you have the room but reports that he will get more involved should be taken with a grain of salt; West is working and things will not significantly change anytime soon, pending an injury or a disastrous performance. The Steelers’ run defense is struggling, yielding huge games to Ajayi and Blount prior to the bye. With little competition in the backfield, West is a solid RB2 in this matchup. **Dennis Pitta** has greater than 8 targets in 5 of 7 games, so the volume is there, and it’s a plus matchup against a defense that has given up good games to big name and no name tight ends alike – he’s a TE1.

##**Cowboys @ Browns**

•	With Cleveland giving up good to great games to every QB it has faced thus far, **Dak Prescott** will be firmly on the QB1 radar this week; stream him if you’re in need. The Browns’ defense has been no better against WRs, and I expect big things from **Dez Bryant** who received an uncharacteristic 14 targets last week. There is plenty of big play potential against the Browns and I like Bryant as a WR1. **Cole Beasley** was hindered but not erased by Bryant’s return. I don’t expect the target split of 14:7 for Bryant:Beasley to continue, I imagine it will even out somewhat. Beasley is still a strong WR3/flex, particularly in PPR formats. Obviously the Browns have not been strong against the run either and **Ezekiel Elliott** will be an elite RB1 in this one. **Jason Witten** is worthy of streamer consideration in this matchup against the league’s worst fantasy TE defense; they’re obviously vulnerable to the position and Dak will take advantage of that.

•	It is unclear who will start for the Browns’ at QB as of this writing, but it will be either **Josh McCown** or **Cody Kessler**. The fantasy world crosses its fingers for McCown. McCown will be in the low end QB1 discussion against Dallas. Kessler would be a low to mid QB2. **Terrelle Pryor** would be a strong WR2 start either way as the team’s primary target. **Corey Coleman** returns from his hand injury as an immediate WR3 plug in – he displayed serious talent in his second game in Baltimore. **Isaiah Crowell** will have a limited ceiling against the Cowboys’ tough run defense, but his rushing floor has been fairly safe all season, and he has dominated in the red zone. I’d say he’s a high RB3, low RB2 for the week. **Duke Johnson** has a bleak outlook, as the Cowboys have been pretty good against receiving backs so far this season – he’s a low end flex. **Gary Barnidge** will be in a good spot against a Cowboys’ defense that has been vulnerable to tight ends – Josh McCown being under center would further improve his outlook. Barnidge will be a good low end TE1 streaming option.

##**Jaguars @ Chiefs**

•	**Blake Bortles** is playing dreadfully, but is racking up garbage time points in certain contests which get out of hand early. Relying on garbage time production is a fluky practice, as not all game scripts allow for it. Bortles is a fine QB2 but I’d look to stream in 1 QB leagues. **Allen Robinson** is suffering from the bad mechanics of his quarterback, but is receiving a heavy workload (15 targets last week). This week Robinson will be a WR2 against the Chiefs’ defense which has been giving up huge games to WRs all season. If Bortles can improve his throwing technique, Robinson will be back in the season long WR2 discussion. **Allen Hurns** is receiving a very solid workload himself, and should also benefit from the plus matchup; fire him up as a strong WR3/Flex. The Chiefs are some of the best in the league at halting the TE position so **Julius Thomas** will not be a viable TE play this week. The Jags’ running game is truly putrid because they are never winning. **TJ Yeldon** has some flex value in PPR leagues as the primary passing down back but that’s about it. **Chris Ivory** is more of an RB4.

•	**Alex Smith** is in the concussion protocol, so **Nick Foles** will step up and start. He will not be a viable QB2. If **Spencer Ware** can be cleared from the concussion protocol he will be an RB1 in this game; the Jags’ are middle of the pack against the run on paper but they have given up solid games to every talented RB they have faced. If Ware can’t go, **Charcandrick West** will be a solid RB2. **Jeremy Maclin** got more involved last week, catching a TD from Alex Smith, but he only managed 3 catches on 10 targets. This matchup is a good one, and Foles gave him a slight bump in target share, so Maclin is in the upside WR3 department. Jaguars’ are ranked 5th against fantasy tight ends, but the only TEs of note they have faced thus far are Walker and Pitta who were able to turn in low end TE1 performances. **Travis Kelce** will be a mid-range TE1.

##**Jets @ Dolphins**

•	The Dolphins’ defense does not pose an especially great challenge, but **Ryan Fitzpatrick** has not been a startable QB in 1QB leagues since Week 2. That’s not someone I want to bet on as anything more than a low end QB2. This defense just allowed a 93 yard, 1 TD game to Marquise Goodwin, so I have faith that **Brandon Marshall** can turn in a good WR2 day. **Quincy Enunwa** keeps making big plays and it has apparently earned him a larger target share, with 11 targets last week. I honestly see him as a low end WR2 as well, with a potentially lower floor if for some reason the targets start going back the other way. **Matt Forte** has another two weeks’ worth of workhorse usage under his belt, and he has not disappointed with two strong RB1 finishes. We cannot simply forget, however, the split that formed with **Bilal Powell** in weeks 3 through 6. Forte is best treated as an RB2. Powell is an upside flex in PPR formats. 

•	The Jets are allowing the most passing yards in the league, so **Ryan Tannehill** is firmly on the streaming radar as a low end QB1. His WRs will also benefit heavily from the plus matchup. **Jarvis Landry** should be a high end WR2. **Kenny Stills** will be a not so bad flex play. **DeVante Parker** is a punt flex play, but there’s certainly upside for the deep threat – just keep his low floor in mind. The Jets are very strong against the running game, allowing the fourth fewest rushing yards in the league, but pass catching RBs can still do well against them. Add the fact that **Jay Ajayi** is playing out of his mind, is coming off a bye, and has no **Arian Foster** to compete with for pass catching duties and Ajayi can comfortably be started as a high RB2/low RB1.

##**Saints @ 49ers**

•	**Drew Brees** is away from home, which you ordinarily never like to see, but this week we’ll make an exception. They’re giving up an average of 230 passing yards and 2.14 passing TDs per game, and face a decidedly above average QB in Brees. He’ll be a QB1. San Francisco is a fairly generous defense across the board for all positions, particularly RB, a position to which they’ve granted 1139 rushing yards, the worst in the league. **Mark Ingram** was unceremoniously benched last week for a fumble, replaced by **Tim Hightower**. It is clear that at best for Ingram, this is now a committee. At worst, he is Hightower’s backup. I’ll choose to believe head coach Payton when he says Ingram still has a significant role. In that case, against this putrid defense, Ingram and Hightower are both high upside plays. I would put them both in the category of low end RB2, and that’s only because of their uncertain workloads. If we get any clarity, you can upgrade the beneficiary. **Brandin Cooks**, **Michael Thomas** and **Willie Snead** are all strong starts against this very bad 49ers defense. Their targets have been all over the place based on who is open. I would rank them Cooks &gt; Thomas &gt; Snead, which not-so-coincidentally correlates with their TDs on the season (5, 3 and 2 respectively) – red zone usage is big in differentiating these receivers. **Coby Fleener** is a boom or bust TE who has had his only two big games at home. He has also seen his snaps decrease precipitously from 77% five games ago to 34% last week. **Josh Hill** may be taking over. In an away game, with so many other mouths to feed around him, Fleener’s tough to trust.

•	**Colin Kaepernick** gets a prime matchup against the Saints defense. His high rushing floor combined with the matchup should get him a high end QB2 performance.  What can really be said about the 49ers’ receivers? I wouldn’t start any of them. But if you’re desperate, **Torrey Smith** could catch a long touchdown like he did in week 6, making him a viable boom or bust flex. **Jeremy Kerley** has been a no-show since **Blaine Gabbert** was benched. **Carlos Hyde** should be back from injury and is a legitimate RB1 against the Saints’ awful run defense. **DuJuan Harris** would be the back to own and use as a plug and play RB2 if Hyde is ruled out.

##**Panthers @ Rams**

•	**Cam Newton** should have no trouble putting up a high end QB1 performance against this defense, which has had success against bad/struggling QBs (Gabbert, Wilson, Palmer, Manning) but which has been lit up by good QBs (Winston, Stafford). Los Angeles has faced a series of horrendous tight ends which has inflated their stats against the position – in fact Cameron Brate, the only TE they’ve faced to receive more than 5 targets, lit them up, so the elite **Greg Olsen** should have no trouble at all putting up TE1 numbers. **Kelvin Benjamin** can also be used as a strong WR2 against a weak passing defense – his targets should rise again from Week 8’s paltry 5. **Jonathan Stewart** is a firm RB2 despite the tough on-paper matchup – Cam post-concussion is not doing his usual red zone heroics, leading to more goal line TDs for Stewart. 

•	**Case Keenum** has at least demonstrated he can put up solid performances in the right matchup (see: Detroit) so I’m projecting a high end QB2 finish for him, worthy of streaming consideration for those in need. **Tavon Austin** has received 8+ targets in 5 of 7 games, which is significant. Anyone receiving that kind of target load is worthy of flex consideration – against this struggling secondary, Austin is worthy of your WR3/Flex spot.  **Kenny Britt** is also in the flex discussion, again because of the matchup, but he is lower down the totem than Austin. Britt left us hanging before the bye, but prior to that dud he was on a 3 game hot streak. He could get going again now post-bye. **Todd Gurley** faces a rather tough Carolina run defense that limited David Johnson to just 24 yards on the ground last week – Gurley has been getting more involved in the passing game though, which helped save DJ, so I still like him as an RB2 this week. **Lance Kendricks** is a high TE2/low TE1 play this week just because the Panthers have been so bad against tight ends, and they haven’t even faced any exceptional talent. Kendricks is coming off a two game streak with 8+ targets so the precedent for his success is there.

##**Titans @ Chargers**

•	**Marcus Mariota** is on a great 4 game streak, and the San Diego Chargers have not been great this season, but look closer and see that they have held their last two opponents to 1 passing touchdown and 2 INTs combined. One of those opponents was Matt Ryan. I think Mariota is a low end QB1 for the week. **DeMarco Murray** is obviously in line for a huge week against a run defense that has allowed 10 rushing TDs, the second most in the league. Monitor his health, but it sounds like his toe injury is nothing serious. Handcuff **Derick Henry** needs to be owned everywhere. **Rishard Matthews** and **Kendall Wright** are about even with each other in the Titans’ passing game; neither has a standout target share, and both are catching touchdowns. With low targets there’s always a chance for a bust, but I’m comfortable with either as a WR3/Flex. **Delanie Walker** is seeing his targets divided among the aforementioned wide receivers, but he’s still a TE1 based on his talent and red zone potential.

•	**Philip Rivers** has faced Denver twice in three weeks, which has been tough, but he’s putting that tough stretch behind him now. Rivers has been better at home so far this season, and the Titans have given up QB1 performances in their last 3 games to Kessler, Luck and Garbage King Bortles. I’m penciling in Rivers for low end QB1 production. If **Travis Benjamin** misses time with his PCL injury, **Tyrell Williams** will be a locked in WR2 on volume alone. If both play, they’re both more WR3 types. **Melvin Gordon** faces a seriously tough run defense this week which will limit his yardage, but he’s always a safe bet for a score in some fashion – his elite red zone usage keeps him in the RB2 range, and it helps that he displayed serious talent as a runner against a tough Denver D last week. **Hunter Henry** lost serious playing time and targets to **Antonio Gates** last week, suggesting that once again SD will go with their immortal veteran over their young talent for as long as they can. Gates will be the TE to own in this plus matchup, and is worth starting as a TE1. Henry can be stashed in case injuries once again catch up with Gates.

##**Colts @ Packers**

•	The Packers have really only “limited” one QB, Brian Hoyer, who broke his arm early in the game. I have no worries about **Andrew Luck** as a QB1 this week – so far, he is having his best year yet. **TY Hilton** had his targets dip due to a hamstring injury that limited him during the game, and probably also partly due to the return of **Donte Moncrief** to the lineup. This game has shootout potential written all over it and I’d expect a lot of passing plays thanks to Green Bay’s solid run defense. Hilton is a borderline WR1 and Moncrief is a strong WR2. **Frank Gore** will have a tough go of it against Green Bay’s run defense which held Devonta Freeman to just 35 yards on the ground, and everyone else (besides Ezekiel Elliott) to under 50. Gore is not enough of a pass catcher to save his floor here, but his potential for a goal line TD in this shooutout does. He’s a boom or bust, TD dependent RB2 play – insert safer, higher floor options if you have them, and don’t expect much yardage. **Jack Doyle** felt the presence of Moncrief the hardest, his targets dropping back down to three last week. However, part of that was Kansas City’s elite TE defense and I think Doyle bounces back as a TE1 – the matchup is okay, the game is a shootout, and Doyle already has 4 TD passes on the year – he’s a definite red zone threat. However, if **Dwayne Allen** returns to the field (he practiced on Wednesday) Doyle will be a mere TE2.

•	**Aaron Rodgers** will also be a strong QB1 play in this likely shootout against this defense which just gave up two touchdown passes to Nick Foles. Nick Foles!!! The Colts’ secondary is allowing 288 passing yards per game, and **Davante Adams**, **Jordy Nelson** and **Randall Cobb** should be the biggest beneficiaries. Adams has been a target monster over the last two games, which should settle down with Cobb returning, but perhaps not by much. Cobb is coming off a hamstring injury and thus may see his reps managed. Jordy is obviously a red zone favorite and a threat to score each week, but I’ll take the volume of Adams over him for now. Both are in the high end WR2 discussion for the week, while Cobb is a riskier WR3 bet coming off his injury. It seems clear that until **James Starks** returns, **Ty Montgomery** will be the “running back” for the Packers, so fire him up as a strong WR2 option in PPR leagues, and a good WR3 in standard. Now might be a good time for RB desperate teams to stash Starks – **Knile Davis** (waived) and **Don Jackson** obviously haven’t worked out.

##**Broncos @ Raiders**

•	**Trevor Siemian** gets a good matchup against the Raiders paltry defense, but his play has been so poor over the last four games from a fantasy perspective it will be impossible to trust him as more than a QB2. I do love the outlook for his receivers, **Demaryius Thomas** and **Emmanuel Sanders**, whose roles are truly interchangeable. Both are strong WR2s this week. **Devontae Booker** is the workhorse in this backfield now, and this defense will pose no problems for him – consider him a strong RB1 play. **Virgil Green** is starting to get more involved, receiving 6 targets last week. If you need a punt play at TE in a deep league, this is a good matchup for him.

•	**Derek Carr** had an excellent performance last week, but that was Tampa Bay. This is Denver. Denver, which has limited every QB it has faced to a subpar fantasy performance, barring only Cam Newton in week 1. Those other QBs? Luck, Dalton, Winston, Ryan, and Rivers (twice). Oh, and Brock Lobster, but nobody is impressed by that. I don’t think Carr is any better or worse than those guys. So I’m expecting a floor, QB2 type of game from him. Denver has also completely shut down opposing wide receivers, allowing the fewest yards (only 759!) in the entire league. **Amari Cooper** and **Michael Crabtree**, as good as they are, will just be floor-based WR3s against this elite defense. One thing Denver has not shut down this season is opposing run games, so **Latavius Murray** is still in the low end RB2 discussion. Though he is clearly leading it, he is still in a committee, which limits his upside.

##**Bills @ Seahawks**

•	What an ugly, nasty, no-good game for Monday Night Football. I’ll be sleeping through this one. Anyhow, **Tyrod Taylor** has been a remarkably productive QB without **Sammy Watkins** in the lineup. His rushing ability has been a big help in that regard. The Seahawks defense has been tough against QBs on-paper, but has really only faced two good QBs, Matt Ryan and Drew Brees, and they did well and had QB1 days against them. Tyrod isn’t as good as them, but he isn’t as bad as the other QBs the Seahawks have dominated, so I’ll hedge my bets and say Tyrod has a high floor, low ceiling, high end QB2 type of day. He won’t lose your matchup, but he won’t win it for you either. I’m not endorsing the start of any Bills’ WRs against the Seahawks – none are receiving enough targets, or have enough talent, to stand out as a startable flex. If **LeSean McCoy** can play, he’ll be a solid RB2 against a Seahawks defense which is tough on paper, but that just gave up over 100 yards rushing to Tim Hightower. If McCoy can’t go, **Mike Gillislee** will be on the RB2 spectrum as well.

•	**Russell Wilson** is a disaster for his owners. He hasn’t scored a touchdown since Week 4. Maybe his mobility will improve once his knee brace comes off, maybe that will help. I need to see it first. Wilson is a lower end QB2 until he proves otherwise. Buffalo hasn’t exactly been friendly to opposing QBs not named Brady anyways. **Doug Baldwin** is languishing under Wilson’s struggles and is just a WR3 until the offense improves. The matchup looks tougher for **Jimmy Graham** than it really is, because Buffalo has faced such meager TE competition outside of Gronk and Martellus Bennett. Graham should be used a low end TE1, who is also suffering from Wilson syndrome. The Awakening might be coming to an end in Seattle, as **Christine Michael** is losing snaps and opportunities to rookie **CJ Prosise**, the team’s new pass catching pack. **Thomas Rawls** is also fast approaching. Michael will be an RB2 against Buffalo, and owners should consider selling high. Prosise is not yet startable.

JaguarGator9,2016-10-20 18:56:05+00:00,"[OC] In 1993, the NFL experimented with an 18 week schedule consisting of 2 bye weeks. Here's why it failed, and here's how the league can implement such a system today.","When the CBA expires and negotiations take place in a few years (and the inevitable lockout happens), one of the hot topics is going to be the 18-game schedule, expanding the regular season by 2 games. There’s been enough debate over that topic, and generally, most fans consider that to be a bad idea. It increases the risk for injuries, the players would never agree to it, it dilutes the regular season and the record book, teams would get tired and fatigue would come into play during the postseason… you get the idea.

However, one thing that is somewhat being talked about is not an 18-game schedule, but rather, an 18-week schedule, where each team still plays 16 games, but receives 2 bye weeks. Let’s say you cut one week off of the preseason and have each team play 16 games but receive 2 bye weeks instead of receiving just one. What could possibly be the downside of a 2-bye week system?

Well, the NFL tried a 2-bye week system in 1993. And it failed. Miserably.

Now that’s not to say that a 2-bye week system today can’t work. Times have changed. In the rough quarter century or so since 1993, Sunday Ticket and RedZone were created, primetime football on Thursday is a regular thing, and the Patriots went from being the laughingstock of the NFL to the most hated team in American sports (and we let that happen). Was the 2-bye week system just a bad idea that should never be implemented again, or was it a system that failed due to poor execution and the times not allowing for it to be good? Well, let’s take a look.

**Overview**

Oddly enough, I couldn’t find too many articles from 1993 about the change. Most of the things I could find were retrospective. You know how you can find lots of articles today criticizing the NFL for a rule? Couldn’t find any from 1993 on the 18-week system, which is odd, because it was hailed as a unanimous disaster. I could find [one sentence from 1993 which outlined the rule change](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-03-22/sports/1993081079_1_bailey-nfl-meetings-new-york-giants), which stated this:

&gt; As expected, the owners formally decided to play 16 games over 18 weeks this fall, giving each team two byes and cutting the time between the conference championship games and the Super Bowl from two weeks to one.

You have to remember what the NFL just did a few years ago when they expanded the schedule from 16 weeks to 17 weeks in 1990. It worked. It was a success. So, the league decided to push the envelope and get a bit greedy by making it 18 weeks, giving each team two bye weeks. The logic, according to Wikipedia, was twofold. Number one, if the schedule was 17 weeks, then the postseason games would’ve fallen on January 1, and the NFL did not want to compete with college bowl games. The NFL playing some wild card games on 1/1/94 (a Saturday) could’ve been a disaster, considering the fact that they would’ve been competing against the [1994 Orange Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Orange_Bowl), maybe one of the greatest championship games of all-time.

The second reason, obviously, was revenue. More weeks of football meant more money. Remember that 1993 was the final year of the television deals for the NFL. New deals were signed in 1993, and in those deals, CBS lost the rights to the NFC to FOX. If the 18-week season was successful, then the prices for those television deals would’ve skyrocketed. All in all, not a bad idea by the NFL in the slightest bit. It seemed good on paper (minus the getting rid of the bye week between the conference championship and the Super Bowl), and it seemed like a surefire way for the league to get money.

So why was this a disaster?

**Reason #1: Placement of the Bye Weeks**

The Chicago Bears of 1993 may have been the streakiest NFL team of all-time. I mean, [just look at these results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Chicago_Bears_season#Regular_season). That had to be a product of the 2-bye week system, mainly, how poorly the bye weeks were spread out. For those that can’t check, the Bears lost their first 2 games, had a bye week, won their next 3 games, had a bye week, lost their next 3 games, then won their next 4 games, and finished the season by losing their final 4 games to finish the season with a 7-9 record.

Notice the thing about the bye weeks for those 1993 Chicago Bears, though? Two bye weeks in the first seven weeks of the season? In the first 7 weeks, the Bears had the same number of road games as they did bye weeks. Seems like poor placement if even under a 2-bye week system, you’ve got to play 11 games in a row. Turns out, this was common for most teams in the league. Here’s where every team had a bye week in 1993:

Team | Bye Week #1 | Bye Week #2
------ | ------- | --------
Buffalo | 3 | 7
Indianapolis | 3 | 7
Miami | 3 | 7
New England | 5 | 11
NY Jets | 3 | 7
Cincinnati | 5 | 9
Cleveland | 5 | 9
Houston Oilers | 5 | 9
Pittsburgh | 5 | 9
Denver | 4 | 8
Kansas City | 4 | 8
LA Raiders | 4 | 8
San Diego | 4 | 8
Seattle | 6 | 12
Dallas | 4 | 8
NY Giants | 4 | 8
Philadelphia | 4 | 8
Phoenix | 5 | 12
Washington | 4 | 8
Chicago | 3 | 7
Detroit | 6 | 11
Green Bay | 3 | 7
Minnesota | 3 | 7
Tampa Bay | 3 | 7
Atlanta | 6 | 10
LA Rams | 6 | 10
New Orleans | 6 | 10
San Francisco | 6 | 10

The NFL’s idea of placing bye weeks was to do it by division, so the entire division had off at the same time (minus the divisions with 5 teams). Even more concerning is that teams would have 3 weeks of games before the next bye week, and then would still have to play the rest of the season. The only teams with bye weeks that actually made sense were New England, Phoenix, Detroit, and Seattle, because there were significant gaps between the two bye weeks.

And even still, each team had to play the final 6 weeks of the season. There were no bye weeks after week 12 in an 18-week, 2-bye week system. By comparison, there are teams in today’s NFL that have a bye week in week 13. The placement was all wrong, and when you place the bye weeks wrong, of course it’s going to mess up the way teams play and their momentum.

**Reason #2: More Bye Weeks = Less Games**

Remember the placement of the bye weeks and how poor that was? Let’s break down how many teams had off each week, keeping in mind that at the time, there were only 28 teams in the league.

Week | Number of Teams Off | Number of Games
----- | -------- | ------------
3 | 8 | 10
4 | 8 | 10
5 | 6 | 11
6 | 6 | 11
7 | 8 | 10
8 | 8 | 10
9 | 4 | 12
10 | 4 | 12
11 | 2 | 13
12 | 2 | 13

During certain weeks of the season, roughly **30% of the league** was on bye. Numbers don’t reach that high today, and yet, that’s what the NFL thought was a good idea back in 1993. There were 10 games on during certain weeks of the season. Now, let’s assume that we’re playing under today’s rules where there’s a Thursday night game, a Monday night game, a Sunday night game, and even a London game. That means that you’d get just 6 games in the regular Sunday slot, which would likely be 4 games at 1:00 and 2 games at 4:00. Networks would never agree to such a ridiculous system nowadays.

When you give certain divisions the same bye weeks, sometimes, the times for games get a bit ridiculous. In week 4, there were just 2 games at the 4:00 slot; of those 2 games, none of them came in the Mountain or Pacific Time Zone, as the home teams were the New Orleans Saints (vs. San Francisco) and the Cincinnati Bengals (vs. Seattle). The following week (week 5), the NFL went to the other extreme, scheduling 5 games at 4:00 and just 4 games at 1:00. That’s right- it seems inconceivable now, but there was a time where the NFL had more 4:00 games than 1:00 games.

In week 7, because the league had a game on Thursday night and only 10 games for the whole week, there was no Sunday Night Football game. If there was, then there would’ve been room for just 7 games during the regular Sunday slate. In week 8, there were only four games at 1:00 total (by comparison, this week, CBS can choose between 5 games for the 1:00 slot… and that’s just one network). You can see why this was a disaster.

Peter King, in [this 1993 article about the problems with the NFL]( http://www.si.com/vault/1993/12/06/130077/rx-for-the-nfl-pro-football-might-still-be-americas-favorite-game-but-with-fewer-stars-too-many-injuries-and-not-enough-offense-the-nfl-has-to-start-curing-what-ails-it), stated this about the double bye week system:

&gt; The double byes are a double disaster. A second bye week was added this season in order to stretch the network TV schedule to 18 weeks. The boneheaded result was that there were as few as 10 games per weekend through the first two months of the season, not 14. Fewer games, fewer chances for good games, obviously.

You also have to remember that this was one year before the advent of Sunday Ticket, and this was well before the creation of the RedZone. You got one game, and you were stuck with it depending on where you lived. Either way, the placement of the byes led to fewer games, when that was an easily avoidable problem.

**Reason #3: More Bye Weeks = Loss of Rhythm**

Roughly 75% of the league had 3 weeks in between their byes. For some perspective, imagine if after the Eagles play the Vikings this week, they had another bye week. It would seem way too close and could easily disrupt rhythms. Well, that’s what teams were complaining about with this two bye week system. Unless you were one of the lucky teams from a 5-team division that didn’t follow the same bye weeks as the rest of the league and actually had some time between the two bye weeks, you were off twice in five weeks.

All momentum that the Bears had going into their second bye week in 1993 was completely destroyed by the time they got out of that bye. The Kansas City Chiefs, after starting off 5-1 in their first 6 games, slipped to .500 in the 4 games following their second bye week. The Seattle Seahawks went from a .500 team to dropping 4 straight after their second bye week. The second bye week rarely helped a team, and normally impeded their progress.

**Could It Work Today?**

Times have changed. Roughly 25 years later, a lot has changed that could make a 2-bye week system feasible. Everyone hates the fourth preseason game, and that’s going to be gone sooner rather than later. Replacing one week of the season with that preseason game would allow 2 bye weeks to happen while, at the same time, keeping that bye week between the conference championships and the Super Bowl that has been there every year since the 2003 season (Super Bowl XXXVIII).

There are also more teams in the NFL than there were back in 1993. When 8 teams were off in 1993, only 10 games could be played during the week. However, when 8 teams are off in 2016 (which never happens), you can still play 12 games. Realistically speaking, the most teams off in any given week in 2016 is 6, which happens in week 8 and week 9. Even if having 6 teams off was a regular thing under an 18-week season, you’d still get 13 games, 11 of them coming on Sunday (since there would be a TNF and a MNF game). That’s still not a bad option for networks to have, especially when compared to 1993, when the system was so messed up that there were only four 1:00 games total at any given point.

However, the way to make it work today that was the critical error in 1993 would be to spread out the bye weeks. There are many good arguments as to why a team needs 2 bye weeks during a long regular season. However, there aren’t many good arguments as to why a team needs 2 bye weeks within 3 weeks of each other. With better spacing between bye weeks, a 2-bye week system during an 18-week season can work.

Let’s see a system like this in action. Let’s assume that under the 32-team format, that the NFL will implement a 2-bye week system and an 18-week season that still consists of just 16 games. This means that you’ve got to fill 64 bye week slots, and there needs to be a way to divide this evenly.

The best way to do this is to have an alternating pattern where one week, 4 teams get off, and the next week, 6 teams get off. This means that there would be 13 weeks where teams could have a bye week in an 18-week season. No team would have a bye week the first two weeks of the season, and no team would have a bye week the final three weeks of the season. Additionally, during Thanksgiving (if necessary), the alteration would stop, and only 4 teams would get a bye week (even if 4 teams had off the week before). The reason for this is simple- with 3 games now on Thanksgiving, a Monday night game, and a Sunday night game, if 6 teams got off on Thanksgiving, there would only be 8 games during the Thanksgiving day slate, which would be a 1993-esque disaster all over again.

Bye weeks would occur between weeks 3 and 15, so no team would have a bye week during weeks 1-2 and weeks 16-18. Every team would be guaranteed a bye week between weeks 3 and 9, and every team would be guaranteed a second bye week between weeks 9 and 15. There would be a minimum of 5 weeks between each bye week, so as not to totally disrupt the rhythm of teams playing (so you wouldn’t have a bye week in week 8 and then have one in week 10).

But how do you make it so that every week, there’s at least one good team playing? What happens if all the good teams are on bye during a given week, and then the networks are screwed and the ratings go down? This would all be protected by a European drawing of pots. I’m not kidding, NFL. You can literally televise when each team is having a bye week, and people will still watch. Televised or not, this would be how the NFL determines what teams are on bye. Here’s how it works:

Divide the NFL into 4 pots of 8 teams each, based off of the previous season’s results. Pot A would consist of every team that made it into the divisional round (picks 25-32). Pot B would consist of the next 4 best teams in the AFC and the next 4 best teams in the NFC. Pot C would consist of the next 4 best teams in each conference, and Pot D would consist of the worst 4 teams in each conference.

Then, after dividing the league into those 4 pots, you draw. For week 3, a team from Pot A, Pot B, Pot C, and Pot D are drawn. For week 4, a team from all four of those pots are drawn, plus an additional team from Pot A and Pot B. For week 5, a team from Pot C, Pot D, Pot A, and Pot B are drawn. For week 6, a team from all four of those pots are drawn, plus an additional team from Pot C and Pot D. Once each team is drawn once, that’s how the bye weeks are determined. Every drawing would have the same number of teams from each conference, so as to ensure fairness for all the networks. If you’re still confused, fear not, for there is a sample system of how this would all play out.

**Sample System**

This is based on the 2015 standings. First, we have to divide the teams into pots. Remember that there are 8 teams in each pot, with 4 in each conference.

Pot | AFC Teams | NFC Teams
---- | --------------- | --------------
A | Denver, New England, Kansas City, Pittsburgh | Carolina, Arizona, Green Bay, Seattle
B | Cincinnati, Houston, NY Jets, Buffalo | Minnesota, Washington, Atlanta, Los Angeles
C | Indianapolis, Oakland, Miami, Jacksonville | Detroit, Philadelphia, New Orleans, NY Giants
D | Baltimore, San Diego, Cleveland, Tennessee | Chicago, Tampa Bay, San Francisco, Dallas

Now that we have the pots, let’s assign the bye weeks for an 18-week system. Again, this is all a hypothetical. Remember that when it’s a 4-team bye week, we take one team from each pot, remembering to take 2 from the AFC and 2 from the NFC. When it’s a 6-team bye week, some pots will have 2 teams taken, but we will still have the same number in each conference. Also note that under this system, in 2016, Thanksgiving would fall on week 13 (it falls on week 12 this year, but since the season would be pushed up by one week, we’d have it on week 13).

Week | Bye Week Teams
------ | ----------------------
3 | New England (A), Washington (B), Oakland (C), San Francisco (D)
4 | Carolina (A), Cincinnati (B), Philadelphia (C), Baltimore (D), Pittsburgh (A), Los Angeles (B)
5 | Indianapolis (C), Dallas (D), Denver (A), Atlanta (B)
6 | NY Giants (C), Cleveland (D), Green Bay (A), Houston (B), Jacksonville (C), Tampa Bay (D)
7 | Seattle (A), NY Jets (B), New Orleans (C), Tennessee (D)
8 | Kansas City (A), Minnesota (B), Miami (C), Chicago (D), Arizona (A), Buffalo (B)
9 | Detroit (C), San Diego (D), New England (A), Washington (B)
10 | Oakland (C), San Francisco (D), Carolina (A), Cincinnati (B), Philadelphia (C), Baltimore (D)
11 | Pittsburgh (A), Los Angeles (B), Indianapolis (C), Dallas (D)
12 | Denver (A), Atlanta (B), NY Giants (C), Cleveland (D), Green Bay (A), Houston (B)
13 | Jacksonville (C), Tampa Bay (D), Seattle (A), NY Jets (B)
14 | New Orleans (C), Tennessee (D), Kansas City (A), Minnesota (B), Miami (C), Chicago (D)
15 | Arizona (A), Buffalo (B), Detroit (C), San Diego (D)

Notice how the whole thing repeats itself once we hit week 9? Now, under this system, this is when each team would receive their bye weeks. When you compare it to the 1993 system, it’s like night and day, especially in terms of the spacing out between bye weeks.

Team | Bye Week #1 | Bye Week #2
------ | ------- | ----------
NE | 3 | 9
NYJ | 7 | 13
MIA | 8 | 14
BUF | 8 | 15
HOU | 6 | 12
IND | 5 | 11
JAX | 6 | 13
TEN | 7 | 14
PIT | 4 | 11
BAL | 4 | 10
CIN | 4 | 10
CLE | 6 | 12
DEN | 5 | 12
KC | 8 | 14
OAK | 3 | 10
SD | 9 | 15
NYG | 6 | 12
PHI | 4 | 10
DAL | 5 | 11
WSH | 3 | 9
ATL | 5 | 12
CAR | 4 | 10
NO | 7 | 14
TB | 6 | 13
CHI | 8 | 14
DET | 9 | 15
GB | 6 | 12
MIN | 8 | 14
SEA | 7 | 13
SF | 3 | 10
ARZ | 8 | 15
LA | 4 | 11

There is still adequate spacing in between each team’s bye weeks, and even though a good team is going to be off at any given week, there are going to be other good games to complement that. If possible, they could even put something into the schedule that makes it so that whenever two teams in Pot A have a bye, that the national game that week consists of two of the remaining six teams in Pot A.

**Conclusion**

The two bye week system in 1993 was a colossal disaster, but that was because of poor planning from the NFL and because the world was not ready for a two bye week system in terms of having the Sunday Ticket and the RedZone. No longer are fans stuck with just one game. That being said, when close to 30% of the league was off any given week, when only four games were being shown at 1:00, when there was no spacing out between the bye weeks, and when the bye week between the conference championships and the Super Bowl was removed, you can clearly see why it failed.

With better planning, a 2-bye week system can work in today’s NFL. If there was a way to adequately space out the bye weeks and make it so that marquee games would be guaranteed to occur, even if certain marquee teams are on break, then the league would strongly consider going back to their old ways and reconsidering a 2-bye week schedule over 18 weeks. It gets rid of the fourth preseason game, it adds more meaningful football while being significantly less taxing on the players, and increases revenue and the television contracts. With the proper system in place, a system like this can be a win-win for all parties involved.

Palso,2016-10-14 03:50:08+00:00,Valve's psychologist talks about low priority,"Hi guys, I attended Steam Dev Days in Seattle and thought this could be interesting for you. One of the lectures was by Valve's internal PhD. psychologist who also work on Dota 2 (and Counter-Strike and other games).

He talked about player's behaviour, decision making process, how devs at Valve ""manipulate"" players to take certain actions leading to better game experience, as well as low priority mechanics and results.

Here are some photos from the keynote: http://imgur.com/a/5EZvl

And some highlights from my notes:

* Valve puts a lot of effort into Dota 2 on-boarding from the psychology perspective - e.g. they lock tutorial heroes so new players can pick up mechanics more smoothly.

* He said currently around 8% of active players are in the low priority pool in a current time, but I'm not 100% sure I understood this one correctly - the number seems plausible though.

* They see much better results with strict low priority rules and a lot of players are being ""rehabilitated"", there're still notoriously toxic people though.

* When they introduced former match quality rating system they saw lowered report rate because people were actually thinking about the match quality and their own performance and afterwards were less likely to report someone as they knew they were dicks themselves.
* They see much better player behaviour now since they introduced reward system into reporting - that everyone can see a reaction to their action after the report (""We've recently taken action against..."")
* They tested psychological anchoring in match making in Counter-Strike - they showed longer waiting times to players searching for matches than actual waiting time - this led to more satisfied players as they ""waited"" less than they expected. They don't use this however and instead they're honest about waiting times.
* He made a funny case study about anchoring in Valve - he asked people (outside the Dota 2 team) about last two digits of their SSN and then about the number of heroes in Dota 2 - those with higher SSN digits were guessing there are more heroes in Dota 2 than the group with lower SNN.
* They don't take crying about something being imbalanced much seriously, they always look at data (as all game devs do).
* He talked about a HUGE Dunning-Kruger effect in Dota 2 (see Wikipedia) - but we already all know this :)

Then he talked some more about motivation and how do they increase retention of players with various stuff + a lot of things outside the Dota 2.

Whole talk will be available for public in upcoming weeks here - https://www.youtube.com/user/SteamworksDev/videos

**[Week 5 Quick Thoughts](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/561vly/quick_thoughts_on_every_week_5_game/)**

##**Broncos @ Chargers**

•	**Trevor Siemian** should be back for Thursday Night Football and that’s pretty good news for the Broncos’ offense overall, because **Paxton Lynch** looked very much like a rookie last week. Siemian is a worthy QB2 start in a solid matchup. **CJ Anderson** gets a prime matchup against the league’s second worst run defense and should be able to get right in this one – he’s a high end RB2. **Demaryius Thomas** and **Emmanuel Sanders** are both high end WR2s, with Sanders surprisingly being the more heavily targeted of the two. San Diego has also given up the 8th most points to tight ends so if **Virgil Green** returns, he wouldn’t be a terrible streamer here.

•	**Philip Rivers** has been making the most of his depleted receiving corps but draws a tough matchup against Denver this week – he’s only a QB2 against this elite defense. **Travis Benjamin** and **Tyrell Williams** are the number one and two passing options but they’re no more than WR3s against Denver’s league-best pass defense. Denver has not been nearly as imposing against the run – not that they’re bad, but this is where San Diego will look to lean. So **Melvin Gordon** should be able to return RB2 numbers despite a bad YPC and heavy touchdown dependency – the Chargers are committed to them and the red zone opportunities just keep coming. **Antonio Gates** and **Hunter Henry** are a puzzling TE duo – given Henry’s production I would feel alright about starting him as a low end TE1. I’m not nearly as confident about Gates, but the chance for a TD is always there – he’s TD dependent, with a low floor. **Dontrelle Inman** faded back into the ether last week where he belongs – his production will be volatile and unpredictable.

##**Bengals @ Patriots**

•	**Andy Dalton** will be just a QB2 against the Patriots this week. His touchdown upside is low without **Tyler Eifert**. Dalton’s main target, **AJ Green** is an every week WR1 with the upside to single handedly win your matchup; he has a boom or bust reputation but his floor is usually not “kill your week” low. **Jeremy Hill** and **Giovani Bernard** are both avoids for me this week, as New England is giving up the 10th fewest fantasy points to running backs and this is a split situation to begin with; I prefer Gio as a flex play, as he in uninjured. **Brandon LaFell** had a great game last week, but they will be few and far between – don’t trust him against New England. **CJ Uzomah** wouldn’t be a terrible TE streamer against a defense giving up the 9th most points to tight ends; Eifert would be a recommended start if he is able to return. 

•	**Tom Brady** has returned and he hasn’t lost his touch; he’s an every week QB1. **Rob Gronkowski** also returned to form, going for over 100 yards in week 5; he is an every week TE1 from here on out. **Martellus Bennett** exploded for three touchdowns last week; I wouldn’t expect that every week, but I would expect the Patriots to create matchup nightmares with their two tight ends in the red zone. Both Bennett and Gronk should catch plenty of TDs this season, and I’d keep using Bennett as a TE1 if I had him. **Julian Edelman** received a team-high 10 targets with Brady back, and although it didn’t amount to much last week, his stock will rise fast – he’s a high end WR2. **Chris Hogan** was definitely involved in the offense and he’s earned flex play consideration with the possibility for quite a lot more. **James White** improved with Brady under center as expected and is now an every week flex play thanks to a solid receiving floor with big game upside. **LeGarrette Blount** returns to his pre-Garoppolo form, which is flex play in most games and high end RB2 in blowouts – this doesn’t profile as a total blowout, so he’s a flex play for me.


##**Ravens @ Giants**

•	**Joe Flacco** has been matchup dependent thus far, and this is not a great matchup against the defense giving up the 9th fewest points to quarterbacks – he’s a low upside QB2. At the time of this writing it is unclear whether or not **Steve Smith Sr.** will be able to play this week or not, but if he can it is a fairly generous matchup (4th most points to fantasy WRs). He’d be a WR2 if he can go. If he cannot, **Mike Wallace** should inherit a good portion of his targets and return WR2 value – if Smith can go, Wallace is just a flex play. **Dennis Pitta** received 8 targets once again in Week 5, but it appears it will be boom or bust as far as his target share is concerned, and his TD upside is low. He’s a low, low end TE1. **Terrance West** has played well for two weeks straight, and should have received more carries against Washington – the Ravens agree, because they fired former OC Trestman for not doing so. West has benefited from easy matchups, so this tough one against the Giants (6th fewest fantasy points allowed to RBs) will be a true test of his skills – with **Kenneth Dixon** still being eased in, West should be an RB3 this week.

•	**Eli Manning** has been terribly disappointing so far this season, his poor play dragging down everyone around him. He and Brock Osweiler are the only two QBs to not turn in a top 12 performance yet this season. Yikes. It almost has to get better for Manning but don’t pin your fantasy hopes on him this week outside of 2QB leagues. **Odell Beckham** remains a WR1 – the targets and talent are there, and his stats will improve as the offense does. **Sterling Shepard** caught only 2 of 7 targets last week, taking a further step back from his promising start – with Eli playing badly against a tough secondary, he’s not on my flex radar. The same goes for **Victor Cruz** who laid a goose egg last week.  **Bobby Rainey** is a surprising PPR flex play filling in for missing **Shane Vereen**. If **Rashad Jennings** can return this week, he will be no more than an bottom barrel RB3 against the Ravens 2nd ranked run defense. **Will Tye** will also struggle for relevance contending with Baltimore’s defense and Eli’s poor play. If you own players on this team (like I do), pray for Eli to find his way soon.

##**Eagles @ Redskins**

•	**Carson Wentz** has been rock solid in his rookie season and should be able to provide at least low end QB1 value against the Redskins. **Jordan Matthews** has seen his target share dwindle as the season goes on, but faces a Redskins’ beatable slot corner – he’ll be a WR2 in this matchup. **Darren Sproles** is a boom bust flex play with weekly upside if he’s able to break off a big play. **Ryan Mathews** gets a prime matchup against a weak Redskins run defense – he’ll be a solid RB2 in this matchup. **Zach Ertz** should work up to more usage as the season goes on – he’ll be a low end TE1 in this one. He’s a hold for me.

•	While the Philadelphia defense was somewhat unmasked by the Lions last week, they’re still tough, so my expectations for **Kirk Cousins** are quite low – he’s no more than a QB2 this week. While **Jordan Reed** is an every week TE1 based on usage and talent, Philadelphia has been the toughest defense on tight ends thus far – temper expectations in this one. **Jamison Crowder** has seen his target share plummet and he cannot be trusted in lineups against Philly. **Matt Jones** could have some success as an RB3 play. **DeSean Jackson** is more likely to bust than boom this week – he is just a flex play if you can’t avoid benching him. **Pierre Garcon** has carved out a PPR-flex type role in the offense but against Philadelphia’s secondary I wouldn’t want him anywhere near my lineup. **Chris Thompson** is on the low end flex radar in PPR leagues. 

##**Steelers @ Dolphins**

•	Pray for Miami, because Hurricane Matthew was nothing compared to what Hurricane Ben is going to do to them. His home/road splits usually lead me to advise sitting **Ben Roethlisberger** on the road, but not against this awful Dolphins team. **Antonio Brown** will likely be THE WR1 this week – you saw what AJ Green did to them. **LeVeon Bell**, likewise, will ruin the Dolphins as he plays both as an elite RB and a WR2 for this team. **Sammie Coates** has fallen into the Martavis Bryant role, that is, designated deep ball catcher – it’s a fantasy valuable role and against Miami I’d feel very happy with Coates as my WR3 with upside for a lot more. **Jesse James** got 8 targets last week and definitely could be catching a TD in this one – he is a low floor, high-ish ceiling TE streamer for the week.

•	Probably playing in catch-up mode starting in minute 5 of the first quarter, **Ryan Tannehill** could rack up some garbage time stats in this one a la week 2 @ New England. He’ll be a low end QB1 this week and not a bad streaming option for desperate owners. **Jarvis Landry** will get right after last week’s disappointments and turn in PPR WR1 numbers. **DeVante Parker** is not receiving enough targets for me to feel totally comfortable with him, however, he is flex-able given the passing volume I’m expecting for Miami in this one. If **Arian Foster** is able to return after a full week of practice I’d feel good starting him as an RB2 against the league’s 8th most generous defense to running backs. If Foster cannot play, **Jay Ajayi** has a tenuous “control” over the backfield and should return good RB3 numbers if he’s the starter.

##**Panthers @ Saints**

•	**Cam Newton** is cleared to play against the Saints and he’ll be a top shelf QB1. **Greg Olsen** is the TE1 in fantasy right now and you’ve gotta start him. **Kelvin Benjamin** will thrive in this matchup as a WR1. The Saints present the best match up for fantasy running backs in football, but this backfield is complicated. **Jonathan Stewart** may return from injury this week, and he may be eased in. **Cameron Artis-Payne** earned two touchdowns last week against the Buccaneers and is the best play of the three RB options this week in my opinion, though expect fewer TDs with Cam there to vulture them. **Fozzy Whittaker** is falling out of it, but his pass catching role makes his flex-able. I would say CAP is an RB2 without Stewart, and a flex with him in. Stewart is a flex option either way, I don’t trust his snap count coming off of injury but the upside is there to play him. 

•	**Drew Brees** is playing at home against a very beatable Panthers defense – he’s an elite QB1 in this one. Although the Carolina defense is giving up the 9th fewest fantasy points to RBs, it’s hard to ignore that Jacquizz Freakin’ Rodgers had a career day against them. **Mark Ingram** should be fine for solid RB2 production. Outside of giving up huge days to very large talented receivers Julio Jones and Mike Evans, the Panthers’ secondary has actually been quite solid, limiting all WRs to 55 yards or fewer in the first four games. Brees will spread the ball around to whoever is open. **Brandin Cooks** will draw the stiffest coverage and could be in for a disappointing game – he’s a boom or bust WR2. **Michael Thomas** might benefit the most from the coverage on Cooks – he has established himself as a strong WR3. **Willie Snead** is a solid flex play right now - I’d like to see him fully healthy on the field before anointing him to the every week WR2 status he was headed for in the first two weeks of the season. **Coby Fleener** could have a monster game against Carolina’s porous tight end defense – he could be the man Brees’ looks to when his WRs are covered up. If I had him and needed upside from my tight end, I’d start him this week – the caveat is that Fleener has only produced in one of four games, so the floor is low.

##**49ers @ Bills**

•	**Blaine Gabbert** has been benched for the (at last check) marginally better **Colin Kaepernick**. At the very least this should be interesting! In 2QB leagues Kaepernick is legitimately interesting given his potentially high rushing floor. **Carlos Hyde** has been relatively game flow independent and is a legitimate RB1 based on usage. Kaepernick’s ascension is a potential shake up for the 49ers’ receiving corps. Potentially this is good news for deep ball catcher **Torrey Smith** but I would hold off on adding him unless you happen to have an open spot. The effect on **Jeremy Kerley**, who was really hitting his stride as their number one receiver, is less clear. He’s definitely a hold, and a risky flex play for this week. 

•	Outside of week one, **Tyrod Taylor** has been a high floor and therefore solid QB2. Against the 49ers he has more upside than usual and I’d consider him a good streamer for this week. **Charles Clay** is getting more involved in the offense in the absence of Watkins, and with his middling number of targets and talent he’s a low end TE1 streamer. **Robert Woods** is having a tough time taking over as the primary receiver but the targets are there to make him a worthy but uninspiring flex play. **LeSean McCoy** is the centerpiece of the offense and he will run rampant and unchecked against the 49ers for RB1 numbers.

##**Jaguars @ Bears**

•	This game has shootout-of-the-week potential so I’m definitely starting **Blake Bortles** as a QB1. **Allen Robinson** is a sure fire every week WR1, especially in this matchup. **Allen Hurns** is a volatile flex with more TD upside than usual this week. This running game is a mess but **TJ Yeldon** is definitely the back to own at this point – he’ll be an RB3/flex against the Bears middling run defense. **Chris Ivory** can’t be trusted until he shows he has something left in the tank. **Julius Thomas** should be back this week and he can be trusted as a TE1 in this potential high scoring game.

•	**Brian Hoyer** has been quick good in his starts while **Jay Cutler** has been injured – good enough that the Cutlet is getting benched. The way Hoyer has been playing makes him a low end QB1 for fantasy purposes this week. Even with **Kevin White** out of the picture, **Alshon Jeffery** received only 6 targets. This usage (or lack thereof) is concerning and, most of all, confusing. Jeffery is playing well with the targets he does get, so performance is not the issue. Soley due to his lack of volume, Jeffery is merely a WR2 this week. Something has got to give at some point here. Hoyer fed **Eddie Royal** and **Cameron Meredith** 9 and 12 targets respectively – both are strong WR3/flex plays, with Meredith being my preference as he received more targets.  **Jordan Howard** is forcing an incredible number of missed tackles and looks great out there – he is an every week RB2 with upside. **Zach Miller** has inconsistent targets and Jacksonville is good at defending the tight end position – I’d pass on him this week.

##**Rams @ Lions**

•	**Todd Gurley** will be a strong RB2 against the Lions middling run defense. **Tavon Austin** is getting a good number of targets, and occasionally turns them into points. He was able to do that last week, and if he can keep it up Detroit is a great matchup for production – he is flex-able. **Kenny Britt** is a deep league low end flex with fairly steady production so far - because he is a Ram, I don't trust it, but it's there.

•	**Matt Stafford** gets a tough matchup against LA’s 10th ranked QB defense – he should only be able to return high end QB2 value. I believe in **Marvin Jones** and think he can be a strong WR2 in this matchup – the absence of **Eric Ebron** should help him achieve that. **Theo Riddick** is the lone healthy RB and he’s a strong RB2 in PPR as long as that is the case. I don’t want **Anquan Boldin** nor **Golden Tate** anywhere near my rosters.


##**Browns @ Titans**

•	**Cody Kessler** is unstartable but **Terrelle Pryor**, as the Browns’ main offensive weapon, is a solid WR3 with upside even against the Titans’ 6th ranked WR defense. **Isaiah Crowell** will have a tough time getting going against the Titans’ 3rd ranked run defense – he’s no more than an RB3 this week. **Gary Barnidge** will be a decent TE1 in this matchup where tight end is the only “weak point” in an otherwise rock solid fantasy defense. **Duke Johnson** will be tough to trust in lineups most weeks, particularly here – I wouldn’t start him.

•	**Marcus Mariota** had an incredible game last week and he should keep it rolling against the Browns, who are incredibly generous to opposing QBs. He’s a recommended streamer this week. **DeMarco Murray** is an every week RB1 and he should do particularly well this week. **Delanie Walker**is the Titans’ leading receiver and it should remain that way with the WRs struggling – he is a TE1. One of **Rishard Matthews**, **Tajae Sharpe** or **Andre Johnson** might have a flex-able day but I’d be hard pressed to tell you which one – avoid.

##**Chiefs @ Raiders**

•	**Alex Smith** will be another recommended streamer against the 2nd most generous defense to opposing QBs, the Oakland Raiders. **Jeremy Maclin** has had a slow start but this is a prime matchup to get right – he’s a WR2. **Travis Kelce** is an every week TE1, and he should do very well here. **Spencer Ware** should begin to take a back seat to **Jamaal Charles** now that the Chiefs are through their bye, though I still expect a split for now. Charles should be utilized as an RB2 and Ware as a flex in a prime matchup – the only concern is their workloads.

•	**Derek Carr** has been incredibly reliable as a QB1 – keep firing him up as such. **Amari Cooper** and **Michael Crabtree** get a prime matchup – I view Cooper as a WR1 after a 12 target game. Crabtree is a very strong WR2 coming off a target dip down to 7. It is unknown if **Latavius Murray** will return in week 6, but if he does he returns to a hellish backfield split with **Deandre Washington**, **Jalen Richard**, and **Jamize Olawale**. Murray, Washington and Richard would be flex plays in a good matchup, with the two latter getting bumps if Murray is out.

##**Cowboys @ Packers**

•	**Dak Prescott** has been a high end QB2/low end QB1 play through the season and I see no reason to expect more or less in this game – he has a safe floor. **Ezekiel Elliott** is an elite RB1 based on usage and his own skills, which seem to increase with each game he’s played in the pros. **Dez Bryant** is practicing Wednesday, which may be a good sign for his ability to play this week. If he is a full go, he’ll be a high end WR2. **Cole Beasley** has seen his targets diminish with each passing game – he has bottomed out at 4 targets a game with his fantasy relevance hinging on touchdowns. He should see more targets in this one, and is a worthy flex play this week, but I’d be looking to sell for whatever I could get. **Jason Witten** is a low ceiling, low end TE – he’s really more TE2 than TE1. If Dez can’t go **Terrance Williams** would be borderline flex-able but I wouldn’t feel good about it.

•	**Aaron Rodgers** is a high floor QB1 each and every week, despite offensive woes somewhat capping his ceiling lately. His favorite target, both in general and in the red zone, **Jordy Nelson** will keep up his WR1 ways. **Davante Adams** has made progress since his maddeningly disappointing 2015 campaign – it helps that expectations have been low. He has only one game below 7 targets and had a great game last week – he’s in flex territory if you need one. **Randal Cobb** gets a plus matchup here against Dallas, and can be trusted as a lower end WR2/high end WR3 – his good game last week doesn’t erase the concerns from the start of the season, but it helps. **Eddie Lacy**may be out this week with an ankle injury, in which case lowly **James Starks** will get the start at running back. Starks is averaging 1.8 YPC and faces a Dallas run defense allowing the 4th fewest points to fantasy running backs. He’s a spot flex start for those desperate and downtrodden at the RB position. If Lacy can go he’ll be a low end RB2/solid RB3.

##**Falcons @ Seahawks**

•	**Matt Ryan** was slowed by the Denver defense, but not destroyed – that’s a good sign going forward. I’d expect a stat line similar to the one he had at Denver, so a mere QB2 for this week, but the future is bright – the offense appears to be legit. **Tevin Coleman** proved he is a significant passing game threat against Denver last week – I’d temper expectations going into this matchup though. His pass catching ability keeps his value afloat, especially in PPR leagues – he’s a solid flex/RB3 play for this week. Seattle’s very tough run defense will have the greatest impact on **Devonta Freeman** who will only be an RB3 play this week until the schedule lightens up. **Julio Jones** undoubtedly has WR1 talent, but the targets have been lacking thus far this season – we saw what the bad matchup in Denver did to him. I could see someone extremely stacked at WR being able to find a lineup without Julio in it, but they’d have to be EXTREMELY stacked – he’s still one of the best WRs in football.

•	Atlanta has a relatively porous defense, which means great things for all Seattle players. **Russell Wilson** will be a high end QB1. I would start **Doug Baldwin** with extreme confidence as a WR1. I would start **Jimmy Graham** as a definite TE1. I would start **Christine Michael** as a very good RB1. Everything’s coming up Millhouse for the Seahawks this week! **Tyler Lockett** is stashable but not yet startable.

##**Colts @ Texans**

•	**Andrew Luck** faces the fourth ranked fantasy defense against quarterbacks in bitter divisional rival, the Houston Texans. I’d expect low end QB1 numbers at best, and QB2 numbers at worst – I don’t expect either offense to perform extremely well. **TY Hilton**, ordinarily a locked in WR1, is more of a WR2 in this matchup, however his elite number of targets still makes him an attractive start. **Frank Gore** will be a rock solid RB2 in this matchup, as the pass will struggle and the running game may be leaned on.  **Dwayne Allen** is not a recommended start.

•	The going will be easier for the Texan’ offense, as the Indianapolis defense has been rather generous across the board. **Brock Osweiler** is the weak link in the offense, never more than a QB2 regardless of matchup. **DeAndre Hopkins** will be a high end WR2/low end WR1 in this game – I expect his targets to remain about the same but the number of connections should increase. **Will Fuller** can also be fired up as a high upside WR2. **Lamar Miller** is an RB1 in every way but touchdowns – and those are notoriously random and fluky. Minnesota wasn’t his fault. Keep starting him. This is probably the week he makes it in the end zone. 

##**Jets @ Cardinals**

•	**Ryan Fitzpatrick** is a turnover machine facing a very good defense that generates a lot of interceptions. Bail out, my friends. **Brandon Marshall** will see a lot of cornerback Patrick Peterson and may be negatively impacted by Fitzpatrick’s play – however, he got 15 targets last game and volume is king. I’d trust him as a WR2 in the matchup. **Quincy Enunwa** figures to benefit most from the placement of **Eric Decker** onto IR on Wednesday. However, he will not reap those benefits until next week – Arizona and his own QB will conspire to keep his numbers down to low upside flex levels in this game. **Matt Forte** has been on a downward spiral in terms of his usage, and I don’t expect a bounce back this week against Arizona’s run defense – he’s an RB3. **Bilal Powell** has all but taken over the pass catching role, which could be quite valuable in this game where the Jets will need to play catch up – he’s a solid flex play.  **Austin Seferian-Jenkins** is worth monitoring for those desperate at TE – his role should increase with Decker out, but by how much we just don’t know.

•	**Carson Palmer** is back and can be fired up immediately as a QB1 in this juicy matchup against the Jets 4th most generous QB defense. **Larry Fitzgerald** is a safe WR1 play. **John Brown** is a very attractive WR3/Flex. **Michael Floyd** can’t be trusted after his goose egg – he seems to be getting phased out in favor of John Brown. **David Johnson** is an elite, beautiful stallion of a running back leading all of us who chose him to the Promised Land. Praise be.

Welcome back!

Some of the D/STs that were drafted highly are doing really well. Denver is 3rd overall and Arizona is 4th overall, but not all of us are so lucky to have options like that. So next year, why not just draft a D/ST highly and grab one of the best options?

Not so fast. Seattle this year is 9th in points per game, and they haven't even been *that* bad. Carolina is worse at 10th overall. The Texans are 13th. Each of those teams was drafted with the expectation that they would just get plugged-and-played for 15 weeks. Streaming isn't just a strategy to go into from day 1, it's a strategy that functions as a backup plan for anyone without a plug-and-play option for whatever reason. The year-to-year correlations for D/STs are obnoxiously small largely because of how they are scored.

Through 5 weeks, the only D/STs that have really been better than streaming have been the Vikings, Bills, Broncos, Cardinals, Chiefs, and Eagles... and of those six, some number between two and four of them would have been streaming targets early! That ""found money"" aspect of streaming D/STs is probably the most underappreciated part of the strategy.

So, those of us who have stumbled into gold - enjoy it while you can. Things change in a hurry with D/STs. And of course, we're only in Week 6. This snapshot will probably look very different by Week 12.

**[Defense Wins Championships, Week 6](https://empeopled.com/p/94563)**

This week's top teams (MFL Standard scoring):

Rank | Team | Points | Tier | Notes
:--------: | :-------- | :--------: | :--------: | :--------
1 | Arizona Cardinals | 11.5 | 1 | Great matchup, great defense
2 | Buffalo Bills | 11.3 | 1 | First Minnesota, is Buffalo the next to ascend?
3 | New England | 10.3 | 1 | Still steady, still really good
4 | Seattle Seahawks | 9.9 | 1 | Does Atlanta keep rolling or finally stumble?
5 | Oakland Raiders | 9.6 | 2 | Projection is probably inflated from what it ""should"" be
6 | Denver Broncos | 9.4 | 2 | Get well soon, Kubiak
7 | Houston Texans | 9.4 | 2 | Needs a big game to get back on track in 2016, so... **FTC!**
8 | Tennessee Titans | 9.2 | 2 | Too much AFC South in the top tiers, yuck

**(The top 16 teams, and whichever extras are on the same tier as #16, can be found in the link above)**

Most ""Should I start Team A or Team B!?"" questions can be answered very simply by the rankings. There's no magic to it, especially this early in the season. If you have the option of Team A or Team B, and both teams are on the same tier, then the distinction between them is very marginal! Do not stress yourself out about choosing between them. Look at the following week's matchup to see if either option has an edge, and then go from there. Remember, if your league uses different scoring from MFL (which is similar - but not exactly the same - as ESPN, Yahoo!, CBS, et al), then you may need to use some of your own intuition to parse two similar choices.

Adrian5156,2016-10-09 21:51:36+00:00,The Illustrated Art of Volleying,"So last year u/djimonia came up with a brilliant series called “The Illustrated Art of ___”. These included the [Art of Tackling](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/3ae0c9/art_of_tackling_gifs/), [Heading](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/3aps82/the_illustrated_art_of_heading/), [Goalkeeping](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/3c3fpk/the_illustrated_art_of_goalkeeping/?), [Set Pieces](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/3zkh95/the_illustrated_art_of_setpieces/?), and [Bloody Murder](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/3aynxy/the_illustrated_art_of_bloody_murder/). They were fantastic posts and I believe won r/soccer’s end of year awards for best OC. So with u/djimonia’s permission I’ve decided to pick up where he left off and look at the art of volleying.  

The volley, perhaps the hardest of all football techniques, but the technique with which one can best demonstrate their genius. A well struck volley is perhaps the sweetest sight in the whole game and will tend to win goal of the season ahead of most other contenders (12 of the last 17 Premier League GotS have been volleys). Below are over 100 volleys from every angle and distance - screamers, finesse, lobs, flicks and bicycle kicks.   

Unfortunately I had to leave out over 40 volleys because of the word count limit. But please link your favourites too.

kittnzNrainbowz,2016-10-05 15:58:09+00:00,"How could Destiny 2 wipe your character, and yet you'd be fine with it?","Here's what i'd be cool with: Paying homage to Year 1. So you load up destiny 2. It asks “Do you want to continue your character, or start new.” You click continue. It takes you to Destiny 1 orbit. 

**Ghost: Something’s up. I can’t get a signal to the tower. I’m not picking up ANY transmissions. Everything’s gone dark.**

You click “select destination”. 

**Ghost: Umm, Are you seeing what I’m seeing?**

Where the tower once was, is just an empty hole, but it’s still clickable. What’s more, any planet you click on, all the missions are gone. Only patrols remains. You start loading into the tower.

**Ghost: This better not be one of Cayde’s tricks again. (radio static) Cayde? Zavala?... Anyone? Nothing… Lets find out what’s going on.** 

You arrive at the tower, but in first person mode. You have your weapon. 

**Ghost: Stay sharp. Something’s wrong here.**

It’s empty. No NPCs. No players. Nothing. Just you. Alone. You turn around to look at the city. The traveler is gone. 

**Ghost: Tha… That’s impossible… How...** 

You walk around. There’s dozens of things you can scan. Each one will call up dialogue from your ghost. You scan the security cameras. 

**Ghost: Um, we didn’t really want to tell the Guardians this but… Those are just for show.** 

You scan the staircase

**Ghost: Y’know, you could just walk down these, you don’t have to jump all the time.** 

You scan where Shaxx used to stand

**Ghost: (nervous) Heh, I guess we really are the last guardians standing…**

There’s way more to scan, and way more dialogue to hear; all little homages to Destiny 1. 

You fly out to orbit. Still no missions. Still nothing but patrols. 

If you wait long enough, your ghost will suggest

**Ghost: Well… Lets try a planet**

You fly into a planet. It’s lifeless. Nothing. No music. No enemy’s. Just an open sandbox.

**Ghost: What I wouldn’t give to see a vandal… Don’t tell anyone I said that.** 

There’s still more to scan though. Throughout the planets are literally hundreds of things to scan, each with unique dialogue from your ghost. Each recalling unique times and fights. Randall the Vandal. The cell! From the prison of elders! Relic Iron farming routes. Even unprompted, your ghost will talk to you. Wondering about what this means. 

**Ghost: This place is like a ghost town. Get it? Because I’m the only ghos…never mind. I’ll explain it later.** 

If you happen to pass by a computer…

**Ghost: Wait! Scan that, lets see if we can get a signal somewhere! Ok… nothing happened.** 

You go back to orbit. There’s a new mission. Just above the reef. It’s called “Some Time toExplain.” 

You can go patrol any other location. But it’ll be the same thing. Your ghost talks to you about your memories with Destiny.

You click the new mission. The loading screen comes up. 

**Ghost: WAIT! I’ve got a signal from the Traveler. It’s fading fast. We need to check it out.**   

As you watch the loading screen, similar to how ships join your loading screen during matchmaking, a strange vessel we’ve never seen joins your ship; a metal pod with mechanical tentacles trailing behind it. Four tentacles grabs a hold of your ship and push outside the warp screen. We cut to inside your ship (now a cut scene, this is where you would start if you don’t have Destiny 1 saves).

You and your ghost are trying to take control of the ship. We can see throughout the ship. Your guns, and armor fall from their racks as your ship is being abducted. It’s chaos. You’re under attack. A familiar noise appears behind your character. The Stranger warps in. 

**Guardian: You? Are you doing this?**

**Stranger: We’ve got to get out of here.** 

The stranger grabs your shoulder and pulls you away from the ship’s controls. You push her back. And try to take control of the ship

**Ghost: Umm, guardian? I think we’ve got a problem**

The stranger pulls you away more forcefully. You shove her away again. 

**Guardian: Obviously, ghost!**

**Ghost: Ok, then I think we’ve got a BIGGER problem.** 

Your guardian gets away from the stranger. She looks out the front window. The vessel is guiding your ship away from a shrinking portal. 

**Ghost: We can’t control the ship with that thing on top of us. And that portal is closing, fast!** 

**Guardian: (to the Stranger) What’s going on?**

**Stranger: I don’t have time to expl…**

As the stranger tries to pull you back again, you punch the stranger’s helmet. She falls to the ground. 

**Guardian: No. Not this time. What do you want from me?**

**Stranger: You? This isn’t about you. It’s about that (she point’s to your ghost). Your Traveler is gone; your city has been consumed by darkness.**

**Guardian: It’s not consumed by darkness. We were there. It’s just… empty.**

**Stranger: What do you think the darkness is? What do you think your Traveler *does*. Your entire solar system has been consumed by darkness, and you don’t think that *thing*, that spawn of your Traveler knows exactly what’s going on? Knows exactly where it’s taking you?**


**Ghost: Don’t listen to her, we’ve got to get inside that portal or else…**

**Guardian: (doubting the ghost) Or else what? Ghost, what happens if we go through that portal?**

**Ghost:	…I can’t survive without the Travelers’ light… We need to go find the Traveler.** 

**Guardian: Ghost… What happened? What happened to earth? Do you know?**

**Ghost: …**

**Stranger: We don’t have time for this.** 

The stranger grabs your shoulder and teleports you both to the vessel. You run to a window and peers down onto your ship. You see the ghost frantically fiddling with the ship. The tentacles release the ship. 

**Ghost: (On radio) No! Guardian! I can get you back! We can figure it out. I’ll tell (static) everything! (static)**

You watch as the ship drifts into the closing portal. 

**Stranger: I’m sorry. But you don’t understand what’s going on**

**Guardian: I understand that my ghost has been with me since the beginning, and I’m not about to leave him.** 

You shove the stranger aside, grab a gun and helmet off her wall, jump in an escape pod and press a button. As the stranger screams and pounds on the escape pod. You launch, flying towards the closing portal. A tentacle grabs your pod. You hit the emergency eject button. You fire your gun to propel you towards the closing portal. You get a radio signal from the stranger. 

**Stranger: (radio static) Guardian! Don’t (static) traveler. It’s not what (static) thinks it is…** 

Light from the closing portal consumes your screen. Completely white. ""Destiny 2"" fades in. 

You have no guns. You have no ship. And your armor will be ruined when you land. Where will you land? Maybe earth in the past before the accounts of destiny 1. Maybe an alternate timeline than regular earth. Maybe a new solar system that the Traveler is trying to “help”. It’s a portal, they port you places. 



Then Destiny 2 is entirely new races. But only those from year 1 will be able to play as human, exo, awoken. Some shit can happen when you launch in that portal that erases your subclasses. Who knows, it’s space and space is cray. 

Anyway, this is just some fanfic shit. But it’s one of a million ways that they can wipe your subclasses and gear and still pays respect to the grind you put into it. What's yours?

Edit: Formatting  

Edit 2: I'm not saying that if Bungie doesn't carry our characters over I'll join the Cabal and lay siege on Seattle. I'm suggesting that there are story structures that allow us to start fresh with the option for new characters, or the option to stay who we've been for 4 years. That said, there's a lot of people who think that Bungie are fucking us over, and lied about keeping our characters for 10 years. To those fellow guardians, a lot can change in 4 years. It may not make sense to keep a promise made before you realized the full scope of your art. Imagine if a major TV show tried to pull that shit. Like, in year 1, they say ""we know exactly how this ends"" but by the time you get to the ending, too much has happened and too much has changed and characters have developed to a point that your original ending doesn't really make sense.

PendragonDaGreat,2016-10-02 05:11:41+00:00,THE SEATTLE MARINERS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED FROM PLAYOFF CONTENTION,"With their loss against the A's they can get no more than 87 wins. Meaning they can't catch the 88 wins of Toronto or Baltimore.


I also nominate myself for the concession speech:

&amp;nbsp;

FADE US NOW. I would like to thank the wonderful group of fans that we have had all year long in /r/mariners. They have been a delight to hang out with all season long. Through the initial highs of a productive April and May. Followed by the sobering reality that was June. Our strong resurgence to playing meaningful baseball this late in the season, and every day in between.

&amp;nbsp;

Unless this team goes and burns itself to the ground in the off season with unnecessary trades we will definitely be a contender next year. Some changes will need to be made, that is definitely a given. For example Felix is no longer our ace, and we need to accept that. His days of pure dominance with nothing but heat are long over. Hopefully he can adapt like Moyer did  so many years ago.

&amp;nbsp;

Changes will be made up and down the system. Either Smith or Aoki is out for sure and there is a very real possibility that neither is with the team next year. They are both at the end of their contracts with options for next year. Other changes are likely at first base, Dae Ho Lee and Lind are both are at the end of their contracts. 

&amp;nbsp;

Kyle Seager has been an absolute gem to watch all season long. Becoming the first infielder in Mariners’ history to hit 30+ homeruns in a season. However, he’s also put up a ton of errors over there in the [Hawt Corner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QkGey8UtUI) which was been a problem. At the same time [he’s made](https://gfycat.com/UnevenLonelyAfricanelephant) [some amazing plays](http://i.imgur.com/MUp64Hk).

&amp;nbsp;

Memes have been a huge part of the subreddit this season. The legends of [Fulgar](https://gfycat.com/indeliblethankfulgar), [Cotton Candy Girl](http://gph.is/2cs3R5N), and 🍍 will be passed down in hushed whispers for generations. Fulgar will return when the time is right. We all accept that. Until then we will pray fervently and offer up our sacrifices.

&amp;nbsp;

I for one am glad that this season happened. Sure it’s a disappointment that we were unable to continue further into October, but that is life. We will return, and do it with a vengeance.

&amp;nbsp;

\#KeepFighting.

&amp;nbsp;

Every time this team went and seemed like it was gone they came back. Fought harder and all together brought us this far.  It truly was a team effort, everyone had their moment this year. We used everyone fairly well. Our AAA hitting coach deserves a ton of praise, he took struggling hitters and turned them around. 

&amp;nbsp;

There is something to be said about having a team that has finished this close to the playoffs 2 out of the last 3 years. That thing is: You know, they’re actually pretty good. We are all proud to be fans of this team.

&amp;nbsp;

Really though, we are still waiting. We have the longest drought in baseball the second longest in of the “4 Major Sports.” But wait we will. 

&amp;nbsp;

Only a few things remain to be said. My fellow fans will fill you in on those in the rest of the comments.

&amp;nbsp;

Using this season as a springboard, I cannot wait for next year. Until then, let’s gather ourselves around a hot stove.

A helicopter with a pilot and a single passenger was flying
around above Seattle when a malfunction disabled all of the
aircraft's navigation and communications equipment.

Due to the darkness and haze, the pilot could not determine the
helicopter's position and course to get back to the airport.

The pilot saw a tall building with lights on and flew toward it,
the pilot had the passenger draw a handwritten sign reading,
""WHERE AM I?"", and hold it up for the building's occupants to
see.

People in the building quickly responded to the aircraft, drew a
large sign, and held it in a building window.

Their sign said, ""YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER.""

The pilot smiled, waved, looked at his map, determined the
course to steer to SEATAC airport, and landed safely.

After they were on the ground, the passenger asked the pilot how
the ""YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER"" sign helped determine their

Your running backs are doing their best impression of the Last of the Mohicans, and your quarterback is being outscored by random kickers on the waiver wire.

This goes out to my brothers who lost in the 2014 championship because your opponent picked up Knile Davis after you discovered the waivers didn't reset in the playoffs and your Jamaal Charles was ruled out for the grand finale.

This goes out to my brothers who started Calvin Johnson against Seattle in 2015 when he caught a pass, grasped the ball in his hand, extending it towards the goal line on the last drive of the game, just as Kam Chancellor punched it out of his hands. That potential +6 points turned into a fumble, and you lost on Monday night.

This goes out to all my brothers who started Giovani Bernard week 1 against the Jets this season and ended up with 4 points. Then you benched Gio to start Danny Woodhead the next week (who ended up severely injured) while Gio piled up 20 points against Pittsburgh.

This goes out to all my brothers who planned for this season elaborately, drafted well, and put together a solid team that just can't win.

------


The Clinton Campaign may be using their media ties and BLM ties to distract americans with over-coverage of 'protests'. I went to the BLM wikipedia and found every single protest for the year 2016 and then searched the same week for Hillary Clinton. 

The first thing that is interesting is CTR has completely whitewashed google. If you search during those times, only positive Hillary articles are returned. So I switched to bing, and it was like magic: all of the skeletons started falling out of the closet. 


After every major controversial event that hurts Hillary comes out, there is a 2 day period in between her event and a BLM shooting. Hundreds of people are shot every single year by police - but only like 20% of them make it to the continuous news loop status (Michael brown, tamir rice, alton brown, freddie gray etc etc). They have to be just scanning frequencies and trying to find stories to mine. Either way, the ensuing protests and race debate distracts viewers from any sort of Clinton news and keeps networks busy with footage of rioting and looting.

Welcome back!

Week 2 was actually pretty reasonable for most of us. There were a few landmines, but overall, the good teams did fairly well and the bad teams did fairly poorly. Most of the surprises for D/STs were in the back half of the rankings, and that's not the kind of team that any of us land on anyway. Now, 2015's influence on the sample size is roughly half of what it was in Week 1. The 16 games from last year count as much as the 2 games this year. That's going to lead to some wonky things in the results, but they should be fairly easy to spot.

**[Defense Wins Championships, Week 3](https://empeopled.com/p/93764)**

This week's top teams (MFL Standard scoring):

Rank | Team | Points | Tier | Notes
:--------: | :-------- | :--------: | :--------: | :--------
1 | Carolina Panthers | 11.1 | 1 | Sick of seeing them at the top yet?
2 | Green Bay Packers | 10.5 | 1 | I think this is their highest ranking in 5 years
3 | Miami Dolphins | 10.5 | 1 | Oh the Browns...
4 | Seattle Seahawks | 10.0 | 2 | Not panicking yet, and their defense hasn't been their problem.
5 | Houston Texans | 9.8 | 2 | If there were such things as ""trap games"" this would be it
6 | Denver Broncos | 9.4 | 2 | No public line yet; keep an eye on Vegas
7 | Cincinnati Bengals | 9.3 | 2 | Same as above. See the article for details
8 | Arizona Cardinals | 9.0 | 2 | Stupid sexy Cardinals

**(The top 16 teams, and whichever extras are on the same tier as #16, can be found in the link above)**

Most ""Should I start Team A or Team B!?"" questions can be answered very simply by the rankings. There's no magic to it, especially this early in the season. If you have the option of Team A or Team B, and both teams are on the same tier, then the distinction between them is very marginal! Do not stress yourself out about choosing between them. Look at the following week's matchup to see if either option has an edge, and then go from there. Remember, if your league uses different scoring from MFL (which is similar - but not exactly the same - as ESPN, Yahoo!, CBS, et al), then you may need to use some of your own intuition to parse two similar choices.

Best of luck in Week 3!",fantasyfootball,1702

##**Accountability Section**

I think it’s important to look back at the previous week and see what I got right and what I got wrong, so you guys know you’re not reading advice from a complete sham. Here are the major things I was able to gather:

**What I got wrong:**

•	Adrian Peterson: He unexpectedly bombed when the Titans were able to stop him by stacking the box. Perhaps it was because Shaun Hill is not a threatening passer. Peterson has dealt with stacked boxes before so it is a bit concerning long term. Either way, I was WAY off, predicting RB1 numbers for the veteran RB.

•	Todd Gurley: Another case of talented back meets stacked box. Gurley and AP are in similar situations; they’re very talented, with bad quarterbacks who defenses do not respect. I also predicted RB1 numbers for Gurley and that couldn’t have been further from the truth.

•	The Panthers Offense: I overestimated the Denver defense and underestimated Cam Newton and Kelvin Benjamin. I won’t make that mistake again; Kelvin looks like he’s back in a big way. I was right about Olsen as a solid TE1 and Jonathan Stewart as a poor start, however.

•	Danny Woodhead: I said he would fair very poorly against the Kansas City Chiefs, as he has done in the past, but Woodhead scorched them, getting 20+ carries and large passing volume for one of the highest RB scores of the week. I was very, very wrong and I won’t be underestimating Woodhead again. With Allen done for the season, he’s a large part of this offense going forward.

•	Tyrod Taylor: I said he had a safe floor, yeesh, so much for that. The Ravens shut him down and it’s now quite obvious that he is not a good fantasy start with Watkins not at 100%. 

**What I got right:**

•	Jordan Matthews: I predicted him as a high upside WR2/3 against the Browns. I like him even more now after seeing that volume.

•	Barnidge and Walker: I predicted target share reductions for Gary Barnidge and Delanie Walker as a result of their morphing offenses and I was correct, although I still recommended them as starts. I didn’t think their target shares would decrease THAT much!

•	Charles Sims: He didn’t hit his ceiling, but Sims did show off that very valuable flex floor I talked about in my first write up. He even caught a touchdown and put his low-end RB2 numbers! Not too shabby, Sims.

•	Jameis Winston: I said he’d put up QB1 numbers this week, which I don’t think was a particularly popular opinion going into the matchup. He certainly did that. I love the Buccaneers offense going forward, even going into their tough pre-bye schedule.

•	Isaiah Crowell: One of my most controversial picks of the weeks, I said Crowell would put up Flex to RB2 type numbers, and by God, he did it! Crowell finished as the RB16 on the week in PPR. 

---

Now there was obviously a lot more that I got wrong, and a lot more that I got right, but those felt notable to me. There are always going to be hits and misses in fantasy analysis and I’ll always try to explain my reasoning. I hope nobody got too badly burned by any of my advice last week, and I especially hope it was helpful to some of you. With that being said, let’s get into the week’s matchups:

##**Jets @ Bills**

•	**Ryan Fitzpatrick** should continue to be a serviceable QB2 in this matchup against a team that made the shambling corpse of Mike Wallace look good last week. I like **Brandon Marshall** to rebound well from his disappointing week 1 showing and put up the low end WR1 numbers we were expecting. **Eric Decker**AKA “Mr. Consistency”  is as always a great WR2 play, and he should perform better than last week – he was targeted 7 times but only hauled in 2 catches. **Quincy Enunwa** made a great case for himself, tying Brandon Marshall for a team-high 8 targets – he is an intriguing waiver add and flex play. 

•	One major fact we learned from week 1 is that the split between **Matt Forte** and **Bilal Powell** was probably overblown. Forte operated as a workhorse, and is an RB1 for the foreseeable future on workload alone. Powell’s status diminishes to very low-end flex/handcuff status.

•	I was going to write that we shouldn’t overreact to Week 1’s very bad no good **Tyrod Taylor** performance. However, with news that Sammy Watkins is dealing with serious pain in his foot, this whole offense takes a downgrade. Without Watkins’ playmaking ability, Taylor will be no more than a low end QB2. If he’s your every week starter in a 1QB league, it’s time to look to the waiver wire. **Sammy Watkins** was a good rebound candidate after a disappointing week 1, but with this news I would downgrade him to a boom or bust WR3. Start safer options if you can until he’s proved himself. I wouldn’t want to start **Robert Woods** or **Charles Clay** under most circumstances - as second and third passing options on a run-first offense, their good weeks will be difficult to predict and few and far between.

•	**LeSean McCoy** was the lone solid fantasy start for the Bills, and he should continue to be a solid start as the workhorse on a run-first team. There is, however, legitimate concern that defenses stack the box on him without Watkins as a downfield threat, and this could seriously hurt McCoy’s efficiency. If Watkins does play, however, his mere presence should improve things for McCoy. McCoy will be more of an RB2 against a stout Jets run defense either way. **Mike Gillislee** is his handcuff. 

##**Cowboys @ Redskins**

•	**Dak Prescott** was not asked to do many fantasy-productive things on Sunday, rushing only twice and throwing mostly checkdowns. This prevented him from throwing interceptions as intended, but also kept him from scoring any touchdowns. It’s obvious the Cowboys want to play to their strengths and be a run-first team with first round pick **Ezekiel Elliott** who received 20 attempts and can be fired up as an RB1 against a weak Redskins run defense. This development is concerning for **Dez Bryant** who received only 5 targets. It’s not time to panic yet, but Bryant’s skill set does not mesh with what the Cowboys want to do right now. **Jason Witten** performed well as he usually does against Giants – he is a low end TE1. **Cole Beasly** got a whopping 12 targets and with Prescott throwing so many checkdowns, there is potential for it to keep up. Beasly is a potential season-long flex play if things keep going to plan for the Cowboys.

•	**Kirk Cousins** didn’t look good Monday night, throwing poorly for no touchdowns and two interceptions. It’s not a good sign for those who drafted Cousins late as a bargain QB1, but the good news is QB is so deep you should be able to find a good replacement! Cousins is no more than a QB2 going forward. **DeSean Jackson** drew 10 targets and made good use of them, going for over 100 yards. He’ll have a tougher time this week against the Cowboys who are hard on the passing game, and is a boom or bust WR3. **Jamison Crowder** interestingly received just as many targets as Jackson, but wasn’t able to do nearly as much with them – he is a WR4/deep league flex. **Pierre Garcon** was also involved in the passing game but will only be a desperation flex in this tougher matchup. **Jordan Reed** was targeted a team high 11 times and is the best TE in football with Rob Gronkowski out – he’s your every week TE1 as long as he’s healthy. **Matt Jones** looked dreadful, receiving only 7 carries which he turned in 24 scoreless yards – the Redskins basically abandoned the run game. It makes **Chris Thompson** a much more intriguing option, particularly in PPR leagues – he was more involved when the Redskins needed to play catchup. Jones is a flex play against a weak Cowboys run defense, as is Chris Thompson in PPR formats.

##**Chiefs @ Texans**

•	**Alex Smith** is a rock solid QB2 because of his rushing floor who will occasionally turn in great performances like last week. **Jeremy Maclin** turned in a solid week 1 for owners despite a tougher matchup, he is the quintessential high-end WR2.  The other top option in Kansas City’s passing game, **Travis Kelce**, is an every-week TE1 on volume. **Chris Conley** receiving 7 targets (as many as Kelce and Maclin) is surprising – he’s not worth an add yet but keep an eye out, he is a talented deep threat.

•	**Spencer Ware** is so crazy good. He showed off his impressive receiving abilities and was totally gameflow-proof. Without Charles he’s an every week RB1. Even when **Jamaal Charles** returns, Ware has earned a significant chunk of the carries. Charles and Ware will likely become RB2s in this split, but I’d favor the younger RB without health issues. When Charles does return **Charcandrick West** will likely be fully put in the backup role. 

•	The Texan’s offense looks as good as advertised against the Bear’s lowly defense, but they will all face a tougher matchup against Kansas City. **Brock Osweiler** will be a mid to low end QB2 in week 2. **DeAndre Hopkins** is an every week WR1 with his talent. Hopkins owners shouldn’t worry about **Will Fuller** receiving more targets, it will happen from time to time but Fuller is a boom or bust WR3. Not to say Fuller doesn’t have value, he has GREAT value, and should be the number one waiver claim if he’s available. Osweiler clearly loves to throw to him. **Lamar Miller** operated as a clear workhorse, toting the ball 28 times against the Bears, and as a result of this rare workload he should be considered an RB1 even in the tougher matchup.

##**Bengals @ Steelers**

•	With only one threatening weapon, **Andy Dalton** is a mid to high end QB2 in most matchups. That one threatening weapon, **AJ Green**, is the guy you really want. Showing that the offseason speculation about his ridiculous workload was justified, AJ Green caught 12 of 13 targets whilst on a visit to Revis Island. He’s a WR1 in any matchup, and may wind up THE WR1 if things keep up. **Brandon LaFell** and **Tyler Boyd** are picking up the leftovers in the passing game, and LaFell looked like the most efficient of the two. LaFell would be a low end flex, and Boyd is safely droppable.

•	**Jeremy Hill** will be a threat to score a goal line TD any given week, and as such he is a high end flex/RB3, but his efficiency and matchup against the Steelers leave much to be desired. **Giovani Bernard** was surprisingly less involved in the Bengals offensive plan against the Jets than expected. The Steelers are a better matchup for him than Hill, but I would qualify him as a flex play.

•	The Big Three, **Ben Roethlisberger**, **Antonio Brown**, and **DeAngelo Williams** (for now) showed how good they are against the Redskins Monday night. Each of them are in the first tier of their respective positions this week against Cincinnati. **Eli Rogers** made a case for himself as the Steelers’ WR2 and is worth a pickup in deeper leagues just in case, but with **Markus Wheaton** coming back, and **Sammie Coates** still vying for his chance, it’s getting a bit muddy for my tastes. **Jesse James** looks like a decent TE1, getting enough targets, and with plenty of chances in the red zone thanks to the Steelers’ explosive offense. If you need a TE1 replacement, grab him up.

##**49ers @ Panthers**

•	**Blaine Gabbert** gets the Panthers this week, and it’s gonna be a disaster. The one fantasy positive on this team in PPR formats, **Jeremy Kerley** should rack up checkdown targets and make a case for himself as a strong PPR flex – he is one of my top waiver adds this week. Chip Kelly uses the slot receiver heavily. **Torrey Smith** looks done – he does not play to Gabbert’s talents. **Carlos Hyde** had a great week against the horrible, awful, no good Rams, but rarely will the 49ers ever be up by multiple scores again this season. That will certainly not be the case against the Panthers. Game flow will render Hyde an RB3, and bring **Shaun Draughn** in for more passing downs, though I wouldn’t flex him until we see how the targets shake out this week – it could all go to Kerley. **Vance MCdonald** was able to catch a touchdown, but was otherwise pretty uninvolved. I think his role may increase in future weeks and the touchdown means he’s viable as a streamer.

•	**Cam Newton** draws the easiest matchup on paper against the 49ers. He should be a huge part of both this game getting out of hand, as well as running out the clock once the 49ers fate is sealed. He is, as ever, a QB1. **Kelvin Benjamin** showed last week that he’s still a WR1, and if he can do it against the Broncos he should have no trouble against the 49ers. **Greg Olsen** is an every week TE1 as a critical part of this offense. **Jonathan Stewart** gets a much better matchup than last week and can be trusted as an RB2 who will help run out the clock.

##**Ravens @ Browns**

•	The Browns defense looked pitiful last week, so we’re gonna want to start some Ravens this week. **Joe Flacco** goes from QB2 to low-end QB1 with the plus matchup. **Steve Smith**, though quiet last week, received the most targets (9) on the team, but was inefficient with them. Those targets should translate to production against the Browns, and I’d feel alright about starting him in the WR3/Flex positions in a boom or bust capacity. **Mike Wallace** also impressed on his 6 targets, showing more efficiency than Steve Smith, putting him in the flex range against the Browns. **Kamar Aiken** looked uninvolved last week and is safely droppable.

•	**Justin Forsett** and **Terrance West** formed a near even split last week and I would expect that to continue. Getting 10 and 12 carries respectively, I would consider them flexable against the Browns but their upsides are each capped by the other.

•	Welp, unfortunately **Robert Griffin III** was injured Week 1, so **Josh McCown** will now be leading the charge for the Browns’ offense – and it’s not necessarily a bad thing. It’s an especially nice boost for **Gary Barnidge** who thrived with McCheckdown in 2015, owners can feel more confident rolling him out as their TE1. **Terrelle Pryor** and **Corey Coleman** remain boom or bust WR3s; it will be interesting to see how the targets shake out with McCown under center. 

•	**Duke Johnson** should also benefit from McCown’s checkdowns in PPR formats – he’s a Flex option against the Ravens.**Isaiah Crowell** performed fairly well against the Eagles, but I like his outlook slightly less this week against a tougher opponent. He is a touchdown dependent RB3.

##**Titans @ Lions**

•	**Marcus Mariota** was serviceable for fantasy purposes against the tough Vikings D, so I like his odds against the defensively inferior Lions. The Lions also have a good offense that could drive the score up on the Titans, forcing Mariota to throw the ball. That’s good news for rookie **Tajae Sharpe**, who led the team in targets by a wide margin operating as their WR1. Sharpe is a solid WR3/Flex play this week. **Delanie Walker** did suffer the predicted volume reduction as a result of new additions Sharpe, **Rishard Matthews** and **Andre Johnson**. I would give him another chance as your TE1 in this plus matchup, but that is as far as I’d go with the Titans’ passing game.

•	**DeMarco Murray** is, for now, in command of this run-first offense backfield over **Derrick Henry**, which is very good news for Murray’s fantasy owners. He rushed 13 times to Henry’s 5, and was targeted in the passing game 7 times to Henry’s 2. Henry is a great handcuff, but flex value is a stretch right now. Murray, on the other hand, is an every week RB2 with a nice floor thanks to his involvement in the passing game.

•	**Matt Stafford** will continue to excel in this offensive scheme in this matchup. The Titans defense doesn’t scare me. I’m rolling out **Marvin Jones** and **Golden Tate** as upside WR3s, with preference to Jones who received deeper targets. The Titans defense is good at stopping the run, so I don’t feel good about **Ameer Abdullah** this week, but given his play last week I think he’s earned RB3/flex consideration. Same goes for **Theo Riddick** who is a solid flex in PPR. **Eric Ebron** looks quite involved in the offense and is a nice lower end TE1 play; with his size he should be used in the red zone.

##**Dolphins @ Patriots**

•	This should be quick because there are only three fantasy relevant Dolphins. **Ryan Tannehill** is a mid-to-low end QB2 with **Jarvis Landry**, a solid PPR WR2, his only dependable receiver. **Arian Foster** looked good against the Seahawks and I expect him to put up solid RB2 numbers for as long as he’s healthy – start him while you’ve got him.

•	**Jimmy Garoppolo** functioned well as a real life football player in Week 1 but will remain only a QB2 for fantasy purposes. **Julian Edelman** and **Chris Hogan** served as New England’s top two receivers in terms of offensive snaps played. Edelman is a WR2 until Brady returns, and Hogan is a prime bench stash or desperation flex play. **Danny Amendola** is either warming up from his injury or is less involved in the offense this season, I wouldn’t trust him. **Rob Gronkowski** will likely be out another week and yet **Martellus Bennett** primarily served as a blocker last week. Bennett will be difficult to trust as the Patriots are targeting their WRs for now with Brady out.

•	The Patriots should dominate this game, so it figures to be a **LeGarrette Blount** type of game. I like him for RB2 numbers, with a pretty good shot at the end zone. **James White** should also be involved, albeit less so than in close games – he’s a flex play in PPR leagues.

##**Saints @ Giants**

•	This game has definite shootout appeal because it involves **Drew Brees** and the ever generous New Orleans defense. Brees is an obvious QB1 but what about his receivers? Well, once again, I would start (almost) everyone I can. **Brandin Cooks** is an obvious WR1. **Willie Snead** exploded last week in a very good way but I don’t think anyone is ready to anoint him a WR1 yet – a WR2 though, with upside? Absolutely. **Mark Ingram** is still an RB1 play against the Giants despite a lackluster performance Week 1 – it remains to be seen if **Travaris Cadet’s** targets in the passing game will stick or if they were merely a fluke consequence of Brees spreading the ball around. **Coby Fleener** had a disastrous and concerning week 1, but this is still a great matchup. As an owner myself, I’m treating this as a second and final chance for him to get things going in this prolific offense – start a safer option if possible, but don’t drop him yet. **Michael Thomas** is a flex play in this offense where anybody could explode – the 6 targets last week weren’t bad either.

•	With three solid wide receiver options to throw the ball too **Eli Manning** is looking more and more like a true QB1 this season. **Odell Beckham** is an automatic WR1 start – the Cowboys just proved last week that they are offensive kryptonite with their clock killing playstyle, which slowed Beckham down. **Victor Cruz** and **Sterling Shepard** received 4 targets apiece, which should increase in this shootout, and each caught a touchdown. Both are viable flex plays this week. I don’t see too much value in the tight end situation between **Larry Donnell** and **Will Tye** but I suppose you could take a shot on one if truly desperate in a deep league.

•	**Rashad Jennings** should be able to get more going this week against the Saints putrid defense. I like him as an RB2 in this contest. **Shane Vereen** will come into play when the Giants are down and is passable as a low end flex.

##**Buccaneers @ Cardinals**

•	The Buccaneers begin their nightmare schedule against the Cardinals at home. **Jameis Winston** becomes a high end QB2 against this very tough defense. **Mike Evans** will be covered heavily by Patrick Peterson which will impact his floor and ceiling – Evans is still a good WR2 play on the basis of volume and talent. **Vincent Jackson** was targeted just as much as Evans, but did not look nearly as good – he is not even a flex play in this tough matchup. Despite the TD, **Austin Seferian-Jenkins** is in a muddled timeshare with fellow TEs **Brandon Myers** and **Cameron Brate**. I would have a hard time trusting any Buccaneer TE. 

•	**Doug Martin** received the heavy workload we were all hoping for and that should continue in week 2. Roll him out as a nice RB2 this week. **Charles Sims** showed off his tackle breaking ability and safe flex floor last week, and that will continue in this game. Start him safely as a flex with upside for more if the Buccaneers go down hard early and need to pass.

•	**Carson Palmer** proved me wrong in Week 1 and turned in a solid QB1 performance in Week 1, and I expect it to continue against an easier opponent in Week 2. With this array of weapons, it is hard to deny Palmer will be good most of the season. **Larry Fitzgerald** laughs in the face of time and dominated against the Patriots last week, he will be a low end WR1 this week. **Michael Floyd** was the next WR up for the Cardinals, and makes for a rock solid WR3 play. **John Brown** played significantly last snaps than Fitzgerald and Floyd, and is a low end flex play at best. **David Johnson** is a beautiful unicorn of an every-down back and you’ve gotta start him as an RB1 every week.

##**Seahawks @ Rams**

•	The Rams usually keep these divisional games interesting but **Russell Wilson** is a QB1 regardless. **Doug Baldwin** is in play as a WR2 as the most targeted player on the team by far. **Tyler Lockett** was the next most targeted player in the passing game, but his role is still uncertain – he’s a risky WR3. **Jermaine Kearse** was the third passing option for Seattle and not one that I’m interested in for fantasy purposes. **Jimmy Graham** can still not be trusted coming off of his patellar tendon injury. **Thomas Rawls** started the second half of week 1 and became more involved. Pete Carroll said after the game that Rawls’ workload is clear to be increased. This spells the likely end of the Awakening of **Christine Michael** barring an injury to Rawls. Rawls will be an RB2 against the Rams and Michael would be a risky flex.

•	I have never seen a scene as gruesome as the one I witnessed on Monday night. **Case Keenum** looked clueless, and the offense looked uninterested in winning as the Rams went for punt after punt after INT after punt after INT after punt. Some people think **Todd Gurley** will bounce back – I’m legitimately concerned about his chances of doing so. Gameflow is going to be a huge hindrance on his performance, and defenses will stack the box on him if Keenum continues to be under center. I’m not so sure **Jared Goff** or **Sean Mannion** would improve things over Keenum either. It is truly worrying and I would only feel safe starting Gurley as my RB3 against a much tougher Seahawks defense. There is no way you can consider starting any Rams passing option for the foreseeable future. May God have mercy on their souls. 

##**Jaguars @ Chargers**

•	**Blake Bortles** draws a nice matchup against the Chargers who just got lit up by Alex Smith – he’s a QB1 this week. **Allen Robinson**, as always, is an elite WR1 start, and you can expect good things in this matchup (EDIT: as noted by /u/space_is_fun Robinson may be covered by CB Jason Verrett, which should negatively impact his floor and ceiling, but I still like him to produce WR2 numbers with upside). In a potential shootout **Allen Hurns** will be a solid WR3/Flex as a threat to enter the end zone. Monitor his injury situation, but if he suits up you can feel good about starting **Julius Thomas** as your TE1. Although inefficient in Week 1, **TJ Yeldon** gets one of the worst defenses against the run and should put up good RB2 fantasy numbers once again this week as long as **Chris Ivory** is held out as expected.

•	**Philip Rivers** is just not playing at his ceiling without **Keenan Allen** and I can’t endorse him as more than a low-end QB1 without him. However, other members of this offense will see their roles increase. **Antonio Gates** sees his already considerable redzone upside increase a bit, so fire him up as a TE1 with as good a chance as anyone to score a TD. **Travis Benjamin** and **Tyrell Williams** will see the biggest boost out of the receiving corps. Benjamin is the early favorite for a production increase but I believe Williams is the one you want to own in the end; he has the size and athletic ability to become special if things work out. **Danny Woodhead** should see 2015 levels of production once more; he was involved heavily in Week 1 even when the Chargers were up. Woodhead is a boom or bust RB2, much like in 2015. Woodhead nearly doubled **Melvin Gordon’s** snap count in week 1, which is concerning for Gordon’s outlook. If Gordon is not the primary back when the Chargers have a lead (not the case Week 1) it will be hard to trust him outside of an RB3/flex capacity. 

##**Falcons @ Raiders**

•	Another game with shootout potential, I like **Matt Ryan’s** chances at QB1 numbers in this game throwing to a nice array of weapons. **Julio Jones** is an every-week WR1. **Mohamed Sanu** if active, looks worthy of low-end WR2, definite WR3/Flex consideration with his impressive 8 targets. **Jacob Tamme** received the kind of volume (8 targets) that makes for decent TE streamers in good matchups like this one. **Tevin Coleman** and **Devonta Freeman** are in the throes of a full blown RBBC, and who does better in any given week is anyone’s guess at this point; Coleman has the hot hand right now. Both are excellent flexes and low floor RB2s.

•	**Derek Carr** will benefit from yet another high scoring game to put up QB1 numbers. **Amari Cooper** should, like Mike Evans a week ago, put up WR1 numbers against the Falcons. **Michael Crabtree** is an underrated bet to put up solid WR2 numbers, even if followed by Trufant he will get the volume to overcome it. **Latavius Murray** will be a lock for RB2 production with volume on his side. **Jalen Richard** was a fluke on only 3 carries. **Clive Walford** is a fringe TE streaming option.

##**Colts @ Broncos**

•	**Andrew Luck** and the Colts get a rough matchup on the road against the Broncos, who should be able to exploit the Colts’ porous offensive line and rough Luck up. I’d prefer to stream decent QBs with better matchups over him this week. That’s bad news for **TY Hilton**, **Donte Moncrief**, and **Phillip Dorsett** in the passing game, though they still hold plenty of value as a WR2, high end flex and low end flex respectively. **Dwayne Allen** is still a TE1, as the Broncos are surprisingly generous to the tight end position from a fantasy perspective. **Frank Gore** should get swallowed up by the Denver defense behind that bad o-line, he is a risky RB3.

•	**Trevor Siemian** isn’t anybody you’d ever want to start but he can support fantasy viable receivers. **Demaryius Thomas** is currently questionable to play coming off of a hip injury, and I’d feel very risky starting him this week unless better news comes out closer to game time; with the news I have now I’d say sit him for better options if you can. Thomas’ loss is **Emmanuel Sanders** gain however, and he should rack up a ton of targets against the Colts this week for solid WR2 numbers. **Virgil Green** looks like a favorite of Siemian’s and although he had a mediocre week, he got the requisite targets for a streaming tight end (5) and was also targeted in the end zone. You could do worse for your streamer or fill in. **CJ Anderson** will continue rolling to RB1 numbers this week against the Colts who couldn’t even contain Ameer Abdullah last week.

##**Packers @ Vikings**

•	The Vikings are a tough defense, so expect a middling performance for **Aaron Rodgers** – although a middling performance from Aaron Rodgers is still a QB1. To give you an idea, he has averaged 17.225 Yahoo standard fantasy points in his last four games against Minnesota. With the offense fully healthy once again, **Jordy Nelson** and **Randall Cobb** should be locks to produce WR2 numbers. **Davante Adams** received just two fewer targets than Jordy Nelson last week, and only one fewer than Cobb. He failed to haul in more than half of them but made a catch where it counted in the end zone. He may have taken a step forward since last year and should be on the flex radar if he can keep it up. **Eddie Lacy** should have no problem racking up solid RB2 numbers week in and week out with the offense running smoothly again. **Jared Cook** and **Richard Rodgers** have knocked one another out of fantasy relevancy barring an injury or a breakout; don’t start ‘em til they prove it.

•	**Shaun Hill** is out, **Sam Bradford** is in. Hopefully it won’t affect **Stefon Diggs** who was on fire last week with his 9 targets – I believe he is talented enough t o warrant WR3 consideration each and every week. **Kyle Rudolph** rose from the dead Week 1, finishing as a decent starting TE. If you’re desperate at the position you could do a lot worse if he keeps up his target share. **Adrian Peterson** had a miserable Week 1, but should bounce back to post at least low end RB2 numbers this week. His lack of involvement in the passing game is concerning, and time may be catching up with him. If that’s the case, there’s little fantasy owners have to hope for in terms of his efficiency improving – so let’s hope it was just a bad week because the defense didn’t respect Shaun Hill. I’ll be watching **Jerick McKinnon** to see if offseason hype about him holding standalone flex value on third down was legitimate or just smoke.

##**Eagles @ Bears**

•	**Carson Wentz** looked pretty good against the Browns, and is worthy of streamer consideration against the Bears in Week 2. **Zach Ertz** will be out for some time with a rib injury, and that means **Jordan Matthews** will be locked into a heavy workload similar to the one he received in Week 1. Matthews is a high upside WR2 in this matchup – volume is king, and he’s talented. **Ryan Mathews** should have a slightly tougher time this week against the Bears as compared to the Browns; he's still an RB2 on volume however. **Darren Sproles** is a dual threat as a runner and pass catcher but he was relatively uninvolved last week in favor of Mathews, he’s a low end flex in my book.  **Nelson Agholor** is too unproven with too small a target share for me to trust him in my lineup.

•	**Jay Cutler** is a mid to low end QB2 with only one viable weapon in the passing game. **Alshon Jeffery** should feast this week with Eagles’ top corner Leodis McKelvin likely out with a hamstring injury – he’s a solid low end WR1. **Jeremy Langford** operated as a true bellcow in week 1 and we should expect a good week of RB2 production since he’s going against the Eagles who allowed Isaiah Crowell to go for 5.17 YPC. **Zach Miller** and **Kevin White** struggled last week, which I don’t anticipate changing here; if anything it solidifies and justifies Alshon’s role as the one true playmaker in this offense.

Welcome back!

Week 1 is always a little rough, and 2016 is no exception. For the most part the surprises weren't too traumatic, but overall it was a very low-scoring week. Only one team scored a D/ST TD, although they did it twice, and the rest of the league kept their scoring fairly tame. Kansas City and Los Angeles were the two biggest disappointments, whereas Minnesota, Miami, and San Francisco all vastly outperformed expectations.

The average MFL score on the week was just 5.8 points. Expect that to bump up by almost 3 points going forward (for reference, 2015 averaged 8.5 points per game among all D/STs).

Week 2 gives us a few solid options for streamers, as well as a few teams that rank a little lower than I certainly expected to see. It will be interesting to see how it all turns out!

**[Defense Wins Championships, Week 2](https://empeopled.com/p/93452)**

This week's top teams (MFL Standard scoring):

Rank | Team | Points | Tier | Notes
:--------: | :-------- | :--------: | :--------: | :--------
1 | Carolina Panthers | 11.3 | 1 | SF nowhere near as good as in Week 1
2 | New England Patriots | 10.1 | 1 | Lock in the Patriots for the next few weeks
3 | Denver Broncos | 9.7 | 2 | 
4 | Pittsburgh Steelers | 9.6 | 2 | Primary streaming option
5 | Seattle Seahawks | 9.3 | 2 | Don't be fooled, they should be tier 1
6 | NY Jets | 9.2 | 2 | Secondary streaming option
7 | Houston Texans | 9.2 | 2 | 
8 | Philadelphia Eagles | 8.8 | 3 | Tertiary streaming option

**(The top 16 teams, and whichever extras are on the same tier as #16, can be found in the link above)**

Most ""Should I start Team A or Team B!?"" questions can be answered very simply by the rankings. There's no magic to it, especially this early in the season. If you have the option of Team A or Team B, and both teams are on the same tier, then the distinction between them is very marginal! Do not stress yourself out about choosing between them. Look at the following week's matchup to see if either option has an edge, and then go from there. Remember, if your league uses different scoring from MFL (which is similar - but not exactly the same - as ESPN, Yahoo!, CBS, et al), then you may need to use some of your own intuition to parse two similar choices.

Best of luck in Week 2!",fantasyfootball,2122
IamHowardMoxley,2016-09-11 23:08:45+00:00,WANTED: single female roommate,"I noticed a purse lying inside of a garbage bin one night while throwing away a receipt. Inside, there was 1 wallet, stripped of everything but business cards. 2 tubes of chap and lipstick, shattered cell phone, a lovely Amethyst necklace, and 3 pages torn out from a spiral notebook, written in loopy neat handwriting. Feminine writing. There seems to be one page missing. The pages have two symmetrical blood stains, as if it was folded when blood soaked into it. They have been typed verbatim:

&amp;nbsp;

“the ad has been removed from Craig's List already. This is what it said:

&amp;nbsp;
“WANTED: single female roommate to share 800 SQF apartment near Pikes Place market, on 15th floor with gorgeous views of the city and sound with professional female. $500 a month, all utilities included.”

&amp;nbsp;
I called that hour- deals like this didn't last long in Seattle. The woman, Cathy, answered on the first ring. We agreed to meet and sign the paperwork that day. 

&amp;nbsp;
Her furnishings were gorgeous, even the ones in my own room. She seemed very chill and had only one rule: her room was off limits. Curiosity got the better of me and I peeked in one day to see trash mixed with dirty clothes all over her room- I assumed she was ashamed of her personal space and didn't want me to see it. It was strange, as she kept rest of the apartment was spotless. 

&amp;nbsp;
My roommate was Cathy Nolan, a CPA who was going through a divorce at the end of her middle ages; she needed modern company more than cash, hence the cheap rent.  She felt “trapped” by her former life and needed a mentor to adjust her to the dating world of 2016. She started out reading my books, watching Netflix and listening to my music while smoking cannabis, something she hadn't done in 30 years. We had a lot of fun at first. 

&amp;nbsp;
Cathy wanted to meet my friends- I thought it was just her simple need to be around others- she said her past husband was possessive and hated the world at large, especially the people who would talk to her. I admit she fit in with my group of friends well only after a few days. 

&amp;nbsp;
Then she started using Castile soap as well. Then my kind of lotions, hair products, perfumes. Her makeup shifted to match my own glittery eyeshadow. She even died her hair purple and did it up to match my own. It was kind of ridiculous to see someone her age with purple hair, but I kinda laughed it off. I didn't want it to be a problem- living in the high-class tower had perks I didn't want to give up because some woman was going through a crisis and wanted her youth back. Besides, Cathy wasn't hurting me; in fact, she was the best friend I had in a while. 

&amp;nbsp;
All that changed when I found her apartment door unlocked and one of the apartment’s maintenance men were inside her room, where a leak from the floor above was pouring into Cathy's closet, where the circuit breaker was. The man said he had to get in before the panel got wet; Cathy was still at work, and her closet door was illegally padlocked. The man asked me if I had a key, and when I told him no, he cut it open. 

&amp;nbsp;
We both gasped without really knowing what we were looking at- they looked like  people, but smaller, dried but wrinkle-less, hard, but not rotted; they looked used up in a way I have never seen a human used up before. There were the naked bodies of men and women, all in the kneeling position against the closet which held no clothes at all. Each one had a small but deep incision on the back of their necks. Besides the bodies, there was a chest of drawers held stacks of notes, numbers and personal documents. He skimpy journal went back 15 years, all names of the previous roommates and potential roomates with crosses through their names, notes such as “infected” or “bad genes” or “madness” noted nearby. “Cathy Nolan” was the last roommate on the list, besides the latest block of names written three months ago with 102 names stricken off the list and my name circled. A note was made on a calendar 2 days from today: “make new ad for roommate”. 

&amp;nbsp;
The police spent the entire night trying to take a sample from the “people”. One of the technicians didn't even think it was real humans- he said the skin felt like “a vinyl record”. The police couldn't decide if my roommate was a murder, not without knowing if the bodies were real. The police's initial investigation found that this apartment went through 23 different roommate leases; most of these people have departing flights leaving the country, some are just listing as “missing”...several of those “missing” people appeared in her closet. 

&amp;nbsp;
No one could reach “Cathy”. They found a body under an overpass, withered to half of her size, skin hardened to rock like the bodies in the closet. The body looked like her and the purse confirmed her ID; the sample scraped from the body had no traceable DNA. I know they kept the body to study it, because they know the people were human before...whatever was living in them was turning them into something...I don't know. No one does, it seems.  

&amp;nbsp;
Thanks again for helping me do this. I know I found “Cathy”, or the thing that lives inside the people she's harvesting. She didn't go far, but she's doing the same old trick, saying the same old jokes and pulling the same tricks she did with me and my friends. I don't think she noticed me, but what I am doing freaks me out a little, I won't lie. I'm glad”

&amp;nbsp;

The letter ends there. It has been a week since I turned the purse and the letter to the police. They haven’t said a word since. 

&amp;nbsp;

Sometimes I wonder where ""Cathy"" is. How close she is...and if she watched me read the letter in the purse.",nosleep,1057

Ehan2,2016-09-07 23:06:29+00:00,Quick Thoughts on every Week 1 game,"**PRO TIP: CTRL+F the players you care about**

**Panthers @ Broncos**

* Trevor Siemian plays the role of game manager but still can complete plenty of short to intermediate passes to Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders, making them quite startable this week. Also working in their favor is the fact that they will be facing rookie CBs. Don’t be shocked if Virgil Green breaks out this week and becomes a hot week 1 waiver add; Siemian loved throwing to him in the preseason.

* Gary Kubiak returns to a run first offense and CJ Anderson receives a large workload, but can’t count on great efficiency against the Panthers D. I expect a good number of yards, around 80, and a score.

* Cam Newton against the Denver D worries me. We all saw how that went during the Superbowl. He will be great, but not this week. The entire offense will be slowed down. The recent announcement of more “spread out” playing time amongst the Carolina receivers isn’t exactly inspiring for their outlook either. Kelvin Benjamin is a very risky start. I would feel alright starting Greg Olsen though, his role is clearly defined.

* Jonathan Stewart’s outlook is even bleaker. Denver just shuts down the run and forces teams to throw. I would bench him for any better option this week.

**Vikings @ Titans**

 * Whether Shaun Hill or Sam Bradford winds up starting, I wouldn’t expect much production from either. The MIN QB will always be asked to merely manage games while Adrian Peterson is there. Because of the rocky QB situation I am in wait-and-see mode with Stefon Diggs. In a deep league I don’t think he’s a bad start as a flex though, he is very clearly their number one target.
 * Adrian Peterson will get a huge number of carries, that has always been evident. This game should be a low-scoring, run-heavy affair that goes in his favor. I worry about him over the long term but with fresh legs, he’s an easy RB1 this week.
 * Marcus Mariota and the Titans’ offense as a whole should see improvement this season with excellent rookie additions Derrick Henry and Tajae Sharpe, as well as veteran newcomers DeMarco Murray and Rishard Matthews. I think we will see more of the runners than the receivers on Sunday as this game projects to be a low-scoring affair. Look for Tajae Sharpe to dominate the short to intermediate passing game, however; he and Mariota seem to have a very nice connection going. Grab him off waivers if he’s there. Delanie Walker is a very solid TE start, though I think we will see his volume decrease somewhat from last year with Sharpe and Matthews on the team.
 * The workload split between Murray and Henry should lean Murray to begin the year. I like him as a low end RB2 this week, and I wouldn’t start Henry just yet. Look for Henry to increase his role as the year rolls on, however.

**Browns @ Eagles**

 * Robert Griffin III gets his first start in quite a while on the road without Josh Gordon. I’m not overly hopeful for his outlook this week but I do think a couple long bombs (his specialty) to Corey Coleman and/or Terrelle Pryor are likely. Corey Coleman should be peppered with targets as the number one WR in the offense, but as a rookie expectations must be tempered. I would start him as my WR3. Gary Barnidge, like Delanie Walker, faces volume reduction due to an influx of new WR talent, but I think he’s still a solid TE start.
 * Isaiah Crowell will be a boom or bust player depending on game flow, and I think the game flow will dictate a “boom” week for him this week. Philadelphia is poor against the run and the game should stay close enough that he will be involved most of the game. Start him as your flex or RB2 if you have a starter in a bad match up this week. As a result of Cleveland being able to keep this game close, Duke Johnson doesn't figure into the game plan as much, since he specializes on passing downs. I wouldn't start him this weak, but he should have value in games where Brown will be blown out (most other games).
 * Carson Wentz gets his first NFL start against the Browns, which bodes well, but I still expect him to struggle as he adjusts to the pros. Turnovers are likely here.  Jordan Matthews and Zach Ertz have their outlooks suffer somewhat with the rookie under center, but they have always been volume-dependent plays. I still like Matthews as a high upside WR2/3 against a very weak Browns defense. I would stream another TE option such as Walford or McDonald over Ertz, as I don’t see Wentz as able to support two fantasy relevant receivers at this point in his career, but I admit I could have this one wrong.
 * Ryan Mathews should run all over the Browns bad defense, start him wherever you can, simple as that. 

**Chargers @ Chiefs**

 * Philip Rivers should be a fine, startable-if-low-end QB1 this week, just don’t expect him to light up fantasy scoreboards this week against a tough Kansas City D. With Keenan Allen back, the offense should be back to its early 2015 level of excellence. Rivers will pass a lot in this game because Kansas City is tough on the run. Keenan Allen is a WR1 in PPR, as he will rack up a ton of targets and catches. Antonio Gates should also benefit to the tune of TE1 numbers. Sleeper Tyrell Williams might have a break out week, keep an eye on him.
 * Melvin Gordon faces aforementioned tough run defense. I wouldn’t expect much from this bounce back candidate just yet. Unfortunately that doesn’t help Danny Woodhead’s outlook either; Kansas City is one of the absolute toughest defenses on receiving backs as well. Woodhead has been nearly a non-factor in 3 out of the last 4 contests against KC. Avoid starting either SD running back this week if possible.
 * Alex Smith will do his thing against San Diego’s bad defense – most leagues won’t have him starting but I love his outlook in 2QB/Superflex leagues. Maclin should continue to benefit from his consistent 2015 workload and post solid WR2 numbers. Kelce is another solid start this week. The KC offense runs through these two players and its running back.
 * Spencer Ware is a must start this week with Jamaal Charles sidelined. He will ruin the Chargers defense. If he’s not owned in your league no matter the size or scoring go get him right now.

**Buccaneers @ Falcons**

 * Jameis Winston is slimmed down with an extra offseason of experience under his belt. Mike Evans and Vincent Jackson are both present and accounted for, with the former entering a likely third year breakout. I really like his outlook to put up low-to-mid QB1 numbers this week against the Falcons. Evans has struggled in this matchup before but I expect bigger and better things foir him this year. He has a solid floor and a very high ceiling. 
 * I expect receiving back Charles Sims will factor heavily into this game. Atlanta is one of the worst when it comes to defending receiving backs, and TB has said they want him more involved this year. Charles Sims has a flex floor and legit RB1 upside this week. I’m starting him where I can. Doug Martin is a very good RB1/2 on volume alone.
 * Matt Ryan is as ever an uninspiring but sound QB1 choice. The offense will funnel through Julio Jones, who will no doubt have an amazing, volume-heavy WR1 type of game.
 * Much has been made of the increase in Coleman’s carries, but I don’t think it will significantly hinder Freeman. Freeman makes his money in the receiving game and in the red zone, areas which should remain firmly in his grasp. I like him as an RB1, and don’t like Coleman very much at all. Watch to see how the split shakes out though, as it really is anyone’s guess how involved Coleman will be.

**Packers @ Jaguars**

 * This game has big shootout potential between two of the NFL’s most potent offenses. Aaron Rodgers and the Packers have one big question mark, however – Jordy Nelson’s involvement. Reports that he may not be able to play a full slate of snaps are concerning. Still, if you didn’t go WR-heavy in your draft it’d be hard not to start him. Keep an eye on his situation as we get closer to game day. Aaron Rodgers is a QB1 either way. Just having Jordy in the game at all should improve Randall Cobb’s outlook – he’s as good a WR2 as you can ask for. Jared Cook is a TE who could see himself heavily involved in the offense, don’t be surprised if he does well and becomes a hot waiver commodity.
 * Eddie Lacy gets a plum matchup in an offense looking to resurge. I believe in the comeback and think he will be a rock solid RB1 this week.
 * Blake Bortles will likely be throwing a lot which likely means big numbers – lots of yards, TDs and INTs. I think he is in for some regression from last year, but he will put up a solid performance this week in a shoot out. Allen Robinson should therefore deliver some excellent WR1 numbers as well. 
 * TJ Yeldon, as the passing down specialist in this offense, should have a better PPR week than Chris Ivory. Calling it now, I think Yeldon will be the back to own in this offense by season’s end. Still, Ivory is the safe bet for red zone looks, so he could be a solid flex play.

**Bears @ Texans**

 * Jay Cutler and Alshon Jeffery should connect heavily in this game. Cuter is merely a QB2 with few viable weapons. However, Alshon is healthy once again, and his primary competition for targets is Kevin White, a rookie who is reportedly still in progress. Alshon’s target share should be monstrous and you can safely fire him up as a WR1 this week. Zach Miller is an intriguing late round TE/streamer if you’re into that sort of thing, he did well with his opportunities last season.
 * Jeremy Langford shook off doubters this preseason, and seems locked in for a three down role with the Bears. Houston is not the most forgiving defense, but I still like Langford as a low-end RB2 on volume alone.
 * Brock Osweiler gets his first start as a Texan, and he shouldn’t start for your team. However, Brock shouldn’t have any problem feeding targets to DeAndre Hopkins, who you can fire up as a WR1. Aim your expectations towards the second half of 2015 Nuk rather than the first half Nuk, however. With Will Fuller, Lamar Miller and JJ Watt all expected to play their roles week 1, Houston is a more complete team who will not need to force the ball to Hopkins as much. Fuller is a boom or bust deep threat who I would prefer not to start, but he’s worth stashing just in case.
 * Lamar Miller has a great first matchup against a weak Bears defense and game flow should be on his side. Fire him up as your RB1 with confidence.

**Bills @ Ravens**

 * I think that the key Bills – Tyrod, Sammy and LeSean – all have pretty high floors this week. TyGod will keep himself from finishing poorly with his excellent rushing ability. A healthy Sammy is an extremely dangerous receiver who can definitely exploit the Ravens secondary. LeSean should get plenty of volume in a run-first offense that has rid itself of pesky Karlos Williams. I like all three of them as solid starts against a weaker team.
 * The entire Ravens offense, save Flacco, is a mystery to me. There is little to no clarity at their WR, RB or TE positions. The following are my best guesses. Mike Wallace seems to have built rapport with Flacco, but I’ll believe it when I see it. Steve Smith is talented but ancient – he is probably my favorite WR on the team for now until he is inevitably injured – I could see him as a WR3 or Flex. Breshad Perriman is finally injury-free and could certainly carve out a significant role later in the season, but not likely this week. 
 * Justin Forsett, despite getting cut, will likely lead the Ravens in carries this week. If not him, it will be Terrance West. Buck Allen, known as a pass catching back, only came to relevance last year when all other options went down to injury. The Ravens proceeded to draft one of the best pass catching backs in this year’s class. I’ll leave you to interpret that. Dixon is an alright stash for later this season, where he may earn a significant role, but this backfield is just too crowded in week 1. I would only start Forsett as a flex, and I wouldn’t feel great about it.

**Raiders @ Saints**

 * This is a good offenses vs bad defenses matchup where fantasy points will rain from the heavens, so you really want to start everyone you can. That goes for Derek Carr, Amari Cooper, Michael Crabtree, Latavius Murray, and even Clive Walford who should be a solid TE streamer in this matchup. Much has been made of DeAndre Washington stealing Murray’s job, but the Raiders have recently doubled down on endorsing Murray as the lead back. Washington might get some third down work, but I’d feel very comfortable with Murray as my RB2. 
 * The Saints are all healthy and fully operational. As with the Raiders, start everyone you can. Drew Brees is a QB1 and should deliver excellent performances to Brandin Cooks and Coby Fleener (despite offseason concerns). Willie Snead should produce solid flex numbers as well. Michael Thomas the rookie is an intriguing stash, but I wouldn’t start him until his role is defined. Mark Ingram puts up RB1 numbers when healthy, particularly in PPR, and this matchup should be one of his finest.

**Bengals @ Jets**

 * This is a bit of an ugly matchup for most everyone involved. Andy Dalton has one viable target – AJ Green, who is an excellent receiver who draws an excellent corner in Darrelle Revis. Now, Revis is another year older while AJ is still in his prime, but the floor has to be kept in mind when starting Green. I feel fine starting him because he should be force fed targets by Dalton, but don’t expect mind-blowing numbers this week. Brandon LaFell and Tyler Boyd might put up slightly better numbers this week as a result of Green’s CB matchup.
 * This will be more of a Giovani Bernard week than a Jeremy Hill week. Hill has to face the stout Jets run D, which makes me want to avoid starting him altogether. Bernard is a solid flex play in standard and PPR leagues.
 * Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker can both be safely started as a WR1 and WR2, respectively. I don’t see any reason they can’t keep up something resembling the pace they had with 
Ryan Fitzpatrick last season, unless Brandon Marshall falls off the age cliff this season. 
 * Matt Forte should be a solid PPR RB2, but keep Bilal Powell in mind as a potential PPR flex play. Coaches say the split between these two backs should be fairly close. 

**Dolphins @ Seahawks**

 * I wouldn’t want to start anyone but Jarvis Landry on the Dolphins. The Seahawks have such a dominant defense that I can’t trust Arian Foster in the running game (edit: Seahawks are easier on pass catching RBs, so I'm feeling better about Foster now. Decent floor as the Dolphins will be down and he may be used as a safety valve), and I certainly can’t trust Ryan Tannehill. DeVante Parker is likely to be sidelined with an injury. The only guy I see racking up points, particularly in PPR, is Landry.
 * Russell Wilson is a strong QB1, particularly in this matchup. I like Doug Baldwin as a WR2 with upside, depending on if we see the run-heavy Seahawks of the past or the pass-heavy Seahawks of last season. Tyler Lockett is an excellent player with volume concerns who I’d be happy with in my flex spot.
 * Are you team CMike or team Rawls? Either way this should be an interesting game to watch for the Seattle backfield. Right now it looks like the Hawks will ease Rawls in and feature CMike in the starter role for now. Whether that lasts depends on Michael’s play. If CMike is confirmed the starter between now and Sunday, I would start him as an RB2 against a week Miami run D. 

**Giants @ Cowboys**

 * Eli Manning and the gang should have a great game this week. Dallas is lacking in talented cornerbacks to reign in Odell Beckham, who has a solid chance to finish as the top scoring wide receiver this week along with Julio Jones and Antonio Brown. Sterling Shepard is a rookie with upside, but he should remain benched this week until we see how he adjusts to the NFL.
 * Rashad Jennings also figures to have a great week in terms of opportunity and game flow. With Andre Williams out of the picture he will get those goal line touches. I would start him as a solid RB2.
 * Dak Prescott could prove that he will be a great QB in this league, or falter as most rookie QBs would. Either way, I’m not counting out Dez Bryant – fire him up as the WR1 that he is, nothing about this matchup scares me away from him. Jason Witten is also a solid but unexciting TE1 play.
 * Ezekiel Elliott gets a great matchup to start his NFL career. Behind that O-line, he should get off to an incredible start as the Cowboys try to control the game by feeding him carries. Start him confidently as an RB1.

**Lions @ Colts**

 * This matchup has all the makings of another high-volume, high-fantasy point shootout. Matt Stafford should deliver QB1 numbers against the defensively weak Colts, who are missing three of their top CBs. Marvin Jones and Golden Tate will be the prime beneficiary. Both can be started as WR3s with WR2 upside. Eric Ebron, if he plays, may be limited coming back from injury; I would avoid for now.
 * Ameer Abdullah and Theo Riddick will make up the Lion’s running game, and I think either one is a low-end flex play, with Riddick getting a bump in PPR. The Lions are a heavy passing offense so volume is not on Abdullah’s side.
 * Andrew Luck returns with a great matchup. He’s an easy QB1, and I like both Donte Moncrief and TY Hilton to finish the game with solid stat lines. I prefer TY to Moncrief by a bit, but both have a solid floor in this high volume matchup. Dwayne Allen’s week to week value is TD dependent, and in this matchup he is more likely than not to pull it off
 * Frank Gore is only getting older, but the supporting cast around him is only getting better.  He managed to eke out low end RB2 numbers last season when the Colts were a dumpster fire. I think he still has the ability to put up mid-to-high RB2 numbers now that the Colts offense should be firing on all cylinders once again. He has no real competition.

**Patriots @ Cardinals**

 * Jimmy Garoppolo is no Tom Brady, and that will likely cap the upside of Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski this week against a tough Arizona D. They are still solid starters however, and Jimmy only affects their ceiling, I still think both have a very startable floor.
 * I think James White will figure heavily into the game plan as Garoppolo’s safety valve in the short passing game. The receptions could rack up quickly for White, who I like as a very solid flex play in PPR – not so much in standard.
 * Something tells me we’re going to see more of the playoff Carson Palmer who threw interception after interception than the 2015 regular season Palmer who was an every week QB1. Just a hunch, but New England’s defense is no slouch. I like each of the Cardinals’ three receivers (Larry Fitzgerald, Michael Floyd, and John Brown) as WR3 plays with high ceilings, but I worry about their floors. I don’t believe all of them can be supported to WR2 levels in fantasy.
 * David Johnson is my pick for the RB1 this season, particularly in PPR formats. His pass catching ability gives him a safe floor and he’s always a threat for a high ceiling. Start him happily as your RB1, despite the tough-ish matchup. I predict the Cardinals will be ahead most of the game and running it out.

**Steelers @ Redskins**

 * Ben Roethlisberger has got it pretty rough these days with Martavis Bryant out for the season due to smoking the Devil’s cabbage and his new free agent Ladarius Green experiencing headaches in his ankles. Even his star RB, LeVeon Bell, is out for a few games. Outside of Antonio Brown, the Steelers receivers are uninspiring. For this reason I would shy away from Big Ben if I had other options. Antonio Brown is a must start, of course. Markus Wheaton might be a flex, but I wouldn’t feel great about it.
 * DeAngelo Williams should have a solid game, as he demonstrated in 2015 he is a very capable back in his own right. He’s a solid start as your RB1 in a game that has shootout potential.
 * Between Antonio Brown and DeAngelo Williams’ production, Kirk Cousins should find himself behind a lot in this matchup, which will lead to plenty of passing volume. Jordan Reed is obviously a primary beneficiary of that volume, and I love him as a TE1, but don’t overlook DeSean Jackson. Known as a boom or bust player, I think Jackson will boom this week, and I like him as a WR2.
 * Matt Jones seems like he will be ready to start week 1, but I’m not rushing to start him. Not only is he coming off injury, the Redskins will likely be playing from behind and abandon the run fairly early. He is not a supremely talented back so I don’t think he will make all that much of the touches he does get. Still, on the early game volume alone he is flex-able.

**Rams @ 49ers**

* Blaine Gabbert and the 49ers have the worst receiving corps in the league, no question. I wouldn’t start any of the receivers this week, but I kinda like Vance McDonald as a TE streamer here. He could easily lead the 49ers in targets and receptions given their deficiencies at the WR position.
 
* Carlos Hyde has been cleared for football activities, so he will likely start this week. It’s a good week for him, as the Rams will play a slow, run-based offense which will keep the score low, keeping Hyde on the field. I like him to finish with solid RB2 numbers.

* The story is similar for the Rams. Case Keenum has almost no solid options to throw to. I wouldn’t want to start Tavon Austin in my flex if I could help it. The Rams will likewise lean on their star running back, Todd Gurley, who should have an incredible week against the NFL’s worst team.

NFLPowerRankers,2016-09-06 18:36:12+00:00,Official Week 0 /r/NFL Power Rankings,"Welcome to the first official /r/nfl power ranking for 2016!

For those who are unfamiliar, here's the lowdown.

We are a group of 32 NFL fans, with each team in the league having a fan as a representative. Since 2010 we have been producing weekly aggregate power rankings based on the votes of each individual user. This produces what is as close to an unbiased ranking as we think you'll find. The blurbs are also written by each individual user for their team.  [Here's how everyone voted this week (mobile users, please choose to view in your browser, the Sheets app cannot view this without permission, and we're not giving everyone permission).](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;key=0AnDlN9K2SRIFdHRyU0VtMjQ5S0JhcmxxSkVIcjg3Znc&amp;single=true&amp;gid=2&amp;output=html)  There are systems in place to correct for outlier votes and to ensure the results are the product of group consensus.  This first week, we went for a later posting than normal because reddit had a stroke, but from here on out, you can expect them around 2:00 PM Eastern on Tuesdays.

While the group are serious football fans at the end of the day we produce these simply for entertainment purposes, both yours and ours. The rankers were created to allow the Reddit community a voice alongside the other big media players, and over the years has proven to be one of the consistent and most balanced voices on the internet. While some rankers may have placed teams at a level you really disagree with, please bear in mind it's preseason - every team is hard to judge. And please remember, the rankers do this for fun. Many of us are happy to discuss our rankings, but they aren't worth taking personal abuse over.

So, check them out and tell us how we are horribly wrong!

\#||Team|Record|Comment				
--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--				
1.	| [](/CAR) | Panthers |	15-1	|	The Panthers open 2016 as an enigma: as a team that was clearly ascending to dominance until the last game of 2015, will an offseason of turmoil give way to doubt and regression or will the near-miss at immortality galvanize the team to finish what it started a year later? Facing their Super Bowl nemesis, nothing less than absolute ferocity and utter focus will serve to alert the rest of the league that the Panthers are back on the prowl.
2.	| [](/ARI) | Cardinals |	13-3	|	2016 opens with big expectations for the Cardinals. Preseason left many questions, one mainly being if Carson Palmer has rid himself of the demons from the last NFC Championship game. His preseason play, for the most part, was disastrous. Fortunately, he should have plenty of help. The offensive line is only stronger and has David Johnson poised to have a monster season. Meanwhile the Honey Badger returns on defense and Chandler Jones should improve the pass rush.
3.	| [](/SEA) | Seahawks |	10-6	|	The Seahawks enter 2016 on familiar ground. They are a favorite to win it all, their defense should be stout, their offensive line has possibly replaced some donuts with glazed bagels, and thus, their quarterback will need to make the magic happen (which he can do now that Ciara put a ring on it). As always, it is predicted that Seattle's offensive line experiment will be their downfall, but they can only hope the Pope cast no curses on his way out of town and PCJS can continue to beat the naysayers. 
4.	| [](/NE) | Patriots |	12-4	|	Every team gets injuries, many teams lose defensive captains to ped suspensions, some teams start the season with their starting qb banished to the phantom zone.. but no other team has had a TE tandem like Gronk and Bennett since Hernandez got traded to Walpole. The Patriots start the preseason part deux and their *Make the Patriots Great Again Tour* this sunday in the hardest way possible, away against a superbowl contender. It will be a real out-of-the-frying-pan-and-thrown-to-the-lions test for both sides of the ball, the staff and the young qb. The Patriots +6 are the SPACE_LAWYER lock of the week
5.	| [](/GB) | Packers | 10-6	|	Things are looking good for the Packers to start the season. Golden boy WR Jordy Nelson is back from an injury that kept him out all last season, RB Eddie Lacy seems set to bounce back from a disappointing season, and the secondary is really coming into its own. On the down side, G Josh Sitton was sent packing for some reason and he quickly ended up on... Some other team. With a surreal season in the rear view, the Packers head into a season with what most agree is a cushy schedule.
6.	| [](/CIN) | Bengals |	12-4	|	The Bengals start the year once again with a lot to prove. We won't know for 18 weeks if this season can be considered a success, but the Bengals definitely have the roster to get back to the playoffs. 
7.	| [](/PIT) | Steelers |	10-6	|	For all of the many things that could be said about a Steelers team on the cusp of a competitive run, it boils down to the same nervous concern: No more players lost to injury or suspension.
8.	| [](/DEN) | Broncos | 12-4	|	To quote the greatest philosopher of our generation, Damian Lillard, they sleep. Yes, the Broncos are starting a guy at QB who looks like he's fresh out of business school but the pieces around Siemian are all there. A great skills position group, the best defense in the NFL, an offensive line with Michael Schofield not playing tackle anymore. As long as Trevor can keep the turnovers down, (something neither QB managed to do last year) the Broncos will be in a great position to win the AFC West for their 6th straight time. 
9.	| [](/KC) | Chiefs | 11-5	|	The Chiefs might actually be in a better position at the end of preseason than going in.  Well not really, but the lack of any severe injury was good for the Chiefs, who might be fielding their most complete team since 2003.
10.	| [](/HOU) | Texans |	9-7	|	If you consider Preseason Week 3 to be the ""dress rehearsal"", then the Texans are ready to go. Osweiler did nothing to ease the pain in Denver, going 11-13 for 146 and 2 TDs, with the 2 incompletions being drops. If that kind of production keeps up with the same stifling defense that shut down every preseason opponent, then Houston has every reason and then some to believe the hype this year.
11.	| [](/NYJ) | Jets |	10-6	|	The Jets are about to enter a season with more offensive consistency than they have in a long, long time. Speculation on the Fitzpatrick/Smith debate has been drawn out and tumultuous, but the point stands that consistency in this system could prove to be very good for the Jets. Especially paired with a defense that's poised to destroy everything in their path.
12.	| [](/WAS) | Redskins | 	9-7	|	The Redskins may have questions in the run game on offense and stopping the run on defense but they enter the season with the strongest case to take the NFC EAST in 2016. A hard earned first place schedule however may leave a better team in 2016 on paper with a worse record than last seasons division winning squad.
13.	| [](/OAK) | Raiders | 7-9	|	The Raiders have more preseason hype this year than the last decade combined. Khalil Mack may be the best defensive player in football, Carr and Cooper are a year older, and the offensive line is one of the top in the league. The main question is whether this newly built defense can gel in time to live up to the hype. Anything short of the playoffs will be considered a disappointment in many fans' eyes and that alone is new and refreshing for this organization. All hail Reggie!
14.	| [](/MIN) | Vikings | 11-5	|	It's always something with the Vikings. Bountygate, Metrodome collapses, Hall of Fame running back beats up his toddler, kicker shanks a gimme to lose a playoff game, starting quarterback destroys his knee in the last practice. And that's just recent history. The bent-over-a-barrel Vikes brought in Bradford, who joins likely the most talented team he has played on in his career. With an aggressive defense and power running game, even average QB play solidifies Minnesota as an NFC dark horse.
15.	| [](/BUF) | Bills | 8-8	|	The Bills enter the 2016 season with what looks to be a relatively strong offense and a greatly troubled defense. The Bill's defense, which regressed greatly last year, will open up the year without three crucial starters in their front seven. Can Rex's squad find a way to overcome these losses and still improve upon last year's dismal performance? The answer to this question will likely determine whether or not the league's longest playoff drought continues.
16.	| [](/IND) | Colts | 8-8	|	Both Ryan Grigson and Chuck Pagano somehow manged to keep their jobs and will join Andrew luck for a fifth season as the key personell in the Indy organization. Despite what some fools would think, Luck has proved to be an easy top-five franchise cornerstone player. The jury is still out on the others, and surely this season will be a make or break year for their careers.
17.	| [](/NYG) | Giants | 6-10	|	The Giants had one of their most memorable offseasons in a long time, having spent nearly $200 million on the defense alone. This was needed, seeing as how their defense was arguably the worst Giants defense to ever step on the field. 7 of their starters from last year’s defense aren’t even on NFL rosters this time around. With new head coach Ben ~~McAfade~~ McAdoo, the Giants hope to polish the already successful offense of Eli trying to do a million things before finally throwing a touchdown pass to Odell Beckham, and revamp their defense and hopefully Steve Spagnoolololo’s career.
18.	| [](/ATL) | Falcons |8-8	|	Matt Ryan continues to look as timid in the red zone as [his profile pic suggests](http://imgur.com/a/qVOND), even with an upgraded o-line. Kyle Badgameplanahan is slowly bringing more ""system"" guys in, one by one. Either to block the door to physically prevent a firing, or to start a mutiny and kill the current regime. Whichever way you slice the 7-9 cake, it will be hilariously disappointing. A week one game against former Falcons' coaches should be telling for both teams.
19.	| [](/BAL) | Ravens |5-11	|	For the second time in three years, the Ravens finished the preseason undefeated. It came after the Ravens usual solid but not terribly exciting offseason. First round pick Ronnie Stanley seems to be an upgrade over Eugene Monroe, and the Ravens were able to add former all-pro Eric Weddle in free agency. Unfortunately, Weddle, Suggs, and Dumervil are all on the wrong side of 30, while Jimmy Smith and Lardarius Webb are not young either. There is reason for optimism, but also reason for concern regarding their older defense.
20.	| [](/DET) | Lions |7-9	|	The offseason has been full of questions for Detroit. Can the YAC Attack offense produce in the redzone? Will Levy return to making opponents fear the beard? It's time to find out.
21.	| [](/TB) | Buccaneers |6-10	|	Lost in the rampant coverage of Roberto Aguayo's early kicking woes is the realization that Mike Smith has the Buccaneers defense looking sharp. Depth, or lack thereof, continues to remain an issue, but if Jameis Winston and the offense can continue to impress, it shouldn't be difficult for Tampa to best last year's 6 win season.
22.	| [](/NO) | Saints |7-9	|	The Saints faithful enter 2016 hoping this will be the year many of the plaudits bestowed in recent years are actually earned. Will this year see the coach's favourite rookie WR be successful? Will the renewed pass rush actually achieve sacks? Will the stiffened defense stop getting gashed by the run? Will the new Jimmy Graham produce? Will Mark Ingram be the bell cow and enjoy an injury-free campaign?
23.	| [](/JAC) | Jaguars |5-11	|	On the surface, it seems like the same story. Flashes of amazing in the preseason, as well as, flashes of, ""oh god what the hell."" The difference this year is: after cuts, teams [actually claimed](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2016/09/04/jaguars-49ers-have-most-players-claimed-on-waivers/) ex-Jaguars on waivers. Something might be different this season.
24.	| [](/DAL) | Cowboys |4-12	|	With a steamroller for an offense, then Cowboy front office was looking to outscore other teams and forgo the nuisance of having to play defense in 2016. Their plan may have been foiled as Tony Romo went down on his third snap in a preseason game against Seattle. Not all hope has been lost, as Dak Prescott’s impressive debut has risen the expectations of a team that could only win one game without Romo in 2015.
25.	| [](/MIA) | Dolphins |6-10	|	The Gase Hype Train has come to Miami, and many fans have jumped on feet first.  Ignore the hot mess of a secondary (not you Reshad), the replacement level LBs, and AARP cards that the D-Line is holding.  Also ignore the four LTs on the starting offensive line, the overall lack of a durable starting RB, and the 3.1 yards per carry that the team put up in the preseason.  There's a lot of stuff to ignore to believe in the hype.  Screw it!  19-0!!!  Now for another beer!
26.	| [](/CHI) | Bears |6-10	|	The Bears' defense is likely to be very good this season -- but questions linger around the offense. Can Jeremy Langford be an adequate replacement for Matt Forte? Will Alshon Jeffery stay healthy all season? Will Cutler build on the most efficient season of his career, or take a step back? Will Sitton be able to bolster a line that struggeld in the preseason? The answers to these questions will determine if the Bears' finish fourth (like most expect) or if they can challenge for the NFC North.
27.	| [](/LA) | Rams |7-9	|	Following a lackluster preseason from first overall pick Jared Goff and the receiving corps, Case Keenum will once again take the reins of an offense that lives and dies by the success of second year running back Todd Gurley. While Alec Ogletree now runs the Rams stout front 7, the loss of cornerback Janoris Jenkins and safety Rodney McLeod are a cause for concern in the secondary. If the Rams are able to ignore the new distractions of being a large market team and find a receiver to step up they may be able to find success, but until then they are imminently heading towards another middling season.
28.	| [](/PHI) | Eagles |7-9	|	Yet another wild off-season saw the Eagles bring in Andy Reid protégé Doug Pederson as new head coach and a dumping of future assets to trade up for Carson Wentz, an FCS standout who, until recent days, looked like an expensive benchwarmer.  In one last chaotic turn of the beloved ""wild ride"" the Eagles jettisoned Sam Bradford to the Vikings, effectively torpedoing the season and handing the reins over to Wentz.  Time will tell whether this move was good strategy, but with the NFC East an epic dumpster fire, it's anyone's division to win.
29.	| [](/SD) | Chargers |4-12	|	[Much like the aquifers of San Diego County, the Chargers depth leaves much to be desired. Such issues should be of no concern for a team with such a rigorous strength and conditioning program. As a team that is hardly ever touched by injury does not need solid backups for their star players. Who has ever heard of a whole line being injured before? What nightmare scenario of the past few seasons could ever occur in such a paradise of a city.](http://imgur.com/wWFSPf8)
30.	| [](/TEN) | Titans |3-13	|	The 2015-2016 Titans season ended with an interim head coach taking the team to a 3-13 record, an injured franchise rookie QB, a controlling owner who's leadership was questioned by the NFL, and one of the worst rosters in the NFL. The journey out of this hole will take a long time for the Titans but they seem to have the solid rock in newly hired GM Jon Robinson (praise be). Robinson's first move was to hire interim coach Mike Mularkey. As much it was critiqued, it seems that Robinson has tried to give an identity to this team that has not had a clear identity since Jeff ""7-9 bullshit"" Fisher. The changes are clear. The reigns of the defense were given to Dick LeBeau and the offensive skill positions have been given a facelift. At least we all learned the term ""exotic smashmouth"" this offseason, so it's already a win.
31.	| [](/SF) | 49ers |5-11	|	While the talent level on the team is still far below the team that made the NFC Championship 3 consecutive years, things are improving. Defensively, DeForest Buckner looks like the real deal, heading up a strong future Defensive Line. Offensively is where Chip has his real work cut out for him. Gabbert won the starting job, but you have to believe the long term starter for this team is still in college.
32.	| [](/CLE) | Browns |3-13	|	Pre season is over. Hopes are high. We have a [new Quarterback](http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/video/2016/09/02/0ap3000000694936_video_cp.jpg), again, along with ten other players, [formerly on other teams.](https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/772761830523633664)  As with the last few years we're in ""re-set"" mode.  More like ""re-start"" mode.  Most experts predict another terrible year for Cleveland with some saying we'll go [1-15](http://www.espn.com/blog/cleveland-browns/post/_/id/18628/2016-cleveland-browns-game-by-game-predictions).

quickonthedrawl,2016-09-02 14:18:22+00:00,"Week 1 D/ST Scoring, 2016 (!)","**EDIT: News! News! We have news! Check [this comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/50tfwe/week_1_dst_scoring_2016/d79460f) for a rundown of what I would do with Minnesota, Philadelphia, Tennessee, and Cleveland.**

Week 1 is always a little bit weird.

We have people here in the sub who have been here for half of a decade. We have some that have been here since this morning. And most of us fit somewhere in between. So where do I even start?

This column started back in 2012. It was just a list of rankings that grew into something a little larger, and now we're here. Why are we here? First and foremost, we want to maximize our D/ST scoring. Of course, that's easier said than done, and there are competing thoughts as to how best to do that.

Some people say to stream. For those less experienced, ""streaming"" refers to aggressive use of the waiver wire to essentially extend your own bench. You add/drop a new team every week, or every 2-3 weeks, and rely extensively on matchups to gain your edges. You're looking to start D/STs against the 49ers or the Browns or the Rams or whichever other offenses turn out to be very bad. This is my preferred strategy with the position.

Others say to take a good D/ST in the draft and just hold them. This is a great idea, if we only knew which D/STs were going to be good. The problem is that we are often very bad at determining which ones are going to be good versus the ones that were good last year. So, last year some people thought they were getting a steal by drafting the Buffalo Bills or Miami Dolphins. Oops, I was one of them. So while drafting a good D/ST is obviously the ideal outcome, the rest of us simply have no choice but to make do with what's left.

In Defense Wins Championships, I do my best to sort through the good from the bad, and to arrange the ""good"" choices in tiers. I also try and keep up with the meta strategy of streaming D/STs in general, especially as we get closer to the playoffs, where strategies really open up a little: you have more freedom to carry multiple defenses, as well as a few other minor strategic differences between then and now.

It's good to be back. I look forward to spending another season here, as I have every year since 2012:

**[Defense Wins Championships, Week 1](https://empeopled.com/p/92946)**

This week's top teams (MFL Standard scoring):

Rank | Team | Points | Tier | Notes
:--------: | :-------- | :--------: | :--------: | :--------
1 | Carolina Panthers | 11.3 | 1 | Beckham &gt; Norman, anyway
2 | Kansas City Chiefs | 10.7 | 1 | No Houston, no problem
3 | Seattle Seahawks | 10.6 | 1 | Go Hawks!
4 | Arizona Cardinals | 9.5 | 2 | 
5 | Philadelphia Eagles | 9.5 | 2 | 
6 | Houston Texans | 9.4 | 2 | Fuck the Colts
7 | Green Bay Packers | 9.3 | 2 | Sneaky long-term option
8 | Los Angeles Rams | 9.2 | 2 | SF is the early #1 fade

**(The top 16 teams, and whichever extras are on the same tier as #16, can be found in the link above)**

Most ""Should I start Team A or Team B!?"" questions can be answered very simply by the rankings. There's no magic to it, especially this early in the season. If you have the option of Team A or Team B, and both teams are on the same tier, then the distinction between them is very marginal! Do not stress yourself out about choosing between them. Look at the following week's matchup to see if either option has an edge, and then go from there. Remember, if your league uses different scoring from MFL (which is similar - but not exactly the same - as ESPN, Yahoo!, CBS, et al), then you may need to use some of your own intuition to parse two similar choices.

Caleb_Pitts,2016-08-27 15:57:13+00:00,Talking to Your Dad About Basketball: A Guide,"**Your dad is old.** I mean reeeeally old, It’s just one of the facts of life. Here are the facts of life, by the way:


* Your dad is old

* Young Thug is real good


But, back to your dad. He’s old. It’s not his fault that he’s old, but he is in fact very old. The fact that your dad is so old can make it hard to talk to your dad about certain things, stuff like relationships, or electricity. And sometimes, it even interferes with talking to him about the one thing he loves more than all of the stuff he loves more than you; Sports, specifically Basketball.

All dads love Basketball. This is another one of the facts of life, but this fact doesn’t need to be on the list because everybody already knows it. If your dad doesn’t like Basketball, then I hate to break it to you, that’s not your dad (I’m sorry you had to find out this way).

So your dad likes Basketball, but he’s old, so even if you also like Basketball, it can be hard to talk to him about Basketball for any amount of time without him bringing up “the old days” (which he loves because they’re old, like him.) So you came to me. I’m gonna teach you how to hold a conversation with your dad about ball, without him boring you to actual, physical death with old stuff that doesn’t matter anymore. Ok, let’s get started.

**STEP ONE: Call Your Dad**

The first step to talking to your dad is calling your dad on his phone (probably a rotary). If you don’t have your dad’s phone number then he probably doesn’t want to talk to you about anything in the first place, so I would just leave him alone, or hire an impersonator to impersonate your dad for the purposes of this guide.

**STEP TWO: Greet Your Dad**

This one should be pretty self-explanatory, but it takes some finessing. The key here is to properly greet your dad and engage in an acceptable amount of small-talk to lead into a conversation about basketball, but not giving him so much time before the basketball conversation begins that he starts rambling about Polio and The Dust Bowl. My personal advice is to pretend you are currently playing basketball in order to create a smooth transition to basketball. My dad-greetings usually go like this:

Me: Hey Dad

Dad: Hey there son

Me: Hey dad I’m playing basketball, you like basketball right? I’m playing it.

Dad: Yes of course I like basketball, why are you calling me while playing basketball?

Me: *cheering crowd* oh I just had basketball on my mind and figured we could talk about basketball *buzzer 
sounds*

Dad: Of course, son.

**STEP THREE: Start Slowly**

Ok, now for the real stuff. Your dad loves basketball, but he’s old and doesn’t understand what makes basketball great these days. At the beginning of the conversation, don’t bring up things like analytics or three-pointers, because your old dumb dad doesn’t know what those things are. Pretend that you’re Charles Barkley and, as far as you know, basketball has stayed exactly the same since 1961. Begin with a slick reference to someone like Doctor J or another dead guy that your dad probably played basketball with. He will appreciate it, and his inferior old brain will be tricked into thinking that you’re also old, because why would a cool young person ever bring up a geezer like Doctor J.

**STEP FOUR: Use Wikipedia**

It’s imperative to keep Wikipedia open at all times while talking to your dad about basketball, just in case he mentions something like “The ABA” or “The Seattle Supersonics”. When he starts talking about this stuff that you cannot comprehend because it existed so long ago, just read the first sentence of the wikipedia article on the subject. Example:

Me: Man, that Kyrie Irving has some great handles, huh?

Dad: Yeah, he reminds me of Isiah Thomas in that way

Me: Oh yeah, Isiah Lord Thomas III, the American Retired Basketball player that played 12 seasons in the National Basketball Association. I think what I like the most about Isiah Thomas is that he was an NBA all star 12 times and won 2 NBA Championships. His nickname was the “Babyfaced Assassin”.

Dad: Wow, we both know that information. How cool.

**STEP FIVE: Don’t Mention Steph Curry**

WHATEVER you do, do NOT mention Steph Curry. Dads hate Steph Curry, because he’s young and cool and is still married (unlike your dad). My advice: whenever you would normally mention Steph Curry in a basketball conversation with a cool, young human, replace the words “Steph Curry” with “George Gervin” when talking to your old man. I don’t actually know who George Gervin is, but your dad will love it. Here’s an example for you:

Dad: Who do you think is the best 2-point shooter of all time? Wow that was weird, not sure why I said 2-point shooter seeing as 2 is the maximum amount of points you can make with a basket from anywhere on the court, so specifically saying “2-point” was unneccessary.

Me: Honestly, I’d have to give it to 2014-2016 MVP George Gervin, what a talent he is. He drains half-court shots like they’re layups, It’s like nothing the NBA has ever seen. George “Chef” Gervin is easily the GOAT shooter.

Dad: George Gervin with the shot, boy.

**STEP SIX: Give Him Your Top 2**

With any young person, you would normally go on and on about each other's top 5 list, but it’s different with dads. See, there were only 2 good basketball players before your dad stopped understanding what basketball was, so all dads only ever have a top 2 list. The 2 players on the list are always Michael Jordan (From SpaceJam) and Larry Bird (From Indiana), the only thing that changes between lists is what order you put them in. Personally, I know my dad hates all bulls (ex-matador), so his list goes:


1. Larry Bird
2. Michael Jordan


Just make sure you know what order your dad’s list is in before you bring up the top 2 list. Getting this part wrong could ruin your relationship with your father, which is already pretty bad.

**STEP SEVEN: Say Bye to Your Dad**

This is the easiest part of the whole guide, because by now I’m almost positive that you’re sick of talking to your old dad. The best way to end the conversation with your dad is to silently hang up right as he starts talking about “The Golden Age” (It’ll happen, trust me). Because he has bad, old hearing, he probably won't even notice you hung up on him, so it's a win win. You get to not talk to your dad and he gets to keep rambling about fundamentals, victimless.

**STEP EIGHT: Repeat**

Wait 3 months, and then call him again. This is exactly the amount of time necessary between phone calls that your dad’s brain (with its fading capacity for memory) will have forgotten about the last conversation you had with him, but it’s not so long that he’s forgotten that you exist and stops sending you money “for groceries”.

Anyways, be smart out there, and tell your dad I said “defense wins championships”. He'll love it.

One_smitten_kitten,2016-08-26 23:22:54+00:00,"College student messes up my clothes, I volunteer hers as tribute.","I was in college a few years back out of state, living in the college housing. I was on the 3rd floor, and every floor had a laundry room that had 4 washers and 4 dryers. These were usually never full, and they were always working and well maintained. 

Enter me, a 2nd year very busy student who is in the last week of the current semester. On this day at about 4, I was supposed to demonstrate the entire portfolio I had created that year for review by my professors who headed up the degree field I wanted to enter. Their decision would determine whether or not I would be permitted into the Game Arts and Design degree. This school was demanding in what they would require you to be able to do to be accepted into those courses. I had attended my morning classes. Prior to that I had washed my laundry containing my nicest outfits, including the one I intended to where to this demonstration. My school was a 1/2 hour walk away from my housing in downtown Seattle. My laundry needed to be done. I spent my lunch break running home (literally) to change my clothes over from the washer to the dryer. Then when 2:30 rolled around, I ran home again to fetch a clean, dry outfit so I could go do my presentation looking my best.

Only.... some b!tch had come along RIGHT after I put in my clothes, realized all the dryers were full and decided to just take mine out and set them on top of the dryer--where they proceeded to remain wet and mildew sadly. 

What's a girl to do? I stood there fuming for 5 minutes, and then ripped all of her pleasantly dry laundry out of the dryer and took them the few steps down the hall to my room, where I then proceeded to realize that she wore mostly the same size clothes as me. I kept what I liked, including a fuzzy warm blanket which was very welcome in the chilly Seattle weather. Then I opened up the window, which would swing entirely open on a very nice set of hinges, and threw the rest of the clothes out the 3rd story window into the dumpster below which was located right next to a soup kitchen, and thus frequented by the homeless. ""FREE GIRLS CLOTHES"" I shouted down to the homeless sitting outside there, and they were on the dumpster in seconds.  Then I wrote a scathing rage-filled note about how selfish and shitty it is to tamper with someone's clothes rather than just walk your lazy ass to a different floor to do laundry if your own machines are full.

I proceeded to go to my portfolio review in a different, albeit far less striking outfit, passed with flying colors, and then headed home to rewash and dry my clothes on another floor of the building so she couldn't know how to retaliate against me. I stopped by later to look at my note and saw that it had been replaced by an equally rage-filled f#ck you note written by said offender demanding the return of her clothes. I left it there, walked to my room, stripped, dressed in her very cozy new PJ's, made myself some hot chocolate, greeted my room mate--""Oh you like my PJ's?? Thank you! I just got them...""--and proceeded to play WoW for 2 hours before sleeping the best sleep I had in a long time. In my very cozy new blanket.   n____n

EDITED: misspellings, some grammar changes.

Also, decided to revisit how good I felt that evening today by making some hot chocolate in her PJ's. http://imgur.com/fbWQgL9

Obligatory 2nd edit to curtail some of the butthurt: No, I didn't ruin this bitch's life. There was about (*maybe*) 50-60 $ worth of clothes in that dryer. Not hundreds. I'm a nice lady with a hair-thin, easily triggered temper; not Satan incarnate. I wouldn't have thrown anything that looked like over 100$ out the window. Yes, I understand the response was perhaps disproportionate, but no, I'm not sorry. Deal with it. :)

So I'm just going to format it to the best of my ability into topics. Also, there was a thread about this earlier but I think it got buried and so I just made a new one instead considering how long it took to type everything out.

**Cloud9**

* Bone7 thinks he was a terrible C9 captain.
* EE's captaining style in C9 was basically to read the players and try to pick for them accordingly but communication got really bad and everyone got emotional so this style fell apart. EE's style was basically to pick heroes that people would be good on and they'd be part of the meta too and he would be confident about it too. It just didn't work when internal issues escalated and then Bone7 began to captain.
* Huge amounts of internal issues were present in C9. Lack of understanding/agreement on meta heroes/drafts with some people wanting to try out heroes that they had never properly practiced just because they were suddenly in the meta. Ego issues were very present too. Team was basically divided and not united.
* C9 w/Aui/PieLieDie/SingSing &gt; C9 w/FATA &gt; C9 w/NoTail/Misery
* With Aui/PLD/Sing as well as FATA lineup C9 always had late game comebacks. But with the TI5 iteration of C9 there wasn't even that anymore.

**Cloud9 Players**

* Misery: Evolved immensely from C9 days. Back in C9 he always knew what needed to be done in the game but wouldn't share his opinions.
* NoTail: Very good player and teammate but morale dependent. If team is not positive then it doubly affects him. Best teammate and human being in C9 (this is despite EE's long standing friendship with Bone7).
* FATA: Intense. Best mid player in TI4 era but meta didn't favour him afterwards. Pretty patch dependent. When he was in Liquid patch favoured him heavily. Insanely good player but makes some basic mistakes at times like everyone. With regards to respecting certain calls by the team (ie. don't farm here, don't go there) FATA was inconsistent.
* EE: Most interesting player in C9. Very smart at DotA. Kept finding ways back into impossible games. Despite losing the LGD vs C9 game at TI5, EE made huge plays. He somehow got rax after getting a rapier on AM and they were back in the game after they thought that it would be impossible.
* Players cannot hold onto grudges and hate just because you are all in the same game and it's detrimental to hold onto those. Most C9 players are still friends and on good terms.

**Kaipi**

* Kaipi was an experiment by Bone7 to try to build up his own team from the ground up but in his own words ""I failed in that"". He wanted a break from Tier 1 DotA due to a lot of stress. Big tournaments are ridiculously stressful.
* Bone7 is captain currently because everyone else is awful at it and he's ""a little less awful"".
* I had my own ideas on how to make my own team good. It was sort of similar to how TI5 EG were. Very united and friendly. Going to eat together, going out together.

**Captaining**

* Some teams have 5 players who gel so well together that they don't need a captain per se. However, this is extremely rare.
* Puppey and PPD are amazing captains that make things work even when things are far from ideal.
* Misery has evolved a lot since C9 days. He's not the smartest players but he's smart enough to do what needs to be done. See an AM? Pressure him. See an Alch? Ruin his jungle. He does what needs to be done and that is why DC got as far as they got in DC.
* A captain needs to be very good at talking to people. He has to be able to command without coming across as arrogant. You cannot be cancerous at all. *At all*. You have to have amazing interpersonal skills.
* A captain should be someone who can gain trust from his players because he is the mastermind of the team. He would have an idea which may be unorthodox and he needs to convey it perfectly and convince them that it's a good idea too. (*personal note: think about how misery said that DC doubted his Slardar+DS pick vs EG but he convinced them it was great*). Bone7 has trouble with this aspect because he cannot convey the idea perfectly.

**Secret**

* Bone7 initially thought that Secret v1/2 wouldn't work out.
* Everyone thought Universe going to Secret was a great idea but it didn't work because of his playstyle. Misery used to make space on the map tanking lots ofdeaths but it would allow EE/W33 to farm. However, with Universe's incredibly conservative and consistent style, EE and RTZ were much more pressured.
* RTZ plays too much of the farming mid and isn't balanced enough towards being a traditional mid. This makes farm distribution a lot trickier. It worked out in EG because Fear would play things like Razor in the safe lane and make lots of space for RTZ. When RTZ played with Sumail, RTZ took most of the farm and Sumail was the new Fear.
* Puppey is an amazing captain.
* EE carried Secret ridiculously hard during Shanghai.

**Secret's BO1 vs LGD at TI6**

* In TI6 LGD vs Secret game there was a ridiculous outdraft from Puppey. Secret *should* have completely rekt LGD. You might say that Alch+TB is retarded but it isn't. TB needs very little farm to fight, maybe Dragon Lance or even just Treads. The damage comes from the Meta+Illusions. Secret's plan was to stack early game for their cores.
* Alch should have been thinking that ""okay I have lots of damage on my team due to TB, I don't need to farm but rather I need to teamfight so that we can win our teamfight and secure late game."" I mean TB+Alch is a stupidly tanky and DPS heavy lineup. It's hard to deal with. Alch should have maxed Acid Spray and get early treads+pms and started fighting instead of going the armlet radiance build. Alch's job was to keep the game stable in the first 12 minutes.
* However, Secret didn't have the right approach. Jugg+Ember are really weak until level 11 and they need items to come online. Secret should have been fighting and pressuring before then but instead they kept stacking and farming. This is how they lost so much map control. Secret needed to pick between which hero gets a good game: TB or Alch. Instead they picked both. There was a lack of unity in direction that was very clear here.

**Wings Gaming**

* Amazing team. Players gel together really well and work as a unit.
* Asian teams are generally more team oriented and nowhere near as spoiled as European players. They are more communal and less individualistic.

**Post TI6 Shuffle**

* This shuffle is the most interesting shuffle of all the shuffles. It isn't about who plays with who, that's not important. What is important is how they play with each other. There will be several new all star teams coming up and it will be interesting to see if they work out. I want to say it won't work out but I'm wrong about such things usually (ie. Secret v1/2). Bone7 knows the shuffle but refuses to share details.
* Bone7 says after you leave Tier 1 DotA you become forgotten unless you are very lucky. As a result Bone7 is little more than a spectator.
* At TI there are a lot of roster shuffles going on during and after it. By leaving a Tier 1 team Bone7 denied himself the opportunity of being part of that shuffle at Seattle.

**Roster Change Speculation from OP**

* Bone7 used the past tense with regards to FATA being in Liquid and RTZ being in Secret. Most likely this implies that both players have left those teams.

**State of DotA 2**

* DotA 2 is at a weird point where there's a lot of money in it but high end players still don't take it as seriously as they should. They are very spoiled. The people who are at TI are still letting personality issues get in the way of performance. Players don't get up and eat together. They don't come on DotA at the same time.
* Ego issues get in the way of players trying new and unorthodox ideas.

**Misc**

* Bone7 doesn't consider himself to be an amazing carry.
* It's not always about what needs to be done in a game but it's about *how* it needs to be done.",DotA2,1630

I have always been a Dendi fan, through up and downs of Na'vi. I went to Frankfurt major, but unfortunately Na'vi did not make it there. I was the only guy wearing a Na'vi hoodie at Frankfurt Major. I was really looking forward to TI6, going to Seattle and finally seeing Dendi in person. My four best buddies and I were all booked to go to TI6. However, a last minute opportunity for a really good internship came up and I had to ditch the trip. I was really bummed about it.

On Saturday, my friends sent me a picture, of them with Dendi and GeneRal, while one of them holding up a Na'vi sign saying ""Hey Tony"". I was really happy for them getting a picture with Dendi but sad at the same time that I missed the opportunity to meet him. However, a couple minutes later, my friends sent me this picture, with Dendi signing the sign. 

http://i.imgur.com/VddAdRs.jpg?1

They told me the story how you were not supposed to get things signed while taking pictures with the pros. They were going to ask Dendi to sign it regardless to try their luck. But Dendi brought it up first asking why they were holding a sign saying ""Hey Tony"", and after hearing the story he offered to sign the sign and told my friends to tell me he says hi.


Oh man, when I saw the picture and heard the story, that was probably the happiest and most excited I felt in a long time.I just want to share my story and say thank you so much Dendi, this meant so much to me. Go Na'vi, we will get it next time!",DotA2,1101

But seriously, what is this horseshit. 

Wilhelmsen has been with the Mariners from 2011-2015, and in this timespan had a 2.97 ERA. The Rangers traded Leonys Martin (currently batting .244 with 13 homers) to the Mariners for Wilhelmsen, and two other players. Wilhelmsen was moved away from the city he had grown his MLB career in, without any personal input, so his feelings about this trade are questionable. 

Wilhelmsen had a 10.55 ERA for the Rangers in 21 appearances. Twenty. One. Appearances. How does a player go from 2.97 ERA to a 10.55? In June, the Rangers sent Wilhelmsen down the minors, and he refused the assignment, forfeiting $1.8 million. He becomes a free agent, and guess where he signs?

The fucking Seattle Mariners. For $508,000. 

He's had 15 appearances so far for the Mariners. What's his ERA so far?

Fucking 2.08. 

This is bullshit, and I want to publicly call you out for it Tom Wilhelmsen. You're a modern-day Black Sock in my book. 

EDIT: Statistical data from fangraphs pointed out by /u/nckdmss. You can tell exactly when Wilhelmsen began pitching for the Mariners this year just based on the velocity spike. http://www.fangraphs.com/pitchfxo.aspx?playerid=9975&amp;position=P&amp;pitch=FA

What some have commented is the fact the Rangers made Wilhelmsen increase his cut fastball usage to 25% from 15%. While true, doesn't explain the wild increase from 2.97 to a 10.55 ERA. He could have worked on it in AAA ball but he opted out. 

Wilhelmsen in a radio interview:

&gt;""It wasn't by choice [making the Rangers lose], ... I was so used to beating the Rangers and.. Nothing changes I guess ... The front office made me feel as comfortable as I could but there just wasn't a fit. I tried to fake it [feeling at home in Texas] as much as I could""

ayesee,2016-08-08 06:45:25+00:00,"With the TI6 main event about 10 hours away, I wanted to share my TI ""Core Memories"" with you","Greetings and **EXTREMELY LONG POST AHEAD WARNING**, Dota fans!

Over the past week or so, as I've been reading through all of the threads and discussions about TI6, I've caught myself acting like the old man I am... meaning I've been leaving many comments about the way-back-when days, sharing memories and spinning yarns. And inevitably as I've shared those thoughts and experiences, even more have come to mind. Going back in time and remembering that part of my life has brought me a lot of bittersweet joy. Now with the main event only a handful of hours away, I can't think of a better time to share my TI core memories with you, given that all of you have been there with me every step of the way.

If I'm honest, there's also an emotional healing element to all of this which will be made clear by the end. There are a lot of things involving the family nature of GoodGame, Evil Geniuses, and Alliance and how tight nit we are which I think the community will appreciate.

I've decided to skip stories about commentating particular games or series, and except in cases where exceptions are obvious, anything about gameplay/results as a whole. Most people have seen those moments. At any rate, I hope you enjoy... I know I did, through the ups and downs alike.

**TI2**

---

**First time walking into TI**

* I had only been playing Dota for eight months and casting it for five when I arrived in Seattle and walked into Benaroya to cast TI2 at the invitation of IceFrog. I toddled into that foyer with the awkwardness of a kid on his first day at a new school. I walked up to the first group of people I spotted wearing Valve shirts, stuck out my hand, and said ""Hi, I'm Ayesee."" Doug Wood of Valve turned and said, ""I recognize that voice!"" Afterward, I introduced myself to Tobi, who went out of his way to guide me around and introduce me to all of the other casters, hosts, and panelists who'd go on to be some of my best friends and favorite people in the world. [I'll always be thankful to him for that](http://i.imgur.com/DSRLUqA.jpg).

**Meeting Gabe Newell**

* Second day I was there, before the event even started, sitting down in the cafeteria/green room area used by talent and staff by myself drinking a diet coke. In walks Gabe, who sits down RIGHT beside me. Starstruck, I stuck out my hand and said, ""Hey Mr. Newell, I'm Aaron..."" and he shook my hand and said ""Of course I know you, you're Ayesee."" To this day, I have no words to describe that feeling. It wasn't pride. It was something closer to humility mixed with validation. Feeling humbled that you were given the chance to do the work you do, intertwined with a feeling of graciousness that you'd done something right to be alive in that experience.

**My first real Greetings and Salutations**

* Sure, I'd said it hundreds (if not thousands) of times on stream before... but saying those words live to a packed audience at a million dollar tournament, in a moment that represented a genuine dream come true is just... well, different. Yes, I had worked in radio for years, but in radio you're alone in a small studio, you can't feel or see your audience. Staring out over the sea of people, it hit me - hundreds of thousands of people were at home, and thousands were in front of me, waiting for me to be a voice for their memories of this moment. My hands started to shake, my chest started to tremble. I heard the producer in my ear say ""GO COMMENTATORS,"" and as if someone had hit a button, I bellowed out my greetings... and the crowd roared in response. I've never been nervous in front of an audience since that moment.

**Meeting Alex Garfield**

* After TI2 I was milling around the lobby while the DJ spun his tunes for the after party, when a guy in an EG shirt came up to me and asked what I thought of the event. I didn't recognize him, but he had the most profound look of focus and understanding in his eyes. Everything about him screamed ""this seems like a cool guy."" We talked and shot the shit about the event, the matches, etc until a Team Liquid writer interrupted us. He said ""I see what's going on! Trying to hire Ayesee!"" I put the pieces together and realized it was THE Alex Garfield, a man I only knew as a name. I started working for EG/GGA the next month, and moved out to SF to work on site full time 8 months later - one of the first 8 founding members of our home office in the Bay. Alex's belief in me changed my life beyond my wildest dreams, and the moments we've shared together... you can't imagine. More on those later.

**TI3**

**Late night soccer at the Westin**

* I don't play soccer. I don't like soccer. But I'll always remember this moment because of how it sums up people who work in eSports - serious, driven individuals... who are just kids at heart. I remember coming back to the Westin very late one of the nights of the main event. I went up to the ballrooms marked off for talent to relax/eat/drink with hopes for a nightcap. What I found was a full blown game of soccer taking place in the large open area in front of the ballrooms. Almost everyone still awake was playing. I sat down, watched, and commentated. Maybe you had to be there, but it was... something special.

**Alliance wins the Grand Finals**

* I got to be that fanboy in the Alliance box, during the Grand Finals, surrounded by the friends and coworkers I loved the most. The end... the dream coil... the moment that ancient exploded. You could give me 10,000 words, and I still couldn't capture it. I remember Cody Connors jumped on my back and I jumped up and down with him ON my back. I remember I was standing right next to Alex, and he literally almost fainted - eyes fluttered and he stumbled backwards against the wall, lmao. I grabbed him, hugged him, and lifted him off the ground with tears in my eyes. We all hugged everyone else we could get our hands on, then Alex, myself, and Sean Green (GGA photographer) ran as quickly as we could down from the balcony to backstage. We were there waiting to greet our boys as soon as they walked off stage. More tears. More hugs. Everything from there is a blur - we hung around, talked and laughed, then as a group we all went to dinner... with the Aegis sitting in the middle of the table. Somewhere on someone's cell phone exists a picture of Alex and I holding the aegis together at that dinner.

---

**TI4**

---

**Not doing the main stage**

* TI4 was hard for me in a lot of ways... really hard. As a member of GGA, my day to day life and work responsibilities began to pivot away from simply casting Dota, to being a part of much larger projects in much more impactful roles. I was doing more work in eSports than ever... but doing less casting. By the time TI4 invites were set to go out, I knew there was a chance I wouldn't be asked to do the main stage that year. Which is what ended up happening. I was devastated. Like, didn't leave the house for days devastated. And being physically present at TI4 in that diminished role wasn't any easier. Even though I didn't know it at the time, that pain I was feeling was the pain of change, resulting from slow evolutions happening inside me as a person and involving me in the industry. I just wasn't ready for it. Looking back, those memories are still hard... but they were inevitable. And what got me through it was the endless support I got from Dota fans all over the world, both online and in person at that event. Thank you. You know who you are. Ultimately, even though I didn't know it at the time, my efforts and energy being required for other projects turned out to be my small part to play in our acquisition by Twitch, which was already in the works. I just didn't know that until much later.

**Getting to know the item creators**

* You know those awesome people who make the hats that keep this whole TI thing growing year after year? Listen closely when I tell you this: they are some of the most talented, funny, intelligent people you'll ever meet... and some of my favorite people in the whole world. This was the year I really got to know them - Manny, Anuxi, Danidem, Thiago, Terracotta, the list goes on and on. I've spent more nights than I can count at dinner, in bars, in hotel rooms, on rooftops, and just wandering the streets partying with these amazing folks. And no matter how many times we get together, I'm sad when we have to say goodbye and can't wait for the next chance to say hello. I'm sure some of you are reading this - please know, I love you. And you've all helped me get through some of the hardest times in my life... this year, and especially around TI5. 

---

**TI5**

---

**Note:** TI5 is hard of me to write about. Just typing that sentence has tears welling up in my eyes. It was the single most emotionally violent and turbulent period of my life I'd ever experienced. Low, to high, to low, to high again... to the lowest I've ever been. I don't know how to list these events except sequentially. I've never shared them before with anyone outside of closest friends and family... but if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do it right. The formatting for this section is a little different so bare with me.

**My first TI on the sidelines**

Title says it all. This was the first year I wasn't invited to participate in a TI as talent. If you've read this far, and read the experiences above, you can imagine how hard this was for me. By that time, though, my life had changed so much that I knew it was the next step in my transition from ""Ayesee, the Dota caster"" to ""Ayesee, the eSports industry professional who still casts Dota when he can."" Thankfully, I once again had the full GGA family around me to help me remember that while a part of my life had been left behind, it was another step towards the future.

**My Father, Ronald Chambers**

EG was in the Grand Finals. The whole gang was there. The GGA suite was packed with almost every person who was or had ever been a part of GGA... who'd ever been an Evil Genius. I can look at this moment, surrounded by all those people I was lucky enough to have in my life, all of us sharing this moment together, as one of the most profound I'd ever experienced.

EG had just won game 1 against CDEC, and we were all riding on a high that can't be comprehended. I ducked outside for some air and sunshine, and my phone rang - it was my parents calling. I answered, excited at their timing, as I could tell them all about the event so far and that our team was winning! We were THIS CLOSE to Evil Geniuses - to OUR TEAM - being TI5 champions!

I answered practically shaking with excitement. Mom knew all about EG and Dota and my work. I couldn't wait to tell her. Mom said hello, and I stammered out ""Hey mom, guess what! We're doing it! EG is in the Grand Finals!"" But she interrupted me. My father, who'd been having serious health problems for the last five years, had collapsed earlier that morning, and been taken to the hospital. He was in a coma. And they weren't sure if he would ever wake up.

I don't know how to verbally describe a moment like that. Every word or phrase that comes to mind feels cheap. So I'm not going to even try. I wept, and I almost fell over. I couldn't stand up without leaning on something.

I honestly don't remember what I asked her, and what she told me in specific. Just vague notions we communicated back and forth. He was in a coma, and it'd be a day or two before we knew if he had the possibility to wake up or not. He was on life support. There was nothing I could do. Nothing she could do.

I told her I was going to fly home immediately. She told me no, that I should stay. He was breathing on life support, and that wasn't going to change. If he woke up in the mean time, everything would be okay. If he didn't, that wasn't going to change by me being there. I was completely stunned. I told her I had to come home. What she said next shocked me:

""No, baby. You go win. It's what Dad would want.""

And she was right. Ever since I left my old business and moved home to help her take care of Dad full time in 2011, he'd been my rock and biggest motivator. During that time, I lived with her and Dad, and did side radio/broadcasting jobs and worked in eSports to earn money. I'd take care of him most of the time, then broadcast Dota and do other eSports work in between. And while she was always supportive, it was Dad that asked me every day about eSports - about Dota, about this crazy industry I was trying to break into. It was him that, when I was invited to cast TI2, called my friends over to help him figure out how to watch me cast on his potato computer. It was him that used that potato computer to look up and read articles about Evil Geniuses and Alliance, even though he had almost no idea what he was reading... he just knew it was our teams. He knew we were Evil Geniuses. It was him that cried tears of joy when I told him I was moving to San Francisco to work in this industry full time. It was him that made me who I am today.

He was my biggest fan.

So I listened to him, and to my mother, and stayed.

**Circle the wagons**

It's a cliche, but in this case, it's true. So many of my memories about this final day are a blur - a lot of hazy images and feelings, with extremely bright and clear moments woven in. I remember going back to the GGA suite, a crying mess, and not knowing what to do but seek out Alex and Colin DeShong (GGA COO, my mentor, and my very good friend) and tell them what had happened, and that depending on when my mother called back with news, I may have to fly out on very short notice.

They barely said a word. Just hugged me, and didn't let go until I was done with needing to be hugged. Which, bless their hearts, took a while. This continued with every person in the box. Dozens of them.

They then took me up to the front row of seats in the box, and parked my ass between them. And we cheered on Evil Geniuses to victory.

**Prologue**

The day I arrived back in SF from TI, I got another call from my mother. My father was never going to wake up. I told Colin I had to leave immediately. He told me they were paying for mine and Sherry's (my GF) flights home, and that there was no date I was expected to be back. To take as long as I needed. They only wanted to hear from me if there was anything I needed, even if it was just to talk.

My father passed away on August 13th, 2015. This year's grand finals will be one year, to the day, since he passed.

I stayed home for 2-3 weeks. When I finally came back, once again it was GGA who booked my flights. And they flew us first class - the one and only time I've flown first class.

I came back to the office still a wreck, but wanted to achieve some degree of normalcy. I walked in and headed back towards our area of Twitch. I saw Alex sitting in a booth in the cafeteria with his earbuds in working on his laptop - I didn't think he saw me and he looked busy, so I walked on past.

I hadn't taken 10 more steps when I felt a hand on my shoulder - Alex had spotted me and chased me down. He hugged me and welcomed me back, and shared some words that are just for he and I.

I walked on back to our area, and was similarly welcomed back by everyone. Then, I spotted a big picture frame on my desk. 

[At the direction of Alex and Colin, GGA commissioned a very special painting for me.](http://i.imgur.com/WDA7Z3n.jpg)

At the bottom left is my father and I. Middle, the TI5 stage. The sides, my two favorite and most played Dota characters. On the back are lot of signatures and messages, most of which are too personal to share.

It's the single most valuable material possession I've ever owned.

**Thanks**

I'd imagine not many made it this far, but if you have, there they are... my TI core memories. Concerning the emotional stuff at the end, that's the healing I was talking about... and more than anything, I wanted everyone to understand how special of an organization GGA has been over the years. I couldn't have survived without them. All of these memories have been made possible by you, the Dota fans. And it's my pleasure to share them with you, the way you all so often share your own with me.

This year will be a little hard for me after TI5, and because of other changes that I can't get into. But this year will be Sherry's first eSports event ever... not a bad one to start with, huh? She'll be there with me. I hope some of you will come say hello.

Thank you, Dota community members, for allowing my life to be made up of these moments. Thank you Valve and all your staffers, for how amazingly helpful and supportive you've always been, allowing me to be a part of this historic community you've created. Thank you IceFrog, for giving an unknown commentator from West Virginia a chance. Thank you to every commentator, host, player, and personality, for letting me be a part of this special group with you.

Thank you Alex and Colin, for believing in me and making me an Evil Genius - and for being the most supportive friends for which I could ever ask. Thank you everyone at GGA for being my family in the only ways that matter. Thank you to my mother and the rest of my family, for everything.

Thank you, Dad.",DotA2,2913

1.	Let’s try to be more creative than “lul cowboys” or “no rings” jokes. These jokes are unfunny and unimaginative and we all know we are better than that.

2.	This is a roast thread, please take all jokes as well…..a joke. I saw a few cases of retaliation and arguing. Jokes are Jokes, don’t like it? Move on.

3.	NO OTHER TEAM BASHING, save that precious ammo for when that teams time to be roasted comes.

4.	No malicious posts, trolling, or over the top comments attacking r/nfl users. As i said before this is supposed to be light hearted and fun, lets keep it that way.

5.	The next team up will be posted in the thread the day before, so you guys will have time to come up with material and decent jokes referring to the team.

6.	Have fun! This is meant to be lighthearted thread and they are to be taken as such. The offseason can be long and hopefully this series will provide some fun to pass the time. So roast away!!

I tink we covered a lot of points here up to a point where it gets too much for easy reading and effective testing of single theories. Therefore I decide to only update this post when there's a new Easter Egg discovered. I'll keep the current content as ""archive"" though. Until then make sure to follow /r/findingditto and post your ideas there. You can find more people over there to test your theory than on this topic. Until then, happy hunting!** 


So John Hanke recently mentioned that [there are still Easter Eggs hidden in the game](https://youtu.be/3n7046RUjt0?t=8m21s). I'd like to collect them in this thread and also ask for help to confirm or disprove theories we might have. I've already seen a few theories/ideas that I will list here aswell. With the knowledge that this subreddit already discovered so many Gamemechanics, I'm certain that we can also find the hidden eastereggs.
Please note that these are just theories which yet have to be tested. Some seem unlikely or ridiculous, but who could've thought about the Eevee trick? Apparently someone did and and it worked. Therefore I'll add most of the suggestions, just so we can test them. Even a failure is a good result, for we then know that we have one possibility less. 
In order to find ideas and possibly Eastereggs we have to stretch the mechanics this game offers. I listed some possibilities below
Furthermore, we know from Ingress that Niantic loves to hide secret codes in their posts on social platforms (mainly G+). They hide these inside pictures, within the source code or just reference anything as seen in the [wargames](https://ingress.codes/2016/06/09/wargames-aegis-nova-may-28/). If you're interested in decoding, then you should check out [this](https://ingress.codes/) website. It teaches you the different methods Niantic uses. Besides hidden text QR codes could also be hidden. These were used in previous Ingress riddles

#1. CONFIRMED:

* Running away from the starters will eventually spawn a Pikachu
* You can force Eeveelutions by naming them. Rainer -&gt; Vaporeon; Sparky -&gt; Jolteon; Pyro -&gt; Flareon
This apparently only works the FIRST TIME for each Eeveelution! Every other time it's RNG

* (When the egg reaches it's required distance but didn't hatch yet a text like this might pop up: ""this egg likes butter. feed it lots of butter to hatch it"" Seems to be a Beta Joke)

* (Every 10th unique Pokestop you visit within 30 minutes will give you at least 6 Items and 100XP)

* (For every 100 Pokemon of a kind you catch you'll receive 100 Bonus XP)
* [(Green Lake in Seattle seems to be a Hitmonlee Nest. An hommage to Bruce Lee?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/4ui975/pokemon_go_easter_eggs_and_theories/d5q8pwa)


#2. POSSIBLE WAYS TO APPROACH EASTEREGGS

* [John Hanke mentioned something about ""always spin[ning]""](https://youtu.be/3n7046RUjt0?t=20m12s). What he meant is not sure. Some people connect it to the Pokestops which offer items, but perhaps this is a hint to some hidden easteregg


**2.1 Game mechanics**

* Using the AR mode to find anything special like QR-Codes

* Taking pictures of (certain) Pokemon

* Renaming Pokemon and evolving them/powering them up

* Renaming Pokemon and transferring them

* Pokemon can be renamed with Emojis and also be formated with &lt;b&gt; Bold &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; Italic &lt;/i&gt;

* Anything hidden in the journal

* Anything hidden on the trainer page (character, medals etc..)

#3. THEORIES/IDEAS:

**3.1 Ditto and Red Gyarados Theories**

Please note that it's [not 100% sure](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/4ulg0d/a_programmers_perspective_on_the_seemingly/) whether Ditto is obtainable yet or not. Therefore it's possible that Ditto will only be unlocked during an event or so.

I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/4ui3is/ditto_easter_egg_thread/) thread about more detailed Ditto theories, if you want to take a look in it. That's why I these theories and will only update this part, if something confirmed is discovered.

Same for Red Gyarados. We don't know if he exists in Pokemon GO. Therefore don't expect much when trying out these ideas. Also, there are lots of [points](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/4ui975/pokemon_go_easter_eggs_and_theories/d5u99gc) which suggest that Shinies are not implemented in the game (yet). 

**3.2 Renaming Theories**

After renaming and evolving/powering up the Pokemon and restarting the App, make sure to check following things:
Does the Pokemon have any visual irregularity (try turning the Pokemon)? Is the sound abnormal? What are the Attack Moves? Any weird stats in Size/Weight?

**3.3 Other Ideas**

* You can hold the Pokeball and swipe to acces the menues. Some people had the idea of trying out some sort of [Konami Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code), but without success (yet?) 

* There are different thories on the colors of the rings when doing the swipe access. 1. Three Birds and Mewtwo/Lugia 2. They resemble the Pester Ball, a type of Pokeball used to catch a disguised Ditto (as Bulbasaur) in Pokemon Snap

* Don't join a team until a certain level. Maybe you can join Team Rocket or something like that. A Level 25 player without team has reported that nothing special happened yet.

* Perhaps the teamleader's names are connected to an Easteregg: 
Team Valor: Candela. Team Mystic: Blanche. Team Instinct: Spark.

* Perhaps Mew can only be caught, [when you have all the other Pokemon in the Pokedex](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/4ui975/pokemon_go_easter_eggs_and_theories/d5q47rv)

* [The game was released 6th of July.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/4ui975/pokemon_go_easter_eggs_and_theories/d5q5ucc) Mew was discovered [5th of July in Guyana, South America](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Mansion_journals). Perhaps an event on one of these dates next year? Mewtwo was given birth 6th of February.

* In Red and Blue MissingNo was unlocked by performing a glitch after an old man shows you how to catch a Pokemon. Maybe a glitch can be performed during/after the tutorial

* [Maybe something could be triggered when multiple trainers fight with certain Pokemon at the same time. Are there any special combos?](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/4ui975/pokemon_go_easter_eggs_and_theories/d5q9a6q) Suggestions: Nidorino and Gengar. They are the first battling Pokemon appearing in the Anime.
Or a [Shellder attacking a slowpoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR5ELoh0IPI) 

* [Anyone tried fully evolving their starter?](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/4ui975/pokemon_go_easter_eggs_and_theories/d5qog0e)

* When changing the phone's date to Feb. 27th a lucky egg/ incense timer will appear stuck at 31:23. Perhaps it's some sort of hint for Ditto (Pokedex entry #132). More information: At that timestamp the first pokemon movie shows a scene where you can see a [poster of Nurse Joy missing](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/4ui975/pokemon_go_easter_eggs_and_theories/d66byub). Perhaps there's something connected to the name ""Joy""

* When doing a curveball you can spin the Pokeball for some time until it stops sparkling (I counted roughly 129 turns in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FavLMSFbtAI)

**3.4 Putting certain Pokemon in the same Gym** (5x Squirtle Debunked, so not sure if this works at all)

 /u/Vayzian had the idea of putting certain Pokemon into the same Gym. I guess favoritising these Pokemon does not work (tested for Brock and Misty)

* For example Misty's team in the Anime consisted of Staryu, Starmie, Goldeen, Gyrados, Horsea and Psyduck. She temporarily had a Seaking, Golduck, Pikachu, Vulpix, Scyther and Bulbasaur

* In the Anime Brock had a Geodude and an Onix.
Thanks to /u/Vorgarian who told me to add Zubat and Vulpix to Brock's Pokemon

* Ash had Pikachu, Charizard, Bulbasaur, Snorlax, Kingler, Muk and 30 Tauros (only used 1 of them). Temporarily he owned Lapras, Pidgeotto -&gt; Pidgeot, Squirtle (from the Squirtle Squad), Charmander -&gt; Charmeleon, Krabby, Primeape, Haunter, Caterpie -&gt; Metapod -&gt; Butterfree and a Raticate

* Red: Lapras, Snorlax, Charizard, Blastoise, Venusaur and Pikachu

* Officer Jenny: mainly Growlithe, Arcanine; Others: Gastly, Blastoise, Pidgeot, Parasect, Tangela and the Squirtle Squad

* Nurse Joy: mainly Chansey; Others: Pikachu, Rattata, Pidgey, Magnemite, Bulbasaur, Jynx

* Squirtle Suqad: 5x Squirtle [DEBUNKED by myself, therefore I think that the other ones won't work either..]


#4. NEED FURTHER TESTING:

* Special Locations from the Google April's fool might reveal certain Pokemon. (Special Spawners? Nests?) You can find a list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/21ub4t/google_maps_pokemon_list_where_to_find_them/). A Parisian reported nothing consistently special in Paris. Need further testing for other Locations

* Shellder attacking Slowpoke in a Gym [tested once under certain conditions](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/4ui975/pokemon_go_easter_eggs_and_theories/d5sfbqb) . Someone maybe try fighting an enemy gym and/or having the necessary candies? Perhaps team up with someone from another team and tell him to deploy Slowpoke for research purposes


#5. BUG OR FEATURE/HINT?

* There seems to be some sort of bug when favoritising Pokemon and swiping around. Just a bug or possible path to an eastergg? Links are [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/4ui975/pokemon_go_easter_eggs_and_theories/d5qgvxa?context=3), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/4ui975/pokemon_go_easter_eggs_and_theories/d5s56oq) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/4ui975/pokemon_go_easter_eggs_and_theories/d5qbl7t)

#6. DEBUNKED:

People reported these theories as false.

* Apparently renaming already existing Weezing and Arbok does nothing. Evolving an Ekans resulted in a Arbok with Acid and Sludge Wave, nothing special. I guess Weezing won't have anything special either.
* The fourth ""Eevee brother"" was called Mikey and had an Eevee which he didn't want to evolve. Maybe evolving an Eevee called Mikey does something, although it doesn't totally fit into the story.
* In the Anime Series there was a Pikachu named [Puka](https://youtu.be/x5MnZnNRM18) Maybe evolving such a Pikachu does something ... there has an image on the internet, which seems to be fake. 
* Swiping Pokestops from left to right or right to left makes a difference (this is false)
* Renaming a Growlithe to Growlie and evolving it might do something
* Naming a Meowth ""That's Right"" and evolving it could have some sort of effect
* Initially Ditto disguises as Pikachu in the Anime. Maybe evolving/powering up a Pikachu named Ditto reveals it
* In the game Pokemon Snap Ditto disguises as Bulbasaur. Maybe evolving/powering up a Bulbasaur named Ditto reveals it
* Another theory is naming the Pokemon Ditto will reveal that it's a Ditto
* Favoritising certain Pokemon might change your appearance (tested for Brock and Misty)
* Ritchie's Butterfree was named [Happy](https://youtu.be/qLET9qBSkYM?t=17m39s) I named my existing one Happy but nothing changed. Maybe it has to evolve into a Butterfree while being named ""Happy""
* Evolving a renamed Charmander (Zippo) results in a Charmeleon with Ember + Flamethrower, just as in the Anime 
* Ingress Glyphs are not related to Pokestops
* [Hit the evolve Button and cancel it 400 times](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/4ui975/pokemon_go_easter_eggs_and_theories/d5qf2lo)
* [Do the same thing as above while having 399 Candies](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/4ui975/pokemon_go_easter_eggs_and_theories/d5qf2lo)
* [Apparently a Lure/Lucky Egg will be activated, when you change your phone's date to your birthday](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/4ui975/pokemon_go_easter_eggs_and_theories/d5qxjyp). It doesn't have any effect, though. Someone needs to try this during his real birthday, since I guess that the date is also checked by the server. For me changing the date didn't work, but further testing is required. New: Changing the date to Feb. 27th (Pokemon Release day) activates the Incense/Lucky Egg symbol without effect. Update: Tested with an actual birthday, no effect.
* [This bug](https://imgur.com/LPkRvok) triggered by Apple users on the incubator screen could be something to start with. (EDIT: These jumbled letters apparently [change](http://imgur.com/nRJddzN), so I guess it's really just a bug.
* Releasing a Butterfree named ""Bye Bye""
* On the screen where the servers are down you can see following Pokemon:
Golbat, Magnemite, Psyduck, Meowth, Oddish, Rattata, Pikachu, Weedle, Magikarp, Paras, Eevee, Bulbasaur, Squirtle, Charmander, Pidgey, Caterpie and Slowpoke. Perhaps favoritising (or something else) all these does something
* Articuno and Ditto have been in player's hands for a short while, for Niantic accidentally gave them out. They are revoked now.
* Attacking with 5 Squirtles at the same time did not trigger anything special

If anyone could help verifying or disprove these theories that would be great! If you have other Theories or any results feel free to post them.

marisam7,2016-07-22 19:43:15+00:00,Debunking Myths about Islam,"#Myths about the proportion of Islamic Terrorist Attacks on U.S Soil

So I was on Facebook recently and saw a post claiming that, ""Islam has carried out more than 100,000 terrorist attacks against Americans since 9/11"" with no citations what so ever.

Looking at the Facebook group that posted this, I assumed from the fact their profile picture is a stock image of an interracial couple inside of a snipers crosshairs with the caption ***""Race mixing and Liberalism is a mental illness but we have the cure""*** that most people would be able to see this group isn't the most trustworthy source but despite that, the post had hundreds of upvotes and comments. Not from Neo-Nazis and White Supremacists but from average people.

I saw dozens of comments from people like Susan (*A retired school teacher and grandmother from Indiana*) who responded by talking about how the liberal media refuses to even acknowledge Muslims are a problem despite them killing thousands of Americans every day and how when Obama finally dies the lord Jesus will send him to hell for him helping cover up the evil deeds of Muslims. 

Or people like Gary (*A small business owner and NRA member from South Carolina*) Who responded to the graph by making a long incoherent rant where he talked about how when he was a kid during Vietnam the liberals tried so hard to go after our soldiers calling them rapists and baby killers and just because they didn't like the methods didn't mean someone had to them and because they did what they did we won the war and the Vietnamese realized they could never take over America so they didn't try and bring the fight to the US. 

His post then goes on to argue that we need to put someone with balls in the white house who will let soldiers do what they did in Vietnam and when that happens the terrorism will stop. 

Now its very frighting that people like Gary who not only for some reason believe that the U.S won the Vietnam war (which they didn't) and who thinks that the Vietnamese wanted to take over the United States  (which they didn't) but also ontop of that thinks the reason the US won the war is because U.S soldiers raped women and murdered children and that if the U.S started committing war crimes again the terrorism would stop.

Ignoring the fact of how scary it is that a person like Gary is allowed to own firearms. And the fact that [U.S soldiers have raped and murdered children while deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmudiyah_rape_and_killings) The main thing I learned from this post is how people just making up numbers can incite hatred and violence.

I looked more into Facebook and found other lists that actually do go through all the Islamic terrorist attacks. Yet these lists will cite things like: 

&gt; **Nation of Islam member robbing a convenient store in 1975** 

as a terrorist attack. Or 

&gt; **Turkish man who was in prison for bank robbery in New York stabbing a prison guard in 1981** 

as an ""Islamic terrorist attack on law enforcement."" 

Going through these lists more many of the examples they give just didn't happen. They will give a name or a description of an event or a location or a date and when I google the info I don't find any results for it being real or in many cases it did happen but the perpetrator wasn't even a Muslim.

Some of these lists all of which are poorly put together and without any real citations circulating on Facebook and other known Islamophobic websites have even been republished by actual news sources such as [WorldNetDaily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldNetDaily) to the response in the comment sections of paranoid delusional rants by people who use obscure biblical passages and sources of Islamic text to falsely claim Muslims truly worship Satan and Islam translate directly into ""the religion of the devil""

**So I decided to go through the list starting with the World Trade Center bombings in 1993 and create a coherent list of all the successful Islamic terrorist attacks which resulted in at least 1 death that occurred on US soil.** 

I found soon after that it didn't take long to make this list. Due to the fact that since 9/11 there have only been 9 successful Islamic terrorist attacks.

At this point I thought even though [you are 7 times more likely to be killed by a right wing extremist then a Muslim terrorist in the United States](http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/11/30/3725562/you-are-more-than-7-times-as-likely-to-be-killed-by-a-right-wing-extemist-than-by-muslim-terrorists/) and even though [Non-Muslims Carried Out More than 90% of All Terrorist Attacks in America.](http://www.globalresearch.ca/non-muslims-carried-out-more-than-90-of-all-terrorist-attacks-in-america/5333619)
This is just one country. 

So I decided to look at another country with a significantly higher Muslim Population. 

Canada which has well over a million Muslims who make up 3% of its population and instead of doing a small 20 year timeline I decided to look into the entire history of the country to get the most accurate results.


#Number of Terrorist Attacks in Canada by motive.

**Freedomites**

* Number of terror attacks: 300+

* Number of injuries: 6

* Number of deaths: 3

**Quebec Nationalists**

**So to put this into comparison there are half the number of followers of Sikhism in Canada than Islam.**

**Yet Sikhs have killed 162 times more people in the name of their religion than Islam has in Canada alone.**

Despite this, no one is calling for Sikhs to be deported by the millions.

Now to the people out there saying, 

&gt; ***You only look at terrorism, what about all the other crimes muslims commit!***

#Well lets look at a few places around the world:

**The first place I'm going to look at is the city with the highest Muslim population in the United States,  Dearborn Michigan.** 

Dearborn has a population of around 100,000 people half of which are of Arab Decent.

[*Last year Dearborn had 3 murders and 35 rapes.*](http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/mi/dearborn/crime/)

**Lets look at other cities in the United States with the same population but instead of being populated by Muslims lets look at cities populated by White Christians.** 

Billings, Montana is a city with a population of around 100,000 people same as Dearborn. 90% of these people are white. 

And the city has such a small Muslim population that there isn't even a mosque in it. 


[*Last year Billings had 10 murders and 72 rapes*](http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/mt/billings/crime/)

Just in case that one example was an outliar I looked up a few cities with the same population as Dearborn to compare the crime rate

City | Number of Murders 2015| Number of Rapes 2015
---|---|----
Dearborn MI | 3| 35
Sandy Springs GA| 6 | 40 
Pueblo CO | 10 | 152
Billings MT | 10| 72
West Palm Beach FL |15 | 45

I could keep going but I think you get the point. 

Dearborn Michigan despite having more Muslims liveing there than anywhere else in the US is below the average national crime rate.

[Dearborn  is 16% safer than the average city.](http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/mt/billings/crime/)

And statistically speaking 64% of the people reading this right now are more at risk where they are live currently than if they moved to Dearborn and surround themselves with Muslims.

Chances of being a victim of crime:

&gt; In Dearborn
1 in 275

&gt; In Michigan
1 in 234

But forget about the U.S lets look at cities outside of America. Last time we looked at Canada lets look at the U.K this time.

###**Birmingham has one of the largest Muslim populations in England.**

[One out of every 5 people in the city of Birmingham is a Muslim.](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html) 

It is one of the highest Muslim Populations in the country.

[Let's look at the crime rate there:](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/crime-statistics-for-birmingham-3217262)



City | Crime Rate Per 100 Residents
---|---
Birmingham | 5.15
 UK Average | 6.57
London | 42.53

###But maybe that isn't good enough for you lets look at the rest of Europe:

**Amsterdam has been cited as having one of the largest Muslim populations in Europe. Pretty soon 20% of the city will be Muslims.** 

You would think this influx of immigrants would cause the crime rate to sky rocket right? 

I myself assumed it would when I was researching this and honestly was shocked to see news articles titled: 

&gt; [AMSTERDAM’S 2015 HOMICIDE FIGURES HIT RECORD LOW](http://www.nltimes.nl/2015/12/30/amsterdams-2015-homicide-figures-could-hit-record-low-point/) 

But the fact of the matter is its true that they did. 

* In 2015 there was 15 murders in Amsterdam 

* In 2013 there was 22 murders in Amsterdam

* In 1998 there was 65 murders Amsterdam

The higher the Muslim population has been getting in Amstredam the lower the murder rate gets.

&gt; ***But how can that be?!?! Multiculturalism is a failure just look at the rape rate in Sweden! What about all those Muslims raping children? I read about on Brietbart and infowars!***

Well even if it wasn't for the fact that many news headlines about Muslin Refugees raping and killing people are fake.

And when I mean fake I mean literally Infowars and breitbart just outright reported lies.

Such as the time them (along with many other right wing news outlets) reported the story about Syrian Muslim refugees gang raping a little girl in Idaho. 

[Local officials and police even had to have a press conference afterwards to explain not only did the story never happen but there aren't even any refugees who live in the entire county.](http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/state/idaho/article84829787.html)

And no, none of the right wing news sites ever apologized for spreading false info or even redacted the stories. They still have them up on their site without even acknowledging it was proven to be false.

Reasons like this are probably why so many media watchdog groups and committees into the ethics of journalism have time and time again ranked Brietbart as one of the most dishonest journalist outlets ever created. And when I say ever created they get a lower ranking than North Korean State Run Propaganda Media.

But for the stories that are true where it turns out a Muslim did kill someone or molest a child, even though these cases are rare they still do happen. The only thing the media never talks about is how they **happen at a lower rate than the native born population.** 

If you were to randomly pick 100,000 American Citizens born in the US and then pick 100,000 Americans originally born in other countries. [You would discover that that the number of immigrants who had committed crimes is lower than the number of native born Americans who committed crimes.](http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mythical-connection-between-immigrants-and-crime-1436916798) 

The only difference when a Muslim refugee molests a child and when a Catholic Priest does the same thing. Is that when the Muslim does it you don't see the Catholic Church covering it up. 

[And Muslim groups aren't spending millions of Dollars to lobby against sex crime laws like Catholics groups are.](http://www.ibtimes.com/new-york-catholic-church-spent-2m-lobbying-against-child-sex-abuse-accountability-2376078)

But in response to common claims that multiculturalism is a failure because Sweden has the second highest rape rate on earth and allows refugees in I just want to remind everyone that the rape rate didn't sky rocket in Sweden after they started allowing refugees into the country. [The rape rate skyrocketed in 2005 when Sweden reformed its sex crime legislation to make the definition of rape much much wider. Ontop of that the Swedish police trained to improve the handling of rape cases which led to more victims coming forward to report assaults. This is why the rape rate appears to be so much higher than it is. Even though Criminologists say that the number of rapes that occur in the country aren't above average and surveys from The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights discovered that instead of being the rape capital of the world Sweden is actually below neighboring countries of Denmark and Finland in terms of the number of rapes.](http://2static2.fjcdn.com/comments/Inb4+quot+look+at+their+rape+levels+you+cuck+quot+_473d0e13a7742baf9aa976bb534e1457.jpg)

&gt; ***But the Qur'an is violent!***

Here are a few quotes:

&gt; ***""If a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father.  Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her.""***

&gt; ***""If within the city a man comes upon a maiden who is betrothed, and has relations with her, you shall bring them both out of the gate of the city and there stone them to death: the girl because she did not cry out for help though she was in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbors wife.""***

&gt; ***""You may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you.  You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land.  You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance.""*** 

&gt; ***""When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are.  If she does not please the man who bought her, he may allow her to be bought back again.  But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her.  And if the slave girl’s owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his daughter.  If he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his wife.""***

&gt; ***""If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.""***

&gt; ***“A man or a woman who is a medium or a necromancer shall surely be put to death. They shall be stoned with stones; their blood shall be upon them.”***

&gt; ***""If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you love, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, “Let us go and worship other gods” do not yield to them or listen to them. Show them no pity. Do not spare them or shield them. You must certainly put them to death. Your hand must be the first in putting them to death, and then the hands of all the people. Stone them to death, because they tried to turn you away.""***


* Punishing Women for Being Raped
* Promoting Sexual Slavery
* Stoning Gays
* Stoning Witches
* Murdering Infidels

**These seem like quotes from a barbaric stone age death cult right?**


Well you would be correct because **these quotes are from the Bible.** ^(The same book the Republicans and Trump want to use to govern the country.)

&gt; ***But the difference between Christians and Muslims is Christians don't follow those quotes and would never do that! They don't have child brides or commit honor killing or any of those evil Muslim things!***

Except they do. 

[In Christian Majority Mozambique women can be punished for being raped by being forced to marry their rapists and this is in accordance to the law.](http://allafrica.com/stories/201402270391.html)

[Christians in The Central African Republic execute more people every year for witchcraft in the name of Jesus than all the Muslims in the middle east do according to the UN.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/centralafricanrepublic/12018588/Christian-militias-in-Central-African-Republic-burnt-witches-at-stake-says-UN-report.html) 

[40% of the marriages in Tanzinia involve child brides according to Human Rights Watch.](https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/12/09/ending-child-marriage-africa)

**And honor killings aren't even an Islamic specific concept.** 

[You can find many examples of cases where a Christian father beat his daughter to death with a metal bar because she wanted to marry her Muslim boyfriend.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/23/israel)

[Look at India. Where Hindu and Sikhs are some of the highest perpetrators of honor killings on earth today.](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/honour-killings-are-a-separate-horror/article8381779.ece) 

Even in places like Brazil it was a big problem until recently. Men could be acquitted for murdering their wives up until 1991 on the basis of them digracing their honor, and because of that you would see 800 recorded murder honor killings in a year. Even after the laws were changed, lower courts still ignored the ruling of the Supreme Court and acquitted people like Joao Lopes for a double homicide.

&gt; ***But women in Somalia aren't allowed to drive***

The idea of showing the treatment of women in Somalia as proof that Islam is evil makes as much sense as showing the treatment of women in the Congo as proof that Christainity is evil.

Lets look at a Muslim nation that isn't torn by war as see how they treat women:

Kyrgyzsta is a landlocked country located in Central Asia with a population of 5 million people. In this country close to 9 out of every 10 people are Muslims.

In 2010 after large opposition protests caused the President to resign the Muslim majority population voted and elected [Roza Otunbayeva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roza_Otunbayeva) as the country's new leader. [Roza Otunbayeva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roza_Otunbayeva) is not only a woman but an atheist. 

Why is it that in Kyrgyzsta and Somalia they both read the same holy book ^(The Qur'an) but in one country an Atheist woman would be stoned and in the other elected president. 

It's probably the same reason why in both Italy and the Congo they read the same holy book ^(The Bible) but in one an Atheist woman would be stoned and in the other elected president. 

&gt; ***But still why is the middle east so war torn to begin with? Why can't you get your stuff together and stop oppressing women?***

I wish you could post pictures on reddit but you can't so I'll just link them with a description:

[**Here is a picture of a Muslim woman named Benazir Bhutto she is the former Prime Minister of Pakistan.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benazir_Bhutto)

&gt; ***So what changed? To make it the way it is today?***

* The same thing that changed Latin America to make it a violent cesspool of Drug Cartels.

* The same thing that changed Southeast Asia that allows the rise of anti-government rebels. 

**The United States government came into the region, overthrew their democratically elected leaders and replaced them with Islamic extremist dictators who would sell oil for a cheap price, and denounce the Soviets.**

The Middle East didn't even have Muslim countries before. They were secular nations where people elected leaders. 

In Saudi Arabia the monarchy the country has is literally only 60 years old. They didn't have a King before that they had a President.

[
The Taliban.](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/who-is-responsible-for-the-taliban)

Before these coups there wasn't widespread terrorism. Look at Syria in 1948 and look at America. One of those countries had groups of religious extremists going around dragging people from their homes and lynching them solely because of their race. 

* Those religious extremists were the K.K.K and that country was America.

Look at Afghanistan in 1985 and look at Ireland. One of these countries had groups of paramilitary religious extremists kidnapping and murdering innocent people. Bombing hospitals and public places, killing dozens at a time. 

* Those religious extremists were the IRA and that country was Ireland.

There isn't even a counterpart to compare the groups to because none existed in these countries. No one was doing these things before the CIA got involved. 

&gt; ***But like you said the CIA did the same thing in Latin America and Africa and South East Asia. So why is it only Muslim countries who become terrorists? Why don't those countries have terorrism?***

* [In Myanmar Buddhist Terrorists have been targeting religious minorities and killing hundreds of them](http://world.time.com/2013/06/20/extremist-buddhist-monks-fight-oppression-with-violence/) Though they target all non-Buddists. They have been going after Muslims especially hard [massacring dozens in a single attack.](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/un-dozens-of-rohingya-muslims-massacred-by-buddhists-in-rakhine-burma/)

* In Israel there are unprovoked and well organized attacks by Jewish Terrorists. [Things like the Duma attacks which happened last year where a group of Jewish Terrorists decided to pick  a random Muslim home and firebombed it, killing an 18 month old child and two other people.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duma_arson_attack) Even outside of Israel in the United States groups like [The Jewish Defense League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Defense_League) are responsible for acts of terrorism. Whether it be the time they tried to assassinate a US congressman in 2001. Or time [one of their members massacred 29 people.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_the_Patriarchs_massacre)  

* Hindu terrorism is so common that there is even a word for it. It's called Saffron terror. And not only are [there more Hindu extremists than Muslims.](http://scroll.in/article/718458/most-extremists-in-india-are-not-muslim-they-are-hindu) but [the Indian government considers Hindu Terrorists a much larger threat as well.](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Rahul-Gandhi-told-US-Hindu-extremists-are-a-bigger-threat-to-India/articleshow/7115703.cms)

* For Christian terrorists I could go on and on about this, pointing out examples of groups like The Lord's Resistance Army who are still active in Uganda and South Sudan and who are [still claiming child sex slaves in the name of Jesus.](https://www.rt.com/news/kony-children-sex-slavery-396/) But I'm going to try and put this into numbers. [ISIS has killed a total of 18,800 people \(almost all were other Muslims\) so far. According to the latest UN figures.](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isis-terror/isis-death-toll-18-800-killed-iraq-2-years-u-n499426)
In that same amount of time [Christian Terrorists in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have killed a total of 300,000.](https://www.hrw.org/africa/democratic-republic-congo)

**Christian terrorists in a single country kill 16 times more people than ISIS has world wide.** 

&gt; ***Why isn't the media talking about this?***

The short reasons is that there isn't any oil in the Congo so no one cares.

**But back to the main point of this post:**

#Islam isn't causing terrorism. 

* If it did, you would expect to see Muslims in Canada reading the Qur'an and bombing buildings

* You would expect that back in the 60s Syria would of had terrorists doing the exact same thing they are doing now.

* You would expect Muslims in Kyrgyzsta not voting for a woman as President.

* And most of all you would expect that if it did cause terrorism there would be more terrorism and violence in Muslim countries as opposed to the opposite which is the case if you compare Muslim communities in the west with non-Muslim communites and compare the Middle East with 99% population Christian nations in Central Africa.

&gt; ***So what is the reason for terrorism then?***

The reason for terrorism is there being nothing to stop it.

If anyone has watched Walking Dead or Mad Max or any post apocalyptic movie then you understand the idea of those raving bands of killers and rapists going around doing whatever they want because there isn't anyone to stop them. 

Now if we put that into a real life scenario what happens is you get ISIS, you get the The Lord's Resistance Army and the Catholic Drug Lords in Honduras with their own Patron Saints and the Atheistic Rebels murdering missionaries in Thailand for being Christians and so on... 

If you are upset about terrorism here is a way you can stop it that way isn't[ harassing Muslims on the street and uploading the video to Instagram.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BHlDJBSAtxc/) The way is actually helping to stop the destabilization of these countries [by telling the U.N to do its job.](http://www.un.org/en/contact-us/)

*-Edit-*

*Thanks to /r/nureng for this*

&gt; ***But I heard that X% of Muslims want to murder infidels and kill innocent people? And force Islam on everyone.***

I've seen this a lot before. Anyone who is reading a poll that claims things like:

&gt; 80% of Muslim Americans told us they want to take over the country.

I urge you to actually find out who did this poll and look into their sample size and methodology because the weird thing is the people who are putting out these polls are always the same people. They are groups like [the Gatestone Institute which has been discredited time and time again as an Anti-Islamic propaganda mongerer.](http://www.alternet.org/investigations/one-americas-most-dangerous-think-tanks-spreading-islamophobic-hate-across-atlantic) They are people like [Frank Gaffney who was literally banned from all of the other conservative think tanks for being to racist and crazy even for them.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gaffney)

And always these polls are never Primary Sourced or Peer Reviewed. How about we look at some actually well established and cited polls.

**Here is one such example below:**

*Some people think that for the military to target and kill civilians is sometimes justified, while others think that kind of violence is never justified. Which is your opinion?*

 | Muslim | Protestant | Catholic | Jewish | Mormon | No religion/Atheist/Agnostic
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
Never justified | 78% | 38% | 39% | 43% | 33% | 56% | 
Sometimes justified | 21% | 58% | 58% | 52% | 64% | 43% | 
Depends | 0% | 0% | 2% | 3% | 3% | 0% | 

Keep in mind that the question was not asking about ""collateral damage"" but rather **targeting civilians**.

* http://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/njiym7x7nkuh2cnawawxka.gif

&gt;Gallup analysis suggests that one's religious identity and level of devotion have little to do with one's views about targeting civilians. According to the largest global study of its kind, covering 131 countries, it is human development and governance - not piety or culture - that are the strongest factors in explaining differences in how the public perceives this type of violence.

&gt;While the majority of world citizens agree that military attacks targeting civilians are never justified, a decade after 9/11, there is a wide range in the level of support for this view. A clear majority in Asia and MENA find military attacks against civilians unacceptable. This is not surprising considering the acute conflicts raging in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, and other parts of the Middle East.


&gt;In contrast, regionally, residents of the U.S. and Canada are most likely to say that military attacks against civilians are sometimes justified. **Americans are the most likely population in the world (49%) to believe military attacks targeting civilians is sometimes justified, followed by residents of Haiti and Israel (43%).**

* http://www.gallup.com/poll/157067/views-violence.aspx

Now if you do find polls that are well cited saying: 

&gt; X% of Muslims in this country want Sharia Law

Then I would encourage you to find out what percent of Christians in that country want Biblical Law.

Because if its the United States the number would have to be over 57% to beat the Republicans.

[**Since 57% of Republicans want Christianity to be the national religion of America according to a national survey done by Public Policy Polling**](http://www.politicususa.com/2015/02/25/57-republicans-dismantle-constitution-christianity-national-religion.html)

**-Edit-**

Looking more into disproportionate representation of Muslims I found that despite Muslims making up 23% of the worlds population [they account for 5 out of the past 12 Nobel Peace Prize winners.](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/) (Which is 42 percent.)

CS:GO majors are supposed to be the pinnacle of our eSport. These are the tournaments that fans look forward to most, and that teams spend months preparing for more so than any other league or tournament.

Should it not follow, then, that the majors adopt a format more conducive to the high-level of competition and high stakes that they inherently present to teams and fans?

[This is the actual bracket](http://i.imgur.com/Tkrewxr.png) for the Cologne Major 2016. There's nothing really wrong with it... but in a vacuum, does that ""look"" like a major?

Now, let's consider what a double-elimination bracket [***could*** have looked like](http://i.imgur.com/t0dGdH6.png) if it was used instead. Does that not ""look"" more intense? More worthy of being called a major?

The fact is, the double-elimination bracket is nothing new for Valve. They've been using it since [The International 1](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/The_International/2011#Results) for DotA 2 (2011). Just for those of you who aren't familiar with DotA 2, The International (TI) is like the Superbowl of DotA 2. It's easily the biggest tournament of the year, and is their premiere major. But in 2015, Valve implemented a Major system for DotA 2 as well. Each season brings a Major, and is hosted in a specific region: 

* **Fall Major 2015** (Frankfurt, Germany - EU Region)
* **Winter Major 2016** (Shanghai, China - CN Region; massive shitshow, but that's a different story)
* **Spring Major 2016** (Manila, Philippines - SEA Region; massive success, ironically produced by PGL)
* **Summer Major 2016** AKA **The International 6** (Seattle, Washington, USA - NA Region)

CSGO doesn't necessarily have to mimic this structure exactly, but the rotating regional hosting is nice for regions that love that specific game (e.g. the Philippines is an absolute die-hard DotA region, as is Russia/CIS—they've both resisted the switch to League of Legends).

Each one of these majors has a double-elimination bracket, and they all last an entire week (except TIs, which last 10 days). There is much fanfare, there are many storylines, the games are always incredible, as is the feel of the tournament—it just *feels* like a really big deal not just for the players but for the fans as well (whether in the crowd or watching at home).

There is a reason that I edited the hypothetical double-elimination bracket the way I did. If you'll notice, the grand finals ended up being SK from the upper bracket, and G2 coming out of the lower bracket. I think this illustrates the benefit of a double-elimination bracket better than anything else because it shows that this format can help to negate bad group draws which, though rare, happened in Group D this major. Of course, people will argue: ""If they deserved to make it through, they wouldn't have lost in groups."" I totally agree. But for a tournament and a prize pool if this magnitude, the fact that two BO1s in a godly-stacked group can destroy the dreams of these players seems less than ideal to me. Again, these players spend a lot of time preparing new strategies specifically for these events. Then they find out that they're in a group with SK and Fnatic, or Na'Vi and VP. At least with a double elimination bracket, they can still make a run through the Lower Bracket. 

Besides, this is not without precedent. At the Frankfurt Major in DotA, team OG [came through the lower bracket](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/Frankfurt_Major/2015#Results) against all odds to win in the grand finals after placing 3rd in their group. If Frankfurt was single elimination, OG would have been done after the group stage. It was a Miracle- run (puns!), and was one of the most unexpected storylines (and still is, considering OG came out of nowhere to win and are now the best team in the world after winning the most recent Manila Major). 

CSGO needs something like this. I know that DotA 2 is Valve's baby/flagship game, but CSGO is growing up fast and has as many eyes on it as DotA now; I think it deserves equal treatment. Besides, Steam wouldn't have existed in the first place without vanilla CS—don't forget your roots, Lord GabeN.

Remember: the goal of a double-elimination bracket is to make sure that the two best teams are in the grand finals. It's not to make things unnecessarily long or to make it unfair for teams like Liquid or FlipSid3. On the contrary, it works both ways: the LB can help keep teams like nV and G2 and NiP alive; it also serves to give the upsetting teams a second chance to keep their runs alive: Gambit, FlipSid3, etc. The ultimate goal is to leave absolutely no doubts that the it is, in fact, the two best teams facing each other in the Grand Finals. With a double elimination, there can be no more excuses made by the fans.

#How else can we improve the major system? 

Well, I'm going to say the ""c"" word. How about crowd-funding? I know we have the stickers, but that goes directly to the organizations/Valve. It is a more altruistic form of ""crowd funding"" because the teams that realistically don't have a chance of winning can still earn some extra money with these profits. But why not introduce something additional that will contribute specifically to the overall prize pool for everyone? DotA uses the [Battle Pass/Compendium](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/The_International_2016_Battle_Pass) system to fund their Majors. Just look at the sheer amount of things for DotA players to do with that, as well as the rewards (custom skins, cursors, emotes, etc. etc.). 

Obviously, CSGO doesn't have to mirror this exactly. For example, Valve could release Major-specific weapon cases that will be available only in a time frame leading up to the major (for example, 2 months). A percentage of the money spent on the keys purchased for this case will go directly to the prize pool of the upcoming major. Or if they want, they could just use a Battle Pass/Compendium approach which, after purchase, allows you to complete quests in matches (in addition to a ton of other things). For CSGO, an example of a quest would be something like ""Get 10 headshots in one MM game."" Stuff like that. Players feel great because they're contributing to the prize pool and the Battle Pass/Compendium helps to enhance their experience when they play or at the very least give them external goals besides just winning. There are definitely caveats, however, as there is a sizable amount of DotA players complaining about some of the quests because it negatively affects gameplay by forcing questionable plays/decisions (e.g. build X item within 20 mins, when that item is not at all viable on that player's current hero).

Crowd-funding is good but not always viable—Valve only employs it with TI, not the other 3 majors, so perhaps CSGO will first have to establish its own premiere Major. Even for just one major a year, though, it helps the ""big tournament"" atmosphere when the prize pool is 10m+ instead of a static amount. It also creates an inextricable link between community/fans, company, and players—none truly exist without either of the other two. Just look at the prize pool for TI6. TI5 had a staggering [prize pool](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/The_International/2015) of $18.2m. With a starting amount of $1.6m, the TI6 pool has been increased to $17.2m+, and there is still roughly one month left before TI6 begins.

CSGO majors have a $1m flat prize pool. [ELeague](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/counterstrike/Turner_Sports/ELEAGUE/Season_1) has a bigger pool than that, and [ECS](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/counterstrike/Esports_Championship_Series/Season_1) had only $250k less. Of course, of course, distribution is different, etc., but the biggest tournament(s) of the year, sponsored and endorsed by Valve, should not be equaled or outdone by other leagues in either prize pool or competitive atmosphere.

#Fantasy Changes

These are very minor suggestions in the grand scheme of things, but the fantasy team positions/rewards could be improved. Commando is fine. Sniper is fine. But I do think that the other 3 positions leave something to be desired.

#Clutch King

Sure, guys like Hiko, Happy, GTR, cold, etc. are pretty solid picks for this (although cold should have been your perma-Commando, but I digress). The issue I have with Clutch King is that it doesn't/can't account for non-1vX clutches. a kill in a 2v2 to open a bombsite is clutch. Even killing the last player in a 2v1 is clutch if your teammate has 10hp. I know that's asking a lot, and I honestly don't know what to propose that would alleviate the issues. Perhaps kills in 2v2 or worse situations would be more appropriate; the point reward could be adjusted accordingly (4 points for 1vX kills, 2 points for 2v2 kills). Simply being the last player alive is no guarantee in and of itself.

#Eco Warrior

Let's take a look at this. Pistol kills are only guaranteed in the first two rounds of each half: pistol round, and the following force-buy round. The only other time you see pistols are during saves or force buys which, by definition, have a lower percentage chance of winning the round, and thus, of getting kills. Shouldn't ""Eco Warrior"" encompass all aspects of the eco round? Why not include SMG kills? They could offer a reward of one extra point instead of two for pistols. This also adds more viability in gun rounds as Sadokist's Jaden (sp?) Round becomes the norm (carrying 2nd/3rd round SMGs into the first gun round) and guys like Fer like to carry/buy SMGs into full-blown gun rounds as well.

#Entry Fragger

This all hinges entirely on how the ""entry frag"" is registered. Is it the first kill of the round, period? Honestly, I haven't really checked on this, hopefully someone can confirm/correct this. But if that's the case, this would be unfortunate because a lot of times, the entry fragger won't get points for entry fragging because a CT killed his teammate on the other side of the map already. The only remedy I can think of would be to separate the kills by team. In other words, if a CT kills a T at the start of the round, the T-side entry fragger can still get entry frag points so long as he's the first T to get a kill (and the same goes for CT, although technically, they're counter-entrying, but let's not discuss semantics here).

#Final Thoughts

Overall, I think these changes can improve the overall experience and reception that we, as a community, have for the majors, while also rewarding the players with bigger prize pools as well as a 2nd chance to achieve their dreams of being major champions.

Please discuss civilly your own suggestions and/or addendums/alterations to mine.

#TL;DR (as per request):

* CSGO majors should implement a double-elimination bracket
* Valve should establish a premiere CSGO major for which crowd-funding will raise the prize pool (like TI for DotA 2)
* Minor changes/tweaks to Fantasy Team positions

**EDIT**: It would seem that the consensus is that the group stage is in the most need of a makeover. The two popular suggestions are: 

* Bigger groups with a round-robin format akin to the [TI format](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/The_International/2015#Group_Stage), as suggested by /u/hansjc (and some others).
* A Swiss System BO1 format that was utilized during the [Cologne qualifiers](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/counterstrike/ESL/One/2016/Cologne/Offline_Qualifier#Format) and was received warmly by the community, suggested by our very own ResidentSleeper /u/YNkCSGO (jk &lt;3 you).

Both formats would provide the seeding for a Double-Eliminiation playoff bracket. There are also some other suggestions with keeping it Single-Elimination, but having the entire Group Stage as a BO3 format. Regardless, the purpose of this thread is to foster discussion, so dissent is a good thing.",GlobalOffensive,2057

&amp;nbsp;  
Focusing on the next stage of the Republican primary season, from an unassuming 101st day on the campaign trail to the fall of Jeb Bush, Donald Trump: A Destroyer Of Dynasties explores how the contentious billionaire dismantled his toughest rivals in the most savage primary campaign in recent memory.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**What I'm Doing Here In /r/The_Donald**  
&amp;nbsp;  
I'm originally from Seattle, which isn't big on The Donald. In fact, I lost a number of friends as a result of supporting my favorite candidate.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Initially, I thought his presence in the race was good for a laugh too. Then I started watching him.  
&amp;nbsp;  
He made a lot of sense. I didn't agree with everything he said, but I agreed with a lot of it. And one thing I admired about him was his sheer willpower to endure the worst that the media could throw at him.  
&amp;nbsp;  
So I predicted in August 2015 that he'd take the primary.  (In July, I had money on it.)  
&amp;nbsp;  
Eventually I became a bigtime centipede. Couldn't watch enough of his rallies. Couldn't get enough of the Twitter wars and the incredible drama of the most exciting campaign I'd ever seen. And when the debates happened--what a popcorn moment!  
&amp;nbsp;  
But underneath it all, what he said completely resonated with me. And I found out I was spending more time on Facebook explaining why what he was doing was working. Because nobody seemed to get it.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I'm not a big-time writer at all. In fact, I have no very good idea how to promote, in fact. But what I think is very important is that I'm the only one who's putting together a work of this magnitude about the most incredible primary campaign we've ever seen. Lots of people have no idea what they're seeing - to them, it makes no sense why he managed to beat seventeen opponents in a rough primary.  I'm here to explain it.  
&amp;nbsp;  
From the subtle psychology behind Trump's deft responses to how he bludgeons his opponents, people have been wondering exactly how Donald Trump is winning.  My books cover both what happened on the campaign trail itself, and what he did in order to win the hearts and minds of Americans across the nation. How did the billionaire withstand the combined firepower of the media? Why do his supporters stick to him like glue? Why couldn't Jeb Bush's money machine take him down? From when to how to why, I detail it here. And both of these books are great, exciting reads. Real pageturners.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Why am I getting an AMA?**  
&amp;nbsp;  
People will probably be wondering who I am and why I'm getting an AMA. I think it's not about me -it's about these books. Nobody's doing anything like them, and probably nobody will. These might become the best historical records of the entire campaign that we see out there. We're already over 100,000 words in on a crazy primary season alone - and the primary isn't even finished yet!  These books might be really important someday.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I'm living in Eastern Europe (Poland) at the moment, and book sales and my writing both go a long way toward helping me out in this unique economy over here. I don't exactly make a ton of money at my work, so I do writing on the side to cover for the money I'd be making in America. It really helps and gives me a lot of encouragement for writing more and more.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I'll be detailing the rest of the primary in the third book, **Donald Trump: A Conquerer Of Kings.** After that, hopefully we have a good general election and that there will . Let's make America great again!

HelloSaroh,2016-06-28 08:35:59+00:00,The Tip Jar- A Scary Encounter Working at a Bikini Coffee Stand at 4:00 AM,"EDIT:  Verified. :) What do you have to say now disbelievers? *Crickets*

I am not willing to share the evidence that earned the ""verified"" flair with anyone else except the mods for obvious reasons. I am no longer responding to hostile comments or comments about dis-believing my story. If you don't believe it, I no longer care as the support shown to me has been far greater and shown by intelligent, compassionate individuals. 





The Tip Jar

 Against the advice of my parents, I started working at a bikini coffee stand when I was 17 years old and continued working there until I was 20. If you are unfamiliar with “bikini coffee stands”,  they are little drive-through espresso stands (usually painted in some neon color) where the employees all wear lingerie or bikinis while they serve coffee. I know this sounds strange, and believe me, it is strange; however, the money was good , it was fun at the time, and my parents couldn’t really afford to pay for college. 



There is no loud-speaker where customers place their order. They simply drive up to the stand, order coffee, and make small talk as they ogle you in your skimpy ensemble. Anyway, it's kind of hard to explain, so maybe just Google it...the Seattle area has them all over the place.



  Within a matter of  months the boss gave me the busiest shift; the shift began at 4:00 AM and ended at 9:30 AM. Though the coffee stand was not officially open until 4:30, I had to count the till, grind the espresso beans, fill up the sinks, take stock,  clean if needed, etc. 



The coffee stand was situated in the corner of a large parking lot, sharing the enormous empty lot  with only one other retailer. The other retailer didn’t open until around 10:00 AM, and so when I arrived the lot was completely dark (save for one dim street lamp above the stand, and another in the far corner of the lot).


I pulled up to the stand as I normally did, only this time it was my first shift alone. Normally, I worked with one other girl, as the shift would get far too busy for just one person. I had a routine with regular customers, as I literally worked every single day (the boss didn’t believe in time off, unless requested). While I worked, I could see cars approach the stand, and know immediately what drink to prepare (based on my recognizing a regular customer’s vehicle). 


After almost a year on the morning shift,  it was rare to see a new vehicle, or meet a new customer. My boss was extremely strict about being fast and efficient, and would have us prepare drinks in advance for our regulars while they waited in the line of cars. My boss was so strict, that for the first six months of my working there, he would watch constantly on his camera system and call me on the business phone to scream at me for lack of efficiency. After this, I became so fast at preparing drinks, I guess he decided he would save money by having me work alone in the very early morning hours (he was stingy too).


So, like normal, I approached the stand and punched in the access code. I went inside and turned on some music right away to keep myself company. The street lamp directly above the coffee stand had burnt out a few days before, so it was rather dark outside; coupled with the tinted sliding windows of the coffee stand, and the knowledge that I was completely alone, I felt a little creeped out…. though not nearly as creeped out and terrified as I was about to feel in a few minutes. 


Even though the stand was technically open at 4:30, I wouldn’t expect my first customer until about 4:45. I usually arrived at 4:00, but since it was my first shift alone I came in at 3:30 to give myself enough time to complete all of the opening tasks. My first customer was always Dave. He drove a red sports car and ordered a double cappuccino, heavy on the foam. He worked for the local Boeing plant and would brag about his high ranking job in-between awkward remarks about my body. You get used to this sort of thing after a while, but nothing could prepare me for the sort of thing that happened to me on this particular dark morning.


  
Though many of our customers were pervy men like Dave, most of the early morning customers weren’t as lecherous as one would expect; they simply needed coffee and no other business was open as early as ours. In fact, many of my early morning customers were married women in soccer mom vans, in desperate need of caffeine.  


I glanced up at the clock as I counted the money in the till. 3:50 AM.  I finished the count and walked from the back of the stand onto the main floor. There were two steps separating the back of the stand from the “main floor” . The back of the stand had no windows and contained a bathroom, large refrigerator, washer, dryer, etc.  This is the area where my co-workers and myself would get ready, and joke around where customers couldn’t see us. 


As soon as we walked onto the main floor, where customers could see us,  “uniform” was required (meaning lingerie or bikini) as well as heels.  That morning I was wearing a matching pink lingerie set with knit stockings. The lingerie fully covered my breasts and buttocks, and provided more coverage than a typical bikini you would see at the beach.



I counted all of the syrup bottles. I opened the fridge and took stock inside. I turned on the espresso grinder and robotically poured in a bag of espresso beans. I started filling up the large commercial sink with soapy water.   Music played softly on the stereo. Then I heard it.  Over the noise of faucet, coffee grinder and the music, I wasn’t sure I heard anything at first, so I just ignored it. Then I heard it again.




Tap. Tap. Tap.




Someone was tapping on the sliding glass window of the stand. I wiped off my wet hands and grabbed my cell phone. 4:15 AM. We weren’t open for another  15 minutes. I checked the light switches to make sure I didn’t accidentally flip on the open sign. 


Along with an open sign, the stand was equipped with bright flood lights to illuminate the presence of the stand. Due to the sheer darkness that morning, I had contemplated turning on the flood lights when I first arrived, but it was strictly forbidden to do so until the stand was open. Without the flood lights on, and through the tinted glass, I could not see who was on the other side. I stood there, staring at the window. Maybe it’s just Dave, I rationalized to myself.




TAP.TAP.TAP.



 I could hear my heart thumping in my ears.  The tapping had definitely grew louder. I picked up the business phone, and punched in my boss’s number. He had an extensive camera system, complete with night vision, and could see in real time both inside and outside of the stand. In the very least, he could tell me who was outside.  The phone rang and rang. No answer.  I flipped on the flood lights. I walked over to the window, and saw the man, now illuminated by the bright lights. His head was pressed up against the glass, hands cupped around his eyes as he tried to see in. I jumped back.



“Hi!” he yelled through the glass. “Can I get some coffee?” 
“We aren’t open for another 15 minutes,” I replied. “My boss will be mad if I open early.”


“Oh, well. I can wait.” The man then walked away from the window and stepped into a small black Honda. I continued my opening duties, wearily eyeing the black Honda. At the time, I felt a false sense of security, lulled into the daily routine of my shift. However, this was different. At 4:30 I dutifully turned on the open sign and watched as the man in the black Honda drove up to the window. He was wearing a dark red baseball cap, a thermal shirt and plaid pajama pants. I opened the sliding window. 


“Hi, sorry about that. What can I get for you this morning?”  I said, trying to sound as normal as possible.


The man looked at me for what felt like an eternity. “What I want doesn’t appear to be on the menu” he said, not looking up from my crotch.

 
Okay, so, I know what you’re thinking: what did I expect working in this profession? Gentlemen? I brushed his comment aside with a laugh.


 “We have a great white chocolate mocha.” I looked around frantically. *Where the fuck was the usual morning guy, Dave?* I silently prayed another customer would pull up behind this guy. 


He looked away and stared at his steering wheel. “I want you to be my maid.” 


“Excuse me?” I said, not sure if I heard him correctly.


“I want you to be my maid. I want you to come over to my house, wearing a maid costume with nothing underneath. I want to watch you, and if you don’t clean correctly I am going to do whatever I want to you.” He paused and gripped his steering wheel tightly. “I am not a nice guy.”  He looked up at me and smiled. Until that point in my life, I had never seen a truly sinister smile before. 


I slammed the long serving window shut. I ran to the back of the stand, hyperventilating at this point. I picked up the phone and called my boss repeatedly. No answer. I  stood on the steps and peered out the window. 


The black Honda was gone, replaced by the familiar red of Dave’s sports car. I never thought I would be happy to see Pervy Dave, but here I was, rushing to the serving window to tell him what  had happened. I opened the window, all the while frantically relaying the story. Dave just laughed and muttered something about the guy dreaming. He told me that I was being paranoid and the guy just had no filter. For some reason, this put me at ease.  


Dave reached his hand out the window to place a five dollar bill in my tip jar (he tipped this amount  each morning). “Wow!” He exclaimed, “you  just opened and your tip jar is already full. I  know you make good coffee, but it’s not that great!”.  


“Huh?” I said, slamming the register shut. The tip jar rested on the outside window ledge, so customers could reach it. I made it a habit of just leaving it outside in-between customers, as it could get very busy.  


I leaned over and looked into the metal canister. Inside the tip jar was a long white envelope, that appeared to be stuffed to it’s capacity. My stomach turned, as I knew it had to be from the guy in the black Honda. 


“Dave,” I said cautiously, “it’s from that guy I just told you about. I am not opening that.”    Dave sipped his cappuccino and suddenly his goofy demeanor turned serious. “you’re right, let me open it. I have gloves.” It was late fall and rather cold out. Dave put on his gloves in a dramatic manner, laughing about my paranoia, and proceeded to step outside of his car. He took the envelope out of my tip jar and opened it. 


“Holy shit.” He said, his eyes widening. He held up a stack of $20 bills held together by a rubber band. On the back of the stack was a folded up piece of paper. He unfolded the paper and began reading it. His eyes grew even wider. His hands were shaking ever so slightly. “What!? What does it say!?”  He simply said “Get dressed and call the police.” 


 I snatched the note from him, his jaw slightly agape.  The note was laden with spelling errors and looked as if it was written in a child’s hand; oddly, there were rather long words that were attempted but spelled incorrectly. It said some very deranged things. There are some things too sick to mention here, but I will relay the basic message as best as I can recall; some things you just never forget, even if you want to (so here it is, without the spelling errors and the length; it was two pages long, front and back):


""*You will come to my house.  When you arrive I will examine you thoroughly. I will then tie you to the post and you will be punished for what you do. Every inch of your body will be bruised and sore. Afterward I will untie you and  use you in every way possible* (he used a different term, but it is extremely graphic and includes the words “hog tied”). *You can scream, but no one will hear you. This is your first payment. Upon reading this note and taking this money you have agreed to follow through. If you do not follow through you are a stealing, lying whore and you WILL be punished more severely than if you cooperated to this initial agreement.  You will clean every inch of my house. There will be no mistakes or there will be more punishment to follow.*""


I got dressed and called the police and my boss (who finally answered). The police arrived and I went to the station to explain in detail what happened. I handed them the note, along with the money for evidence. The female police officer (who appeared to be in charge) nonchalantly told me that I should probably quit my job, that this behavior was to be expected from customers. I told her that I had never experienced anything like this before.


My boss reviewed the outside video tape footage. The footage showed a man, standing outside of the coffee stand window just staring inside. Occasionally, it showed him leaning his head into the glass and cupping his hands around his eyes for a better view. It also showed him rubbing his crotch. Apparently he had been standing outside the window since 3:40 AM, ten minutes after my initial arrival.  At one point it showed him going back into his car, only to re-emerge several minutes later and finally tap on the window. I was shocked to realize that the man had watched me for almost a full hour without my knowledge. I felt stupid, but most of all, scared. The footage also revealed that the man had his license plates covered with what appeared to be white paper.


After reviewing the footage and the note, the police decided that the man posed a potential threat, and that this behavior was not normal (duh). 


They sent an undercover cop back to the stand with me.  I was shocked that they wanted me to go right back to work not even two hours after the incident. The cop sat outside in an SUV while I worked; the plan was this: if the man drove through again, I was to flick the open sign on and off to alert him of the man’s presence.


  I worked, serving all of my regular customers, trying my best to pretend nothing happened. I was told not to recall the incident to any of my co-workers or customers that morning, in case they knew the man and warned him of police involvement. The man did not return that day… but he did return. 


Little did I know, that day was only the beginning of a year-long nightmare. I know this reads like a work of fiction, but every single word of it is true. This is the first time I am fully re-telling this to anyone other than the police, my former boss, my past co-workers and my ex-boyfriend…. So please, be nice. 

Edit: Although the second installment of my story was also verified by the mods (I provided them with access to police reports, location of former employer, photographic evidence, proof of identity, news articles, name of former boss, etc.) I have chosen to take it down after receiving a slough of harassing private messages (and a couple public comments).

Edit #2: To all those who asked: this happened well over 5 years ago. I am no longer working in that industry, and I am happily ( and very recently) married to the most wonderful man on earth ( in my opinion anyhow).

****FINAL UPDATE****: I have been inundated with requests from very kind/polite individuals who would like to  hear the second installment of my story. I would love to share it with you all, but I really want to re-write it to include more details and events that happened pertaining directly to the stalking and assault incidents.

 My second installment was not well received, perhaps because I left a lot of uncomfortable personal details and events out: a drugging that resulted in a stay in the hospital, embarrassing photos that were circulated throughout my neighborhood, and other things I wasn't/am not ready to talk about because I shouldered a lot of blame for these things in the past. 

I am hesitant to share the details, as I am working really hard to graduate (college), and if my identity is somehow revealed, I do not want things that were largely out of my control to impact any future careers/plans I have.

In my previously shared second installment, I focused more on the storyline/ things that happened at work and events that could be verified by means of public record.  Right now I am focused on school as I am nearing the end of the summer term. Once I have some time to set aside, and once I am able to get in the right mental space, I will re-write and re-share the second installment; largely because  the kind private messages and comments I have received have given me encouragment. 

 I can not say when, but hopefully within the next month.  I also want my second installment to be verified (as it was before); but since I am going to completely re-write it, and include additional details, I will need to obtain hospital records and other documents to send to the mods. Thank you for taking the time to read.",LetsNotMeet,1551

sjchoking,2016-06-26 22:57:36+00:00,How a 50 team NHL alignment and expansion should look be.,"Now that Las Vegas is a confirmed team the NHL will have 31 teams. To expand to 50 this is the route I would take. 

The first thing I would do is revive teams that have been defunct which are the Quebec Nordiques, Hamilton Tigers, Hartford Whalers, Kansas City Scouts, Cleveland Baron and Altanta Thrashers. 

For the next 13 expansion teams I first looked at the most populated cities that have a team in NBA, NFL, and MLB, but not the NHL which is only Houston. Then cities with at least 2 teams in NBA, NFL or MLB: San Diego, New Orleans, Baltimore, Seattle, Indianapolis. Then most populated cities with at least 1 team: Sacramento, San Antonio, Portland, Salt Lake City, Orlando, Oklahoma City. Then I threw in Saskatoon because I needed another Canadian city in the West. 

The season will be expanded to 106 games. With 4 games(2 home, 2 away) against each division opponent and 2 games(1 home, 1 away) against the other 45 teams. Also,the playoffs will be expanded to 32 teams.

For alignment of the divisions I decided to group teams into 2 Conferences(East and West) with 5 division of 5 teams within each conference. Then for divisions I grouped teams geographically and culturally and ignored some rivalries.

**West**

*Canadian West Division*

* Vancouver Canucks
* Calgary Flames
* Edmonton Oilers
* Winnipeg Jets
* Saskatoon Sasquatch

*California Division*

* San Jose Sharks
* Los Angeles Kings
* Anaheim Ducks
* San Diego Gulls

* Las Vegas Black Knights
* Seattle Hedgehogs
* Portland Dysentery
* Salt Lake City Mormons

*Great Lakes Division*

* Detroit Red Wings
* Chicago Blackhawks
* Minnesota Wild

**East**

* Ottawa Senators
* Toronto Maple Leafs
* Quebec City Nordiques
* Hamilton Tigers

*Metro Division*

* New York Rangers
* New York Islanders
* Buffalo Sabres

Saesama,2016-06-21 21:24:54+00:00,"Child, you do not want to pay $6k to fly me out there.","Greetings, Reddit. This is actually my first post on this site, please be gentle to this nub.

I work tech support for a company that builds food prep machines. 95% of what we build is pneumatic batter depositors, with a healthy smattering of conveyors and bottle fillers, but 99.98% of our machines have some kind of air input. Cue me, day 10 on the job, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and brand new to the industry. I get a call.

&gt;Me: [Company], Saesama speaking.  
&gt;Teenaged Girl: I'm from the [Store] in [middle of nowhere, Texas] and our machine stopped working, someone needs to come fix it!  
&gt;Me: Um. Okay, miss, how about we try troubleshooting over the phone first, see if we can't figure out how to fix this?  
&gt;TG: I'm not a mechanic, can't you just send someone to fix it?  
&gt;Me: Sure. But I'm in Seattle. Your company needs to pay for my flight out, flight back, hotel, rental car, and about $250 an hour while I'm there. If you want me to arrange this, I'll need to speak to your manager.  
&gt;TG: ....okay, we can try to figure it out over the phone.  

This gets the attention of my co-workers, who are now gleefully listening in, enjoying the new guy's trial by fire. Pricks. Conveniently enough, every machine we have at [store] is identical.

&gt;Me: So, what is it doing?  
&gt;TG: It's not working!  
&gt;Me: I get that. Is it not cycling, is it not letting air through, is one side working and the other not? What's the air pressure gauge read?  
&gt;TG: There's no air line to this thing.  
&gt;Me: What? Well, what does this machine do?  
&gt;TG: It makes cakes.  
&gt;Me: ...really. Give me a minute.  

She goes on hold while I give my coworkers my best 'help this poor nub' gaze. One eventually takes pity on me and tells me that some [store]s have an electric cutter, more or less a band saw on its side for cutting frozen cakes in half. I get the tech manual for it and get back to my customer. Incidentally, this machine is cheaper than the service call to get me in Texas would be.

&gt;Me: Okay, you're talking about the cutter. It's plugged in, right? You tested the wall outlet?  
&gt;TG: Yeah, I tested it with my phone charger, but the cutter isn't working.   
&gt;Me: Okay, unplug it and take the safety cover off and the pan out. On the side with the blade, there's two metal buttons. One gets pushed by the pan, one gets pushed by the cover. Do you see them?  
&gt;TG: There's only the start button on the side.  
&gt;Me: No, the other side. By the blade.  
&gt;TG: That's the bottom.  

You ever see the Spongebob skit, 'Put your hand on the lid. No, the lid. NO, THE LID'? That was the next five minutes of my life. This thing is only a six-sided box, I do not know how we went around ten times. I tried to give as specific of directions as I could, and kept getting back answers that indicated she was by the start button, or by the power cord, or on top, or every side that wasn't the only one with a two foot long saw blade sticking out of it.

Naturally, watching me refrain from pulling my hair out was great amusement from my coworkers, one of whom invited my boss in to watch the show. 

&gt;TG: Oh, THOSE buttons. Under the knife.  
&gt;Me: ...yes. Those. When you put the cover on, does it push in the top one?  
&gt;TG: Yup!  

Progress!

&gt;Me: When you put in the pan, does it push in the bottom one?  
&gt;TG: Yeah, but it falls down under the button when I put a cake in it.  

Wat.

&gt;Me: Are the support rails for the pan broken?  
&gt;TG: Nope.  
&gt;Me: Okay. You got a camera on your phone? I'm going to give you my email address. Take as many pictures as you possibly can; pan in, pan out, pan with a cake on it, from every angle. Email them to me and we'll figure out why the pan isn't pressing the button.  
&gt;TG: Okay, I can do that. Do you guys still need me to get my manager to fly you out?  
&gt;Me: Not if you send me those pictures.  
&gt;TG: Okay, bye!  

I get off the phone and gracefully accept the hooting of my coworkers. It's not even lunch yet, so I expect to see the pictures some time in the afternoon.

Nothing.

And nothing the next morning, either. I get a little concerned. Did this cake cutter go rogue and murder everyone in this bakery? Did this minimum wage cake baker snap and chuck it out the window? I give her until lunch, and give her a call.

&gt;Me: Hey, this is Saesama, from [Company].  
&gt;TG: Oh. Uh. Hi.  

You ever talk to someone on the phone, and just know that their face is as red as a spanked monkey? That's what I'm hearing. It was almost an animu 'blushu' sound effect going on.

&gt;Me: So I never got the machine pictures from you, did something happen?  
&gt;TG: Yeah, um. Well. I had the pan. In backwards.  

The pan. With 'This End First' stamped into the leading edge. the one that's only supposed to fit in one way and is at a distinct slant if it goes in the other way. *How.*

&gt;Me: So, it works now?  
&gt;TG: Yeah! Thanks for your help, though.  
&gt;Me: No problem.  

I hang up. I thump my head off the desk a bit. One of my coworkers buys me a cookie from the vend. I am now officially indoctrinated into the Service Department.

0x0DFFB,2016-06-15 01:34:45+00:00,My friend Vic was a weird kid.,"When I was in high school I had this friend called Vic. She was a weird kid, scrawny and dirty and unpopular, and we kind of ended up as friends because I was a weird kid, too. There's a certain camaraderie, I guess, in constantly running into each other in the bathroom, cleaning spitballs out of our hair.

We started to hang out, first at school, then after and on weekends. Always at my place, though, never at Vic's. My house was across the street from a green belt, and Vic and I used to spend hours up there; building treehouses and catching frogs and all the other nonsense things kids get up to. We called it ""The Green"" and pretended it was a magical otherworld, made up this whole mythology to go around it. 

Like, I said, Vic was weird. She always wore boy's hand-me-down clothes, ratty and full of holes. This was the '90s, the age of Seattle grunge, so I guess in some other universe she would've been cool. In real life, she just smelt slightly of old cheese and flaked iron. 

I figured out what the iron smell was one day sitting in Ebbflow Hollow, also known as the old stormwater drain in The Green. 

It was a sweltering summer's day, the sort where walking barefoot on pavement leaves blisters. I was in a tank top and Vic was still wearing her torn, dirty flannel, because Vic *always* wore her torn, dirty flannel. I guess I must've asked her about it, because I remember her giving me this really long, deep look, then--very carefully--rolling up her sleeves. 

Suddenly, both the flannels and the iron smell made sense: Vic was a cutter. Everything from her wrists on up was just a tangled mass of old scarring and new scratches. Nothing suicide-deep, just shallow stuff; pain and frustration cuts. I'd never seen anything like it before. Remember this was the 90s, pre-Internet, and there was a lot less information out there about this stuff back then. I freaked out a bit at the sight of the cuts, and asked Vic why she did it. I'll always remember her answer:

""Because it's ugly. He doesn't like ugly things.""

I know what you're thinking and, nowadays, I think the same. But back then I was just a kid, and didn't know how to deal with a situation like Vic's. So I did the only thing I could think of at the time, and ignored it. 

Yeah. I won't lie; I still hate myself a little over that.

Anyway. The years dragged on and Vic and I became weird-kid-besties, sharing adventures up on the Green and helping each other survive the ravages of high school. About six months before the end, Vic started getting real lethargic. Like, falling-asleep-in-class, dark-circles-around-the-eyes lethargic. She got sent to the nurse's office a lot, where she spent most of the time asleep. I think the teachers were pretty lenient on her because they suspected what was going on at home. I mean, there are laws about mandatory reporting and whatever, but who knows. I guess they did what they could. 

Sometimes, I used to sit in the nurse's office while Vic slept, just so she wouldn't have to wake up alone. She had nightmares. Like, real bad nightmares, which I guess is why she didn't sleep so well. She told me once she used to dream the Shredded was chasing her. 

The Shredded was a monster we'd made up as part of the mythos of the Green. Once upon a time she'd been the King's wife, gentle and kind, and more beautiful than anything else in the kingdom. All men wanted her and all women wanted to be her, that sort of thing. As is always the case in these stories, one day the King went away to war. When he returned, he began to suspect his wife had been cheating on him with the other men of the court. She, of course, assured him her heat and body belonged to him and him alone. To no avail. The King's paranoia grew; he had his wife locked in a tower but was convinced men were stealing in through the window at night. So he had her locked in a dungeon, instead. Even filthy in the dark she was still beautiful, still coveted by the dungeon's jailers, so the King had a hideous mask made from iron bands and the flayed head of a deer, which he had welded in place over her head. Even that did nothing to hide his wife's beauty, nor stop other men from dreaming that, one day, they'd be able to rescue her and claim her for their own. 

Eventually, the King decided once and for all to make his wife as ugly outside as he believed she was inside. He had her stripped naked, bar her rotting deer-head mask, and dragged her on all fours through the streets. As she crawled, the people of the kingdom--still jealous of her or afraid of the King--whipped her with switches and pelted her with stones. Her bones snapped and her skin was shredded from her body, and still the King dragged her on. Until there was nothing left but a pile of broken, mangled meat beneath a rotting deer head. 

Finally, as if woken from a dream, the King saw what he had done. He tore the mask from his wife's head, only to find her beautiful face underneath; thin and dirty, but otherwise as beautiful as she'd been the day they were wed. The King howled in grief and remorse for his cruelty, but it was too late. His wife was already nothing more than a beautiful face atop a broken, mangled corpse. 

The King held that corpse, weeping, well into the night. Until the moon rose high and full and red above him and the mangled flesh in his hands began to stir. The King cried in joy, believing a miracle was returning his wife to him. It was, in a sense. But the creature that arose was not his beautiful, gentle wife, but a grotesque monster of raw muscle and tattered flesh, starvation-thin limbs broken and twisted, and shoulders topped with a grinning, rotting deer skull. 

The Shredded. 

Vic had been the one to make up the Shredded, and now it was chasing her in her dreams. We'd never really gotten around to figuring out what it did, exactly, only that it wasn't the sort of thing you wanted chasing you. 

I tried telling Vic it was just a story, just a dumb thing we'd made up. She told me she could smell it, that every night it got a little closer, and every night the smell got a little stronger. A rotten smell, like sour milk and rusted iron. 

I didn't have the heart to tell Vic that was her own smell and that, yeah. It'd been getting worse. It followed her around almost like a physical presence, sticking to everything she touched. Including me; my other friends knew if I'd been hanging out with Vic because of the stink she left on my clothes. Even my parents noticed. I started taking a lot more showers. 

The end of the year loomed and Vic just got worse and worse. She started getting really, really thin--like, skeletal thin, anorexia thin--he eyes sunken and wild. She started hallucinating, which I learnt later is a side effect of staying awake too long. Like, sometimes we'd be just hanging out or whatever and she'd grab me and start pointing at nothing, saying things like, ""There. It's right there. Can't you see it?"" At first she'd be pointing far away, like across the oval far away, but every day it was a little closer; across the car park, across the auditorium, across the classroom. Until one lunchtime, we were in the bathroom, and Vic suddenly yelled, ""It's here! Run!"" And dragged me forcibly out. I remember her fingers were *strong*, like iron bands, which shocked me because she seemed so thin and so frail. 

As we ran, I swear I felt… something brush against my back. I mean, I've relived that a lot over the years. Vic's behaviour was really scaring me by then, so I keep trying to tell myself it was nothing, just hysteria, just getting caught up in the moment, imagining fictional monsters on because it was easier to deal with that reality. I keep telling myself that, but…

But that doesn't explain the stain on the back of the hoodie I'd been wearing. A big, dark, hand-shaped smear. One that wouldn't come out, one that stank like cheese and iron, no matter how many times it was washed. 

Vic told me the Shredded was chasing her in her dreams. That, maybe, it'd always been chasing her. It'd just taken this long to get to our world from the Green; the real Green, not our imagined empty lot. That's why she didn't want to sleep, because it was so close, now. All it had to do was reach out and grab her and—

""And what?"" I'd asked, but Vic didn't know. 

The last time I saw Vic alive, it was Thursday. She was sitting in our usual place, on the stairs behind the science block, and she looked and smelt like a corpse. But she was calm. Calmer than I'd seen her in months. I remember she looked at me, eyes big and soft and gentle, and she said:

""I know what it wants now. It wants to make me ugly. If I'm ugly, he won't touch me.""

They were the last words she ever said to me. 

Vic wasn't at school that afternoon, or the day after. On Monday, the cops came. They told me Vic had been found dead in the stormwater drain--in Ebbflow Hollow--in the green belt across from my house. She'd finally cut in deep. 

There was a big investigation. In the end, Vic's death was ruled a suicide. Her uncle had been under suspicion for a while, but with no complaining witness, they couldn't make anything stick. A month after the verdict, they found him badly mauled in a local park, attacked by something that'd torn off his face and his hands and his dick. He lived, but barely, shredded in body and in mind. Official verdict was that it'd been a feral dog, and no one looked too hard after that.

It's been nearly twenty years, but I still think about Vic a lot. Particularly when the moon is high and full and red. On those nights, I dream I'm walking through the Green. It's cold and I'm barefoot and there's something following behind me. It smells like sour milk and rusted iron, and sometimes I can see its shadow on the ground; body a thin and twisted tatter, skull a stripped and grinning deer.

It's behind me, and I'm afraid. But it never gets any closer, and I never turn around. ",nosleep,1060

---------------------------------------
We are former Los Angeles gang members and social activists who are now trained community interventionists working in the same neighborhoods we came up in. We work to break the cycle of violence that we once helped to create by developing protocols to restore communities.

A few years ago, we were approached by folks who wanted to make a documentary to tell our story. **That documentary, *LICENSE TO OPERATE*, premiered today** on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, Xbox, and Vudu. The film is also debuting globally in Geneva July 6-8 at the *Reviewing the State of Safety in World Cities Conference*, organized by the UN. **Check out the trailer: *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIkzA4U7UbE***

Pete Carroll, Head Coach of the Seattle Seahawks, was instrumental in helping to bring this group together. [Here he is speaking about it on 60 Minutes.](https://youtube.com/Y-wIAL0Dfsw?t=7m2s)

Over the last few years, professionals from the public safety, local and regional municipalities, numerous universities and emergency responders have credited our work with aiding in the significant decrease of violent crimes in the neighborhoods we serve. Here’s a little more about each of us: 


* **Alfred Lomas** – Gang interventionist, former gang member from South Central Los Angeles, which he also now covers.
* **Aquil Basheer** – Founder of the License to Operate movement and the Professional Community Intervention Training Institute which officially trains/certifies interventionists and other professionals to do this work.
* **James Lipetzky** – Director of *LICENSE TO OPERATE*
* **Reynaldo Reaser** – Executive Director of R.A.C.E. (Reclaiming America’s Communities Through Empowerment), Gang interventionist and former Raymond Crip now covering LA’s West Athens Neighborhood

We’re also here with **Officer Stinson Brown** (LAPD, Gang Intervention Liaison – Criminal Gang/Homicide Division), who has been a change agent in the collaborative mindset between interventionists and law enforcement. We are all proof of what can happen when everyone works together for a greater good.

Austrianape,2016-06-05 13:14:41+00:00,"The Last Unicorn movie is being mismanaged by a predator, and the creator is suing him for elder abuse.","Got this message shared on a fan email list.
__________

Fans, geeks and lovers of fantasy and animation - you need to hear this. Please spread the word about a predator in your community.  

Seattle's Central Cinema is screening ""The Last Unicorn"" in June.  The classic book and 1982 movie were written by Peter S. Beagle.  

Here's how it's advertised:  ""THE LAST UNICORN w/ Connor Cochran.  This special screening brings producer Connor Conlon to Central Cinema, including a Q&amp;A with the one person who may know more about this film than any other breathing soul on this planet.”  

Weird how it doesn't mention Peter, the creator, right? 

Connor Cochran had nothing to do with making a 1982 movie that he gained control of in 2011.  And while Cochran was Peter's ""manager"", Peter was forced to live in poverty, defrauded, and suffered physical elder abuse.

It's all in Peter's $52 million lawsuit against Cochran, which is being hidden from unsuspecting fans. There's 190,000 fans on a Last Unicorn Facebook page on lockdown, with all mentions deleted. They need to know.

Here's the kicker.  The money from Peter's fans won't just fund Cochran's defense to block justice.  He's also doing nuisance legal retaliation to double down on Peter's abuse.  Cochran, a seasoned con artist and professional litigant, writes it with help from an ex-lawyer who lost his license for defrauding a literary estate.

PAYING FOR THE MOVIE PAYS FOR ABUSE. And believe it or not, it gets worse.

Cochran is working with Peter's kids in a bid to put conservatorship of Peter in their hands, under a pretext that he's senile.  It's all about money.  Peter's lawsuit gives records that Cochran tried to get doctors to fake evidence, and he is not senile, nor ""alcoholic"" (a unique accusation from Cochran alone), and in excellent health for age 77.  He's sharp as a tack.

Peter continues to be an active creator.  On May 28, he appeared as guest of honor at Balticon in Baltimore MD. He has a new novel coming out. He's not helpless - he's just a poor writer, while Cochran has the wealth of a movie and it's fans to exploit.

The screening should be picketed. At the VERY LEAST, fans should know about the predator among them.  There's still time. Screenings start June 10.

Cochran is withholding Peter's share of sales of his works.  People who paid should contact Peter's lawyer to help get an injunction.
http://fansagainstfraud.com/peter-beagle-contact-lawyer

Peter's not alone. There's been numerous lawsuits against Cochran. The Last Unicorn Tour investors sued him when hundreds of thousands of dollars disappeared. There's 12 years of undelivered ""pre-sales"" to cheated fans - and Cochran is STILL doing it.  This doesn't just hurt Peter.  ""Pre-sales"" keep making new scam victims.  There will be new victims at the upcoming screenings if they aren't told.

[Inspired by this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3cbauy/hey_rnba_almost_everybody_hates_you/), I started browsing some team subreddits over the past year. I have noticed that a lot of them, unsurprisingly, feel the same hate towards /r/NFL. Most team subreddits have least one post about why they hate /r/NFL, or why this sub hates on their team. A lot of team subreddits feel this sub singles out their team in some way. So I thought I would research to see how extensive the /r/NFL hate goes among team subs. Here are the results:

The corporate special interests have their voice in Washington, DC. What Washington State needs is a bold progressive voice who will fight for you.

I have spent the last 25 years fighting to expand the middle class and lift up working people all over Seattle and across our state, and that’s exactly what I’ll do in Congress.  

I will fight for a higher minimum wage because working families deserve a pay raise; paid sick and safe days so workers don’t have to worry about losing a job when they are sick or dealing with domestic violence; and equal pay for equal work, because women deserve every penny they’ve earned.  

I will fight to expand Social Security and Medicare instead of letting the special interests cut them and break the promise made to seniors who paid in with every paycheck. 

I will fight for cleaner air and water, and for a clean energy economy that creates jobs and preserves our environment for generations to come. 

I will fight to pass comprehensive immigration reform, and ensure we continue to accept refugees in numbers that reflect America’s global status in the world and history of compassion, and that we provide them with the support and services needed once here.

And the first bill I will propose is debt-free college so every young person willing to do the work can get the education or training they need to succeed.

I am an immigrant. And like so many immigrants before me, I am an American.  I came to the United States as an immigrant from India when I was 16 years old. My parents took all the money they had and used it to send me to this country - because they believed this was where I would get the best education and have the brightest future. 

They were right. I’ve worked on Wall Street and know exactly what needs to be done to protect consumers and punish those who crashed our economy. I’ve been a community organizer, and know the challenges families face just trying to get through the week. I’ve been a state senator, and know how to get things done while standing my ground. 

I’ve lived the American Dream, and I’ve devoted my life to fighting for others to have the opportunities they need to achieve their own American Dream.

In response to several of the questions this morning on immigration, here's some of the work I've done on this issue: 

A History of Standing Up for Immigrants

In response to the backlash against immigrant communities after 9/11, Pramila created OneAmerica (formerly called Hate Free Zone) to fight back against the civil liberties abuses of the Bush Administration against Arabs, Muslims and South Asians, and protecting thousands across the country from deportation and detention.  As Executive Director for 11 years, she helped organize tens of thousands of diverse immigrants in the fight for immigration reform, including bringing a gender lens to immigration and working to keep families together.  She also led efforts for immigrant integration in Washington state, registering 23,000 New Americans to vote, serving as Vice Chair of the Governor’s New Americans Policy Council, and helping to establish the Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs in Seattle.

Under Pramila’s leadership, OneAmerica grew into the largest immigrant advocacy organization in the state, and played a key role in passing the 2014 DREAM Act, protecting drivers licenses for all residents regardless of citizenship, and passing a New Americans Executive Order that helped facilitate immigrant integration through citizenship, English Language learning and cross-cultural understanding.",SandersForPresident,1741

Over 20,000 words of analysis and career predictions for every team's draft class","**2016 NFL DRAFT REVIEW** Read it in full [here](http://www.draft32.com/#!2016-nfl-draft-review/suclj)

*For past reviews, check my post history or Draft32.com.  I've actually been doing these since 2009, but the NFLDraftCountdown forum recently deleted all old posts.*

First, let's get this stuff out of the way:  

1 – “This is too long and unorganized!” You’re 100% right. This will be shorter than past years.  
2 – “Stop trying to be funny, you are not Bill Simmons.”  How do you know?  
3 – “Seriously though, those newspaper headlines are cringe-worthy.”  Eh, some of them are.  Most of them are.  They all are?  I don’t care.  Labeling them by team name is as boring as the movie Boyhood.  
4 – “You are biased because you criticized my team!”  No, I’m not.  I root for Seattle and criticize them all the time.  I don’t hate your team.  I do usually get tired when I get to Washington though.  
5 – “You suck at this.”  Maybe.  Maybe not.  Maybe go watch The Departed.  No one else actually does predict the careers of 200+ draft prospects so that makes me the best at it.  

Believe it or not, I watch at least two games of every prospect I comment on, save for a few late-round/small-school guys who might only have a highlight tape on YouTube.  I invite you to disagree with my opinions, but I do put in the work.  The career prediction part is for fun, so I go out of my way to predict different things than the talking heads.  There’s a level of embellishment to the career projections, but all of it is grounded in hours of film study.  

OK, before we go over some of the laughers of the past two years, I have to link [these preseason predictions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/3jmgf7/2015_you_heard_me_fantasy_football_bold/cuqie5b)

So yes, I’m the same guy who wrote “Derrick Henry isn’t a world-beater” and “Cam’s Super Bowl run won’t come this year” in last year’s review.  In fairness, I DID in earlier reviews predict that a Cam Super Bowl run WOULD come eventually and it did.  I don’t have an excuse for the Henry thing.  Dude beat the world.  

The Blake Bortles flip-flopping is probably most embarrassing.  A huge endorsement prior to his rookie year, and inexplicably jumping ship after an expectedly shoddy rookie year.  Am I back on the Gus Bus?  If they’ll have me, sure.  

What’s interesting about last year’s review is that there were many prospects that I clearly had doubts about but didn’t explicitly pick to bust.  I really wanted to pick Melvin Gordon to bust, and that doubt was obvious in my write-up of the Chargers draft, but I chickened out with some mindless reasoning.  So I’m takin da pledg to not do that anymore.

Over the years I’ve had some big hits with Gronk, Antonio Brown, Jamie Collins, pretty much the whole 2011 QB class minus Dalton, etc.  And of course my share of embarrassing misses (mostly LBs because apparently I suck at scouting LBs).  I was, however, the only person in the world who was correct in saying the Seahawks were dumb to take Aaron Curry at No. 4.  Although I can’t be given much credit for that considering I wanted Sanchez or Crabtree instead.

I was more bullish on Allen Robinson and David Johnson than most, one of the few who predicted Greg Robinson’s struggles, nailed the projections of Teddy Bridgewater and Geno Smith, and talked up the 2014 WR class as possibly the best ever – which it very well may prove to be.  Yes, Telvin Smith, Devonta Freeman, and Ronald Darby are making me look stupid, but subconscious FSU hate aside, it hasn’t been all bad over the past few years.  Let’s keep it rolling. 

This draft was one of the most entertaining in history thanks to the Tunsil hit.  What I find fascinating is that you could make a very compelling case that the top four players in this draft went 13th, 34th, 36th, and 5th.  That’s nuts.  My top five for the record: Jack, Tunsil, Goff, Hargreaves, Buckner.

In preparation for this, I conducted a mini-study to determine the true value of draft picks at various points in the draft.  You can read it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/4grt3c/did_the_rams_and_eagles_give_up_too_much_to_move/) to see what draft picks really do usually turn into at each round.  I rated every drafted player from 2005-2012 on a scale of 1 to 5, and then compiled the data to find a percentage of each level of player at each round in the draft:  

5 – All-Pro: Starter who has performed at an elite level at his position.  
4 – Above Average: Starter who has been among the best at his position.  
3 – Solid: Starter or valuable back-up with significant positive production.  
2 – Replacement Level: Below average starter or back-up who made minor contributions.  
1 – Bust: Player who didn’t amount to anything positive.  

Here’s what the results showed for the top five, for example:  

**Picks 1-5**  
All-Pro: 25%  
Above Average: 17.5%  
Solid: 17.5%  
Replacement level: 22.5%  
Bust: 17.5%  

With this new data, I now have something to base my predictions on.  Obviously all draft classes are not created equal (I think 2011 had four 5’s and a 4 in the top five), but I like to view this as a reminder that picking all 5’s for the first five picks is almost impossibly unrealistic.  In the fifth round, picking any more than a couple of 3’s and above is overly optimistic as well (13% rate of 3-5s in the fifth round over the span of this study).  

So accompanied by my description of each player and prediction of his career is a number in parentheses.  To make this more objective and less wordy, each player I comment on is given a career prediction from 1-5.  Mel Kiper giving a team a “B” really doesn’t mean anything at all.  What is he actually predicting from the drafted players?  I’m going to attempt to tell you that you drafted one All-Pro, three solid contributors, and four complete nothings.  I’m going to be dead wrong on many of these picks, but it’s more interesting to me than a meaningless, easy-to-forget letter grade.

Here’s an example using a past blurb to make me look good: “I can’t believe I’m about to endorse a prospect who had 1.5 sacks as a starter last year, but Danielle Hunter (4) is one of the prettiest girls at the dance.  This freak has all the traits of a stud pass rusher; he just didn’t get many sacks.  But when you study his tape you see another ‘thisclose’ type player, which was Mingo two years ago.  13 TFL isn’t bad, it’s not like he’s been a massive underachiever other than sack stats, and apparently he’s fine character-wise.  I liked him on tape.  He’s strong enough, just raw.  And I think he has a really high floor.  Everson Griffen put it all together once he got to the pros and I think he can help Hunter do the same.  He’ll be a rotational pass rusher early and eventually a productive starter with some 10+ sack years.”

OK, before we get to the team reviews, my annual pre-cursor:

- Predicting the career of an NFL draft prospect is a RIDICULOUS exercise.  But it’s better than draft grades and it’s fun to look back on.  90% of busts happen for two reasons that are almost impossible to forecast.  1) How hard a guy works after he’s been paid.  2) Injuries.
 
- Related, this has become harder to do.  I used to have such strong conviction, but the more experience I get, the more I learn there’s so much I don’t know.  I don’t want to be wrong, but hedging or not making a commitment is a cop-out and boring.  Like Kyler Fackrell.  He’s this year’s Devin Funchess.  My brain just can’t process him.  I have no Facking idea what to do with him.  And evaluating ALL of these mid-round cornerbacks will make any man go crazy.  They are hard to separate from each other and there’s just so much projection with such different external parameters in every guy’s film.
 
- I’m going to be wrong.  If you think there is any way to not have some hilariously bad predictions , try it for one year.  It’s not possible.  If I can nail 5 or 6 things, and say 10 other accurate-ish things, that’s enough to keep doing this every year.  I got Antonio Brown right.  I got Anthony Barr wrong.  Ab exercises.  
 
- I’m way more negative than other draft reviews and draft grade articles.  Pretty much every article you read after the draft is unrealistically optimistic.  Many of those writers have friends in the league or aren’t allowed to write overly negative things and are probably discouraged to write anything really negative at all.  They don’t want to bash guys in the league or predict negative (realistic) outcomes.  Their bosses don’t want them to upset fans.  They want fans to read and be happy.  I highly doubt anyone in the NFL reads this and I don’t know any personnel people anyway, so I don’t care about bashing GMs.  I also don’t really care if negative predictions upset fans.  I think the only fans who would sit and read any of this are those who have enough patience and objective thinking skills to handle negative predictions, even if they disagree with them.  There will be busts.  I will attempt to predict those busts and I won’t be shy about it.  Go look at any past draft class.  It will be littered with busts and guys who never amounted to anything.  Every team’s draft looks good in May.  But most won’t look too good in a couple of years.  That’s just the reality.

Thats all I have for you now.

raegnbob,2016-04-26 10:29:01+00:00,Brought my dad with me to pick up my new car,"[Album](https://imgur.com/a/oQcRQ)



Well there really isn't much I can say about this car that hasn't been covered in reviews.  What I can say is that after driving the car for 2 weeks, I haven't been disappointed by anything.  I just can't see my mere mortal self ever outgrowing this car.



A few years ago my dad was in the market for a new car and I had told him about euro delivery - He fell in love with the idea instantly.  (Un)Fortunately he found a local-ish new Z4 that was 15k off of MSRP as it had been sitting n the lot for some time, so he couldn't pass it up.  Then, last February I just about pulled the trigger on a Cayman GTS but decided to sleep on it.  I knew the GT4 was coming out but I didn't think I'd be able to afford it so I was pretty set on the GTS.  The next day the GT4 was announced for surprisingly not too much more than a GTS.  I drove to the dealer and put down a deposit immediately.  I waited and waited and waited, then 8 months after my deposit date the dealer contacted me to let me know I would not be receiving an allocation and that they wanted to refund the deposit.  After 30 minutes on the phone with my sales adviser, I convinced them to keep my money, and thus keep me on the list.  Just 3 weeks later I received an allocation.  



As for the trip, the itinerary was more or less:



*Pickup in Leipzig

*Stuttgart

*Black Forest

*Col du Grand Balon (thunderstorm cancelled this)

*Route Napoleon

*Rally Monte Carlo (Col de Turini and Col du Braus)

*Cote D'azur

*Nurburgring

*Return to Frankfurt then Seattle


My dad had a blast, and even though traveling with your parents can be very trying (I think), I'm glad to have taken him.  I just dropped the car off to the shipper this morning and will now have to wait about 8 more weeks until I get to see my very broken-in new(ish) car.

I research malaria and the interactions between host and pathogens. I’m excited to talk to you about it. AMA!","Hello Reddit! 


My name is Alexis Kaushansky and I serve as a principal investigator at the Center for Infectious Disease Research. My research studies the interactions between humans and pathogens, with a particular focus on malaria. The malaria parasite and other infectious diseases that burden the world cannot survive independently. To cause sickness and travel through the population, they must appropriate resources from the people they infect. Our work aims to identify what pathogens need from their host and use this knowledge to prevent and ultimately eliminate malaria.


When malaria parasites are transmitted from mosquito to human, they are first deposited into the skin, then quickly travel to the liver. In the liver, each parasite replicates tens of thousands of times within the confines of a single hepatocyte, a cell in the liver. During this stage of infection, the parasite causes no clinical symptoms, yet elimination of the parasite in the liver prevents disease and transmission and can even elicit sterile immunity from subsequent infection. Our work focuses on the basic question of how the malaria parasite is able to modify its human liver environment in order to counteract host defenses and ensure for its own survival.


At CIDResearch, we breed thousands of research grade mosquitoes each week in order to power our bench research projects. Our work critically depends on malaria parasite infection in mosquitoes and production of sporozoites for lab experiments. We maintain state-of-the-art insectaries that breed and house Anopheles mosquitoes.


Here are a few of our recent publications:

This is long, yes, but with supporting documents...proof will be noted some of the links.

There’s a small group of activists and computer geeks who have been following election problems since 2003.  I’m one of them.  We’ve had our successes but honestly, things are getting worse.  The latest trend scares me: people in “closed primary” states (where you have to be a Dem to vote in the Dem primary for example) are finding themselves switched from Dem to something else without their permission and often with very crude at best signature forgeries on the false voter registration documents.  This is new – it tells us that election manipulation has been going on too long, not enough people care and now we’re seeing “in your face” examples.  I’m going to go into the history of the issue and what we need to do to change things.

**If it takes me a week or a month or whatever I’m going to answer every question in this thread!**

Urgent: one of the people I’ve worked with over the years is John Brakey based in Tucson AZ.  The AUDIT-AZ election oversight group he founded is now in the thick of it as Arizona now has two election challenge lawsuits going, one filed by John and one by the DNC (Democratic National Committee).  John’s suit seeks to overturn the Arizona election and have a do-over while the DNC wants the court, as a cheaper remedy, to throw out all the Arizona delegates to the convention.  John and AUDIT-AZ need funding immediately – more about their lawsuit and donation info (via PayPal) is at: http://electionnightmares.com/ - I'm pictured in there, look for the big guy with the fanny pack with the peace sign on it.

Now let me fill you in on some history of this problem...some of it stuff I was directly connected to.

I’ve been involved since mid-2003.  I was brought into this movement as a former IT guy (already turned activist by then) by the work of Bev Harris and I still sometimes refer to myself as one of her earliest lieutenants.  Bev was the first one to turn up serious proof of misconduct in vote counting software and systems when in January of 2013 she found an open-access FTP site (online repository of stuff) maintained by Diebold Election Systems and copied all 40,000-ish files off it over three days.  This, in my opinion, really jumpstarted the debate over bad voting systems.  By 2005 I spent a year in the Seattle WA area working with Bev on election investigations and reporting.  Bev and I still talk and collaborate frequently.

**Important:** the single biggest fallout from Bev’s first reporting, still very relevant today, is that at each county running Diebold voting gear there’s ONE computer where all the precinct and mail-in votes are added up – the “central tabulator”.  Bev showed (with basically stolen copies of the Diebold “GEMS” central tabulator software that as long as you deal with the election database with “GEMS” everything appears secure, but once you open the data in an off-the-shelf copy of Microsoft “Access” (a crappy database app included with MS-Office) all the security basically vanishes: you can edit every aspect of the election with no password required, no audit trail entry left and you can even edit the audit trail.  When I’ve been involved in forensic exams of voting systems after an election I very, very often find evidence that MS-Access is loaded on there.  In a few cases we’ve found proof it was used.  Voting system software has to be approved and “certified” ahead of time and MS-Access has never been approved, at all, by any state or at the federal level.  When you see that bad boy on allegedly certified voting systems it’s basically a burglary tool for elections.

At one point Diebold denied this, saying that “no human being” can alter the data in this manner...so Bev knew somebody with an honest-to-God chimpanzee and we taught HIM to do it:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4-wQhtRiP8 – behind the scenes note, this was possible because the dang thing was addicted to Menthos[tm].

My reddit username originally matched my real name: James “Jim” March.  In 2013 I married another political activist hellraiser, Jill Simpson and took her last name.  Jill is somewhat well known as the formerly Republican whistleblower who put a hurt on Karl Rove: http://www.donsiegelman.net/Pages/topics/Players/Heros/heros_simpson.html

Jill and I met doing election monitoring in 2012 for the Obama campaign.  This report on the risks of manipulation of overseas and military voter’s intent got a fair bit of coverage and remains of concern, although we don’t think it’s a top avenue of election management misconduct this year:  http://electionprotectionaction.org/uploads/MOVE%20Act%20nov%205th%20article.pdf – note that pics of myself and Jill are in there, part of my proof...

In the summer of 2005 I was arrested in San Diego California for trying to observe the counting of the vote as per California law: http://www.lookingglassnews.org/viewstory.php?storyid=1685

I was released a week later with felony election tampering charges dropped: http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=104x4266418 – if you scroll through the comments you’ll see that I was controversial among some Dems as I was previously best known as a gun rights activist and lobbyist...in 2002 I was thrown out of the California NRA because I was exposing how sheriffs were selling gun carry permits for campaign contributions and the NRA told me to stop complaining about Republican sheriffs doing that.  I refused.  Yes, I’m still a “gun nut” of sorts.  As you can see, some of the folks on Democratic Underground had...issues with all that :).  They had issues with Bev Harris for another reason I’ll get to in a sec.

Back to election stuff :).

In 2006 I moved to Tucson AZ and immediately started working with John Brakey who had been tracking election problems since 2002 when he was threatened with assault by pollworkers in Pima County when he realized they were shaving votes.  John and I did a LOT of work exposing Pima County’s election problems (2nd biggest county in AZ, where Tucson is) and in Maricopa County (the biggest by far, centered on Phoenix).  To give one good example of how shady Pima’s election process is, check out this videotaped deposition of the head election tech for Pima County during most of the last decade and decide for yourself if he’s hiding anything: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfPGU4LjN94 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzyxQszono0 – trust me, he doesn’t usually twitch like that :).

In 2010 John and I did some digging into election misconduct in Maricopa County: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2TKmkSNAkCfOTMzN2YzZTgtNzIyYi00MTcyLTg4YWQtMzY1NzhkMGFjZTQ1/view?ddrp=1&amp;hl=en&amp;pli=1 which became the basis for a lawsuit trying to reform at least some parts of the process.  This report in turn was mentioned in an appellate court decision awarding fees to, among others, John and I by name: http://caselaw.findlaw.com/az-court-of-appeals/1596645.html 

This was one of the few times this insanity paid anything - $8k each if I recall right?  (I’ll have John chime in on this thread if possible...he’s usually not a redditor.)

The main reason I’m posting is that while I’m no longer in Arizona (I moved to Jill’s place in Alabama in early 2013), John is still fighting and in the recent Arizona primary election a whole lot went wrong that John is now suing over.  One of Arizona’s problems was a pattern also seen in other closed-primary states where people’s voter registration database entries were altered to deny them the right to vote in the Democratic Party primary.  You can see examples from other states here:  http://heavy.com/news/2016/04/election-fraud-voter-registration-changed-suppression-party-affiliation-sanders-clinton-ca-ny-az-md-pa-what-to-do/ 

Specifically in Arizona, Anonymous is claiming the statewide voter registration database is hackable - vulnerable to SQL Injection along these lines: https://xkcd.com/327/ - and that Anon was able to actually test-hack the data: https://anonymousinvestigationsblog.wordpress.com/2016/03/26/anonymous-report-was-arizonas-voter-registration-database-hacked/

We also know that the number of sites where a voter could in fact vote were radically reduced from previous elections in Maricopa County, from almost 400 four years ago to about 60 now.  John has evidence of misconduct at some of those voting locations (for technical reasons, not really “precincts”).  We also find it very suspicious that on election day Bernie won the polling place vote by 60% to 40% Hillary but in the mail-in voting the pattern was exactly opposite – 40% Bernie, 60% Hillary.  We know there’s enough security holes for Maricopa County election staff to have manipulated it and they have a long infamous history of deliberately subverting security enough to pull it off.

The Democratic National Committee has announced that they too are filing suit in Arizona.  They’ll be in federal court.  John’s lawsuit is in state court and because he’s challenging the actual outcome of the election (requesting the whole thing be done over!) he is “fast tracked” with his first hearing on the 19th of this month(!).  He needs financial support immediately for that case.

John’s lawsuit has a lot more details at: http://electionnightmares.com/ - he is for real and I’d like you to consider hitting the “Donate Now” button.  He has a real attorney who we’ve worked with before in Maricopa County.  Any help appreciated and win or lose, any and all information he gathers in his suit will be shared ASAP with the public and with the lawyers for the DNC as they follow behind in federal court on a slower timescale (because they’re challenging future procedures, not necessarily the actual outcome.  John’s affidavit gives a decent starting point as to his case: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6Fh3F6hufhDN296Vm1PNE1UY3M/view?usp=sharing 

One other thing...I mentioned controversies regarding Bev.  This relates to a problem I’ve seen ever since the debate over voting machines and processes started.  In 2004 (a presidential election year) Bev got flooded with donations from people on the left who hoped she’d be able to “save the election”.  Yeah...didn’t work exactly although blaming Bev was dumb.  Reason being, if you want to save, well, let’s say the 2020 election from fraud, you need to start NO LATER THAN early 2017.  It takes time to figure out where the weaknesses are, predict how the next round of hacks will go down and sue over them.  Those of us in the election integrity community never EVER get funding in advance.  John’s lawsuit in Arizona is very important but what’s really needed is strategic investigation and litigation intended to go to the US Supreme Court.  I can tell you for a fact that when the US gun rights lobby went to the Supreme Court twice in 2008 and 2010, the planning for those cases began in 2000 with funding and resources from major organizations and budgets starting at half a mil.  The US election integrity movement has never, ever been as well funded and the money that does come in happens in “pulses” every four years.

You can’t protect an entire national election in 2016 when you start in **2016**.  Ain’t gonna happen.

We need to switch to crowdfunded support and we need to get this idea of well-planned long-term action established.  That said, among the “quick and necessary” suits this year that DO have results that can be built on, John Brakey’s case via the group AUDIT-AZ has the best chance of quick action that will in turn support suits across the rest of the election cycle.  If you can support his work please consider it

Thanks and AMA!

Part 1: The Wrestling Landscape Before Vince.

In 1982, Pro Wrestling was dominated by a group of promotions with informal regional boundaries that for the most part were respected by each promoter. 

NATIONAL WRESTLING ALLIANCE

The National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) was a grouping of regional promotions. In theory membership in the NWA gave every promoter a vote on who would be the NWA world champion,  along with regular visits from this world champion to their territory. As well membership was supposed to prevent one member from encroaching on another members' territory without agreement. In the event of a ""pirate"" promotion encroaching on a given territory, all members were required to bolster the attacked territory with talent and cross promotion. Wrestlers were discouraged from working in non NWA promotions with the implied threat of being blackballed from the NWA at large. In reality the larger territories controlled the voting and bookings for the world champion, border skirmishes were frequent between members and name wrestlers were too valuable a commodity to blackball. The major NWA member promotions in 1982 were:

Mid Atlantic (Jim Crocket) - the Carolinas and Virginia
Georgia Championship Wrestling (Ole Anderson, Jim Barnet, Jerry and Jack Briscoe)
Championship Wrestling from Florida (The Grahams)
World Class Championship Wrestling (Fritz Von Erich) - Dallas
Southwest Championship Wrestling (Joe Blanchard) - San Antonio
Southeastern Championship Wrestling (Ron Fuller) - Alabama &amp; Knoxville, Tn
Pacific Northwest Wrestling (Don Owen) - Seattle and Portland
Maple Leaf Wrestling (The Tunneys) - Toronto
St Louis Wrestling Club (Bob Geigel, Pat O'Connor and Harley Race)
Central States Wrestling (Bob Geigel) - Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Iowa
Continental Wrestling Association (Jerry Jarret, Jerry Lawler) - Tennessee
Stampede Wrestling (Stu  Hart) - Alberta

Several minor NWA affiliated promotions such as All Star Wrestling (Vancouver), Superstars of Wrestling (Detroit), National Wrestling Federation (Buffalo), etc... existed as well but never hosted the NWA champion. Their affiliation was only to trade on the credibility the  NWA name implied and prevent the larger promotions from encroaching on their turf. 

MID SOUTH WRESTLING

Owned by Bill Watts, the mid south territory covered a large swath of land from New Orleans to Houston to Oklahoma City. While the NWA champion did defend his title in Mid South on a regular basis and top names in wrestling worked for Bill Watts, Mid South was an independent promotion. Upon purchasing the promotion in 1979, Bill Watts promptly pulled out of the NWA surmising that being a member was a waste of money since he controlled access to the prized New Orleans Superdome and that no other promotors would have the guts to prevent him from booking top names including the world champion. He was proven right. In 1982 he formed an alliance with Houston Wrestling promotor Paul Bosch that gave him access to the fabled Sam Houston Coliseum, a long time NWA stronghold. Mid South wrestlers would now share the ring with wrestlers from other NWA territories in Houston proving once again to Watts that he had made the right decision by dropping out of the NWA. He was getting all the benefits of being a member without the cost or politics.

AMERICAN WRESTLING ASSOCIATION

Owned by Wally Karbo and Vergne Gagne, the AWA broke away from the NWA in 1960 because the NWA board refused to give Gagne the world championship. Verne was the first to challenge the NWA control of pro wrestling and like many times after, their implied threats to blackball and not cooperate proved toothless. One of the first TV stars of Wrestling, Verne had enough power in the business to break away and suffer little consequences.  He happily made himself AWA world champion and successfully promoted the 2nd largest territory in wrestling. By 1982 he controlled a large area that included Minnesota, Illinois, Manitoba, Nebraska, Colorado, Utah and had just expanded into San Francisco, Las Vegas and Phoenix where NWA aligned promotions had failed. Respecting the unwritten rules of no encroachment on existing promotions, Vergne expanded only where there were no active promotions. The AWA also had cross promotional agreements with the CWA in Memphis, and Paul Bosch's Houston Wrestling that would produce the occasional NWA/AWA joint card. As well, the WWA in Indianapolis, International Wrestling in Montreal and Grand Prix Wrestling in atlantic Canada were affiliates of the AWA who recognized the AWA champion as their world champion. 

WORLD WRESTLING FEDERATION

The 3rd largest territorial promotion, the WWF, formerly the World Wide Wrestling Federation followed Vergne Gagne's lead and broke away from the NWA in 1963 when owner Vince McMahon Sr refused to accept the title being removed from Buddy Rogers and given back to Lou Thesz. Rogers was a big draw in the cash rich northeast that McMahon controlled and Thesz was not. With control of Madison Square Garden, Boston Gardens and the Baltimore Arena for major shows, McMahon had the clout the break free and never fear any reprisal. A little known fact is that the WWF quietly rejoined the NWA in 1971 in order to have access to the occasional appearance by the NWA champion in ""unification"" matches that would end up as 60 or 90 minute draws. By 1982 the WWF was in control of the east coast from Maryland to Maine along with New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania and were still quiet members of the NWA. Vince Sr. was ailing and his son Vince Jr. was attempting to cobble enough cash to buy out his father and their partners in the WWF parent Capitol Wrestling Corporation.

LarBrd33,2016-04-13 01:57:58+00:00,"I took over a bottom team 7 years into a dynasty keeper league. Using ""Hinkie Methods"" I dominated so thoroughly they kicked me out.","**WARNING:  THIS IS LONG** ... Fantasy basketball war stories are probably excruciatingly boring, but this one is somewhat unique so I thought a few people might be entertained by it.

**League Format Context:**  I'm a regular at a popular Celtics-based Forum.  Way back in 2007, some members there started a Points-based 20 team dynasty keeper league.  16 roster spots (PG, PG, SG, SG, SF, SF, PF, PF, C, C, Util, BN, BN, BN, BN, BN).  You can see the equation used to determine points here:  http://i.imgur.com/e21m7GO.jpg ..   Each team's entire roster carries over into the offseason.  Every year, each team is given a 1st round pick (coinciding with picks 1-20 in the NBA draft) and a 2nd round pick (coinciding with picks 21-40 in the NBA draft).  Much like the real NBA, these picks can be traded throughout the season.   The scoring system is a little strange in that there are no weekly head-to-head matchups.  It's a pure points league.  With 82 games at each position (and 11 active positions) it leaves you a total of 902 max games played for the entire season.  Simply whoever scores the most points at the end of the year wins.  For example, here are last year's final standings:  http://i.imgur.com/mbGqkCq.jpg  ... And for full context, here is a list of the top 50 players last year sorted by average fantasy value:   http://i.imgur.com/HtuSL2C.jpg ... 

**League Background:**  While this was a non-money league, the members of the league had invested 7 years into it and took it very seriously.  Much like the real NBA, they occasionally had GM's leave and would replace them with new members from the same Celtic forum.  The league also had a pretty [elaborate constitution](http://nedyken.com/cbpl/league-constitution/) with rules addressing things like inactivity penalties.   Because it had been going for 7 years, there was a pretty massive chasm between the ""haves"" and ""have nots"".  Those who drafted well in the league's inception and made smart trades were dominating the bottom half of the league.  The teams at the bottom had little hope of ever competing with a loaded champion.
 
**Joining The League** - A member of the league recruited me in January 2014.  I was originally hesitant to join, because the pure points-based system seemed a bit lame.  I was, however, drawn to the idea that it was a league with a built-in history.  The team I would be taking had finished in the lottery in every year of the league and was currently in dead last: http://i.imgur.com/GpcQ3wp.jpg ... Also, because the lineups hadn't been set properly, it was facing an inactivity penalty (explained in the constitution) that made the draft pick projected 7th.   The team was a disaster.  There was also a widespread belief from members of the league that the two top teams (""Utah Flash"" and ""Pittsburgh Pisces"") were now unstoppable.  They had finished in the top 2 for 5 years straight.  They had built such a gap over the bottom teams that some considered it impossible to ever catch them.  This intrigued me.  It sounded like a fun challenge.   I decided to take the job.

**First Season Strategy:**  I joined with much fanfare.  Publicly exclaiming that I hated my roster, would soon burn bridges by overwhelming my rivals with trade offers, and quoting the immortal Mikhail Prokhorov [ransom video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au3hkZZpVM4):  ""If all goes according to plan, I expect us to be in playoffs next season, and championship in 1 year minimum, maximum of 5 years.""  My team wasn't all bad.  I had a couple assets like Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson and rookie CJ McCollum (who was tossed around the league like the town skank for years until finally landing on his feet this season), but for the most part it was a disaster.  There were guys on that team, like Marcus Camby, who hadn't suited up in over a year.  The first day I rebranded the team the ""[Bellevue Leprechauns](http://i.imgur.com/CwKEchz.jpg)"", cut 6 players, and traded away 4 more.  Keep in mind that this was early January 2014.  The upcoming draft was expected to be epic.  I had seen what guys like Sam Hinkie (and Boston's own Danny Ainge) were in the process of doing.  My strategy was simple... I would try to acquire as many draft picks and young prospects as possible.  I would churn out picks for better prospects and those prospects for better picks.  I would try to acquire established talent and trade that established talent for multiple underrated prospects.  I would sign rising waiver players and sell them for 2nd rounders as soon as possible.  I would trade multiple later picks for better picks.  I would take advantage of the league's built-in homeristic Celtic-bias by acquiring Boston players and selling them to teams immediately after hot games.   In the process, I'd make sure my own pick had a good shot to land #1.  Full-on tank mode.   I went full Hinkie.   I knew from the start that I'd tank for two years straight, hopefully acquire some young ""keepers"", and after the two years trade my extra assets for vets that could help me go on a run.  

**The Results:**  ... And that's exactly what I ended up doing.  Two straight years of tanking.  100+ trades.  I went into the 2014 draft with an unfathomable 8 picks in the top 40, and through a series of trades ended up with picks 2, 3, 4 and 5.  Even when I drafted relatively poorly (Embiid, Exum, Smart and Parker), I knew when to sell high - later flipping Marcus Smart in a package for Chris Paul and flipping Chris Paul for a package built around Andrew Wiggins.   After two years of tanking and acquiring top assets (like Karl Towns and Jahlil Okafor in the 2015 draft), I spent this Summer consolidating my bounty of assets into a world-beating team that could contend for a championship.  I spent much of the Summer writing fake press releases and coming up with the fake slogan [""Believe in Bellevue""](http://i.imgur.com/v0a2WAE.jpg) ... I even made a fake commercial hyping my up-start team:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdwdtCjvj_k  ... Nobody seemed to share my sense of humor/enthusiasm.    

My Summer was headlined by a major acquisition I [hinted at days before it was made official](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sdLFVbn9lI) ... On June 22nd, 2015, I acquired Kevin Durant (for Jahlil Okafor, MKG and Ben McLemore).   I celebrated the news of bringing Durant back to the Pacific Northwest (Bellevue is just East of Seattle) by once again making a fake commercial:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7DX3IyexgM ... They didn't share my enthusiasm.  Sometimes, I wondered if they even [Believed in Bellevue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjZkSLgDrCo).  

Here is my full slate of assets before and after (with their averages in 2016 for context):  http://i.imgur.com/vh9sgHp.jpg ... The improvement was dramatic and unprecedented.  It went from a perpetual bottomfeeder to the runaway favorite to win the championship (the best team in the history of the league had scored a total of 32,019 points with an average player score of 35.5fp).  More surprising, I surpassed my own expectations and had a team filled with exceptionally young players (average age of rotation players was 23) and no need to bring in elderly short-term help (oldest key player being 30 year old Rajon Rondo).  

**Inevitable Backlash:**  Like I predicted when I took over, I knew that I would eventually irritate my rivals with aggressive trade requests and lowball offers.  What I didn't anticipate was the hostile culture the league had formed before I even joined.  It was a hyper-competitive league filled with trash-talkers and instigators.  Members frequently hurled insults at each other, accused each other of cheating, and even occasionally threatened physical violence against one another.  Unfortunately, this league allowed vetoes via vote.  Even worse, thanks to Yahoo's settings, only 7 of the 20 teams needed to vote veto for a trade to be killed.  There were a select few members who would participate in ""veto campaigns"" when they were jealous of a trade they felt was lopsided.  Meanwhile, this forced teams to constantly defend their trades and play Politics trying to avoid having a trade they liked vetoed.   The entire thing seemed pretty anti-competitive to me.  Everyone in the league was an adult who could make their own decisions.  How could any of the bottom tier teams ever succeed if the system allowed jealous teams to kill their favorable deals?   As you can imagine, after 100+ trades in my favor (with many cries of ""trade rape"" from the rabblerousers), I became exceptionally unpopular with my rivals.  It got so bad, in fact, one guy (the fella that recruited me) actually stalked my facebook account, went off the rails insulting me about my personal life, and proceeded to get himself banned from the Celtic forum when he flipped out at the forum mod trying to calm him down.  Some of the members blamed me for this.   Inevitably being the center of so many lopsided deals resulted in me being at the center of a lot of drama.  I had built a lot of enemies in that league - and I was dominating it.   It got to the point where a relatively benign trade (Jabari Parker for Jahlil Okafor) was vetoed in record time simply because I was involved in it - even though it was proposed to me twice before I finally accepted it.  Comical.    

This all came to a conclusion at the tail end of this season.  Having firmly dominated the league (with a core that had an average age of 23 year old and was set to dominate for years to come), I [gloated](http://nedyken.com/cbpl/leprechauns-on-verge-of-greatest-team-ever/) that my team was on the verge of breaking the all-time record.  Granted, bragging might have been tasteless, but I had 2 years of rival team's telling me how terrible my team was, trying to get my trades vetoed, publicly underselling my assets with hopes of making them less valuable, and encouraging teams to ignore my trade offers.  A  little bragging felt warranted now that my team was firmly a world-beater.  Besides, Yahoo Fantasy literally has a ""TRASH TALK"" section. Isn't that a part of the game?  My joking playoff pre-sale ticket announcement (explicit lyrics):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwTFk6pFl-0 

My team did in-fact, go on to score a **record 32,361.60 points with a record average player score of 35.88**... The greatest team in the 9 year history of the league... and still presumably years away from peaking.   

On March 7th, 2016, I suddenly found myself removed from the league with no warning or explanation from the commissioner.  Apparently, half the league (almost entirely teams that I had taken advantage of in prior trades) had threatened to quit unless I was removed.  A league-wide exodus.  They apparently plan to dismantle the Bellevue Leprechauns in the offseason and distribute the players to the bottom-tier teams needing bail-outs (there's literally a team who's best player is Joel Embiid and another team who's best player is literally Evan Fournier... neither owns their 1st rounder this year... they both threatened to quit unless I was removed... whoops... sorry, guys).  League Standings right after breaking the record: http://i.imgur.com/hGzlA2R.png (they changed my team name to ""Vacated"" because seeing ""Bellevue Leprechauns"" 3000+ points ahead of them was apparently a trigger).    

Anyways, it was a fun experiment.  The Hinkie method worked.   I had a nice run.  Best of luck to those guys.   Long live the Bellevue Leprechauns.  Final fake press release:  http://nedyken.com/cbpl/worldchamps/

ElzevirAuxiliatrix,2016-04-10 02:10:58+00:00,"[Discussion] [Drama] It is confirmed that Alison Rapp, former Public Relations Representative for Nintendo of America was moonlighting as an Escort","Before we begin, let me put a few things on the table.

1.) I don't want to see anyone posting any links anywhere at any photos or sites in this thread. I have seen some threads being removed already under rule five, and that is perfectly reasonable. Although I have no doubt that in the coming days the media will paint this as a hate mob, we still have to play this clean, at least for now.

2.) There's nothing wrong with being an escort. If Alison Rapp wants to make $250 an hour plus through sexual services, that's her choice. I'm not going to, and neither should you, make this about the fact that she was an escort.

3.)While this may seem like a cruel or improper piece of information to spread, (and this goes to the moderators here just as much as you the reader) keep in mind the reason why I believe it is important that people know this is because the entire narrative of how events have occurred has essentially become proven false by this information. Alison Rapp was not removed from Nintendo because of a 'hate mob' of misogynists due to her political beliefs or any other issue (lets not touch upon the pedophilia thing here) as the media would like the world to believe, she was removed from her position for breaching her contract.

Alison Rapp, former PR employee for Nintendo of America was fired from her position during late March. While the media put up a strong front in pushing forward the narrative that she was fired for online harassment, the official response from Nintendo of America stated that she was fired for moonlighting under another job. When this story broke I did some investigation to try and find out what this moonlighting job was, and I determined that Alison Rapp was let go from her position for being a boudoir model (bedroom modeling in lingerie, stuff like that). Again I could see very clearly why Nintendo of America would have wanted to let go a PR employee for that reason, but that didn't stop the media at large painting and narrative that she was let go from her position because of public pressure from #GamerGate. 

It turns out that Alison Rapp was not a model. Alison Rapp was offering her services as an escort (a more polite word for prostitute) in the Seattle area for high-class customers. It is most probable that this was the moonlighting job she was released for. I believe it is important for people to know this information, not because Alison Rapp was an escort or because we should go after her in some personal army campaign to try and screw with her life in particular, but because it flies in the face of the continued deceit both Rapp and the media which presented this issue have served to the public. 

One thing that I want to point out which is very concerning, is that Alison Rapp is married. I won't make any judgement now whether her husband did or did not know she offering escort services for money, but either outcome is going to be bad. I do recall some posts during my digging in which Alison Rapp said her husband was helping her set up another income stream, and that she herself said upon the topic of her sexuality that she is in an open relationship. These things in the end, are tangentially related to the issue at hand. The issue at which is at hand is that Alison Rapp and the people in the media who perpetuated a narrative that she was removed from her position because of a misogynist hate mob either did not understand a full set of the facts behind this story, or they chose not to report on facts that they didn't know (which is probably unlikely). 

Another thing I think that needs to be said; now this genie has been uncorked from the bottle, it would be better to start talking about it upfront in an environment where we can have a measured discussion. Because no matter what happens here, I have no doubt that within the next media cycle there will be a lot of words thrown around very similar to 'revenge porn' in them. So it's important for us to focus on the fact that this is not about Alison Rapp being an escort, but the fact that she lied quite openly in order to blame us for something that we had very little control over.

tl;dr alsion rapp was bad for lying, not for doing butt stuff

Update: /u/NPerez99 has pointed out another dimension that a lot of us have missed. The act of Prostitution and the the promotion of Prostitution are in fact, illegal in the state of Washington under Code RWC 9A.88.030 and RWC 9A.88.070. 

Full explanation of the codes are here: http://www.glblaw.com/prostitution

&gt;**9A.88.030 Prostitution**

&gt;(1) A person is guilty of prostitution if such person engages or agrees or offers to engage in sexual conduct with another person in return for a fee.

&gt;(2) For purposes of this section, ""sexual conduct"" means ""sexual intercourse"" or ""sexual contact,"" both as defined in chapter 9A.44 RCW.

&gt;(3) Prostitution is a misdemeanor.

&gt;9A.88.050 Prostitution — Sex of parties immaterial — No defense

&gt;In any prosecution for prostitution, the sex of the two parties or prospective parties to the sexual conduct engaged in, contemplated, or solicited is immaterial, and it is no defense that:

&gt;9A.88.060 Promoting prostitution — Definitions

&gt;The following definitions are applicable in RCW 9A.88.070 through 9A.88.090:

&gt;(1) ""Advances prostitution."" A person ""advances prostitution"" if, acting other than as a prostitute or as a customer thereof, he causes or aids a person to commit or engage in prostitution, procures or solicits customers for prostitution, provides persons or premises for prostitution purposes, operates or assists in the operation of a house of prostitution or a prostitution enterprise, or engages in any other conduct designed to institute, aid, or facilitate an act or enterprise of prostitution.

&gt;(2) ""Profits from prostitution."" A person ""profits from prostitution"" if, acting other than as a prostitute receiving compensation for personally rendered prostitution services, he accepts or receives money or other property pursuant to an agreement or understanding with any person whereby he participates or is to participate in the proceeds of prostitution activity.

&gt;**9A.88.070 Promoting Prostitution in the First Degree**

&gt;(1) A person is guilty of promoting prostitution in the first degree if he or she knowingly advances prostitution by compelling a person by threat or force to engage in prostitution or profits from prostitution which results from such threat or force.

&gt;(2) Promoting prostitution in the first degree is a class B felony.

&gt;9A.88.080 Promoting Prostitution in the Second Degree

CHECK AND INFORM OTHERS (Actions inside),"We have had [disaster in AZ due to major voter suppression](http://usuncut.com/politics/5-examples-voter-suppression-arizona-primary/). Without early prevention that is about to happen in Washington as well. Currently there are two primary concerns that people get intentionally or not, but misinformed about:

_______________________

1) ~~An [INVALID pre-registration form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByyJkonGsMANWkJVZlE4X1dQZ1U/view?pref=2&amp;pli=1) circulating in social media. **[The VALID form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bze73eO4FRNsaFNjd0VMWWlIbVk/view)** has both Van ID and Caucus location that for some reason the other form misses.~~

~~ACTIONS. If you have used invalid form, or seen someone who did it - inform them to use the valid one.~~

~~Note. The invalid form is [hosted by Chad Lupkes](http://prntscr.com/ajfpnx) from Seattle - if someone has contact with him, please get in touch with him, so that this issue is resolved.~~

Got in touch with Chad Lupkes (Sanders' supporter):
&gt;According to the state party's Party Affairs Officer Greg Haffner, my form is more accurate.  The other one is a doctored version of the form downloaded through the pre-check system.

&gt;According to Greg, nobody should be passing out blank forms.  People either [use the pre-check system](https://www.demcaucus.com/register), or they fill out a form on Saturday morning.  But honestly both of these forms should be accepted without too much difficulty.

---------------------------------

2) [There were reports about alleged calls to Bernie's supporters from HRC supporters](http://imgur.com/Ex76yPS) - they told wrong caucus locations. That was brought to light by one of Bernie's supporters who received the call and actually knew the location. *(Update). If no more claims occur - that might simply show unprofessional behaviour, rather than targeted intent in this case.*

**ACTIONS.** https://www.demcaucus.com/register - Go to the official website and follow the instructions to check your location. Important note - if you have recently *(not defined how recently)* changed your location, as the page suggests, cross-check your address in http://pollingplaces.democrats.org/ (or better yet - call the Washington state democrat office at: (206) 583-0664).

-------------------------------

**Share voting location information to your Facebook if you are from Washington** - we want people properly informed and to use their vote without any more shenanigans as there were in AZ.

-----------------

Update. I see quite a few negative comments. Please refrain from negativity, as point 1 refers to potentially unintentional mistake by some activists (by now it should be resolved - and both forms should work fine). Point 2 refers to either unintentional, or intentional misinformation of voters - as there is no credible proof, it should serve only as a reminder to check things ahead of time and not fall in into situations where many people lose their right to vote (due to for ex. too little time to go to the right location).

**We make calls to find other Bernie supporters!** Bernie has inspired so many volunteers that up until very recently, it has been literally impossible to even contact them all, and it is essential to begin to involve them in their local communities to create ACTION.

We call other volunteers to build the movement, even if we just leave a voicemail telling them to visit /u/rcas’ [map](http://map.berniesanders.com/). Connecting volunteers (or as we call them, ""vols"") across the political spectrum is essential for this movement to begin showing itself to the public. By connecting our voices over the phone (and in person), we are able to learn from each other the real strength of this movement, and we are able to show the world and how powerful, united, and interconnected we are.

**NEW TO PHONE BANKING OR WANT A REFRESHER?**

We invite you to attend a live 15-min online training session. The training is not required, but it's a great way to learn how to phone bank for Bernie! 

The trainings are at 11:45am ET, 2:45pm ET, 5:45pm ET or 8:45pm ET every day. Click on one of links below to RSVP for the time that works best for you.

#Facebanking [[wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/wiki/facebanking#butteal)]
___

**Facebanking is the newest way to support Bernie’s campaign via social media.** Many people agree that it played a positive role in Bernie’s recent wins (including his crucial win in Michigan). It is imperative that we secure key wins in the states ahead, and it is equally important that we narrow the gap in states we are unlikely to win. Facebanking is here to help us accomplish these goals. It’s fast, it’s easy, and everyone should do it today!

**[FeelTheBern Events:](http://feelthebern.events/)** This page was created by the mega-event team. It contains instructions on how to facebank using the highly recommended private event method of facebanking. Using this method, you invite targeted Bernie supporters to private Facebook events which have been set up by the mega-event team for each state. GOTV! (BONUS: [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMjsiuHMAMw))

**[Bernie Friend Finder:](http://berniefriendfinder.com/)** This page will help you find lists of a) friends and b) friends of friends who support Bernie Sanders on Facebook. These lists will assist you when facebanking. On Saturday, March 12, 2016, this page will receive a major update with the aim of helping it become a ""one stop shop"" for all of your facebanking needs. Check back regularly!

**[Bernie Friend Inviter](http://bernieinvite.com/):** Large numbers of people have to first ""like"" Bernie Sanders on Facebook in order for facebanking to reach them. You can help that happen by promoting Bernie's Facebook pages (i.e., [campaign page](https://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/), [senate page](https://www.facebook.com/senatorsanders/)) before you begin facebanking. This tool makes it easy to get this done. Visit the link, add the bookmarklet to your bookmarks bar, and follow the on-page instructions. If your friends like Bernie, you'll have access to a broader network of connections and your facebanking efforts will reach more people.

#Text For Bernie

##www.textforbernie.com

Every week, there are hundreds of events occuring across the country in support of Bernie, but local volunteers may not know about them. **Texting for Bernie lets supporters know about important events that are happening in their communities!**

The more active we are within our communities, the more likely that Bernie will get the support he needs to win the election and the Presidency!

All the online tools you can use to help make Bernie the next president of these United States.
Take your pick, volunteer, feel the bern! 

##APPLYING FOR VOLUNTEER SPECIAL TEAMS OPPORTUNITIES | www.bernie.to/volteams

There are a few other advanced leadership roles and opportunities on the campaign through Volunteer Special Teams. These teams involve a larger time commitment, more responsibility, and often require more experience and training, and they everything from event planning to host recruitment, to running trainings and facilitating conference calls, from tech support to data management. You can see the rundown of the teams here, at www.bernie.to/volteams, and you can apply to join those teams!

Everything about these teams is about building the biggest, most powerful volunteer-led voter contact operation in presidential primary campaigning, so voter contact will always be the first priority to make sure we win. That’s why we ask applicants for special teams to have some experience with the fundamental voter contact program first, through calls, door knocking, attending or hosting a local event.

##Join a Slack Team | http://www.bernie2016events.org/teams/slack

Slack has been invaluable in Bernie's grassroots movement. Some states have used Slack to coordinate, plan, and organize a lot of events and projects, both big and small. For efficient communication and organization with your state, we highly encourage using Slack.

I will continue to add states and universities to this list as the primary season goes on. For now:

* **PLEASE COMMENT BELOW IF YOU ARE ABLE TO VOLUNTEER AT ANY LOCATION, LISTED OR UNLISTED.**
* Comment if you can also give rides to people to help volunteer!
* PM if you have any missing information/information I should add. 
* Get out and help! Every vote matters. If you are able to persuade just one person, that in itself is amazing. 

Note: when scheduling, note that many schools have March 25 off.

This is exactly what Bernie need us to do. Not **JUST** make phone calls and click links, but get out into the street, form groups and realize the political revolution by showing up EN-MASS to BERNOUT the Caucus. He's been saying this since day 1! Now it's time to support the candidate we believe in!

~ Sen. Bernie Sanders

**5 Caucuses** in the next 10 days. We can **REALISTICALLY** make Hillary NON-VIABLE in 4/5, sweep a **97 delegate** net gain, and send a message to the MSM that the revolution is just beginning. 

**Sanders will likely take Washington by some margin as well, deepening his net gain before April begins.**

**TO THE NAYSAYERS = Bernie's Caucus record thus far: WON 4 , TIED 1, LOST 1 (NV close-call and early primary).**

**CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH: WE NEED FACE-TO-FACE connections ON THE GROUND!**  Form caucus groups with your Bernie supporting friends - carpool - get them signed up with absentee ballots if they can't make it. 

**If you have a **canvas group in one of the states try morphing it into a caucus group** and encourage the people you reach canvassing to join and go with you (if you're canvasing in your district).

Here's the math:

[**3/22 IDAHO CAUCUS**](http://idahodems.org/caucus/)

* Population: **1,654,930**   =  **23 delegates** 
* 2008: HC = 3,652 (**17.21%**) v Obama = 16,880 (**79.54%**)
* GOAL: 20,000 people to make Hillary non-viable.
* HOW: Boise State (**30,015**), Idaho State U (**16,273**), any IDAHO college we can reach. [Brigham-Young] (http://universe.byu.edu/2016/02/19/feel-the-bern-poll-shows-byu-students-prefer-socialist-sanders/) apparently might have some supporters after all. 
* IDAHO is an OPEN Caucus - if your parents are republicans... unite them against Trump!/HIllary! (Hearing: Idaho is only a semi-open primary (caucus). If a person voted in the Republican primary on 3/8, they are not eligible to caucus on March 22nd.

[**3/22 UTAH CAUCUS**](http://utahdemocrats.org/caucusnight2016/)

* Population **2,995,919**   =   **33 delegates**
* This state primaried in 2008. We have a real chance to sweep because caucuses have a much lower turnout than primaries - so by nature of the process less people need to caucus than would need to vote in a primary.
* 2008 HC = 51,333 (**39.1%**) v Obama = **74,538** (56.7%)
* GOAL: 30,000 (using Kansas as model b/c comparable population)
* HOW:  Brigham Young University Provo (**29,672**) University of Utah (**31,515**), Utah State University (**27,662**), Utah Valley University (**23,214**), Weber State, Southern Utah Univeristy, Snow College, Dixie State University, any UTAH college we can reach
* UNIONS - (will add info when I can find something concrete - please chime in if you've got it.)

Weber State, UVU (Utah Valley University), SUU (Southern Utah University), Snow College, and Dixie college

[**3/26 HAWAII CAUCUS (TULSI GABBARD LAND :))**](http://hawaiidemocrats.org/)

* Population: **1,431,603**  =  **25 delegates**
* 2008: HC = 8,835 (**23.6%**) v Obama 28,347 (**75.7%**) (home state advantage?)
* GOAL: 32,000 - this is totally possible with Tulsi's endorsement. 
* HOW: University of Hawaii at Manoa (**19,507**)
* Reach out to climate change activist groups ( to add here)

[**3/26 WASHINGTON CAUCUS**](http://www.wa-democrats.org/page/2016-democratic-caucuses) FULLY PROPORTIONAL

* UPDATE IN WASHINGTON the caucus is all that matters on the Democratic side. We also have a Democratic presidential primary, but the results of that **DON'T MEAN ANYTHING** it's basically just a straw poll.
* Population **7,170,351** = **101 delegates**
* 2008 HC = 243,338 (**46%**) v Obama = 259,369 (**50%**)
* GOAL: 30,000+ - non-viable isn't an option here but if we can make it **60/40** that's still +21 net gain.
* HOW: U of Washington Seattle (**44,784**), Washington State U (**28,686**), Western Washington U (**15,060**) Seattle University, Seattle Pacific University, University of Puget Sound, Seattle Central College, Pacific Lutheran University, Washington State, Gonzaga, Eastern Washington University, Central Washington University, Evergreen State, Whitworth, Bellevue College, Cascadia Community, Renton Technical
* Bernie has favor in liberal Washington, let's use this as an advantage and MOBILIZE!
* If you cannot attend the caucus, you can submit a completed SURROGATE AFFIDAVIT FORM (ex. you work on Saturday). This has to be RECEIVED by the Washington State Democratic Party by 3/18. (not postmarked). You can scan affidavit and email OR fax.

ArenaColin,2016-03-11 18:58:07+00:00,Thank You!,"I didn’t plan to write something like this but due to an overwhelming response from friends around the industry and folks from this great community it has become clear to me proper closure requires a real goodbye. Today is my last day at ArenaNet, so here goes nothing…

Eleven years ago ArenaNet took a chance on me. The company’s very first ever game: Guild Wars (Prophecies) needed a game designer to build the bulk of the quests with just a few months left till ship. The offer came on a Friday and required I fly to Seattle from Virginia and be there by Monday morning to start working. On a recommendation from my friend Lewis who was a coder at ArenaNet - I quit my job and jumped on that plane. I flew with what clothes I could bring in a few suitcases and a sleeping bag. I rented an apartment I didn’t have time to furnish and with my sleeping bag as a bed, I set to work banging out the quests. One of the first quests I got to work on involved a little girl named Gwen who needed you to recover her lost flute, I would never have guessed the legacy she would have. 

I knew it was a special place when I was immediately made a part of the family. No one ever treated me like an outsider who came in for the final months, I was made to feel like a true part of the team who was helping make something great and it was clear to me I had found a home. Shortly after the launch of Guild Wars, the company banded together to work on the most fun project I’ve ever been a part of in my gaming career: a free update to the game called Sorrow’s Furnace. So much pure joy and love was poured into that little update and most importantly the amazing friends who I got to work with on it will last with me forever. 

As a game designer on Guild Wars ArenaNet continued to support me and let me take chances on wild ideas like a Mad King who told jokes for Halloween (thanks for the jokes James!), an iron forgeman, rollerbeetle racing, a Grenth vs. Dwayna wintersday battle, dwarven boxing, Polymock, mimes galore, bog beasts, glint’s challenge, siege turtles, journey’s with Koss, a dungeon full of snowmen, an Elonan party, a lunar iron chef battle and so many more fun projects I can’t begin to remember them all. They took a chance on me again when they let me become the quest design lead for the Eye of the North (I love you team quest!). In my final project before moving to the Guild Wars 2 team, they took one last roll of the dice and give me a shot at being the lead designer of the bonus mission pack. 

In Guild Wars 2, ArenaNet gave me the incredible opportunity to lead the team that designed and prototyped the dynamic event system – it all started with a prototype sector we called Shaemoor. Shortly after that they took a chance on me again and let me lead the team that designed and built all of the game content that launched with Guild Wars 2. That team and those years together is another of my all time favorite memories. To those of you out there from that team who read this - I am so proud of you and the amazing things you accomplished – I am truly honored to have been able to have been your lead. 

Around launch in the ultimate step of taking a chance on someone, they asked me to step away from my role as a game designer and hand my design team off to a new leadership team to become the PR and media facing voice of the game as the game director for Guild Wars 2. A position where I’ve got to take the credit for everyone else’s hard work ever since ;)

I’ve spent over a decade at my home at ArenaNet; first the building sinking into the swamp, and now the shiny new building on the hill. I couldn’t be more thrilled with the time I’ve spent, or more humbled by the trust put in me. My departure to take on a new challenge elsewhere shouldn’t be a sad day, it’s a day to celebrate new opportunities. I’ve been blessed with the chance to do so much at ArenaNet – and now new people who probably have better heads on their shoulders than I do will get new opportunities. It’s an opportunity for developers to move into new roles they’ve never been in before, for new designers like I was once to get to take chances, and for ArenaNet to support them taking chances the same way it has supported me. 

I have loved my time at ArenaNet. I loved my time working with the amazing teams and developers over the many years that really deserve far more credit than they ever receive for the work they do. I love this amazing Guild Wars community. I’ve met so many of you over the years at conventions, talked with you in game, discussed ideas through forums, and read the letters you’ve sent to our office - your passion is simply unmatched. To the ArenaNet team and to the entire community who without which there would be no game at all, it has been an absolute pleasure building games alongside you.

Thank you to everyone for the amazing memories, all of you and the Guild Wars franchise will hold a place in my heart forever.

McClendon is accused of ""colluded with another oil and natural gas company over a five year period to avoid bidding against each other for leases in Oklahoma, with the pre-determined winner allocating part of the lease to the “loser.”

If convicted, will the other owners of OKC distance themselves or punish McClendon? He supposedly has as recently as 2014, purchased *additional* shares of the team from other co-owner, Jefferey Records Jr. 

If the NBA chooses to discipline McClendon, it wouldn't be the first time. The NBA fined McClendon $250,000 in response to statements he made to the press shortly after they moved the Seattle SuperSonics to Oklahoma City, as his statements contradicted the organization's publicized intentions at the time. McClendon disclosed to the OKC Journal Record that the team had planned to move the team all along, despite their public stance that they'd wanted to keep the team in Seattle.  
Here are McClendon's comments that resulted in a $250,000 fine:


&gt;“We didn’t buy the team to keep it in Seattle, we hoped to come here. We know it’s a little more difficult financially here in Oklahoma City, but we think it’s great for the community and if we could break even we’d be thrilled.”


&gt;“We started to look around and at that time the Sonics were going through some ownership challenges in Seattle,” McClendon told the Journal Record. “So Clay, very artfully and skillfully, put himself in the middle of those discussions and to the great amazement and surprise to everyone in Seattle, some rednecks from Oklahoma, which we’ve been called, made off with the team.”

**The Future**
-------------------

To update folks on changes from last year, we have seen more clarity in the expansion process. [Atlanta United](http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/07/07/2d/a5/atlutd_icon.jpg) and Minnesota will be joining next year. [Los Angeles FC](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/685155252987809792/OZXvgFYq_400x400.jpg) will be following them in 2018. Miami is a few years behind them, but Beckham's Miami franchise is rumored to be in investment talks with Qatar Sports Investments, owners of PSG. With their help, the floundering franchise may finally start to get off the ground.

Discussion is already underway for the next round of expansion. Sacramento and San Antonio look to be the closest things to locks in this next round. Following them is St. Louis. If they can find ownership, they are virtually guaranteed a slot in MLS. The fourth and possibly finally slot is likely to be a battle between Detroit and Carolina. The former has seen some fantastic grassroots support for a local semi-professional team. The latter has two strong candidates in Raleigh and Charlotte who will be fighting to represent the state at the highest level.

------------------------------------------------------------------

**Current Format:**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MLS consists of 34 games run through the months of March to October. There are currently 20 teams that compete within the league ([listed in the comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/48dame/2016_guide_to_mls/d0ip2gl)).

While there are several unique elements to MLS, I have highlighted only a couple of the unique elements. Oddities like allocation money, the Superdraft, and re-entry draft have a relative minor impact on games and can be learned about later. I'd rather keep things relatively simple for now.

**Salary Cap:** 

The Salary Cap is one of the most unique elements of American soccer. Compared to European sports where teams can spend relatively freely, this cap provides a maximum spending limit for teams (around $3.5 million a year). The main reason this was put in place was to prevent the collapse of another American soccer league. Part of the downfall of the downfall of the North American Soccer League came teams drastically raising their spending on players to the point of financial collapse. With a cap in place, the league was able to ensure teams spend within their limits to ensure financial survival while also keeping down the price of player salaries.

In order to allow teams to grow and attract better talent, MLS passed the ""Beckham Rule"" in which teams can sign up to three designated players who contracts each exceed $457,500 (this threshold increases annually). This allows us to bring in big talent. There is the option for ""young designated players"" who are 23 or under. They have a much lower salary cap hit.

**Parity:**

The other major benefit of the salary cap is that it provides a form of parity not found in any of the other major leagues. Since MLS was founded in 1996, ten separate teams have won the MLS Cup. Only two teams (LA and D.C.) have won more than two titles. Within MLS, your team has a theoretically equal shot of winning the title as any other team within the league.

**Conferences:** 

In MLS, teams are evenly split between the Eastern and Western conference. In any given season, you play each team from the opposite conference once and teams from your own conference either twice or three times. Due to the difficulties of travel, we do not have a balanced schedule. To put this into context, the distance between Vancouver, Canada and Orlando, Florida (the two furthest teams) is 4228.1 Kilometers. The distance from Dublin, Ireland, to Jerusalem is only 4080.8 Kilometers. A balanced schedule is difficult financially for teams and takes a physical toll on the players.

**Playoffs:** 

In MLS, winning the MLS Cup is seen as more prestigious than finishing first on the table (the Supporter's Shield). Under the current format, the top 6 teams from each conference qualify for the playoffs. The playoffs can be thought of as an elimination tournament in which teams are still split between conference. The top two teams from each conference receive a ""bye"" - they are exempt from the first round of play and enter the tournament in the second round. 

The first round is a one game knockout round where the losers go home and the winners advance to face the two teams on ""bye."" 

The second round consists of two-legs much like traditional soccer tournaments. 

The two winners of the second round advance to the conference championship where they square off over two legs. 

The two conference winners then face off in the final for a single elimination match.

**Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup:** 

This tournament is named after Lamar Hunt, an owner who co-founded the North American Soccer League, was a charter investor of MLS, owned American sports teams in several leagues, and who founded and owned three MLS teams when the league began. He, also, financed the Columbus Crew's stadium, the first soccer-specific stadium built for professional soccer in America. Without his backing, MLS would never have taken off. In honor of this pioneer for American soccer, the United States Soccer Federation named the tournament and cup after him in 1999.

While MLS is a young league, many would be surprised how long the U.S. Open Cup has been in existence. This year marks the 102 year of existence for this cup. The tournament has seen several generations of American soccer dominance - from Bethlehem Steel (5 titles) in the 1910's to the Philadelphia Ukranians (4 wins) of the 1960's to the Seattle Sounders (4 wins) of the present. The tournament is open to all American teams -whether amateur, semi-pro, or professional- and the winner is guaranteed a spot in the CONCACAF Champion's League.

Note: Canadian teams do not take part in this. They compete in the the Voyageurs Cup.

**Trades:**

While transfers are the norm in the rest of the world, trades within MLS are far more common. A team may trade a player to another team for a draft pick, another player, a money, an international spot, or other incentives. The player rarely has a choice in a trade.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What's new this year?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In the off-season, MLS announced a new investment in ""general allocation money"" to go along with the ""targeted allocation money"" announced this past July. Over the next two years, MLS teams will be awarded $800,000 annually that can be used to buy down player contracts to fit within the league's salary cap. This money can also be traded for players or other forms of MLS currency.

In essence, this allows teams to sign players who normally would count as designated players and then buy down their cap hit. To make this clearer, anyone who makes over $457,500 annually in MLS counts as one of a team's three designated players. With Targeted Allocation Money (or TAM), a team can sign a player for $600,000 annually and spend $200,000 of their TAM to buy him down below DP level, saving these slots for bigger, more expensive players.

What's the purpose of this? MLS is very invested in their salary cap as a means of keeping expenditures low and maintaining parity. This new TAM allows a team to bring in better players whom might have been to expensive to fit into the salary cap previously.

Along with this, MLS announced an additional $125,000 in for Homegrown Players Funds for teams over the next two years. Homegrown players are academy signings whom do not count against the salary cap.

Yes, MLS rules are confusing and make very little sense at times.

F.A.Q.
--------

(I can update this with new questions.)

*Why is there no relegation/promotion?*

* Unfortunately, it is not economically feasible at present. The fear is that if a team gets relegated, fans will stop coming to matches, and the owner will fold the team. The average American sports fan is used to supporting the best teams in the world at their sport (NFL, MLB, NBA, etc.). We aren't at a point yet in popularity or financial stability where the risk of promotion/relegation is worth taking. I do hope to see it within a few decades.

*Why does MLS run spring to fall?*

* It's the same reason that Scandinavia runs spring to fall. The northern part of our country gets bombarded with snow in the winter unlike most of Europe. Even in March, a handful of MLS cities are still covered in snow. This would kill attendance. Plus, we don't want to compete against the NFL, NBA, and NHL.

*Isn't MLS a retirement league?*

* Not at all. Some teams rely on signing big named and old players. For every Ashley Cole or Andrea that is signed, several young or in their prime players join the league. Of the several players who joined my team this off season, only one was 30 or above.


*Why is the Supporter's Shield less prestigious than the MLS Cup?*

* In part, America values playoffs far more than the regular season. Also, the unbalanced schedule makes it an unfair comparison between teams. Where's the fairness in playing the Union three times compared to playing LA three times? The East is typically worse than the West, meaning Eastern teams have a better shot at winning the Shield.",soccer,1761
badandy80,2016-02-26 14:19:11+00:00,Absolutely insane experience with the Seattle PD last night. Thought Seattle Redditors would enjoy some justice porn,"**UPDATE 3** I'll have some time to go through my dashcam footage on Sunday. For now, here's my favorite report on this story. Listen for when I say ""I hope I have my wallet"". Mitch had asked me if he could see the wallet. Editing makes it look different, but I was actually almost upstairs saying that to myself without realizing I was still mic'd up. Awesome report KOMO! 

**Thanks for the gold!** You are the first person in 9 years on Reddit to gift me gold. Woohoo!

**UPDATE 2** Thanks everyone for reading and upvoting my rambling story. After KING 5 aired their piece, both KOMO and KIRO came and I did interviews from my basement/bar. It was a whirlwind day. Lots of attention at my place and lots of random people stopping by. 

It was cool to have a podium for a day to give an alternative perspective that's usually shouted down as against the ""narrative"". /r/seattle faith restored! It was awesome to have my bias proven wrong when reading all of the supportive and positive comments on here. You guys rock. 

**UPDATE!!** It's been a crazy day with work, but I was able to respond to one of the interview requests I got after posting the story here.

I don't know for sure if it will make it on the news, but King 5 picked up my story in their planning meeting this morning (thanks to reddit) and they asked for an interview. I changed the location last-minute to Anita's Mexican Food (the taco stand) in order to give them some well-deserved publicity. 

I met with a reporter and video guy at 11 this morning and I told the whole story while they tried to find the WORST angle possible to videotape me. Afterwards I went to the taco stand and ordered, giving a big ass tip to Ana, who refused multiple times until I told her coworker she had no choice but to accept my money as gratitude. I REALLY hope I just made the web version so I can relax this weekend before my knee surgery next week, but you might see me on the news today.

**ORIGINAL POST**

So I couldn't find my wallet this evening. Having used it last night picking up my dog from daycare, it was either in my bag where it usually is or for some reason still in my car. 

After searching for 30 minutes I realized I had somehow lost it. I checked my Mint app to see if any of the cards had been used. Nope. JUST as I was putting my phone away, I saw a notification from my Capital One app saying that my card had just been approved at ""Coca Cola in Bellevue, WA"", and then another at ""Coca Cola""... I was pretty confused until I saw a third transaction just a minute later from  ""Anitas Mexican Food""... with this app you can click on a little location icon that shows the location.. IT WAS IN MY ZIPCODE! That's when I realized my wallet had somehow been stolen and I was watching someone using it live. I ran to my computer and googled Anitas Mexican Food and after a few frantic minutes of searching I found a Yelp profile for a freakin' TACO TRUCK. I looked at the address and HOLY JESUS it was just a mile up the road. 

I grabbed my bag and ran out the door as my fiancé was looking at me very confused. As I was racing up Aurora Ave I called the food truck and this lady answered, speaking mostly spanish. In my best (read: terrible) spanish I asked her if someone had just purchased $5.48 at her truck and she said yes. I explained that the credit card was stolen and asked if they were still there. She says YES. 

After a few frustrating u-turns I finally find this taco truck tucked away in a parking lot. As i'm walking up to the taco truck lady I realized that NO ONE IS THERE. I call 911 and try to explain that my wallet was somehow stolen while I walked up to the truck. After a few frustrating minutes between the dispatcher and the lady, I gather that they just walked down the street. 

I finally got a description of a white guy with a black t-shirt and no jacket.. skinny and my height. I hang up with the dispatcher as he said he's sending the police. 

Not wanting to wait, I get back in my car and start driving up the road to see if I can spot him. TWO BLOCKS AWAY I see this guy fitting the description perfectly, sitting near the bus stop and eating. I get back on the phone with 911 and told the dispatcher that I'm pulling into Krispy Kreme parking lot behind him and for the police to meet me there... LET'S FLANK HIM! 

Seattle PD shows up less than 3 min later and WHOA.. it's the two female officers that responded when someone tried to steal my 200lb rolled up chainlink fence from the front of my house a month ago. I explained the situation as yet another officer shows up and the three of them finally go over there to talk to him. As they continue to talk with him for nearly 10 minutes, I called my little brother to tell him the story... I'm explaining things to him and his wife on speaker and one of the officers tells me they're going to get the taco truck lady to ID him. 

After she leaves things are starting to get a little more intense with the male  and female officer grilling this guy. I go back into my car and am telling the story when this guy freaking BOLTS DIRECTLY INTO TRAFFIC ON AURORA.
He runs full speed across the street with the other two cops running after him weaving through cars. I couldn't believe what I was seeing... I'm stunned sitting there with a running cop car next to me.. and the guy and cops had disappeared down a DARK side street and down a hill in an instant. 

I then realized that this dude was pretty big, and was concerned. So I put my car in gear and take off after them, realizing that they're on foot FAR away from their car and I'm IN a car so maybe I could help.

I turn down this side street and notice just how dark it is.. barbed wire along the right and stone a wall along the left. Out of the corner of my eye I see a struggle in the grass.. the cops have this guy pinned on the ground with his head at an odd angle against the wall. I get out and try and help them without punching this guy (way harder than I thought it would be).

Since the guy cops mic fell off in the chase he asked me to get the other girl cop at the taco truck. She had the lady from the taco truck in her police car. With nothing more useful to do I went back to babysitting the running cop car back at krispy kreme.

The officer with with the taco lady comes back and tells me he tried to toss my credit card during the chase. They recovered it and said they'll let me know if they find anything else. So I head back to look through the bushes for my wallet. 

Not 5 minutes later dispatch calls me back to the scene. They had ALL of my cards and my wallet, but not my ID.. funny thing is, that my wallet had all of his stuff in it by this point, and he was holding it the whole time they were talking to him. They didn't know what my wallet looked like and just assumed it was his.
After about 15 minutes of bullshitting with them (EVERYONE was excited) I head home, looking for my ID along the way on the road. 

As I was telling this story to a friend  on the phone at home, I get a call from one of the female officers, saying that they found my ID hidden ""on his person"" when they were booking him. They offered to drop it off at my house, but I decided to go pick it up from the station as they said they had tons of paperwork to do. 
I'm not kidding, the three officers were some of the coolest, most friendly and professional cops I've ever met. Aaaaand I think I'm out of luck for the year. 

I'm not going to contest the charges at the taco truck as I know how difficult it is to get chargebacks. I'm going to buy some tacos tomorrow and give a fat tip to her for helping me catch this shitbag.

Edit: The best part I left out. I realized I had my dashcam running the entire time. I'll post it!

TL;DR: Found lost wallet and dude goes to jail. Seattle PD didn't call me a racial slur.

Edit: Learned from a 2 very vocal people that using the term ""girl"" in any context, or being concerned when a criminal could overpower a female officer is sexist. (guess I missed that class!) I edited that out because I like talking with people on here that understand context and real life situations as humorous as those comments are. Unreal, but I expected more of them so I'm happy regardless. My opinion: Boys and girls, dudes and chicks are just alternate words. Context defines the intent. Don't let people that don't yet know that, or are just sexist themselves, ruin your stories. But I could be wrong.",Seattle,2529
whynotdolphins,2016-02-18 01:37:25+00:00,I went through and wrote down who every team had the opportunity to draft since 2003. Wolves fans beware.,"**The Idea**


My buddy and I were talking about how the Wolves passed up Steph Curry twice in the 2009 draft (they drafted Rubio at 5, Jonny Flynn at 6 with Steph going at 7) and how much different the Wolves would look right now. So I thought, I wonder what other teams could have had.

**The Rules**

*The player the team “should have” drafted has to be taken five spots or less later than they could’ve drafted him. This ensures the scouting opinion is consistent with the league. For example, the Wolves would much rather have Jimmy Butler (No. 30 pick in 2011 draft) than Derrick Williams (No. 2 pick in 2011), but the entire league had the opportunity to pick Butler and whiffed. So it wasn’t a case of ineptitude by the Wolves not drafting Butler, he’s just an outlier the whole league missed on.

*This isn’t a world in which the players just go to one team. Example: The Pistons drafted Chase Budinger at No. 44 in 2009 and the Wolves (I’m sorry Minnesota!) drafted Nick Calathes at No. 45. The Cavs drafted Danny Green at No. 46. In my hypothetical team building, I would give Green to both the Pistons and the Wolves, since they both had the chance to draft him. Each team exists in their own little draft universe (insert “time is a flat circle” meme).

*I’m starting with the legendary 2003 draft class because that’s just when I started following the NBA at a serious level.

*I’m just doing the first round.

*If a scrub was drafted, followed by five scrubs, I just ignored it. Or if everybody is retired.

*I’m not redoing the 2015 draft, because I don’t think rookies can be judged with less than a full season of experience. Just a personal belief.

**Keep in mind**

I know, I know. If player X went to crappy situation Y, then player X wouldn’t have developed into a good player. Each player needs the right situation to prosper. I know that. This is just meant to be a fun “ooohhh look what we could have had!” type of post. Please don’t take it too seriously and be *too* mean to me.

Ok, let’s get started. The player in parentheses is the player the team actually drafted. The number next to each player is his draft order. Bolded names are players the teams actually drafted that I couldn’t find a better replacement for. I’m starting the Wolves, because, well….

&amp;nbsp;


**Minnesota Timberwolves**

PG — Steph Curry 7 (Ricky Rubio 5)

SG — C.J. McCollum 10 (Trey Burke 9) or J.J. Redick 11 (Randy Foye 7)

&amp;nbsp;

Wow. Could have had Boogie and Steph very easily (they were taken IMMEDIATELY after the Wolves picks). This is my favorite what-if team. I let it be a dealer’s choice for SG and PF. Whatever style you prefer to run would dictate which one you start. I do that a lot with other teams in the list, too.

Now I’ll go in the reverse order of the worst records of this year’s teams.

C — **Serge Ibaka 24**

Bench — J.J. Redick 11 (Mouhamed Sene 10), **Nick Collison 12**, Al Jefferson 15 or Josh Smith 17 (Robert Swift 12), Ian Mahinmi 28 (Johan Petro 25), Joakim Noah 9 (Jeff Green 5, traded from Boston), Patrick Peterson 14 (Cole Aldrich 11, traded from New Orleans), Eric Bledsoe 18 (drafted, then traded to Clippers), **Reggie Jackson 24**, Festus Ezeli 30 (Perry Jones III 28), Giannis Antetokounmpo 15 (Steven Adams 12), Rodney Hood 23 (Mitch McGary 21), **Josh Heustis 29, Cameron Payne 14**

I had completely forgotten about Mouhamed Sene. The only think I know about him is a joke Bill Simmons made in his draft diary column about how Ray Allen poured another glass of scotch upon seeing his team draft a player that wouldn’t help him.

&amp;nbsp;

edit: Added Golden State upon the request of several. Because sure, they need Reddick and PG, too.

&amp;nbsp;

edit 2: I've seen a lot of ""We didn't draft X"" comments. What I tried to do was say each team had the chance to draft some player, but they didn't. So the Celtics came away with Kelly Olynyk, the 13th pick in the draft (via trade from Dallas) so they technically didn't draft him, but they still came away with the 13th pick in the draft and they *could* have had something else. Hope that reasoning makes sense.

&amp;nbsp;

edit 3: added Spurs and Thunder &amp; correct Eric Maynor. He was not the No. 2 pick in the draft.",nba,1318

peeekaboo1,2016-02-16 20:57:27+00:00,[UPDATE] My [22 M] girlfriend's [21 F] dad bought her a 10k watch for Valentine's Day.,"I was in a really tricky situation and was feeling doubtful about myself, and I'm so thankful all of you encouraged me to continue with my Valentine's Day plans because everything went better than expected. [Here is the original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/45hogk/my_22_m_girlfriends_21_f_dad_bought_her_a_10k/)


She got ready as usual in the morning, and hopped on over to our favorite breakfast spot. when we were done, she said something like, ""this is so thoughtful, how wonderful we get to spend this morning together. thank you, thank you"" which got me all excited because I knew she was expecting to go home afterwards, but SURPRISE! We get in the car and head further north. she was all like, ""what's happening?"" and when we stopped at ANOTHER coffee spot, she burst into laughter saying, ""oh my gosh are you serious MORE coffee? you really want to spend the day with a lunatic?"" to which i respond, OF COURSE.


and when we get to seattle she's still giddy. we live close to seattle but hardly ever get time to just walk around and enjoy seattle because it's normally business, or we're just too busy ourselves to have a leisure day. we go to little shops and look around and she loses herself in some kitchen shop for a good hour and a half (seriously). and once again, she's like, ""wow, this has been incredible thank you for this amazing day"" thinking we're about to go home, and that's when I give her the watch! she starts crying and says that this is the most thoughtful thing anyone has done for her. and she LOVES our anniversary engraved into it. she even said, ""ah! I don't want to wear it because I don't want to hurt it!"" but put it on anyway. in fact i feel like she was flashing it off :) which she never does with any jewelry.


and then, we were going to go to dinner but the restaurant goofed and didn't write down our reservation. she wasn't upset at all and suggested we go to *Chipotle* for our v-day dinner! so we went and she loved it because she said it was the perfect day where she didn't have to be ""on"" or ""too formal"" and ""boring"" with her family. she then laughed and mentioned how weird it was that her dad got her a watch and so did i, and that she's so grateful for me and our relationship &amp; not to be intimidated by it all because she prefers ""this way of living"" (relaxed? i guess?)


anyway, we got home later than expected, and she got me some sort of couples coloring book, a handmade card, and a batch of cookies. we colored and ate cookies until she fell asleep... SMILING. she fell asleep smiling. I'm the happiest man alive. Thank you Reddit for telling me to continue with my v-day plans. i never would of went through with it without everyone encouraging me. it makes me laugh because after everything was said and done, she said ""we spent the entire day together and it cost *nothing*"" haha. 

   
**tl;dr**: went through with v-day plans, everything turned out better than expected. she loved the watch and the entire day. thank you to everyone who told me to go through with my plans. ",relationships,2967

**Edit:**
Jeeze guys. Thanks for the comments! You really get me through my work day! :)

Some of you guys are wondering why I invited him. No I'm not some cringy 35 year old creep, I am a 19 year old wanna-be game designer with unrealitic fantasies. Todd is not the only game-industry guy we have invited, I just thought I would share the experience.  My fiance and I are really big on games, that is just who we are, and we plan on taking a honeymoon in Seattle so we can visit Valve and Nintendo!

Thank you guys again. I just wanted to tell you guys how much I appreciate the kindness before this post fades into the void!!

-AbeFroman,2016-01-08 01:25:46+00:00,"If the Lions had won their two games that ended in controversial calls by the officials (Packers and @Seahawks), they would be the #5 seed in the NFC.","I just realized this, think about it.

The game against the Packers - the hail mary that won Green Bay the game was gifted on a botched facemask call. Sure, it was impossible to see in real time, but upon further review it was clearly not a penalty. The game should have been over, and Detroit should have won. This puts Detroit at 8-8 and Green Bay at 9-7.

Now take the MNF game against Seattle. At the end of the game, Calvin Johnson fumbled the ball on the goal line thanks to an incredible play by Kam Chancellor. However, K.J. Wright illegally ""bats"" the ball out of the endzone, giving Seattle the ball. Detroit should have been given the ball at the 1, and the way they were driving down the field, it's likely that they would have scored a touchdown with little or no time left for Seattle. If Detroit wins that game as well, both they and Seattle go to 9-7, with Detroit now holding the tie-breaker over both GB and SEA. Detroit is now the 5th seed, Green Bay the 6th, and Seattle misses the playoffs entirely.

TL;DR - The refs potentially costed Detroit a playoff berth and gifted one to Seattle.",nfl,1389

As many of you know, our [first light brigade was a great success!](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/3xegsg/bernie_light_brigade_photo_megathread/) We had volunteers in 40 different cities spanning 20 states put together glowing LED signs for Bernie, and on December 18th, they all held their signs up on overpasses, in parks, and outside of movie theaters to raise awareness for Bernie! [Seriously, **look at how awesome these San Fran folks are.**](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CWid9ZhUsAASzIZ.jpg:large)

This is an amazingly fun project, **AND IT'S SO EASY TO DO.** Even [Ben &amp;amp;amp;amp; Jerry (of ice cream fame) took part!](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/3uuus6/hi_reddit_im_jerry_greenfield_original_cofounder/) (They'll be giving us an update within the next day or two as well).

##**So. Does this interest you?**

If yes, then keep reading. We have 500 total volunteers in our Slack channel (an app we use for organizing and communicating) and I'm certain that many of them are **in your area!** 

##**What is the Bernie Light Brigade?** 

The Bernie Light Brigade is a project inspired by the work done by the activist group, the [Overpass Light Brigade](http://overpasslightbrigade.org/). The BLB originally started late Friday night, during a campaign-related phone call I had with Ben and Jerry (the individuals, not the corporation). The following day, I [submitted a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/3ult40/ive_been_working_with_ben_cohen_and_jerry/) about the project and the response was overwhelmingly positive! The following day, I asked Jerry to post a picture of his own sign. [He did](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/3uuus6/hi_reddit_im_jerry_greenfield_original_cofounder/), and we reached #3 on /r/all, gave the Overpass Light Brigade's website the hug of death, and will actually be featured on Reddit's editorial website, Upvoted.com! 

##**What is our quest?** 

[To seek the holy grail!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWS8Mg-JWSg) And also, on **Friday, January 15th**, teams of volunteers and activists in various cities across the country will stand on overpasses, in public parks, beside busy streets, and outside of movie theaters with bright, attention-grabbing, and homemade [""BERNIE 2016"" LED signs](https://i.imgur.com/QZKFNAW.jpg)! 

This is a creative way to raise some awareness about Bernie Sanders, and most importantly, IT'S FUN, and a great way to establish some relationships with other supporters in your area. 

Better yet? Displays like this have been done hundreds of times in the past without hardly any hiccups! After all, is a glowing word really more distracting than [this](https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/stltoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/f0/5f023b26-0fe7-11e0-b4f6-0017a4a78c22/4d1580439de83.preview-300.jpg) or [this](https://myfivesenseworth.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/edsa.jpg)? Real people holding up ""BERNIE"" signs will be pretty difficult to misconstrue into a negative thing, but you still need to abide by the law in your area! Don't be disruptive, make sure walkways are clear, and don't attach any of your objects to the infrastructure around you! 

##**INSTRUCTIONS: How to join your team, How to make your sign, etc**

* **Step 1:** [Fill out this Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HLq5lm-GPsmfwiBnl7wsCnX-oryrj6GhNGQnN56zxP8/viewform) or [**Click here to get an automated invitation**](https://bernielightbrigadeslack.herokuapp.com/)

* **Step 2:** You will receive an email from me with a link to join our official Light Brigade [Slack Team](https://www.slack.com/). For those unaware, Slack is an amazing group messaging tool that volunteers have been using for months! It grants us the ability to divide 100-person groups of people into different channels, based on metrics like location, skillset, age, responsibilities, and more. The FeelTheBern.org crew used it extensively during the production of their website, and without Slack, our mod team would have surely imploded by now. 

* **Step 3:** Once you get your invite and join the group, *find the team for your location!* We have amazing people leading the charge in dozens of cities and areas across the country - and many of them have already bought materials and built signs! This will allow you to connect and interact directly with Bernie supporters in your area. You can pool resources, coordinate meetup times, and assign duties. 

* **Step 4:** Read this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jwJFxwFxkC7bX-UxjduMd92fUW7jSNFJ1GCCEI3YnR4/edit?usp=sharing) and figure out what resources you need to buy and how to assemble the signs. Additionally, please read through [this photo album](http://imgur.com/a/DG0gu) for an alternative sign-making method. The original Google Doc is for standard signs, the latter album is for using 'rope lights.' 

Share these resources with your teammates! Split up the costs and duties between yourselves. Work *together.* If you know you won't be able to partake in the assembly of the signs, maybe offer to pay a little more than the rest of the team, or vise versa. We're all in this together :)

* **Step 5:** Spread the word! Invite new people to the Slack group! GET TO WORK! 

* **Note:** There are a handful of designated ""leaders"" in that Slack channel. When I'm unavailable, they will serve as a conduit to me or the mod team. If you need help inviting new members, we can take care of it. If you have a question about the scope and logistics of the project, we can help provide an answer. *Someone* is always a mere click away from providing assistance. 

##**Do I get anything out of all this?** 

OF COURSE! Not only will we be awarding unique **Bernie Light Squad** flair promotions within the subreddit to individuals who bust their humps on this project and participate, but you also have the opportunity to make a real impact on the political process! Plus, you get to meet and work alongside hundreds of passionate, funny, kind, and intelligent individuals, and hopefully forge some long-lasting friendships and activist-connections in the process. Maybe someone sends an email to a local news affiliate and they interview your group!

Not updated for today but the Bengals allowed 16 points, and Seattle allowed 6. Chiefs allowed 17.

naforever,2015-12-30 08:18:28+00:00,Some pics from my third year of daily-driving the NSX,"I have been daily-driving my 1995 NSX for three years now. Just wanted to share pics from my NSX's 2015, as I did in my earlier posts: [year 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1tkvgj/some_pics_from_my_first_year_of_dailydriving_the/) and [year 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/2s3hiq/some_pics_from_my_second_year_of_dailydriving_the/). 

When I say ""daily-driving"", I mean it. I knew a guy who had several different vehicles and while he was showing off his garage, waved his hand over four or five forever-project-cars off to the side and said ""those are the ones I daily-drive."" I asked if he really drove each of those cars every day and he insisted he did. That's not what I mean here.
And I don't mean daily-driver to mean a car that only comes out for bad weather, or a car that sits on weekends while one hops into a more fun vehicle.

When I say my NSX is my daily-driver, I mean that literally. Every day, no matter what I'm doing or where I'm going. 

* Some days are good; [top-off ocean-side sunny cruises for hundreds of miles](http://imgur.com/v8VpWYs.jpg).
* Some days are bad; [packing groceries into the trunk in a crowded parking lot covered with muddy snow](http://imgur.com/u8vHd2s.jpg). 

I started the year with approximately 142K miles. I'm now at just over 168K miles, putting me at just over 26K miles for the year ~ a little less than last year. I *tried* to put more miles on her, I really did.

To start, the weather didn't cooperate much. I know I said I'm a no-compromises kind of driver and I really do take my car out in all conditions, including [pulling her out onto the slush to rinse her off in the middle of winter](http://imgur.com/QXaWCWB.jpg). But I admit I drive longer distances if the weather is good.

I invented road trips to go on. I recently started to follow Formula One (Ayrton Senna's connection to the NSX was always a bragging right, and the repartnering of McLaren Honda was really exciting... at least until the racing actually started). However the closest thing to an F1 venue on the US' east coast is [future street circuit Port Imperial](http://imgur.com/ZEW62CT.jpg) across the river from New York City. Everyone says it's never gonna happen however and that Austin's Circuit of the Americas is a much better track. [Look at that view, though](http://imgur.com/mEECVh2.jpg).

I even re-did some previous road trips. Several years ago I went to Maine in my trusty Acura Legend. I did it again, with the [trusty NSX](http://imgur.com/8i0dQnr.jpg). This spot, West Quoddy Head, is actually [the Easternmost point in the continental United States](http://imgur.com/eTa7w10.jpg). 

I mention that because... well, now we put ourselves on a mission.

A ridiculous mission that included driving to the [Northwest Angle, the northernmost point in the continental US](http://imgur.com/Ok137iG.jpg). That meant driving all the way through Minnesota and managing dozens of miles on dirt roads and gravel. Into Canada. And checking ourselves into a border crossing (it's really weird). 

Once we got there it was tough to figure out exactly how far north we could go, but [according to GPS this was the spot](http://imgur.com/InoPOO2.jpg). Gotta admit though, Canadian dirt roads are smoother than American dirt roads... smoother even than some American paved roads -_-

The [buggy aftermath](http://imgur.com/mgAPklJ.jpg). Not to worry though, I rinsed/washed the car almost every day of the trip. About a [third of our trunk space was dedicated to detailing gear](http://imgur.com/Car6Y5z.jpg). Yes, under that yellow microfiber is a sealable bucket with Optimum No Rinse, grit guards, assorted sprays and a fat stack of microfibers and detailing cloths. 

We kept on going. There was some debate as to where we consider the most western point to be but finally decided on [a spot](http://imgur.com/DrUOODy.jpg) on the map called Ozette in western Washington. While one can technically hike further to Cape Alava, [the NSX could only reasonably make it to the ranger station](http://imgur.com/jvrQX3R.jpg).

If you're keeping score (and saw last year's post), that means this NSX has driven to all [four corners of the continental United States](http://imgur.com/NkwlYw5.jpg):

* northernmost: Northwest Angle, MN

* southernmost: Key West, FL

* westernmost: Ozette, WA

* easternmost: West Quoddy Head, ME

The real reason we drove all this way though was because we were moving out west and figured we'd make a good road trip out of it =) and since we were already all the way out on the coast, why not check off another great once-in-a-lifetime-drive and do the entire Pacific Coast Highway?

* this is [where it starts](http://imgur.com/8xTboY8.jpg). It's weird because it is US-101 north and we're supposed to be going southbound (with the Pacific on our side of the highway, of course). However if one looks at a map, US-101 starts by wrapping around Washington's Olympic peninsula so it goes north first then west before finally curving south along the sea.

* then you get [views like this](http://imgur.com/7HmlUha.jpg)

* and [this one in Oregon, my personal favorite](http://imgur.com/5L18qWI.jpg)

* the whole coast is just gorgeous all the way down and it is beautiful the entire fucking time and we just kept stopping for pictures over and over, even more so once we hit [the California Redwood forest](http://imgur.com/i1qtYhL)

* pro tip: if you are driving from Seattle down US-101 and you are counting on stopping in a large city so you can get your oil changed, it's not gonna happen until San Francisco. At least there, I was able to meet up with other NSX owners including another [extremely rare Midnight Pearl NSX](http://i.imgur.com/6UfEFhN.jpg).

* best part: [that section between Monterey and Big Sur](http://imgur.com/jw29vb5.jpg). Besides H3 in Hawai'i, [this is the most beautiful highway in the United States](http://imgur.com/v8VpWYs.jpg). Top off? Fuck yeah.

* and this is [the end of the Pacific Coast Highway](http://imgur.com/7LMmpuC.jpg), CA-1 in the middle of the night, bleary-eyed and exhausted and not a care in the world because we finally made it to San Diego.

I spent time in San Diego some years ago, back when I had an Acura Legend. Back then, there weren't too many guys willing to go on cruises and drives with my old 1993 luxury barge. The local NSX guys though had no problem with it. It really made an impression on me and a lot of San Diego weekends were spent chasing NSXs through the mountains and hills. It made me happy to finally show up with my own NSX (almost 10 years later) and [join them for Cars and Coffee](http://imgur.com/nQUI4R5.jpg).

Of course that meant we also had to do another Palomar Mountain drive, [for old time's sake](http://imgur.com/6DlTMyZ.jpg).

The WikiPedia page for ""Honda NSX"" has a pic of an 02-05 NSX sitting at Palomar Observatory. [This](http://imgur.com/q9px9rp.jpg) is that same lot, at the end of one of the best drives in the country. Next time I'll take a better picture, worthy of a WikiPedia article.

If you were in San Diego in the early 2000s, then [you know where this is and what it meant](http://imgur.com/rx5w1XF.jpg). Those were some good times. Probably good I didn't have an NSX back then.

Did I mention we moved west? I meant way way west. We put the NSX on a boat and I didn't see her until [three weeks later](http://imgur.com/Yq5d8WA.jpg).

[In Hawai'i](http://imgur.com/eNHmygM.jpg).

It has been a real adjustment. There have been serious frustrations. Traffic is horrific, way worse than LA or even Washington DC. Driving habits here are aggravating as fuck. There are few places to stretch out the NSX; it seems everywhere has too many speed bumps, too many potholes or simply too many people. There are so many times I just wanna give up on living here and I find myself having to turn off my inner car guy just to maintain my sanity.

But then I get to go on [drives like this](http://i.imgur.com/BlF8okI.jpg).

Met up with some good local enthusiasts and entered my [first car show](http://imgur.com/4XkS5VW.jpg) ~ the red one next to me won ""Best Acura"".

I've been trying to get more of the local NSX folks together and that's been [a lot of fun](http://imgur.com/ESVFaou.jpg). More of them on the island than [one might expect](http://imgur.com/U17IfwL.jpg).

But yeah, it's been kinda tough. I've learned a lot. 

* For starters, there is no real good way to take a picture next to the ocean with your car if it is really low. [Can't ever quite get the angle right](http://imgur.com/hDNLLkc.jpg).

* Also, it really is about the friends you make along the way. I don't care how corny that sounds. We had a [great group of enthusiasts in Washington DC](http://imgur.com/uj8p1l2.jpg) and I was proud to be part of it. I can go on and on about the NSX and how amazing it is as a car and what an engineering marvel it is, but what I really love most about it is [meeting other crazy motherfuckers](http://imgur.com/h6kAPXO.jpg) just as stupid about the car as I am and knowing that wherever I take this sexy beast to, I'll meet more wild enthusiasts just as bent about the NSX ~ more crazies to meet again in the future.

* And finally, I've learned that other types of cars have the [same kind of enthusiasts who are just as crazy about their cars as NSX guys are](http://imgur.com/FeJVydP.jpg). 

It's been a good year and [a long fun road](http://imgur.com/XUMlKzJ.jpg).

* 23.95 average MPG

* 39.99 highest MPG (somewhere in Wyoming)

* 18.37 lowest MPG (daily traffic in Honolulu)

* 70.28 miles per day

Hope you enjoyed the pics ~ I post pics of the NSX on Instagram using the hashtag #nsxlife. All pics linked in this post are my own iPhone shots except [this one](http://imgur.com/BlF8okI) by Jayson Santoyo (jznsn2u on IG).",cars,1058

brokenodo,2015-12-06 13:00:15+00:00,"/r/Seattle, we can stop Comcast from bringing data caps to Seattle","Comcast's franchise agreement with the City of Seattle is up for renewal. The City of Seattle and Comcast have to agree on these terms in order for Comcast to provide their services within the city. 

We can use this opportunity to block Comcast from implementing data caps in Seattle, as they have already done in 16 states. 

Please write to Mayor Ed Murray as well as the City Council, urging them to require this for renewal of the franchise agreement. I have attached what I wrote below, which you can use as you wish. 

Letter:
-------------------

*Mayor Murray,*

*The City of Seattle is coming toward approval of a new cable franchise agreement with Comcast.*

*As part of these negotiations, I urge the city of Seattle to require Comcast to provide data-cap free internet plans within the city, as directed by a new franchise agreement.*

*Data caps, or “data usage plans” as Comcast refers to them, are a fundamental change in the equality that the internet brings to our society. The internet is a fundamental backbone of the development of today’s generation, and will be even more so as we move into the future. As technology progresses, any artificial limitations for the sole purpose of profit only serve to restrict those who cannot afford to pay.*

*Already in the last few months, Comcast has imposed “data usage plans” within certain Florida markets as well as Atlanta, GA and 14 other states. This appears to be expanding, and could be rolled out nationwide before long. After 300 GB of usage is consumed, Comcast charges an additional 10$ per 50 GB, or offers “unlimited usage” for 30 to 35 dollars per month.  The average cord-cutter uses 212 GB per month on average, as of 2014, and that number is rapidly increasing. In 2014, this may have been sufficient for most people, but what about 2024, when this franchise agreement will still be in effect? We need to prepare ourselves for our future progress,  and banning data caps for Seattle franchise agreement holders is an effective way to do that.*

*“…A 2011 study found that it cost just $0.03 (three cents) for a telco to transmit 1GB of data after all costs were accounted for. At the time, that rate was dropping precipitously, from 12 cents in 2007 to 3 cents in 2011. If the costs continued to decline, per-GB transmission costs to Comcast could be $0.02 or lower by now.” http://www.extremetech.com/internet/217716*

*As TV subscriber losses continue to grow, Comcast will only continue to artificially increase the cost of data, stifling the creativity and imaginations of those who cannot afford to pay. Do not allow Comcast to expand data caps to Seattle.*

I am not a practiced writer. So I apologize for the choppiness of this.

The last six weeks have been the hardest weeks of my life.

I forsook all comfort that Id grown accustomed to. My home. My bed. A kitchen. A desk. A computer. Video games. And it has been the single greatest event of my life.

I have been reborn.
Out of mediocrity.
Out of over-consumption.
Out of stagnantion.
Out of wasted time.

I spent most of my life's free time on video games.
Runescape. Guild Wars. World of Warcraft. League of Legends.
It was all I knew.
All I really, truly practiced. I knew this. I hated it.

I wanted to be an artist.
An engineer.
A philosopher.
I wanted to write and draw and read and cook and learn what nice things were and what it was to have good taste.

I was insecure. 
Confident on the surface only.
Intelligent but not creatively expressive. I saw what others had. And in my continual failure to recognize that in myself I grew to fear them. To envy them. Jealousy consumed me. I thought, ""who the hell am I compared to THEM? These people who do and create and learn and have such spirits!""
And I took these thoughts, and I went to sleep. 
I went to work.
I got home and played video games.
I suffered the same mental crisis and went to bed. 
I did this for years.

That all changed six weeks ago.
I found a subletter for my room to save cash due to an uncertain job future. I threw myself into a situation where I couldn't play games. I couldn't waste time. I couldn't deafen the voice in my head that grew from a whisper so incomprehensible into a roaring torrent of pain and regret and loathing.

I snapped.

I was in a relationship.
Probably, no surely, the best girl I have ever found. Loving. Trusting. Faithful. Spiritual. With a laugh and a smile that haunts me now. I lost that. I destroyed it. Poisoned it. I became a monster. Insecure. Suspicious. I saw her friends as threats. I projected my own insecurity, my own pain, my own self image onto her. 

Needless to say. She left me.

Earlier that day I had resolved to change myself. I made lists of what I wanted. What to do with my time. Identified the true nature and cause of my unhappiness. I wasn't her. It was me. Me and my lack of motion.
But it was too late.
I spent the next few days in a daze.
I walked around Seattle for 17 miles on a Thursday afternoon. I had called in sick to work. I got drunk. I went from sad to angry to happy to sad to angry and back and forth all over again.

I made a list  
Write. 
Draw. 
Read. 
Walk. 
Boulder and work out.

It's worth mentioning here that all of my active friends at this point were gamers. It's all I'd surrounded myself with. I didn't know what to do with my time or who to spend it with.

I worked out.
I slept.

I did this for days. Work. Workout. Walk. Listen to music. Read. Write. Doodle. Every day. I read a book in four days. I wrote letters I didn't send. I screamed in my car. I drank more water. I took vitamins. I kept working out. I kept writing. I kept drawing. I made notes to myself. ""Smile."" ""You are a good person and people like you."" ""You are going places and living your life.""

I saw myself changing. I learned to stop negative thoughts before they became nightmares. I was more positive. I was happier. More confident. 

I'd gotten a place by now. And even though I'd set up my computer, I couldn't bear the thought of sitting at it. I just wanted to walk. To do. To create. My mind was restless with adventure.

I applied to the peace corps.
I made new friends. Reconnected with old ones.
Made my bed daily. 
Learned to fold clothes properly.
Talked to strangers. 
Read. 

I have never been happier. But it came at a great cost. And now I live every days honoring that cost. Not only for myself. But for her. For my friends. For my loved ones. 

This life is my apology.
And my thank you.
And my ambition will carry me into God knows what sort of adventures, but I will always be looking ahead. I will allow myself no more excuses.

I am proud. 
I am positive. 
And I am growing. 

EDIT: So, this blew up much faster than I expected it to. I will do my best to address as many comments as I can recall (I read all of them today). PM's will follow afterwards, once again I will do my best to answer each to the best of my ability.

You all should read this comment by /u/nanocurious. He filtered through it and picked out the instructional bits that you are looking for.
""For anyone missing the instruction for change, it started with positive self talk and a smile. Fake it til you make it. Take the 17 mile walk. You'll start to wake up after the first 10 miles. Learn how to stop negative thought trains by jumping off. Recognize that you are more than your thoughts. Practice positive effort in all pursuits. As cheesy as it all may sound to the critic within, this works and the critic is a miserable dick.""

FIRST UP: THE TITLE. Okay, yeah. Not the best title. But it's not entirely wrong, either. Based on the comments I'd say it's best to agree to disagree and move onto the body of the story itself.

SECOND: I wrote this in a few minutes around midnight. I was unable to sleep, and had to get SOMETHING out. This is what came out. I did NOT write it for ANYBODY. I did not format it to make it a piece of 'literature.' This is what came out of my mind. The periods are stops. And it is far more EMOTIONAL than it is INSTRUCTIONAL and that is likely due to it's rather raw and unedited nature. I did not correct anything between paper and this post.

THIRD: VIDEO GAMES ARE NOT INHERENTLY BAD. DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF THINKING I AM SAYING THAT. Video games are an incredibly creative, deep, and engaging form of art. And the producers behind them deserve as much respect as the hottest thing in traditional painting. However, in my situation, they had become a rather sinister vice. Due to MY OWN lack of self-control. I do not loathe games, I love being able to interact with a story. The application they served in my life had long lost that purpose though. They became a competitive outlet. A distraction. And an overall time sink. I learned A LOT from playing them. And I would be a fool to say that it was all a waste of time, despite the content of the above text. But there is more (in my opinion) that I could do with those skills, and I realized I was not utilizing them in a manner conducive to my own goals and aspirations.

FOURTH: The god damn book part. No, it's not impressive in the grand scheme of people who read books. I used to consume them all the time, fly through them. But that stopped at some point in my life that I can't remember. And I will tell you that, personally, reading one at all and FINISHING it was a breath of fresh air that I cannot even begin to describe.

More to come, I'm losing my train of thought.",GetMotivated,2722

Hello and welcome back!

Last week was a losing battle trying to convince people to start the Carolina Panthers, but it turned out to be the most profitable play on the board. Remember, always assess your start/sit and streaming decisions based off of expected value, not actual value - while the Falcons outscored the Panthers (and the Lions matched them), anybody starting either team over the Panthers almost certainly made a blunder.

Blunders are bad. Results-oriented thinking is one of the absolute worst things you can do as a fantasy football GM. Something something DirecTV and cable. Don't be ""that guy"" that kicks himself for leaving Tavon Austin on the waiver wire, and don't kick yourself for leaving the Falcons on the waiver wire either. Last week we successfully identified a number of strong plays, and also some good-looking options that fell flat. Indianapolis and Tampa Bay had enough question marks to stay away, but sometimes you just get unlucky (here's looking at you, Arizona...).

Either way, we move ever onward. Say goodbye to 2014, because our training wheels are gone and it's all 2015 from here on out.

**[Defense Wins Championships, Week 5](https://empeopled.com/p/68722)**

This week's top teams (MFL Standard scoring):

1. Denver Broncos at Oakland, 13.6

2. Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs Jacksonville, 12.5

3. New England Patriots at Dallas, 12.3

4. Green Bay Packers vs St. Louis, 11.7 (thanks, /u/lca4nu)

5. New York Giants vs San Francisco, 11.1

6. Buffalo Bills at Tennessee, 11.1

7. Arizona Cardinals at Detroit, 10.7

8. Tennessee Titans vs Buffalo, 10.6

9. Cincinnati Bengals vs Seattle, 10.4

A lot of these teams are going to be taken in your league. Most of you aren't masochistic enough to start the Buccaneers again. If you need deeper options, or if you want to know why things fell the way they did, be sure to read the full writeup. Most ""This"" or ""That"" questions have already been answered in there.

Agnostix,2015-10-05 16:28:15+00:00,I quit my corporate job to play guitar full time. Here's a rundown of how it all turned out...,"Hi /r/guitar! 

You might remember me from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/2vblfv/i_am_quitting_my_corporate_job_to_play_guitar_on/), in which I announced that I was quitting my salaried job to be a full-time, solo guitarist.

Well, I did what I said I was going to do, and I'm here to tell you how it all went. If you ever wondered what it would be like to 'follow your dream' of playing guitar for a living, this post might be of interest to you. Or, if you're just curious about ""whatever happened to that guy who fucked up his career to play guitar"", then read on.

On February 23rd of this year, I submitted my resignation. I had been in the business-to-business sales industry for about 15 years at that point, and I was so OVER IT that quitting was actually really freaking easy. The liberation and exaltation was almost palpable, and I still have a crisp memory of exactly the moment when I handed over the physical letter to my boss. He took it fairly well, and when he asked me what I was going to do next, I simply said:

""Well, I'm heading out next week to drive across the country playing guitar music on the street in public places.""

...you know that look that people give you when they *genuinely* think you're crazy? Yea, I got that look. And in fact, every other time I told the people in my life what I was doing, I got a similar look. One thing I learned though, is that there was a small handful of people who *didn't* give me that look; instead they beamed a HUGE smile and said, ""WHOAH!! That's fucking AWESOME!!"". 

Those people happened to be my truest friends. This would be just one of the valuable lessons I would learn over the next few months. 

If you look at my post history, you'll see that I traveled around the US a fair amount. I played music on the street in the following cities:

Taos, NM

Santa Fe, NM

Albuquerque, NM

Phoenix, AZ

San Diego, CA

Santa Monica, CA

Venice Beach, CA

Monterrey, CA

San Francisco, CA

Eugene, OR

Portland, OR

Seattle, WA

...and a few smaller stops along the way. It was actually a pretty extensive 'west coast tour', and it took about two and a half months to complete. 

So what exactly was I playing? Well, I'm a loop guitarist. I use a Flashback X4 looper to create soundscapes that I then use to solo - here's an example of such: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bbX9mtkRbY . I essentially took my show 'on the road' and completely neglected my 'professional career' to do it. 

So. 

How did it all go, now that it's over? 

Well, I can safely say that these past 8 months have been the most growth-filled as well as the most expensive months of my entire life. I spent about half of my cash savings (near $7k) *JUST* to fund this trip, which was all by car. Watching my bank account dwindle month after month was truly humbling. 

But for what I paid for in spent savings, I made up for in incredible experiences. I met some of the most amazing people and had some of the most amazing things happen to me on the road that I could likely write a book JUST on touring California. The entire journey was THAT PACKED with remarkable events. 

As I sit here reminiscing, I can't help but get a little teary eyed...it's all good stuff. Expensive, but good stuff. 

I mean, I sometimes find it hard to believe, even myself: I packed my car and drove solo around the country and played guitar music in the street for strangers and THEY PAID ME. 

...they paid me really well. And if some mechanical bullshit didn't go down with my car, I could have probably stayed on the road ANOTHER few months touring the East (which was, after all, my initial goal). 

I want to emphasize the value of doing something like this, because I don't think it can be overstated. If you truly believe that playing music is what you want to do with your life (even if it's just for a few months), then do it. 

Don't wait until you're 40 and regretful. Do it now. It might be a bit spendy and you may find yourself scraping just to get by, but I swear to you that the character you will build and the life story you will create will be something to truly behold. 

...So then. How exactly does this story end?

Well, I got a job. And yes, it's in sales. I found a company that provides a product that I really enjoy selling, and I guess you could say I'm 'back in the game', in that respect. 

But you know? It's been a wild ride. And even though I'm a little thinner in the wallet, my passion for making music has grown beyond measure. 

Thanks for reading, guys. :)

Last week was a mixed bag. Dolphins starters might be furious. Cardinals starters probably smashed their matchup this week. Patriots starters don't know whether to feel good or bad. Those with the Bills and Seahawks probably think we're all a little crazy for passing them up to stream.

Your team could be the king of the hill, or your entire season could be crumbling week by week. Either way, you need a defense.

With little hope, I set out today to see if I could track it down and get it back for her while she was at work. I succeeded.","My girlfriend commutes to downtown Seattle by bike and locks her ride to a bike rack on the sidewalk. Her work does not have any room for bikes inside so she has no choice but to lock it up outside.

When she got off work around 8:30p a couple days ago, she discovered her chain lock had been cut and her bike was gone. The cut chain was left at the scene. She then called me to break this news to me and to ask for a ride home.

She was too upset when we got home to do anything progressive about it that night so I went online to file the police report and list her bike as stolen on BikeIndex.org and Bikeshepherd.org. I also set up auto notifications on Craigslist (Seattle and Portland) and eBay for new posts for bikes of her type.


Today I set out to ride around to every pawn shop and police station in downtown and the surrounding areas to ask if they had seen her bike and to keep a lookout for it. I was even going to ride up to the bicycle cops that ride around downtown to show them pictures and ask them to possibly keep an extra eye out for it.

A few hours into my mission, I received a call for a King County Sheriff's Deputy saying that **one of his officers recovered my girlfriend's bike!** He said that the officer saw my post I made on BikeIndex.org and just happen to recognized the bike when she saw two people walking it on the sidewalk in downtown. She confronted the couple with the bike and told them it matched the description of a stolen bike in the area. The couple told her that they were ""watching the bike for a friend"". She asked to see the serial number on the frame and it matched the serial number I posted online so she confiscated the bike from the couple.

The Deputy then gave me a call and said that they had my bike down at the station and I could come claim it. I was jumping up and down on the sidewalk after I took that call.

As fast as I could I rode my bike back home and then ubered to the station to claim her bike. I claimed her bike and rode it back home to surprise her. I put her bike in our bedroom, closed the door and made no mention of it when she got home from work.

She eventually got home, hung out with me on the couch for a while and talked about her day. After an hour or so, she migrated to our bedroom to change and quickly came running back ecstatic and jumped into my arms.

I've never seen her so happy before so I knew I had to share this story and thank the hard working officers of the King County Sheriff's Office. Without their diligence and hard work, this would not have been possible.

Thank you King County Sheriff's Office for helping me give my girlfriend the best surprise I've ever given anybody. Your work truly goes unnoticed and underappreciated. Stay safe out there.

Our methodology relies on Vegas to set accurate lines, so in weeks where *f*our underdogs r*u*n rampant, our results are likely to suffer too. *C*leveland pulled their weight, but let's be honest: Jac*k*sonville, Washington, Tampa Bay, and Oakland all won in upsets, which definitely skews things at the top.

But when we all lose, nobody loses, unless you were matched up agains*t* Cleveland, Denver, or Arizona (and a handful of ot*h*ers). Because so many favorites fell, th*e*re's a good chance your Miami or St. Louis or Houston defense ran up against something else that fell short.

Otherwise, I'm assuming that Clausen will be in the Cutler, Stafford will be playing, McCown might be in for Brees, and that Manziel/McCown are approximately equally futile.

Best of luck in Week 3!",fantasyfootball,1706

Hello and welcome back!

Last week's top 3 all hit big, which is good because numbers 4, 5, 7, and 8 were all particularly disappointing. Everything else on our radar was somewhere between mediocre or great. Will Week 2 be similar?

Probably not.

**[Defense Wins Championships, Week 2](https://empeopled.com/p/65203)**

This week's top teams (MFL Standard scoring):

1. St. Louis Rams at Washington, 12.0

2. Miami Dolphins at Jacksonville, 11.7

3. Cleveland Browns vs Tennessee, 11.2

4. Carolina Panthers vs Houston, 10.8

5. Indianapolis Colts vs NY Jets, 10.8 (thanks, /u/b0hica)

6. New Orleans Saints vs Buccaneers, 10.3

7. Houston Texans at Carolina, ~~11.1~~ 10.1 (typo)

For the second week in a row, we get three road teams and three home teams. For the full writeup, along with who to target and who to avoid, please read the article linked above!

For those of us looking multiple weeks in a row (or at least would like to consider future equity), I would target Miami, then St. Louis, then Carolina, then Houston. Other D/STs worth consideration for future weeks would be Seattle, Buffalo, New England, Arizona, and Denver. I would consider most other teams to be relatively fungible with the waiver wire going forward.

Best of luck in Week 2!

Edit: Baltimore/Oakland has been posted at some books, but not Pinnacle. Baltimore -7, over/under 42. Baltimore is a much heavier favorite than I anticipated, although like I said, my algorithm doesn't love them this week. The Raiders do project to score the lowest points this weekend however, so we can assume Baltimore is somewhere between ""solid"" and ""top tier"" this weekend. I'd still start St. Louis, Miami, and Carolina over them. The Ravens would then be in the mix with Cleveland, Indy, New Orleans, and Houston, and I couldn't argue too much with any specific order of those four.",fantasyfootball,2607

We help chemists around the world discover new antibiotics, ask me anything about antimicrobial resistance, the empty antibiotic discovery pipeline and the ‘superbug’ crisis. AMA!","Hi Reddit! I’m Mark Blaskovich, the Program Coordinator for Hit Validation &amp; Chemistry for the Community for Open Antimicrobial Drug Discovery (CO-ADD, see www.co-add.org). I’m also a Senior Research Officer at the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at The University of Queensland in Australia. The goal of CO-ADD is to empower the community of synthetic chemists to discover new antibiotics. We provide free screening against five bacteria and two fungi, and are actively seeking out compounds to test from chemists around the world. Any compounds that show activity undergo further assays, and all the results are the property of the compound submitter.
 
My background is medicinal chemistry – I got my PhD in synthetic chemistry developing syntheses of unusual amino acids, and published a book on amino acid synthesis (Handbook on Syntheses of Amino Acids, Oxford University Press). I worked for ten years for a couple of biotech companies in Seattle, a peptidomimetic company developing GPCR ligands and protease inhibitors (Molecumetics) and a company focused on protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors (CEPTYR).  I then crossed the ocean to become Chief Operating Officer at Mimetica (Australia), where I managed the drug discovery and development program for melanocortin-5 receptor antagonists. This work led to a compound currently in Phase II human trials for the treatment of acne. Since 2010 I’ve been working at The University of Queensland, developing new antibiotics to treat drug resistant pathogens and helping to set up CO-ADD. I’ll be giving a talk about CO-ADD and our antibiotic discovery efforts at the [C&amp;EN virtual symposium on Advances in Drug Discovery and Development on Sept 16](http://engage.vevent.com/index.jsp?eid=782&amp;seid=1319&amp;code=CENEmail1).
 
**I will be back at 5 pm ET (2 pm PT, 9 pm UTC, 7 am in Queensland!)**  Please AMA about CO-ADD, and what you can do to help to discover new antibiotics!

Hi all, I'm online now and will start answering questions. I see there's a lot of interest already, which is fantastic. If I don't get to your question during this session, I'll come back to it later today (it's bright and early in Australia now)!  MB 

Hi again - thanks for all your questions. Unfortunately I have to check out, but I''ll be back in a couple of hours and keep working my way through, so please check back to see if your question has been answered. Also, please watch my presentation next week at the [C&amp;EN virtual symposium on Advances in Drug Discovery and Development on Sept 16](http://engage.vevent.com/index.jsp?eid=782&amp;seid=1319&amp;code=CENEmail1) to learn more about CO-ADD and how you can help discover the next antibiotic.

miss_micropipette,2015-08-27 14:59:51+00:00,Revenge assist from TSA,"This just happened. I am flying out of Seattle on an early morning flight. There is a long line at the security check in area. So long that it is overflowing out of the designated area. The airport has provided a person with an ""end of  the line"" sign to keep things from getting out of hand.

So I get in line and 20 minutes go by. There are about 30 people behind me. Suddenly out of nowhere there is a new person in front of me. Now, I am not sure about you but people who cut in line are second to serial killers for me. But maybe he is just mistaken so I tap him and tell him that the end of the line is way back there. This mofo turns around and says to me ""no, the new line started right here"". What the fresh fuuuck? The gall, the brazen shamelessness made my teeth gnash. And I can tell that other people in line agree with me. But this is Seattle so everyone just silently seeths.

Meanwhile, a TSA agent standing nearby witnessed this entire scene. He comes over to me and asks ""did that man cut?"" And I answered in the affirmative. To this he replied ""people like that never ACTUALLY get ahead"". Little did I know his prediction would manifest itself soon thereafter.

As we head to the conveyor belt where bags are x-rayed, this troglodyte is still in front of me. He puts his bags on the belt but they don't appear on the other end. Finally it dawns on him, all his bags have been commandeered for "" hand check"". When the other passengers realize what happened there is audible celebration and jeering. Somewhere out there there is a TSA agent who is judge, jury and executioner.",ProRevenge,1704

They will launch a new DRAM memory called ""FIT Faker Edition"", and to commemorate it, he will be at PAX Prime in Seattle with the KLEVV guys at the Twitch booth!


For those of you who don't know me, I've done several interviews and translations for OGN and SKT in general; hopefully others can verify for me that I'm legit :P

------------------------

The AMA will open on the **30th of August, 3PM Seattle time**. We will keep it open for the duration that Faker is at Pax (30th, and 31st). In between interviews, fan meets, event matches, etc. we (KLEVV and I) will be periodically asking Faker the questions you guys ask to put up the answers. A few things:

* Please understand that not every question will be answered! 
* It could take awhile between answers as he has sponsor duties and so please be patient! 
* There will be at least 3 people who can translate for him, so we will all take turns writing out answers once we get them from Faker. Just letting you know why certain answers might sound like they are written differently from others!
* Please remember to be respectful!

---------------------------

**Any questions to Faker asked in this thread will NOT be answered.** Please prepare your questions and make sure they are in the AMA thread when it opens on the 30th. In case you forget, it has been scheduled on the right side of the subreddit page under AMAs. However, if you have any questions for ME regarding this AMA, I can answer those.

Oh yeah, and proof. Haha.

Economists have studied this over and over again, but I'm going to reiterate one last time--reasonable increases in the minimum wage over reasonable periods of time do not displace workers. It's a big, fat, ugly lie put out there to convince people they should settle for scraps.

The reality is that more often than not, states with high minimum wages [LEAD the country in job growth](http://www.cepr.net/blogs/cepr-blog/2014-job-creation-in-states-that-raised-the-minimum-wage).

kittensyay,2015-07-16 13:02:39+00:00,Every player at TI5 should get paid.,"At this stage, The International is not just a competition, but almost a celebration of the year in Dota. Teams and fans come from all around the world to watch the games, interact with the personalities, and make new friends.

That's why, I think that each player who makes it into TI, should be given an amount of money. That way, nobody walks away empty-handed. Even the earliest losers are still able to show something for their year of hard work.

And don't say that 'A Free Vacation To Seattle!' is their reward. That doesn't pay rent or buy food.

Imagine if each player, upon making it into TI, got ten thousand dollars. 10k.

50k a team. 16 teams. That is 800000. Eight Hundred-Thousand.
That barely brings the prize pool below 16 million.

Suddenly, nobody is a loser. Everyone is able to pocket something. Crashing out early is never good, but at least it isn't the end of a career, at least it doesn't mean you spent a year working and toiling for nothing.

Alot of these teams don't make big money. SEA scene, NA scene. Tier2ish teams. Ten Thousand can change alot for somebody.

I would love to see this. Let TI be more of a celebration then a cut-throat competition. The winners will still rake in millions, why not spread the wealth and help the Dota2 Esport community just a little bit.",DotA2,3399

amzn_vet_throwaway,2015-07-07 04:29:13+00:00,"Dear Amazon interns, some advice from an old man who has been at Amazon way too long.","Hello visiting Amazon Interns! 

I hope you are enjoying your summer here in Seattle!

I'm sure by now most of you are settled into your gigs at Amazon and working on some project the team you got stuck onto has put off for months and thought, ""Fuck it, just give it to the intern when they show up in June.""

Since I have been at Amazon I've seen hundreds of you guys come through, you're all smart as hell and you work yourselves to the bone over the summer for a chance to impress your mentor and get a job offer. 

You are smart, driven, and are no doubt going to be successful in whatever you do, which is why I want to urge you to STAY THE FUCK AWAY from Amazon when it comes time for you to leave school and jump into the workforce.

There are a number of things that Amazon doesn't tell you when you sign up.

You know that big pile of stock that they promise you in your offer letter? You are going to vest around 20% of that in your first two years there.

Now, the average employee stays at Amazon for LESS than two years, so when you do the math to compare offers from various companies go ahead and factor that in. The entire system is designed to bring you in, burn you out, and send you on your way with as little equity lost as possible.

That signing bonus they offer you to offset the fact that they give you jack shit for stock your first two years? If you leave before two years is up you actually end up OWING Amazon money. You have to pay it back on a pro-rated scale. It's not a bonus, it's more like a payday loan.

Two years is also the amount of time you have to get promoted from Software Development Engineer 1 to Software Development Engineer 2 before they put you on a PIP and kick your ass out the door. If you are an SDE-1 at Amazon your job is in every way temporary, you are basically participating in a two year job interview for an SDE-2 role.

In other words, up to 80% of the initial stock grant presented to you in your offer letter is contingent upon you being promoted to SDE-2. There are a limited number of promotions each review cycle and chances are very good you won't receive one of them.

Amazon's work life balance is awful, and it's even more awful for fresh college students who don't have obligations outside of the office to excuse them from working all night. You'll be stack ranked against your peers, so if the rest of your team is going to stay until 8PM working on some project we need to finish before Q4 then you better do the same, otherwise it's going to be PIP city for you come review time.

The most fucked thing about bright young engineers such as yourselves going to work for Amazon is that you have your choice of ANY technology company out there. If you are smart enough to get through an Amazon interview loop then you're smart enough to get through a Google/Facebook/Apple/etc. loop without any problems. So why throw yourself into an environment that is designed to chew you up and spit you out?

I'm sure you will kick ass on your projects this year. Work hard but don't spend all night working. Leave at 5 or 6PM and go enjoy the city while you are here. While you are in the office pay close attention to the happiness and job satisfaction of your team mates.

Read up on the stories people have posted about life at Amazon, they are completely accurate. Here are a few:

http://gawker.com/inside-amazons-kafkaesque-performance-improvement-plan-1640304353

http://gawker.com/inside-amazons-bizarre-corporate-culture-1570412337

Check out the reviews on Glassdoor:
http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Amazon-com-Reviews-E6036.htm

You are smart, hard working, driven, and the type of employee Amazon loves to take advantage of.

Don't let them take advantage of you.

EDIT: Wow, this post got more attention than I thought it would.

[koonawood](https://www.reddit.com/user/koonawood) has posted some great messages on this thread covering many of the things I brought up and more in a very well thought way, you should read them. :)

EDIT #2:

For folks asking for me to reveal my identity to prove I am really an Amazon employee: Sorry, that's not going to happen, I have a mortgage to pay. If you think I'm lying please disregard everything in the above post and read the comments section instead. Plenty of posts agree with what I posted.

For folks accusing me of being a recruiter for Google/Facebook/Apple since I listed them as examples of companies that people could get jobs at if they are skilled enough to pass a loop at Amazon: Fuck it, don't work for any of those companies, go work for a technology company who works in an area that interests you, the entire concept of a ""BIG 4"" that you absolutely need to kick your career off at allows these larger companies with lots of brand recognition to exploit you just like Amazon does.",Seattle,1785

I've looked at how to create a player support organization through the form of a **501(c)(3)** (*charity*), which was actually pretty complicated although that wasn't the most deterring thing... it was more that it would need the community to support it as most players don't make enough to run an organisation and part with significant enough $ to make an organisation of that calibre run.

I also looked into creating a **Players Agency**, which in my opinion is the next step towards leveling up the power dynamic for players (*coupled with a few other things*). I met with some of the largest agencies in the world, as well as several investors and had capital to go ahead with it, however these agencies are so numbers and spreadsheet focused that they don't buy into the long-term potential of representing players. They were willing to invest, but you know they don't care for the talent necessarily - they care more about $'s on the spreadsheet which would mean representing Broadcasters, Developers, Publishers, Tournaments and Teams (*where most of the money is in the scene right now*).

As I'm still passionate about representing players and doing consulting on their behalf, I do actively represent some LCS and Amateur players in a part time capacity - but it is not a full time occupation for me at the moment due to it not being self-sustaining.

I considered working for many of the large gaming orgs out there such as Twitch, Riot, EA, Microsoft, Hitbox, Blizzard, AZUBU, and Razer. These are fantastic companies in their own right and would be enriching, fascinating and great environments to work in, but I found myself always coming back to the desire to be a part of build something from the ground up. Whether it be my own start up or one I simply joined, I needed to be working somewhere fast-paced with limited bureaucracy (*that all large companies face*) - I needed to be put in uncomfortable environments to be given the opportunity to fail, as well as thrive.

I was introduced to a passionate team of gamers by /u/esportslaw in Seattle. This is where I met the founder of Microsoft Ventures **Rahul Sood**, who left MS and set out with the ambition of creating a safe, legal and responsible platform for eSports and non-eSports enthusiasts alike to wager on eSports. I loved the team, I loved the vision and accepted the position as **Global VP of Business Development** at  [**Unikrn**](https://unikrn.com/), which will have me moving to Seattle next month providing Visa goes through (*fingers crossed*). I'll leave the inevitable queries regarding **Unikrn** to the comments!

-------------------
**EDIT:** Wanted to address some of the concerns regarding ethics, match fixing and competitive integrity as they are recurring throughout which I completely understand!

I do apologise for some that have moral conflicts with gambling, you are very entitled to that - I'm not a betting man myself.. perhaps the odd blackjack game or a few bucks on a game with friends. This role is about me growing in the business environment personally for my career and bringing more overall money to the eSports ecosystem. We will do our best to prevent in match fixing working closely with tournament organisers, primarily offline tournaments, capped maximum bets (*would be ludicrous for a player to throw away their career for a capped bet*), working with TabCorp to measure any irregularities and crack down hard on those who abuse the system in conjunction with other partners. If you've paid any attention to CS:GO or DOTA, wagering has created a huge additional audience of engaged spectators which is driving more sponsorships and investment in those scenes which in turn should provide better infrastructure for players. Right now that isn't being done in the most legitimate way and we hope to do that, we want to re-invest in eSports. You may thing this was a cheap money grab because I see the upside; it played a factor.. but far was it from the only thing that made me take this step. If you are not comfortable with it, I'm not asking you to endorse, or use the platform - I done this AMA to let you air any grievances or questions you may have. I knew this would be controversial, I'd rather take it head on than hide from it. I've had long conversations with very close friends over my decision, which some were morally opposed to also and in the end.. I managed to reason with them, even if they didn't like what I was doing.. they understood it.
--------------------


---------------------
**On a side note:** I learned some tough personal lessons throughout this time and the reason I bring it up is to perhaps help those who face a similar situation. Relationships are amazing, wonderful and magical but sometimes it isn't the right time - regardless of how much you love each other and see a future with that person. It'll take some time to move on, but try find strength in it and re-invest in yourself. Happy to provide moral support for others if they need it in comment section (*or DM privately*)!

**UPDATE: Gotta close out the AMA now guys, heading to Soho, London (haven't packed yet!) tomorrow for the HyperX, OverclockersUK and Intel Pop Up shop where we will be doing a fan meet as well as lunch with pros (and ex pros haha)!**

I knew this AMA would be very controversial, but I wanted to have it - I wanted you guys to have the opportunity to throw rocks at me (*if you felt the need*) and me attempt to provide satisfactory responses. Wagering will happen in eSports, by us or someone else - it WILL bring more money into the scene and it WILL further the ecosystem. Yes there is controversy that will happen along the way, despite ours and others best efforts to prevent it - but I assure you I will do my best. PS: My long term dream is to create a Players Agency, that purely represents players and no one else; after carefully looking at the model.. it's not financially sustainable without a secondary income. Therefore I'm going to continue doing it but on a part time basis! Have a good weekend folks, thanks for participating. Message me on twitter/email if you have further questions!

Sheepless-In-Seattle,2015-04-14 16:57:40+00:00,TIFU by counting sheep,"Hi Reddit, I'm writing on behalf of my pal because his English isn't the best, but here is his story:
        
         
I'm in high school on an exchange program (home is Taiwan) and my host family lives just outside Seattle, in the country. My sleep hasn't been very good lately causing me to stay up late at night. To make the time pass I read or watch movies, it helps with my English and especially the slang terms. Last night I was up late watching The Fugitive (great story!) and the volume was just a tad loud. My  host mom asked me to turn down the volume and gave me advice to try counting sheep to sleep. I have never heard of this technique for sleeping, I thought it must be an American thing. She went to bed and I decided to try this ""counting sheep"". 
      
I get my coat, a flashlight, and begin walking down the road to a ranch close by. A sheep ranch, so I can count my sheep then magically go to sleep. I made it to fence but the sheep were too far away for me to count. I climbed over the fence to get closer and began counting. It was difficult because they moved around and I lost track, so I started over a few times. Then I heard the sound of a gun cocking and a mans angry voice. He began yelling at me for being on property and thought I was going to steal his sheep.        
    
I tried to explain but I was scared and my English wasn't so good. I managed to ask him if I could use my phone to call my host mom so she could pick me up and explain the mistake for me. I made the call, woke up my host family, and they all came to the ranch to explain on my behalf (again my English isn't great). I then learned counting sheep isn't a literal thing but that I was supposed to count imaginary sheep in my head.        
TLDR: I couldn't sleep and was told to count sheep. I trespassed on a sheep ranch and could have been shot by a rancher. Learned a big English lesson.

That said, /u/johnparish's comment ""quite a few users on /r/nfl want Russell Wilson to fail really badly for some reason"" really stood out to me.

I've read a lot of misconceptions about how Wilson and Seattle's offense operate. I'm sure they will be repeated ad nauseum in the time leading to his pending contract extension, so let me try to address them. Here are some recent examples from this sub:

&gt;Wilson gets too much credit for what Carroll has created. I don't think he's a terrible QB but that team feeds off the Defense and Wilson's numbers aren't amazing. (+143)

&gt;I think Wilson is good QB, but make no mistake he gets carried quite a bit by a dominant defense and Marshawn Lynch. (+186)

&gt;Russell Wilson is a nobody on 70% of other teams (+671)

&gt;Wilson isn't even a ""good"" QB. (+122)

**Myth 1: Wilson's stats are underwhelming**

He's [#3 in the league](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=combined&amp;year_min=2012&amp;year_max=2014&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;game_type=&amp;league_id=NFL&amp;team_id=&amp;opp_id=&amp;game_num_min=0&amp;game_num_max=99&amp;week_num_min=0&amp;week_num_max=99&amp;stadium_id=&amp;game_day_of_week=&amp;game_month=&amp;game_location=&amp;game_result=&amp;handedness=&amp;is_active=&amp;is_hof=&amp;c1stat=pass_att&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=1200&amp;c2stat=&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=&amp;c3stat=&amp;c3comp=gt&amp;c3val=&amp;c4stat=&amp;c4comp=gt&amp;c4val=&amp;c5comp=&amp;c5gtlt=lt&amp;c6mult=1.0&amp;c6comp=&amp;order_by=pass_adj_yds_per_att), behind only Rodgers and Manning, in AY/A since he came into the league, the QB stat [most predictive of team wins](http://www.footballperspective.com/correlating-passing-stats-with-wins/). 

He needs 248 attempts to qualify for career passer rating records, and if he does nothing but maintain his rating, he'd be [#2 all time](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_rating_career.htm), again behind Rodgers.

And this is with a ton of turnover in his receiving targets (Miller -- injured for 2014; Rice -- injured for a good portion of 2013, then retired; Harvin -- injured for 2013, you know the rest; Tate -- left in FA after 2013; McCoy -- injured in 2013 and 2014). Not to mention Seattle's o-line struggles.

**Myth 2: Wilson isn't asked to do much**

Wilson passed for 3475 yards and rushed for 849. Seattle had 6012 total yards. Wilson accounted for 72% of Seattle's yards (31% of their rushing yards). How does that compare to other QBs?

* Wilson 72%
* Manning 73%
* Brady 71%
* Rodgers 75%

Another common sentiment is that Wilson's numbers are inflated because he's playing ahead so often. How does he compare to some other QBs? Percentage of pass attempts made while trailing in the game (calculated from ""splits"" page on PFR):

* Wilson: 34%
* Rodgers: 34%
* Brady: 34%
* Manning: 41%

Pretty similar to other QBs who have been on good teams consistently.


He's also led [15 game winning drives in 3 years](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/gwd_active.htm). Compared to other young QBs:

* Wilson 15
* Luck 12
* Kaep 8
* Newton 8
* Tannehill 5
* Foles 5

(yes, this stat is imperfect, but Wilson has played a big part in a lot of impressive late game situations. Good examples are in 2012 against NE/CHI/ATL or the overtime drives in 2014 against DEN/GB).

**Myth 3: Seattle's offense is carried solely by Lynch, not Wilson**

Is Lynch a vital part of Seattle's offense? Of course. But here's Seattle's offensive DVOA during the Carroll/Lynch era:

* 2010: #29
* 2011: #22

[Wilson is drafted]

* 2012: #4
* 2013: #7
* 2014: #5

Here's Lynch's yards per carry with Seattle:

* 2010: 3.5
* 2011: 4.2

[Wilson is drafted]

* 2012: 5.0
* 2013: 4.2
* 2014: 4.7

Lynch benefits from the threat Wilson poses on the read option, just like Wilson benefits from Lynch. 

**Myth 4: Seattle's offense is carried by their defense**

Seattle's defense is great, but the offense has quietly been good-to-great for the last three years, too (as shown above, in the 4-7 range in DVOA).

The difference between Seattle and the median team (NYJ) in average starting field position is [2.5 yards](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/drivestats), so they aren't put in substantially better field position by the defense. Just like Wilson+Lynch, Seattle's offense+defense is a symbiotic relationship. Seattle's offense was #1 in fewest turnovers per drive (not placing the defense in hard positions) and #3 in time of possession per drive (giving the defense time to rest). Due to Seattle's lack of turnovers, Seattle's opponents started with the worst field position in the NFL (Jon Ryan gets some credit here, too).

And there's [zero relationship between a team's defensive and offensive performance](https://www.numberfire.com/nfl/news/4251/does-a-quarterback-s-defense-impact-his-performance#), anyway.

**Myth 5: Wilson's scrambling makes him susceptible to injury**

In 2014, Wilson was only tackled on [1/3 of his runs](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/film-room/2015/film-room-russell-wilsons-mobility). On the remainder, he ran out of bounds untouched or slid. He ran 109 times (not counting kneel downs), meaning that he was tackled an extra 2 times per game from scrambling. For someone who is built very similarly to Marshawn Lynch (they are the same height and Lynch is 10 lbs heavier), that's not a lot of hits.

The best writeup I've seen of Wilson is from [Football Outsiders' Scott Kacsmar](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/film-room/2015/film-room-russell-wilsons-mobility)

The short version (no pun intended): he's very good and sometimes downright great, with plenty of room for improvement.*

tl;dr: Russell Wilson is a very good quarterback who is essential to Seattle's continued success (but not as good as Aaron Rodgers)",nfl,1273
celiacthro,2015-03-21 07:23:51+00:00,To the guy I met on the bus nearly four years ago:,"I know it's a long shot that you're on reddit, and on this sub in particular, but I have been wanting to say this to you since six months after we met.

I sat near you on the bus and you noticed I looked sad. You started talking to me and asked how I was. But you said it differently than anyone else; you actually cared. So, my story came out. The sexual and emotional abuse I endured from family, to getting addicted to meth at 15 with a 30something year old psychotic meth dealer boyfriend, to running from him and meth and my family at 17. I was high on crack when I met you. 


You invited me to smoke weed with you in a field near a hospital in Vancouver and let me vent. How I ran from my foster home because my probation officer told me my family choose my sex offender brother over me, and placed me there instead. How I wanted to die and was heading to Seattle, a city I had never been to and knew one person there, with no way to contact them.


You showed me genuine concern. You told me you'd smoke all your weed with me if I'd just go to the ER after and turn myself in. That it would get better. That there are people who care. That I would be an adult soon and this would make it really hard for me to get out of poverty and addiction.


Well, I wanted you to know that I did it. I went to the ER and passed out in the waiting room. I was transferred to a behavioral unit for children, then to another home. Then another. Then I was 18 and have held down a job and my own place ever since. I have been clean off of meth for almost four years. I still have some issues related to my upbringing, childhood addiction, and abusive relationship, but I am doing so much better. And I will continue to get better. 


I wanted you to know that you saved my life. You really did. I didn't want to disappoint the person who had been kinder than anyone I had met before. And I wanted you to know how grateful I am. Words cannot express the debt that I owe to you and the world. I continue to pay it forward. 


So thank you. Thank you so, so very much, you kind soul. I wish that I remembered your name.



Edit: Wow, I didn't expect this to blow up! Thank you all so much for your support and understanding. I do try to help all those who look like they need it. The world would be a better place if everyone did",offmychest,2016

sushicakes,2015-02-26 17:13:16+00:00,Will the Kevin Love for Andrew Wiggins trade turn out to the be Vlade Divac for rookie Kobe Bryant trade of this era?,"I originally thought that the Love for Wiggins trade was great for the Cavs. The trade still might end up being the right choice for the Cavs as I think the Cavs have a great chance of winning the East with Rose and Bosh out (the Hawks and Raptors are certainly real threats in the East). At the time, I thought that Love would be a better Chris Bosh type complement to LeBron. The thing that I did not fully consider was how much worse Love is at defense than Bosh. Love is also a phenomenal passer but his aspect of his game does not get fully utilized in Cleveland because the Cavs are No. 1 in the league in isolation points per game (Jalen pointed out in the Grantland basketball hour that no team has won the championship while leading the league in Iso points). Love is often left standing awkwardly alone waiting for a corner 3 which neutralizes another strength of his: offensive rebounding. The Cavs have recently had a resurgence but I think it has more to do with the addition of Shump and Mozgov than with improvement with Love. Ironically, I think the addition of Mozgov might influence Love to leave Cleveland in the offseason as Thompson and Mozgov are sometimes favored over Love (not to mention Varejao returning next year).

On the Flip side (pun intended), Wiggins has emerged as a budding star likely to become a superstar in this league. We could have a chicken or the egg debate here: Wiggins probably would not have emerged this quickly if he were on the Cavs where he would be a 3rd banana to LeBron and Kyrie. In Minnesota, he can grow without all the media pressure in a small market team much like how KD did in his first year in Seattle. Anyone watching the Wolves recent games with the Rockets when Wiggins was dueling James Harden could tell you that the sky is the limit for Wiggins. Wiggins is 2 dribble moves away from being unguardable. He is already an All NBA level defender.

This brings me back to my question. If Love somehow ends up leaving Cleveland and Wiggins blossoms to take the torch from LeBron and KD as the next premier small forward, how will we think back on the Love for Wiggins trade? I don't mean to bash on Love, I think he is just misused currently and still adjusting in Cleveland but the Wolves got a potential superstar for Love who was going to leave Minnesota anyways in the offseason. Additionally, the Wolves indirectly got KG out of the trade because they traded Thad Young for KG. Garnett I think will be invaluable to the growth and competitiveness (for better or for worse) of Wiggins and Levine (who I also think can be a star). I think this could also end up being a win-win scenario for both teams. The Cavs might somehow end up winning the championship, convincing Love to stay.

TL;DR: I think Love is misused in Cleveland as he often just stands in the corner for 3s (taking away his offensive rebounding and passing abilities) and might leave Cleveland. I think Wiggins can be a future Hall of Fame level player.

Edit: bananabooks made a great comparison that I agree with: the Love/wiggins trade might end up closer in comparison to the Pau Gasol /Marc Gasol trade. The lakers won championships w Pau and Memphis now has an All NBA player in Marc.

Edit2: To the folks reading this and commenting that this is just a Miami fan bitter about losing Lebron: I think it's safe to say that most Miami fans (myself included) are very grateful for LeBron's 4 years with us and wish him the best of luck in the future. My 3 favorite players in the NBA in order are actually Wade, Kyrie (Duke grad), and LeBron. I'm writing this purely from a curious basketball fan's perspective who enjoys what if scenarios. I think it's possible that the Cavs catch fire with Love and form a multi-year dynasty while Wiggins becomes the next Rudy Gay. I also think it's possible the Cavs never win a championship with Love or LeBron or Kyrie while Wiggins becomes a better version of Paul George / Kawahi Leonard. You can't say with certainty what will happen as there so many variables and Wiggins is still only 20 years old. Let's keep the conversation classy; no one is trying to trash talk your team.",nba,1037

**History:**
-------------------------------------------------------------------


In order to bring the World Cup to the United States, the United States Soccer Federation agreed in 1988 to bring a new professional soccer league to the country. The league began play in 1996 with 10 teams in a season in which D.C. United won the opening title. ([Check out these hideous 1990's jerseys)](http://www.dcunited.com/sites/dc/files/image_nodes/2013/10/96mls_uniforms.jpg). The teams were:

* Colorado Rapids
* Columbus Crew
* D.C. United
* Dallas Burn (now F.C. Dallas)
* Kansas City Wiz (now Sporting Kansas City)
* Los Angeles Galaxy
* New England Revolution
* NY/NJ Metro Stars (sadly now New York Red Bulls)
* San Jose Clash (now San Jose Earthquakes)
* Tampa Bay Mutiny (notably owned by the Glazers who now own Man U)

The Chicago Fire joined the league in 1998 alongside the Miami Fusion in a season in which the Chicago newcomers won the MLS Cup as well as the US Open Cup. The following year (1999), Columbus opened their stadium, the first professional soccer-specific stadium in America, at a time when teams were sharing the facilities of other professional sports teams within America.

However, hard times fell on MLS in 2002 when the league was forced to fold Miami and Tampa Bay in order to save money, having lost an estimated $250 million in the league's first five years of existence. Despite this set back, the league continued to grow as Chivas USA and Real Salt Lake entered the league in 2005. In 2006, the San Jose Earthquakes relocated to Houston and were renamed Houston Dynamo.

In 2007, David Beckham shocked the American soccer world by arriving in LA. That same year, Toronto FC became the first Canadian team to enter the league. Their entrance more or less marked the beginning of supporters' culture within the league as the team played to a sold out crowd of passionate adults despite a lackluster performance on the field. 

San Jose re-entered the league in 2008, retaining the name and legacy of the previous San Jose Earthquakes. From this point on, MLS began expanding more rapidly into cities with ravenous soccer support. Seattle Sounders entered the league in 2009 and set a new standard for fan support with their legions of supporters. Philadelphia Union joined the following years and helped establish supporter culture on the East Coast through the rowdy supporters' group the Sons of Ben (SoBs). Portland Timbers and Vancouver Whitecaps joined in 2011, expanding the new supporters phenomena further while create a fierce rivalry with Seattle (the Cascadia Cup). Montreal Impact immediately followed in 2012.

The arrival of Clint Dempsey in 2013 marked the beginning of a major return of American players that includes Michael Bradley (Toronto), Jozy Altidore (Toronto), Maurice Edu (Philadelphia), Jermaine Jones (New England), DeMarcus Beasley (Houston), and several other national team players have returned to the league, with many in their prime.

In the world of expansions, New York City and Orlando City begin play this year and look set to raise the standards of expansion teams. New York City has brought in David Villa, Frank Lampard, and Mix Diskerud while Orlando has silently brought in a very solid team around playmaker Kaka. City brings unprecedented wealth to the league while Orlando seems set to have a great fan base and a strong Brazilian presence. On the flip side, Chivas USA folded this year after a tumultuous period in MLS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Future**
-------------------

As for the future, Atlanta and a new LA team are set to join the league in 2017 while Miami is a likely candidate to join shortly after. Sacramento and Minnesota are battling for the final expansion spot this round after unprecedented success in the lower leagues. San Antonio, Indianapolis, Las Vegas, and Jacksonville look set to battle it out for future expansion spots.

Now is a fantastic time to begin following the league as it continues to grow at an amazing rate.

------------------------------------------------------------------

**Current Format:**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MLS consists of 34 games run through the months of March to October. There are currently 20 teams that compete within the league (listed in the comments).

While there are several unique elements to MLS, I have highlighted only a couple of the unique elements. Oddities like allocation money, the Superdraft, and re-entry draft have a relative minor impact on games and can be learned about later. I'd rather keep things relatively simple for now.

**Salary Cap:** The Salary Cap is one of the most unique elements of American soccer. Compared to European sports where teams can spend relatively freely, this cap provides a maximum spending limit for teams ($3.1 million a year). The main reason this was put in place was to prevent the collapse of another American soccer league. Part of the downfall of the downfall of the North American Soccer League came teams drastically raising their spending on players to the point of financial collapse. With a cap in place, the league was able to ensure teams spend within their limits to ensure financial survival while also keeping down the price of player salaries.

In order to allow teams to grow and attract better talent, MLS passed the ""Beckham Rule"" in which teams can sign up to three designated players who contracts each exceed $350,000. This allows us to bring in big talent. There is the option for ""young designated players"" who are 23 or under.

The Players' Union and MLS are currently under negotiation for a new Collective Bargaining Agreement which will likely see a significant increase in the cap starting this year.

**Parity:**

The other major benefit of the salary cap is that it provides a form of parity not found in any of the other major leagues. Spain is primarily a contest between the top two teams with Atletico sneaking in occasionally. The EPL is a contest mostly between five teams. The Bundesliga has now entered an era of dominance by Bayern. 

Since MLS was founded in 1996, nine separate teams have won the MLS Cup. Only two teams (LA and D.C.) have won more than two titles. Within MLS, your team has a theoretically equal shot of winning the title as any other team within the league. In comparison to other leagues, you do not have to accept your team being forever midtable. D.C. United is the best example of this parity. In 2013, D.C. finished at the bottom of the table as by far the worst team in the league. The following year, United rebuilt heavily and finished on the top of the Eastern Conference.

**Conferences:** 

In MLS, teams are evenly split between the Eastern and Western conference. In any given season, you play each team from the opposite conference once and teams from your own conference either twice or three times. Due to the difficulties of travel, we do not have a balanced schedule. To put this into context, the distance between Vancouver, Canada and Orlando, Florida (the two furthest teams) is 4228.1 Kilometers. The distance from Dublin, Ireland, to Jerusalem is only 4080.8 Kilometers. A balanced schedule is difficult financially for teams and takes a physical toll on the players.

**Playoffs:** 

In MLS, winning the MLS Cup is seen as more prestigious than finishing first on the table (The Supporter's Shield.) Under the current format, the top 6 teams from each conference qualify for the playoffs. The playoffs can be thought of as an elimination tournament in which teams are still split between conference. The top two teams from each conference receive a ""bye"" - they are exempt from the first round of play and enter the tournament in the second round. 

The first round is a one game knockout round where the losers go home and the winners advance to face the two teams on ""bye."" 

The second round consists of two-legs much like traditional soccer tournaments. 

The two winners of the second round advance to the conference championship where they square off over two legs. 

The two conference winners then face off in the final for a single elimination match.

**Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup:** 

This tournament is named after Lamar Hunt, an owner who co-founded the North American Soccer League, was a charter investor of MLS, owned American sports teams in several leagues, and who founded and owned three MLS teams when the league began. He, also, financed the Columbus Crew's stadium, the first soccer-specific stadium built for professional soccer in America. Without his backing, MLS would never have taken off. In honor of this pioneer for American soccer, the United States Soccer Federation named the tournament and cup after him in 1999.

While MLS is a young league, many would be surprised how long the U.S. Open Cup has been in existence. This year marks the 102 year of existence for this cup. The tournament has seen several generations of American soccer dominance - from Bethlehem Steel (5 titles) in the 1910's to the Philadelphia Ukranians (4 wins) of the 1960's to the Seattle Sounders (4 wins) of the present. The tournament is open to all American teams -whether amateur, semi-pro, or professional- and the winner is guaranteed a spot in the CONCACAF Champion's League.

Note: Canadian teams do not take part in this. They compete in the The Voyageurs Cup.

**Trades:**

While transfers are the norm in the rest of the world, trades within MLS are far more common. A team may trade a player to another team for a draft pick, another player, a money, an international spot, or other incentives. The player rarely has a choice in a trade.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

F.A.Q.
--------

(I can update this with new questions.)

*Why is there no relegation/promotion?*

* Unfortunately, it is not economically feasible at present. The fear is that if a team gets relegated, fans will stop coming to matches, and the owner will fold the team. The average American sports fan is used to supporting the best teams in the world at their sport (NFL, MLB, NBA, etc.). We aren't at a point yet in popularity or financial stability where the risk of promotion/relegation is worth taking. I do hope to see it within a few decades.

*Why does MLS run spring to fall?*

* It's the same reason that Scandinavia runs spring to fall. The northern part of our country gets bombarded with snow in the winter unlike most of Europe. These past two weeks, my state got around 15 inches or so of snow. Even in March, a handful of MLS cities are still covered in snow. This would kill attendance. Plus, we don't want to compete against the NFL, NBA, and NHL (credit to /u/hatetom for this point).

*Isn't MLS a retirement league?*

* Not at all. Some teams rely on signing big named and old players. However, others are quietly bringing in young players. For example, my team (Philadelphia) signed a 23 year old Venezuelan striker on loan from France. Other teams like New England build their team around youth. Very few teams in MLS build around aging has-beens.

*The players are going to strike?*

* Players are seeking a raise in minimum wage ($36,500 a year) and free agency. Under MLS, players do not have the option to freely sign with any team they wish when without a contract. Plus, they can be traded against their will. These are the two major demands from players.

*Who plays possession football?*

* No team necessarily plays the heavy possession found in top European teams. However, Real Salt Lake, Portland, and New England focus on positive soccer that often relies heavily on possession. Off the top of my head, Vancouver, Seattle, and Dallas also play free-flowing soccer that is fun to watch.

*Who has the best youth systems?*

* I would give that to LA, Philadelphia, and Dallas. LA and Dallas have brought along a lot of good talent into their team through their academy. Gyasi Zardes, one of LA's top players, came through the academy and the team. Since Philly is only 6 years old, there has not been enough time to see the academy bear any fruit. However, the team has created proactive steps such as building a high school for their players to allow them to play more often. Plus, Rene Meulensteen was brought on in the short-term to, among other duties, assess the effectiveness of our academy.

*Who has the best fan support?*

* The obvious answer is Seattle with an average attendance of 43,734. However, they do benefit from playing in a football stadium with a capacity of 67,000 and being one of only two major sports teams in Seattle worth watching. Outside of Seattle, Portland, Kansas City, Toronto, and Philadelphia have absolutely fantastic support.

*How can I watch MLS?*

* MLS has a list of channels that broadcast games abroad [here.](http://www.mlssoccer.com/international-tv-listings) Otherwise, there are always streams.",soccer,3253

Agnostix,2015-02-09 18:05:10+00:00,I am quitting my corporate job to play guitar on the streets in cities across America. This is going to be intense.,"I am a 35 year old male who, for the past 15 years, has worked a steady, salaried job for some company or another. Playing guitar has been more of a hobby than anything else - until now. 

You might remember a post I put up last year about being pulled onstage with Robert Randolph after he heard me playing in an alley in Denver, Colorado ( [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/206b29/im_a_street_guitarist_who_recently_got_pulled/) ). Since then, I have had this gnawing urge to pursue public performance as a profession. I have made incredible strides during the past 5 years of doing street performance, but I never really had the balls to forego the stability of my corporate gig in favor of pursuing my dream. 

There just seemed to be way too much risk. 

Well, now the time has come, and I want to share this with the /r/guitar community because you folks have been nothing but supportive and encouraging throughout my journey. 

Make no mistake: this shit is scary. To boldly follow the dream of being a musician - a street musician no less - takes serious courage. Especially when I've been so financially comfortable making good money working in corporate America. But I've made the decision and it feels fucking great. 

I play purely improvised downtempo blues/jazz music using a handful of effects pedals feeding a Flashback X4 looper. This is all run into a Roland BA-220 portable PA that can push upwards of 120 db - plenty for a public park, city street or back alley. 

It's taken me this long to find the perfect gear setup with the perfect portability and now it's time to take this show on the road and see what happens. 

My plan is to leave Denver en route to San Francisco at the end of this month after putting in my 2 weeks notice with my current employer. I have a brother there who will put me up in SF, and I have already located some great spots to start playing (Fisherman's Wharf, etc.). After a spell in SF, I'll head down (or up) the west coast: Seattle, Portland, Eugene, San Diego, LA, wherever. 

Then I'll just start picking cities between California and Florida and go there. Just...go there. Wherever. Whenever. However. 

There is a lot of scary stuff that could happen along the way. Then again, there's a lot more opportunity to share my music with people than I'll ever have here in Denver. I plan on keeping a web journal about my travels at www.bret-dallas.com (not up yet, but I own the domain and I'm working with another redditor to get the pages done). So feel free to follow along as I endeavor to do what I've always dreamed to do. 

I may sink and I may swim. I may fall flat on my face and end up broke and dejected, but one thing is for damn sure: when I'm old and worn out, I'll be able to look back on my life and say, ""I did it. I leaped into the abyss and played guitar for strangers like it was what I was born to do.""

If you live in a city that you think would welcome this sort of thing, let me know. I would love to stop by your locale and make music. I'm on Facebook (Bret Dallas) and Twitter (@Cinnabret) - and you can always PM me here on Reddit. 

This is going to be a remarkable experience, regardless of what the outcome is. 

Thanks again for all your support guys.

Here goes nothing! :)

BigDaddyN0tail,2015-01-07 00:01:30+00:00,Hey everyone BigDaddyN0tail here: ),"Hello!

I've been wanting to do a statement for a while regarding the shuffle, and why I am no longer on Team Secret, but I've been very busy with Christmas, New Years and I've been thinking a lot about what to say.

Let me take you back to the very beginning of this team. Myself and Kuro were talking together in Seattle after TI4. We got along very well, and still do, but at the time we were unhappy with how things had went in the past, Dota related.

Talks kept happening and we ended up deciding on forming a team together with a very specific idea in mind. This would be a winning team, a team built to win. If a problem would occur within the team the problem would be solved within the team, if that's turns out not to be possible the team would fix it the other way (i.e. roster replacements).
And that's what has happened this last month and a half.

I have a very good relationship with everyone remaining in secret, there is not a single ounce of bad blood between us and I don't see a reason for there to be any. The decision to remove me and misery for Zai and Arteezy I completely understand, I would be stupid if I don't get the reasoning behind this decision. They're very talented players and there were some issues within the team, although minor issues, the team thinks it can do better with this change.

For the people following the scene closely, you will have already seen I found my place in the Cloud9 team and I am very positive about what we can accomplish, but that post is for another time :)

The main point of this post is to remove any negativity towards any of these players that jumped teams, whether it’s Secret, EG or C9.

We are just young boiz that wanna play doto ^^

Thanks for reading, enjoy the scene and don't make it worse!",DotA2,2632
Lozza_Maniac,2015-01-06 02:54:39+00:00,An explanation of what Riot is doing in NA and why it is taking so long,"So riot have [released a statement](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/AMupzBHw-na-server-roadmap-update-optimizing-the-internet-for-league-and-you) about their current plans for the NA network backbone they're building, but I feel like for the general player reading what they're writing they still won't really understand what's going on. I presume Riot isn't spelling it out because they've had problems in the past talking about something that then doesn't happen / happens differently enraging the community. It's quite clear these days that Riot are trying very hard to deliver on everything they say, and won't say anything until they are 100% sure they can deliver (as it should be).

Anyway, **I'm going to break this down into 2 parts, the current problem and Riots solution**

**The current problem**

This requires a bit of technical knowledge to explain so I'm going to try and simplify this as much as possible. As I hope you're aware, the internet is just a huge collection of computers all talking to each other. When one computer wants to talk to the other, it finds the address of the computer and sends it some data. The speed that the information is sent depends on the route the data has to take. Ideally there is a direct route from the sender to the recipient, in which case the speed of delivery will be pretty much instant. This is what makes Local Networks so fast, the two computers are connected directly. 

The simplest journey for data over the internet usually goes like this: Sender -&gt; Sender's internet service provider -&gt; Recipients Internet Service Provider -&gt; Recipient. The time between each computer on the journey is minimal, but every time the data arrives at a computer, it takes time for the data to be passed on. This creates latency, the delay between a person sending data, and the recipient receiving it. Due to the rapid expansion of the internet however, the amount of systems the data will have to go through until it reaches the target is growing quickly. For every extra computer the data has to go through, the slower it's going to be.

For most internet traffic none of this is a problem. With video streaming it doesn't matter if you have to wait an extra 0.1 seconds before your video starts playing, or an extra 0.05 seconds for your webpage to load. But it does matter if you can't watch the video as not enough data is arriving fast enough. Due to the rise of internet video, bandwidth size has become the important thing. The majority of customers want a fast download speed so they can watch their HD movies, and don't care about an extra 200ms ping because they don't notice.

It is the opposite however for online gaming. Online games use a tiny amount of data when compared to video streaming, but are unplayable with a 200ms ping.

**So lets summarize the problem.** 

The internet is currently built around the idea that Bandwidth -&gt; Latency. ISPs are more concerned with getting 130Megabits per second to the customer, but don't care about a package being able to arrive every 20ms. This is great for online video, but bad for games, because you can watch a video with 400 ping and not notice, but can't play a game with that.

**Hang on, this doesn't effect other games so badly, why is it just league?**

League has over 10x more active users than any other game being played. Every time you want to play league you have to talk to Riots servers. As I said earlier, for data to be sent from one user to another it has to go through other computers. But lets say a middle computer can only handle 1000 requests at a time. This means that the 1001 user has to find another route. Sure the first 1,2,3 routes might all have the same latency, but as more and more routes are taken up by the bandwidth required by the League community, some players are going to have to go on slower routes causing latency.

**Think about it like a super popular city. So many people are trying to get to the city that the motorways are full, so the rest have to use slower side lanes but  they only take another couple of minutes to arrive which isn't a problem. But now those are full, so the rest end up taking super slow roads or massive detours causing huge delays. This only happens because SO MANY people are trying to reach the city, more than any other city using those roads**

**Riots solution**

Build a network across the US only for league traffic. They call them ""Superhighways"" which fits quite nicely with the above analogy. Therefore when a player wants to connect to Riots servers, the players ISP will direct them onto the superhighway which goes directly to Riot. This minimizes ping. Once these superhighways are in place, Riot are eventually planning to centralize the US servers, meaning everyone across the country will have a superhighway direct to a middle point. Meaning everyone should have similar ping.

**""Why hasn't it happened yet, come on Riot it's been 5 years since you released the game""**

Open up a map of the US. Look how huge it is. Riot is effectively creating a Tier 2 network across the whole country. ""A tier 2 network is an Internet service provider who engages in the practice of peering with other networks, but who also purchases IP transit to reach some portion of the Internet."" Obviously they wouldn't be an ISP as they only deal with League traffic, but I hope you can try and appreciate what that means, and how huge of deal it is. **No games company has ever tried to do anything like this. It's making internet history.**

[""Riot Games earned $624 million from League of Legends last year, and that was only good enough for second place on the top-ten free-to-play earnings list. In 2014, however, it's shot to number one, and is poised to be the first to break $1 billion in microtransaction revenues.""](http://www.pcgamer.com/league-of-legends-has-made-almost-1-billion-in-microtransactions/)

This is the reason it is only happening now. They've only had the money to do it recently. That's how big a task it is. That's how much money it takes. It should also make you appreciate how much of an investment they're making.

Honestly, I can't believe they're doing this, I'm amazed. The amount of work this is taking from the Riot team is mind-boggling. That's not even getting started on how hard it must be to convince the ISP's to let them do this.


**Fun test so that you can see what I'm talking about (for NA servers)**

There is a command you can run which will tell you what route your data is going when it is heading to riots data servers.

If you are on **windows**, hit the windows key + r. A little window should appear, type ""cmd"" (no quotes) and hit enter. Then type **tracert 216.52.241.254**

If you are on **mac**, open the terminal from Applications and type **traceroute 216.52.241.254**

Look at how many servers it goes through until it reaches Riot... and look at the latency while it does it. With this new infrastructure you'd only go through a couple of servers before you hit Riots server



**EDIT: Confirmation from Riot, if you don't understand what this means, read my post**

""So building a network is exactly what we are doing. We have leased circuits from Level3, Zayo, and CenturyLink, we have bought Routers from Juniper and Alcatel-Lucent, and we built and are operating POPs (Point of Presence) Equinix and Zayo locations across the country. The backbone is up in New York, Chicago, Seattle and San Jose. And we are bringing on LAX, Dallas, Atlanta and DC in the next month or two.
The Backbone is actually up, the hard part is the peering with the ISPs and route balancing. We now peer with Comcast, Charter, Shaw, Telus, and we are in negotiations with Time Warner Cable, Verizon, Cox Communications, CenturyLink, and many other ISPs.

The holidays have slowed us down a bit, but we are working to have the whole infrastructure finished by March 31st of this year.

The take away is that this is real, and we are moving as fast as we can.""

**EDIT 2: Whoaaaaa thanks for gold! Time to work out what this does...**

Most questions that are being posted now have already been asked / answered so please look through the comments before posting, especially about east coast. If I see that it is a new question, then I'll happily answer it however! There's also some great comments from other people that explain packet loss etc., so make sure you look around!

thegrandplatypus,2015-01-05 22:52:44+00:00,TIFU by starting a serious dildo fire,"My wife and I had a minor argument last night, so I figured I'd start the day on a positive note. Get some cleaning done, tidy up around the house, make everything extra nice while she relaxes. Among other things that needed cleaning, we had several sex toys (silicone dildos) that we'd neglected to attend to. Wanting to be thorough, I brought these downstairs, set them in a small pot of water to boil (element on MAX setting), and headed upstairs for a moment to call my dad and wish him well. Quick convo with my dad turns into an involved talk with mom and dad, and about 15-20 minutes later, suddenly my smoke alarm is loudly going off. Having completely forgotten about the dildo boil, I casually get up and prepare to disarm the ""false alarm"" taking place in my house... until a huge waft of black, inky smoke winds its way around the bedroom door. I immediately think ""WHAT IN THE EVER LIVING HELL IS BURNING"" and at the same time hear my wife scream ""&amp;lt;MY NAME&gt; WHAT THE FUCK?!?!?!"". I rush downstairs into a kitchen billowing disgusting, black smoke, and see a massive pillar of flame exploding upwards out of the tiny pot, which by now has been boiling dry for probably a few minutes. Wife is panicky, trying to activate the (luckily right at hand) fire extinguisher, failing with it, hands it to me and I finally manage to blast the noxious dildo blaze with the entire contents of the extinguisher.

Set the scene for you... Entire house is blanketed in a disgusting, probably highly toxic smog of burnt silicone, with tiny pieces of chemical ash over everything in the kitchen... I put on two surgical masks and run upstairs to open the windows -- dumb move in retrospect, could've passed out up there and totally died -- but at least this averts everything in our upstairs being ruined by dildo smog.

TL;DR: Tried to ""helpfully clean"" by sanitizing some sex toys; turned them into a roaring hellish blaze spewing chemical toxins. 

UPDATE 1: Placed on my back porch the charred remains of the two dildos and partially melted saucepan (which, by the way, appears to have thrown T-1000-like liquified metal over various parts of the kitchen when I extinguished it). Probably a squirrel picked one of these barely recognizable sex toys and moved it a few feet, at which point it discarded it. Not the tastiest thing they've ever tasted I'm sure...

UPDATE 2: WOWzers. 2500+ upvotes. Thanks Redditors! Glad something positive came out of the Dildolation of Smog.

UPDATE 3: Unreal! Story retold via ""The Men's Room"" at 5pm on Jan 6th, 99.9 KISW FM Seattle!

UPDATE 4: Ummm... apparently a lot of people enjoyed this story, because it's since been featured on Vice, Jezebel, and BroBible among others, as well as various radio stations across the US and Canada.",tifu,3072

UnicornOnTheCobb,2015-01-02 12:32:55+00:00,I fucking earned it.,"I was a precocious kid, growing up. My father is an Electrical Engineering PhD from an Ivy-League university, and he recognized from an early age that I was bored by the public educational system. He worked hard to share with me his love for science and engineering. Together we built rockets and radios, a catapult and a treehouse, and conducted science experiments too numerous to count. I loved it more than anything.

My mother, though, is another story. She isn't dumb. Not by a long shot. What she is, as I learned far too late in life, is mentally ill and abusive. Borderline personality disorder is a type of antisocial personality disorder (psychopathy) that causes the affected to lack a basic human capacity for empathy. BPD individuals are gregarious and outgoing, so long as they are getting what they want. When they aren't, the facade drops in an instant and you become their most hated enemy. They are manipulative and cruel. And worst of all, it is genetically transferable.

I have a sister, and she inherited the same illness. I won't go into too much detail, but after my parents divorce when I was 10, my life became worse and worse. My father is codependent to a fault, and would almost always acquiesce to her insane demands and placate her. Even after their divorce he continued to do this even though she was clearly out for blood. In the absence of her ex, she turned her abuse towards me, attempting to isolate me from my friends, and forcing me labour around the house. Nothing I did was ever enough for her and she took every opportunity to berate and belittle me.

It all came to a head when she and my sister corroborated to accuse my father of molesting her as a child. They wanted even more money than the already generous alimony and child support they were receiving. She claimed that she had brought back memories of being sodemized by him when she was about 8. He passed a polygraph test saying that he did not. They brought a court case against him, and even though he was never brought up on criminal charges, it was enough to destroy his reputation in the community and it tore my family apart.

I was caught in the middle of all this, and the court cases took almost two years to be resolved. In that time my world was torn apart. I became extremely depressed and almost suicidal. I couldn't focus in school and began to fail out even after being prescribed antidepressants and ADHD meds. The hardest thing I've ever had to do was convincing my father to sever ties with his ex wife and daughter in order to save what was left of his family.

I graduated high school (just barely) in 2010. That spring, I began to see a family practice doctor that managed to completely turn my life around. She was raped and abused for her entire childhood and early adult life. She had, after years of intense therapy, been able to recover and put herself through med school while in her 30's with an infant daughter from a failed marriage. She recognized that I too was suffering from PTSD (albeit to a lesser degree), and has worked with me over the last few years to get through it.

I took two years off between high school and college in order to recover from that ordeal. I had once dreamed of attending an Ivy League school like my father, but my depression had destroyed my GPA and hurt my SAT scores immensely. After a year of intensive therapy, I forced myself to reapply myself to academics and managed to improve my SAT score by 200 points. It was good, but paired with my mediocre grades still prohibited me from attending a school of my dreams. Nonetheless, I was accepted into one of the top-50 engineering schools, and two years after graduating high school I enrolled.

I figured, if I could no longer be the smartest person in the room, I could at least be the hardest working. I aced all of my courses (computer science), and worked hard to develop my skills outside of class, too. My first year I got an internship at a small animation company in LA. This year I worked at a large tech company in Seattle. And recently I was offered a job at Google. I've realized that now I not only have regained much of my intellect, but have a work ethic to boot.

I'm writing this from a little cafe in Copenhagen where I'm vacationing before moving to the Bay Area for my internship. And for the first time in many years, I am truly happy. One of the hardest things for me to stomach is people accusing me of getting where I am because I'm ""so smart"". No, motherfucker, I earned this shit. I went through hell to get here and I am never looking back.

Some of are lucky to have clinched the playoffs. Some of us have actually started our single-elimination tournament. Still others are hoping that this can be the week that they finally lock in their playoff berth. And the rest of us are just hoping to play spoiler.

The Chargers train derailed in week 6, but those of us with the Cincinnati Bengals could only hope to be so lucky! -4 points between the two teams left the top ranked D/STs last week looking rather frightening.

Behind those two duds however, the top 10 performed admirably: New England (11 points), San Francisco (14 points), Baltimore (7 points), Indianapolis (8 points), Seattle (9 points), Denver (17 points), Detroit (20 points), and Tennessee (12 points) all scored quite well! Even Minnesota, who was late to the party (sneaking into the top 10 by kickoff), finished with an above-average 7 points. For reference, the average D/ST score in week 6 was 5.4 points.

I hope your memories are short. Whether you scored big or busted out, it's important to focus on the *process* of who you start/sit and add/drop, not the results. We'll have an entire offseason to dwell on the results and hone our methods.

**[Defense Wins Championships, 2014 Edition Week 7](https://beta.empeopled.com/p/27373)**

This week's top 10:

1.	New England **Patriots D/ST, 10.7** vs NY Jets (high floor)
2.	Buffalo **Bills D/ST, 8.8** vs Minnesota (high floor)
3.	Chicago **Bears D/ST, 7.3** vs Miami (high variance)
4.	Cleveland **Browns D/ST, 7.4** at Jacksonville (high floor) (low variance)
5.	San Diego **Chargers D/ST, 7.0** vs Kansas City
6.	Arizona **Cardinals D/ST, 6.7** at Oakland (high variance)
7.	Seattle **Seahawks D/ST, 6.6** at St. Louis (high floor)
8.	Baltimore **Ravens D/ST, 6.3** vs Atlanta (high variance)
9.	Green Bay **Packers D/ST, 6.0** vs Carolina
10.	Washington **Redskins D/ST, 5.5** vs Tennessee

A note on variance: D/ST scoring is much more akin to TD-only fantasy football than it is to traditional standard scoring. That is, regardless of what we have projected in a given week, **anything is possible**. A notation like ""low variance"" or ""high floor"" needs to be taken with a grain of salt, since truly, the absolute scoring floor of *every* team in *every* week is -10 and *every* team has a healthy (or unhealthy, depending on perspective) amount of variance.

As has become custom, here are the D/STs I wouldn't hesitate to drop this week for a higher-ranked choice: New York Jets, Atlanta, St. Louis, New Orleans, Jacksonville, New York Giants, Carolina, Tennessee, Minnesota, Oakland, Kansas City, Miami, Denver, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Dallas, Houston, Washington, Green Bay, Baltimore. Both teams on bye, Philadelphia and TB, can be safely dropped as well. The Eagles may have thrown a wrench into that plan by shutting out the Giants, but I’m still inclined to believe that their success has been propped up unsustainably by their TDs.

The two low-ranked D/STs that *might* be worth a stash are Cincinnati and San Francisco. Both are distressing choices. The case for/against Cincinnati is made on site, so please be sure to read that. However, San Francisco now gets the Broncos in Denver and then their bye week. Especially since they now may be missing three of their ""on paper"" starting LBs, I think it will be very difficult to justify keeping San Francisco through their bye. However, aside from their game at New Orleans in week 10, their schedule is somewhat friendly after their bye, and they've shown to have a high scoring ceiling even without their full compliment of linebackers. Most owners should consider dropping both Cincinnati and San Francisco.

New England should be owned in 100% of leagues, and by the time week 7 kicks off on Sunday, so should Buffalo. In case you're *still* not sold on Buffalo, the Bills get their first crack at the Jets in week 8.

Seattle should still probably be held across the board, though it's important to note that a D/ST TD kept them afloat in week 6. Their upcoming schedule through week 12 looks excellent: @STL, @CAR, OAK, NYG, @KC, ARI. Plus, they've passed their bye week, and so make an easy set-it-and-forget-it option that should expect some amount of regression.

I would stream the remaining choices in the following order:

1. Buffalo
2. Chicago
3. Cleveland
4. San Diego
5. Arizona

Deeper leagues can consider reaching further, but we start to approach an average EV with Green Bay and Washington.

Do note however that if you're not able to stomach a high variance play, you should stay away from Chicago. They profile as an excellent DFS tournament play in particular, and I'm a sucker for high risk/high reward options. Their scoring total is a relatively high 23.

As for the Chargers... even with the 0 against Oakland, San Diego scored 34 points over the last 4 weeks. They’ve got one of the lowest Vegas totals on the board this week, they’re at home, and the Kansas City offense is nothing to write home about.  As a whole though, scoring totals across the board this week are higher than normal – in a more typical week, the Chargers would rank closer to 7 or 8 rather than the #5 overall that they are now. San Diego have a better than average pass rush, better than average turnover rates, and that’s enough for a 4-point home favorite to be a decent streaming choice. I can understand trepidation with them though!

**Best of luck in week 7!** I’ll do my best, as always, to get to everyone’s questions. However, I’d like to encourage you to put extra thought into your comments before responding. A more interesting question is much more likely to get a thorough response versus a simple “X OR Y?"" or ""TEAM X? really?""",fantasyfootball,1536

Hello and welcome back!

Week 5 was profitable almost across the board, both in terms of the algorithm rankings and our adjusted streaming rankings. Dallas was a letdown after a scoreless first half and Cincinnati got blown out. Otherwise, almost everything performed to expectation or better (SF’s 5 point showing was below expectation, but only slightly).

Behind San Diego and Pittsburgh, [Green Bay got bumped up to the top choice]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/2i39yt/schefter_signs_point_to_teddy_bridgewater_not/ckyisib) by kickoff. Unfortunately, before Sunday’s kickoff, [Dallas got the same treatment]( http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/2hvypu/week_5_dst_scoring_2014/cl10lq6). That means the recommended streaming order of San Diego (14 points), Pittsburgh (16), Green Bay (23), Dallas (3), Detroit (11), Philadelphia (18), NYG (2), Houston (2) showed a pretty sweet finish aside from the stupid Cowboys!

More-than-streamers Denver (5 points) hit the bottom of their scoring range given how the game played out. Same thing with the aforementioned 49ers. The high variance Panthers (three scores &gt; 12, two scores &lt;-7 – WTF?) made up for their last two weeks in the red by collecting four turnovers and a fluky return TD. Cincinnati was horrible, but we should have only been starting them in a pinch or with a record that could afford it. The Seahawks (2 points) stunk on the scoreboard but played a pretty good game.

But enough about week 5. Ever onward!

3.	New England **Patriots D/ST, 7.8** at Buffalo (high variance)

9.	Detroit **Lions D/ST, 6.2** at Minnesota
10.	Tennessee **Titans D/ST, 5.6** vs Jacksonville (early line) (high floor)

I thought last week’s flow chart of sorts was pretty useful. Let’s try it again this week.

If you have any of the following D/STs, please consider dropping them: Kansas City, New Orleans, NYJ, Dallas, NYG, Jacksonville, Chicago, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Miami, Cleveland, Washington, Oakland, Tampa Bay, Carolina, Atlanta, Minnesota, Houston, Philadelphia, Green Bay. Yeah, I’m still not trusting Carolina: @CIN, @GB, vSEA, vNO, @PHI, vATL, BYE = no thank you.

If you have San Diego or Cincinnati, you’re starting them. If you have both, you’re probably dropping San Diego on Saturday or for a waiver claim tomorrow.

If you have New England or San Francisco, you’re probably not making a move unless it’s to pick up Cincinnati or one of each other. I would lean Cincinnati &gt; New England &gt; San Francisco but you can’t go wrong with any of the three.

If you have Seattle, buckle up and hope for redemption this week. I wouldn’t drop them unless it’s for Cincinnati or perhaps New England. This is the week to make that swap if you are itching to, though.

Denver is a curious option. I’d shy away from them for Indy, and probably Baltimore too. Starting them over Detroit seems fine though. I still think Geno Smith is better than his stats have shown this year to date, though the Broncos project a higher scoring floor than I would have expected.

If you’re streaming, that means the following D/STs should be looked at, and I would use the following order:

1.	San Diego
2.	New England
3.	Indianapolis
4.	Baltimore
5.	Detroit
6.	Tennessee
7.	Arizona
8.	Buffalo

If you’re looking for something viable for 2 weeks instead of one, be sure to read the streaming guide on site!

Thanks for reading, as always &lt;3 I’ll be around all week to participate in discussion and to answer questions, although your patience is appreciated: another exam awaits me today, and my own publishing deadline necessitated writing instead of studying! I’ve tried to answer as many questions as I can think of in advance both here and in the writeup on site.

Edit: Just want to reiterate, I'll get to every question posted in here this week. Just might take me until tonight or tomorrow before I'm all caught up! In the meantime, don't forget to check out my podcast interview [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/2i6wsw/uquickonthedrawl_dylan_lerch_was_awesome_enough/) from Thursday.

Friday night edit: **The line has been hung for Arizona/Washington: Cardinals are -3.5 and the total is 45 at the moment.** Just for reference, that is almost exactly how I handicapped it myself on Tuesday.

&gt;Notes: (no line) There has been no line published for Arizona/Washington. I handicapped this one myself as Arizona -3.5, over/under 44. We’ll see how close I am. I’m pretty comfortable with the spread, but the total could easily be in the 42.5-43 range.

Check back tomorrow morning when I run the algorithm again with updated numbers across the board. Thanks!

Acer1096xxx,2014-09-28 23:28:50+00:00,How Destiny's Content COMPLETELY changed over the last year (TONS of info inside),"This thread is a collection of posts and my thoughts that show how Destiny's development changed DRASTICALLY within its last year. 

It is the reason why the story is lacking, the missions are repetitive, and why there are grimoire cards. A lot of shady stuff went down during the end of 2013 and beginning of 2014.

Anyway, let's start off with what the Story was supposed to be like:

**STORY:** This reddit post from a deleted thread [**Here**](http://s24.postimg.org/eqzaiykes/Screenshot_2014_09_27_13_02_07.jpg) explains how Destiny's story was originally during E3 2013.  Bungie.net user Diver2441 sums up all of this here:

(Key parts are **BOLDED** for the lazy)

&gt;So recently a Reddit thread came to light detailing what Destiny's narrative looked like in 2013, and it's very different from the ailing excuse for a story we're presented with today: the Traveler bringing the darkness, Crow, different progression through planets and even considerable cut areas. So it becomes apparent that between mid to late 2013 and launch, Bungie gutted the story. **Now this is where it gets good, something else happened back in late 2013 before the story was gutted; Joe Staten, Bungie's former lead writer left. Some may think it coincidence, but I think not.** 


&gt;Now the Reddit thread (which has mysteriously disappeared) outlined a story sprawling across a considerably larger solar system, and **including a number of characters and factions who never so much as appear in the full game. The prime example of this is Crow, the character/faction who was set out to expose the Traveler and Speaker for in fact bringing the darkness along with the Traveler, and not the Golden Age. A specific reference to Crow can be found in the above video at 1:01, where a mission would have you assist Crow in looting the Archive on venus for details on the Vex Gatelord (which is in fact a mission we end up doing in the main game, but Crow is clearly not a part of it).** The Gatelord was said to contain a way to access a pre-Collapse AI construct who had the ability to expose the Traveler, and we can see this in the form of the inaccessible Bunker RAS2.

&gt;Even in the PvP, we see a reference to ""faction wars"" at 1:20 in the video, so **it appears that justification and explanation for the different factions in the tower was cut as well.**

&gt;**Destiny's current half assed story starts to make a little more sense when we apply the context that the entire narrative was gutted less than a year before launch, and remade without Bungie's lead writer. Why Joe left, and why Bungie felt the need to completely gut the story of the game and cut huge areas is beyond me, but it's abundantly obvious that there's a lot more going on than meets the eye.** 

**WHAT THE STORY WAS RE-WRITTEN INTO:** Grimoire Cards. ~~I'm currently trying to find the post where I discovered this~~ Check Edit2 for Source, but basically back in February 2014, a man was hired to write all the Grimoire Cards. This was clearly the solution to trying to incorporate as much story as possible with what little story was actually in the game. This also is most likely the reason why there is no Grimoire UI in-game, because it was far too close to release to actually incorporate such a thing.

**UNUSED LOCATIONS AND FEATURES:**

Continuing from Diver2441's post, he mentions:
&gt;If we look at an [article](http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/17/bungies-destiny-a-land-of-hope-and-dreams?page=1) from 2013 and[ the reveal ViDoc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwOUi4JDC4o), it becomes very obvious that the game we have today is vastly different from what it was as little as around a year ago. **For starters there are references to areas such as Old Chicago, the ghost fleet in the rings of Saturn, Charlemagne's Vault, and others that very clearly never made it into the full game, despite being fully made and playable around a year ago.** Additionally, at 3:24 in the video above, we see an in game location in The Reef, and from 3:43 - 3:51 we see a pine forested area in game that never saw the light of day as well. Even in our own back yard of Old Russia in the retail games, we have locked off areas such as King's Watch, the Jovian Complex, and the Seraphim Vault, none of which are even mentioned in the retail game today.

**CUT CONTENT BEING RESOLD AS DLC (POSSIBLY):** 

This **[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-osssAKgEc)** shows that the majority of the first two expansions of DLC is potentially already on the disc! Even in the beta, areas such as the King's Watch and Seripham Vault were accessible through glitches and yet are not available in the full game (Actually, these places aren't even mentioned in the DLC either!) More proof about these areas can be shown through the data dumps at http://db.destinytracker.com 

I want to note here that this doesn't mean the content is actually finished, but the idea that it could be is annoying and makes sense given the amount of content that had already been cut.

**ANOTHER COINCIDENCE:** Along with Bungie's Lead Writer departing for unknown reasons, we can't forget about Marty O'Donnell being fired too. We're all aware that the situation had to do with salary, but when Marty left, there was a clear bitterness between him and Bungie. Bungie had changed, and the lead writer had recognized it too. Was it Activision? Probably. But we're not being told the full story and I don't expect us to find out unfortunately.

**WHAT BUNGIE COULD DO:**

(**Edit11**) NOTE: These are my thoughts of potential solutions to Bungie's problem regarding the story. This is completely opinionated and should not be reflective of the community as a whole.

There are a variety of options Bungie can do to fix these problems.

~~1. *GIVE US THE HELD-BACK CONTENT FOR FREE:* Unfortunately, this isn't very likely given Activision's greed and contracts already settled in to sell this content later. Some could also argue that it's a good thing this content is being held-back so that the game will stay alive for much longer, although I personally disagree given the lack of content available at launch.~~ 

(**Edit11**) Lots of controversy about this demand, so I should probably mention that the whole ""free"" comment was something Bungie *could do* to rile down all the noise. I should have made it more clear that this solution isn't necessarily the best one or a realistic one; it was simply a hopeful possibility.

In fact, I think I'll try to clear it up a bit more now. I apologize for posting such controversial demands.

2. *GIVE US JUST THE STORY MISSIONS FOR FREE*: This is a bit more reasonable and would solve the overall complaint with Destiny. We know there is a story being held back greatly, and we should not let them sell this to us as DLC.

(**Edit11**) I still find this to be a good compromise for the situation. Again, this demand isn't necessarily the best or most realistic one, but would most likely help rile down all the complaints about the story that could have been. 

3. *GIVE US A SCHEDULE AND COMMUNICATE BETTER:* This is my final plea to Bungie. The game is already out; we don't need to be left in the dark anymore. They need to tell us when content is being released and what we can expect so that we can voice our opinions better and prevent them from making more mistakes.

(**Edit10**) DeeJ responds! Check below for link.

**THOUGHTS?** I know this thread is *extremely* long in details, but I think it needs to be seen. The Destiny today is not the Destiny we were promised or the one Bungie had even imagined. Locations, ship customization, a real story, and other deleted content were all things planned/created before last year and are all gone now. Something must be done.

(I will continue to edit this post as more info comes along).

**EDIT1**: Source to Diver2441's post: http://www.bungie.net/en/Forum/Post/70651356/0/0

**EDIT2**: More details about the Grimoire cards and the fact that all of this ""cutting out content"" was very recent.

Posted by Reddit user /u/mrdabu:

&gt;...Moreover, basic game elements were removed - in the developer commentary for the gameplay reveal the bungie developer (Mike Zak, environment artist) says that the hunter could have gained his weapons and armor through trade with other players or a kind of gambling (8:12). this is not implemented in the release version. The video was released on july 8, 2013 on youtube. So the decision to cut these features out was made in the last year of a more than 5 year development period which is very uncommon.

&gt;Perhaps the story is so lame and such a mystery because of all the changes during the last year.

&gt;Then he talks about the grimoire cards which contain the story. in the forum of destiny.bungie.org a guy called general battuta says that the grimoire story was „mostly written and edited in one crazy spiny very close to launch“. (sept 14, 2014) On feb 13, 2014, he posted a thread in which he shared his excitement of being hired as a writer for bungie in seattle. this was 7 months before release.

**EDIT3**: Reddit user /u/PopeOwned gives a little bit more info about Bungie's Lead Writer, Joe Staten, leaving:
http://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2hk88o/spoiler_redditor_provides_insight_as_to_why/ckthwqk

**EDIT4**: Further proof that the story claimed by the reddit poster is TRUE: https://i.imgur.com/Xv02vmU.jpg (Thanks /u/martellus!)

**EDIT5**: I want to note that the demands listed are just things Bungie COULD do to fix all of this turmoil. I am not saying that we deserve anything from them, although it would be in their favor to at least communicate better with us on Destiny's future.

**EDIT6**: More potential proof that the story we're playing now is NOT the one there was a year ago: http://www.penny-arcade.com/news/post/2014/09/10/face-time 

Read the third paragraph in particular. (Thanks /u/JeanLucPicardAND!)

**EDIT 7**:  Another bit that suggests a cut out story was the fact that the Reef was originally playable according to previous videos. Since Crow works for the Awoken Queen, it makes sense that The Reef is the place he took you to in order to make you understand the truth about the Traveler. Factions like Seven Seraphs or Osiris were likely on the Reef but since there was no reason for an explorable Reef in the rewritten story, these factions were cut or rewritten.

**EDIT 8**: ~~Reddit user /u/404Architect appears to fill in some missing information about what Destiny's original content was supposed to be. Since the identity has to be hidden to prevent any legal issues, what this user says should be taken with a grain of salt although *very* convincing.~~

**CONFIRMED FALSE BY DEEJ**
Source:  http://www.bungie.net/en/Forum/Post/70908920/0/0/1

**EDIT 9**: IGN posted an article about this topic! Be sure to spread it around: http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/29/was-this-the-original-storyline-for-destiny?read

Also, thanks to whoever gave me Reddit Gold! :)

**EDIT 10**: DeeJ responds to our concerns! **Source**: http://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2hqmkb/how_destinys_content_completely_changed_over_the/ckvpq6g

**EDIT 11**: I went back and fixed up the ""What Bungie Could Do"" section. There was a lot of controversy regarding the demands, so I tried to clarify things a bit better. Hopefully this helps!",DestinyTheGame,3910

GipsySafety,2014-09-17 23:20:10+00:00,Why The Raiders Drafted a KICKER in the 1st Round in 2000,"I posted this comment in the [Thread about Brady/Janikowski](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/2gpbei/the_only_2_players_to_spend_last_15_years_with/) but thought I'd also make a self-post here for visibility in case anyone is interested.

*(also it makes it easier for me to reference in the future, if I have to)*

**Why Oakland Drafted Janikowski in 2000**

In 1999 :

* This was Jon Gruden's 2nd year as HC
* Oakland Raiders were 8-8 for the 2nd year in a row and looking to ""get over the hump.""
* All 8 losses were by 7 pts or less
* Lost 4 games by 3 pts or less
* Raiders kickers were Michael Husted and then Joe Nedney
* Raiders kickers made only 65.8% of FGAs
* Raiders kickers missed 13 FGs (11 by Husted), 4 in 30-39 range, 5 in 40-49 range.
* Raiders attempted 5 50+ yarders and made only 1.
* Raiders were 9/18 (50%) on FGAs of 40+ yards; 8/13 (62%) in 40-49 yards.

Right or wrong, this is why they took Janikowski.  The thought was that an elite PK would turn 8-8 into 10-6 or better.  Having Janikowski would also mesh nicely with Gruden's often conservative style.

At the time there were rumors that KC would take him in the first if he fell to them so the idea that the Raiders could just wait to the 2nd round was a high risk.  And Al Davis often had the attitude of ""Take your guy if he's there"".

And here are some Personnel items going into the 2000 :

* The WR position was pretty solid.  Tim Brown, Andre Rison, James Jett (an Al Davis favorite).  Davis would draft physical specimen Jerry Porter in the 2nd round of the 200 draft also.
* The OL that would propel the Raiders forward to the Superbowl was basically in place already.  Barry Sims (LT), Steve Wisniewski (LG), Barrett Robbins (C), Mo Collins (RG), and Lincoln Kennedy (RT).  The Raiders really had no need here.  Wis was going into his 11th season and was an 8x All Pro and part of the All Decades team of the 90s.  He would have 2 more effective seasons and then retire after the 2001 season.
* The Safety position was good.  Eric Turner (former #2 overall pick by Bill Belichick when he was with the Browns) was an absolute monster and even at age 30, he was still in top form and Anthony Dorsett was adequate opposite him.  However, after the draft, Eric Turner was unexpectedly diagnosed with cancer and would die.  This would leave a sudden hole in the secondary that the Raiders would not be able to fill until they made another pickup from the Ravens : Rod Woodson.
* The RB position was solid with the rotation of Napoleon Kaufman, Ty Wheatley, and Zack Crockett.  
*  The DL was very good and absolutley dominant at time.  Darrell Russell was going into his 3rd season and he was already a stud and seeming to be worthy of that #2 overall pick. The DT also featured Russell Maryland, Rod Coleman, and Grady Jackson.  The DT position looked well stocked for the present and future.  Who could have predicted that in two years Darrell Russell would become ""DrugRuss"" and his sizable off-field problems would virtually end his career.  
*  The Raiders did have  a hole at outside pass rusher with Lance Johnstone and Regan Upshaw manning that position.  They were both solid and perhaps Above average, but not what you'd call special.
*  CWood and Eric Allen gave the Raiders the shutdown duo Al Davis loved.
*  The LB corps was adequate.  Greg Biekert, Travian Smith/William Thomas, and Eric Barton (Aaron Curry's older brother) being the primaries.  For quite a while, Davis seemed to undervalue LBs.  When he drafted (current Senator) Napoleon Harris in 2002, it was notable b/c it was the first time Al Davis drafted a LB in the 1st round in quite a while.

Shaun Alexander is oft maligned for running behind a dominant Seattle OL.  At this time, the Raiders were also building a monster of an OL and so Alexander may have been productive here.  Certainly at least as much as Tyrone Wheatley.  And later, a Charlie Garner/Shaun Alexander/ Zack Crockett trio would have been very interesting

Julian Peterson went 1 pick before Janikowski but was unlikely to be an Al Davis pick.  There's no way Al Davis would take Chad Pennington.  Some of the other viable potential picks at this slot (WR Sylvester Morris, OT Chris McIntosh, CB Ahmed Plummer, DT Chris Hovan, LB Keith Bulluck, Ian Gold) were not likely to be as much of a impact for the Raiders roster as an dominant, accurate,  long-distance field goal kicker would be.  

Or at least that was the thinking.

Moving forward.

In 2000, Nedney was 34/38 (**89.5%**)  for 2 teams (Den, Car), including 2/3 from 50+ and 8/10 (80%)  in 40-49 range.

As a rookie Janikowski was only 22/32 (**68.8%**), incl.  1/4 from 50+ and 8/14 (57%) from 40-49.  This was not what the Raiders were looking for.

Janikowski would improve after that but was only an average kicker until after the Superbowl season.  He would really emerge in 2003 and 2004 (and had some dips 2005-2007).  The years that he really emerged as the kicker the Raiders envisioned was not until the down years.

Nedney had down 2001 and 2002 seasons (71%, 80%) and then found some consistent success in SF in 2005-2010.

Stats: Male 5’9” 26 years old 162lbs

Before moving on, I want to thank everyone for the tremendous support I received on my last post. Initially I had done it to track my own progress and, lets be honest, get some acknowledgment for my hard work. What I got instead was an overwhelming amount of love and support that kept me going while I faced what turned out to be a very trying time of my life. I am truly grateful [/r/Fitness](http://reddit.com/r/Fitness), more than I can express here.

The purpose of this post is primarily to give thanks. The information in this post was obtained with the help of a coach whom I hired(very expensive). I want to pay your kindness back by giving you this information freely(and there is A LOT of it). I also received many messages and comments asking for updates on my continued progress. I can’t let you guys down! Here we go...




**The surgery and recovery from**

* March 25th 2014 I went into surgery to remove excess skin I had accumulated from being as obese as I had been and losing the weight(240lb to 170lb). The most difficult part of the process was the recovery from the procedure. This is a picture of me [before](http://i.imgur.com/XSjWpJD.png) and [after](https://i.imgur.com/XLGMNYs.jpg) surgery.
* In the post surgery picture you’ll notice tubes leading to a bulb. This is a [surgical drain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drain_(surgery)) this was incredibly disturbing to me.
* I got the drain removed after about three weeks but the swelling didn’t subside for about a month and a half. This swelling looked like stomach fat to the untrained eye(myself included) and caused a great deal of stress in my life. After All, I had spent the last 3+ years dieting to get rid of this fat and now it looked like it was back and I was bed bound.
* In my last post I didn’t show any pictures of my loose skin because I was ashamed of it. 
Here is a picture of a relatively [lean me with my flap of loose skin](http://i.imgur.com/mIFxjAB.png)

**The recovery from this surgery got dark man**

* The inability to exercise affected me much more dramatically than I had anticipated. I became deeply depressed and was consumed with feelings of hopelessness. I thought with certainty that I had lost all progress made in the gym and through my diet.
* Without the support I received from r/Fitness, private messages, encouraging comments etc. I might have taken a darker path than the one I took. So again, thank you guys.

**Competing in Men’s Physique**

* When I was recovered enough to get back in the gym, I decided I needed a solid goal to dedicate my time and energy towards and having gotten my excess skin removed I could finally take my shirt off in front of people. I registered for a bodybuilding competition to compete in Men’s Physique.
* I hired my coach midway through June with the competition on Oct. 4, 2014. This gave me about 16 weeks to prep for the event, which I’ve heard is a reasonable amount of time for a natural competitor.
* Having only started training with purpose in Sept. 2013, I knew this was an ambitious goal but one which I still feel is achievable.




**Contest prep**

**The diet**

* My coach is an old school bodybuilder who believes very strongly in bro tactics such as small meals every two hours and morning cardio. I personally have found great success with flexible dieting(counting macros). For this experience though, I decided to put aside my own notions and give myself fully to the program prescribed.
* I’m eating six small meals of primarily tilapia and brown rice. I have egg yolks in my first meal for fat content and a cup of green veggies with all six meals. Being that this is a meal plan, knowing the macros doesn’t do anything for me but since I’m so macro-conscious I figured them out. The macros come out to 45 fat, 145 carb and 225 protein. 

For those curious, here is my exact meal plan:

- Meal one: 4 egg yolks, 2 egg whites, ½ cup(40g dry) oats, 1 cup(85g) fibrous veggies(green beans, broccoli, spinach)
- Meal two: 6oz tilapia, ½ cup oats or ⅔ cup(120g cooked) brown rice, 1 cup fibrous veggies
- Meal three: 6oz tilapia, ½ cup oats or ⅔ cup brown rice, 1 cup fibrous veggies
- Meal four: 6oz tilapia, ½ cup oats or ⅔ cup brown rice, 1 cup fibrous veggies
- Meal five: 6oz tilapia, 1 cup fibrous veggies
- Meal six: 6 egg whites

**The training &amp; cardio**

- My coach has me doing six days on, one day off. These days are split up into arms/push/pull/legs/push/pull. We are doing weak-point training with an emphasis on arms and chest. Both of my push days begin with a chest movement and end with a shoulder movement. I am working biceps and triceps on my arm day and again lightly on the second day of it's complimentary movement eg. push: triceps, pull: biceps.
- I'm doing three days of moderate intensity steady-state cardio for 45min(walking hilly roads) and two days of 20min HIIT sessions. The introduction of cardio brought with it substantial weight loss that has since slowed down. Before we began this prep I was doing little to no cardio.

**The results**

- The most impressive part of this show prep for me is the constant progress. Dieting on my own program I will sometimes stop seeing progress and then attribute the lack of progress to something outside of my control. With another person handling my diet and training, we have a more objective look and thus we break through any plateau very quickly.
- I started this cut hovering right below 180lbs. In this picture, I had already begun the diet two weeks prior. [Here I am 175lbs] (http://i.imgur.com/OSxwa6n.jpg)
- In the last picture (175lbs) I was roughly 10% body fat according to caliper testing. I was pretty lean already. [This is me at 165lbs(6% bodyfat) after five more weeks of dieting] (http://i.imgur.com/34KiTFB.jpg).
- Only two weeks have passed since the last image(165lb). [Here I am today at 162lb] (http://i.imgur.com/D15qGfC.jpg).

Bonus: [picture of my scar](http://i.imgur.com/QGRudO6.jpg)



**Routine and lifts**

- The combination of taking time off to recover from surgery and then going into a cut has taken a toll on my strength. I’m not focused too much on moving these numbers at the moment. Per my coaches instructions: I am exercising my muscles, not annihilating them. This strategy is becoming more important as I get leaner and lower calorie in order to reduce risk of injury.

[My current routine as prescribed by my coach](http://i.imgur.com/RETZq1B.png)

My numbers:

Squat: 295lb 1-3 rep max

Bench: 225lb 1 rep max

Dead: 365lb (unwilling to test max)

OHP: 135lb 1 rep max



.



**I’m still clean and sober and I’m still stupid happy :-)**. The things I’ve achieved in this journey, freedom from obesity and drug addiction, have shown me that I am capable of great things. The only thing ever holding me back is me. When I allow myself to live in fear of the unknown I become paralyzed. The hardest part is just getting started, after that the rest is easy. Dedicating my life to health and wellness is what I needed to recover from obesity and drug/alcohol dependence. By no means am I fully recovered. Everyday I struggle with urges to binge on unhealthy foods or ingest illicit substances. The difference is, now I’m able to recognize that all those things, whether cupcakes or vodka, are just an attempt by myself to change the way I feel using something outside of me. The happiness I’ve found has all come from things I’ve done for myself, not to myself.



Thanks again for this r/Fitness

quickonthedrawl,2014-09-16 13:46:51+00:00,"Week 3 D/ST Scoring, 2014","Hello and welcome back!

Week 2 was a bloodbath on both sides of the ball. Torn ligaments, dislocated joints, and miscellaneous maladies plagues the NFL all weekend. However, picking the right D/ST helped turn our trash into treasure, so let's dive right into week 3.

**[Defense Wins Championships, 2014 Edition Week 3](https://beta.empeopled.com/p/26694)**

{ [Week 1](https://beta.empeopled.com/p/26375) | [Week 2](https://beta.empeopled.com/p/26558) | [Week 2, updated](https://beta.empeopled.com/p/26646) }

This past weekend:

The Bills scored 21.

The Redskins scored 18.

The Ravens scored 12.

FantasyPros consensus had those three teams ranked at #15, #19, and #16. **Here, they were ranked #6, #3, and #9, respectively.** Of course, it's not without pitfalls: my algorithm vastly underrated Arizona in particular, even after correcting for the line movements.

**Where does that leave us in week 3?**

o If you find yourself with any of the following D/STs on the roster, you can probably check out of this thread for the week and come back for week 4: Carolina, New England, Cincinnati.

o If you hopped on Houston last week, you're about to enter week 2 of their brilliant three-week stretch. Enjoy it while you can! A road game in Dallas is coming up once it's all over.

o Last week's darling, Washington, can safely be dropped across the board.

o Arizona and San Francisco are both tricky. I clearly underrated the Cardinals last week, and I'm starting to come around on them - I'm not ready to crown them as studs quite yet, but they're definitely not the duds I had them pegged for on draft day. However, it's safe to say I was wrong last week about them. With a week 4 bye though, they can either be kept or dropped now without much regret either way. SF, for their part, can still probably be kept and started (as in weeks 1 and 2) at a slight loss of EV.

o I'd order my streaming targets as follows: Houston, then Miami, then Buffalo, then Atlanta. It's highly unlikely that anybody has to dig deeper than that off the wire.

o Before anybody asks, no, it's not worth using a waiver wire claim on a D/ST this week. There's so much value on the wire after such an injury plagued week - make the most of it!

**Week 3 Top 10 (please show your support by reading the article on Empeopled!)**

1.	**Carolina, 11.9** (vs Pittsburgh) (high floor, high variance)

2.	**New England, 11.8** (vs Oakland) (high floor)

3.	**Cincinnati, 8.3** (vs Tennessee)

4.	**Miami, 8.0** (vs Kansas City)

5.	**Houston, 8.0** (at NY Giants) (high variance)

6.	**Buffalo, 6.7** (vs San Diego) (high variance)

7.	**Kansas City, 6.7** (at Miami)

8.	**San Diego, 6.3** (at Buffalo) (low floor)

9.	**Atlanta, 6.2** (vs Tampa Bay) (high floor)

10.	**Indianapolis, 6.1** (at Jacksonville)

A final note on bye weeks: In week 4, six teams are on bye. Arizona, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Denver, Seattle, and St. Louis all get to rest until week 5. Each of those except Cleveland (and perhaps Denver) is strong enough to consider holding through their bye weeks. We'll cover that more in depth next Tuesday.

Best of luck in week 3!

First off, I'm aware that if you put my name into pubmed, not a lot comes up (though I did publish on esophageal surgery as a med student...), but that will soon change.  I'm the co-author of the Paediatric Mental Health section of the new edition of Tintinalli's Emergency Medicine (8th Ed in press), as well as a contributor of the Paediatric Mental Health Diagnoses of the [Clinical Handbook of Psychotropic Drugs for Children and Adolescents.](http://www.hogrefe.com/program/clinical-handbook-of-psychotropic-drugs-for-children-and-adolescents.html)   This year and the next I will be publishing some studies and review articles, on mental health utilization in paediatric emergency departments, Q-T prolongation in children on psychotropic medications, and the use of a new tool to assist emergency physician in navigating mental health cases.

My current positions:

* Director of Continuing Education, BC Mental Health and Substance Use Services
* Chief Medical Information Officer, BC Children's/Women's/Mental Health and Substance Use Services
* Clinical Assistant Professor, Department of Psychiatry, University of British Columbia

I speak internationally on the following subjects: Suicide and Suicide Risk Assessment, Suicide Contagion, Paediatric Emergency Psychiatry, Video Games and Violence, Video Game/Technology Addiction, and Bullying/Cyberbullying.  My audiences range from small parent/patient groups, physicians rounds, health conferences, and (my favourite) Penny Arcade Expo, where I get to both present AND get my geek on.

**Because today is World Suicide Prevention Day**, I'm hoping there are lots of questions about suicide, as well as its prevention, prediction, assessment, and treatment.  I'm happy to discuss any other areas of child and adolescent psychiatry, or my other areas of interest!

With respect to my clinical work, I cannot share patient stories, and because of Reddit policies (and my own medicolegal protection) I cannot provide medical advice.

**Are you having suicidal thinking or feeling hopeless about life?**
Suicide can be a distressing subject for some.  If any of the responses, comments, or topics here is unsettling or triggers suicidal thinking, **please know that there is help available**; suicide is complex but there are *many ways to approach it* and there are people out there *waiting to hear from you*!   Please consult [a local crisis line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines) and make a call if you need to, or talk to a friend or loved one about needing help.

**EDIT1** Well this might be a lot of work!  I'm starting replying now due to the volume!  Stay tuned. 

**EDIT2** While i'm replying, take a time to [recalibrate your senses](http://tylerblack.com/kids.jpg) with respect to ""how our kids are doing today,"" to counter the media and layperson narrative that ""kids are worse today than ever.""

**EDIT3** I consider myself a fast typist, but I'm doing my best to provide detailed responses.  You have so many great questions.  I need to hit the road (I'm driving from Seattle to Vancouver), but I will reply more starting at 5PM PST / 8PM EST.  Keep asking questions.  I have so far loved the questions and I appreciate the moderators for ensuring the ""internettyness"" of this discussion is finely tuned to productivity!

flashthunder101,2014-08-22 09:51:32+00:00,Happy Birthday Layne Staley (RIP): Favorite Alice in Chains Song/Live Performance?,"Layne Staley was truly one of the greatest rock singers of all time in my eyes. Layne suffered with depression and drug addiction, leading to his death on April 5th 2002, at 34 years old.

I thought I would create a thread in honor of his birthday, to remember his life and music.

My personal favorite song and live performance would have to be the classic [""Man in the Box"" live in Seattle (1990)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHZS8S6O4-Y), which showcases Layne's raw vocal power.

Edit: Wow, it brings me so much joy to see so many people who have enjoyed Layne and Alice in Chain's music as much as me. I'm sure this is how Layne would want his legacy to live on through his music bringing joy to others, and for the rest of the band to continue making music. Today has been a wonderful day of blissfully listening to AIC. 

Thank you so much to the very kind people who gifted me gold!

Murklar,2014-08-20 20:33:30+00:00,TIFU by putting my D in Crazy.,"TIFU&gt;Warning to readers; this story does mention the existence of sex. 

Ok so, this story beings monday night at a bar in Seattle. While at said bar, I see a VERY attractive young woman. Now this girl wasn't your everyday monday night bar drinker. she was beautiful, tall, long dark hair, and that look in her eyes that said ""I'm here because I'm vulnerable..."" I had to stop myself from yelling ""DIBS!"" when I spotted her. Without wasting time I run over and introduce myself. I don't want to brag, but my pick up skills are irresistible to Seattle women. I do my mating dance for a few hours and wouldn't you know it, we're headed to my place. We hop in my truck, get to my apartment and proceed to basically eat each others faces. Success!

After a night of passionate rainbows and bananas, we awake and begin the awkward redressing ritual, but as I said this girl wasn't a normal monday night stand. she confidently stands up revealing her stunning naked body, holds eye contact with me and smiles. remaining naked, she stroll to the bathroom turns on the shower and whispers ""you coming or what"". needless to say I liked her. Again, Success!

By this time Im already late for work, its around 9:30am, so I call in and say Im having car problems (a joke rich with irony, but that will be understood later). Now, I could tell this Rom-Com was taking a strange turn when last nights date, who will from now on be known as ""Crazy"", asks me to leave. Yes, leave my own home... I laughed waiting for the punch line, but it never comes. She stared at me with what at the time seemed like a great whites soulless black eyes. I took the hint and decided to just give her some space, who knows what Crazy is dealing with. I step out of the apartment for about 10min and walk down to 7-11 for some coffee.

When I return the first thing I notice is [my truck](http://imgur.com/1GruVfS) I was speechless... Crazy had taken what looks like a sledge hammer and smashed my windshield, only there was no hammer to be found. As if that wasn't enough she then slashed all [4 tires](http://imgur.com/niglRdv). I stood in wonder for some time and then resized my apartment was most likely destroyed. Took a deep breath and walked to my appartment. I slowly opened my door, closed my eyes and prepared myself for complete devastation. When I finally mustered the courage to open my eyes I could not have been more shocked. Nothing was broken, not only that but nothing was moved. In fact, Crazy had folded the sheets, and shut off the lights.

 I started to suspect that this was an example of chance. That perhaps Crazy had just had a bad day and left while simultaneously a psycho had randomly, or mistakenly destroyed my car. I was really hoping this was the case, because Crazy was still super hot and seemed normal. This was not the case. A neighbor told me herd to crack of the windshield and watched Crazy slit all the tires with a box-cutter. he also had no clue what she used to smash the windshield. I never asked for her phone number, and doubt that ill be seeing her again.

I didn't wright this post to help me search her down and make her pay for the damages. I am paying for the damages myself and I'm also not involving police. After spending a little time in heaven with Crazy, and then spending a little money to cover the sobering damages. I have to say, worth it... So heres to you Crazy, thanks for a wild night and a good story!

TL;DR Met a beautiful women, made sweet sweet love, she ruined my truck. Basically a country song...

NOTE; Sorry for the grammar, I'm at work and had to tell the story while it's still fresh.

Chewdzzle,2014-08-19 15:41:55+00:00,Compilation of Kobe Bryant Stories,"Here a list of some Kobe stories I found throughout the internet. Feel free to share any I did not include.
***
**Kobe Bryant and the 40-mile bike ride**
***
Interesting tidbit from an article on the Clippers’ Blake Griffin, by ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne:

Blake Griffin needs to know if the story is true. Ever since he first heard it last July, he’s been obsessed with it.

""The first night we all got into Las Vegas last summer for the USA Basketball camp, I heard Kobe went on some 40-mile bike ride at night through the desert,"" Griffin says. ""Forty miles? At night?  You think it’s true?""

Before I can answer, Griffin continues:

""When I found out about that bike ride, I was so tempted to ask him if I could go next time.""

This is my favorite part about Kobe: you assume this story is true.  Forty miles in the desert?  You don’t even question it.

…in this moment, all Griffin wants to talk about is whether or not Kobe Bryant really got on a bike and rode 40 miles through the desert last July.

""I love that stuff,"" Griffin says. ""I love all those stories.""

The story Griffin heard turns out to be true. And it goes something like this: Bryant told his longtime trainer, Tim Grover, that he wanted to add in bike training to his summer conditioning. Grover researched a trail in Las Vegas, rented three bikes — one for Bryant, one for himself and one for Bryant’s security guard — and on the night before the first day of practice, they each put on headlamps and headed out to the trail and rode.

""We finished up around 2 a.m."" Grover said. ""And we were back in the gym working out by 7:30 in the morning.""

And that’s just it.  To Blake Griffin, and most of the NBA, these are just stories.

To Kobe Bryant, that’s a Tuesday night.
***
**He decided to lose 16 lbs for the Olympics in 2012**
***
Kobe has never been out of shape, but he decided to change himself as a precautionary measure. He told the Guardian:
""With summer basketball leading directly into the season — and I'm expecting to play until next June — I have to take some load off my knees. I've got to shave some of this weight.""
***
**He'd make high school teammates play one-on-one games to 100**
***
Kobe played a bench warmer to 100 multiple times when he was in high school.
In Kobe's worst game, he still won 100-12.
***
**He used to practice by himself without a ball, says Shaq**
***
Shaq wrote in his book:
""You'd walk in there and he'd be cutting and grunting and motioning like he was dribbling and shooting — except there was no ball. I thought it was weird, but I'm pretty sure it helped him.""
***
**He goes through super intense workouts on game days**
***
From ESPN's Rick Reilly:
""Among a dozen other drills, Bryant does suicide push-ups. At the top of the pushup, he launches himself off the mat so hard that both his feet come off the ground and his hands slap his pecs. He does three sets of seven of these. This makes me turn away and whimper softly.""
***
**He watches film of himself at halftime**
***
According to ESPN's Jackie McMullen in 2010:

""He often corrals teammates, fires up the laptop, and shows them precisely how they can carve out easier shots for themselves.""
***
**Caron Butler**
***
Caron Butler says he's grateful he spent a year in Los Angeles as Kobe Bryant's teammate and work out partner. 

""I say that's the best thing that ever could have happened for me personally for my career,"" Butler said. ""To play alongside a guy like that, see his preparation, see what it takes to get to that level, that's why I was able to be so good in Washington because I took everything I learned from him under his wing."" 

Butler played in 77 games in 2004-05 with the Lakers. He averaged a then career-high (by a tick) 15.5 points and then career-high 5.8 rebounds. His free throw shooting improved, too. 

""Work ethic,"" Butler said. ""He comes to the gym 6:30, 7 in the morning, gets shots every day, a rhythm. Afterward hits the weight room, works out in the summer, studying film, critiquing guys, watching their tendencies, picking things up ... Just studying the game with him taught me a lot."" 

Butler and Bryant talk every couple of weeks, and when Butler was traded to Dallas, Bryant was quick with a call. 

""He told me he was happy for me and happy to see me in a situation to be able to legitimately compete for a title,"" Butler said. 

But Wednesday will be a different conversation. 

""You always hear that he's ready to compete,"" Butler said. ""He's happy but at the same time once we get on the court all bets are off with Kobe. He's going to bring it, then hug me afterwards. That's how it is. It's business.""
***
**Kevin Durant**
***
""We had the day off, but they said we could get some shots up if we wanted, so I decided to head over to the gym with [Oklahoma City teammate] Jeff Green. 

""Kobe [Bryant] was the only guy on the bus to the gym, and that spoke volumes to me -- he's the best player in the game, yet he's always willing to come work on his game, so that kind of motivated me and Jeff,"" Durant said. ""He went by himself, he got a lot of shots up, and by the time he was done you could see he had gotten better over that hour. Like I said, it was a big inspiration to me and Jeff.""
***
**The Pandas Friend (formerly known as Metta World Peace who was formerly Ron Artest)**
***
He reported Thursday that he arrived at the gym early, early in the morning for a hard workout,but once inside, he discovered he wasn't alone. 

""3rd workout done. Let me tell why I LOVE KOBE JELLY BEAN BRYANT! I get to the gym at 6:45 am, the Black Mamba is there since 5:30! Go Lakers!!!"" 
***
**John Celestand**
***
“The first time I began to understand why he was the best was in the pre-season. In a game against the Wizards, Kobe broke the wrist on his shooting hand. He was always the first person to practice every day, arriving at least an hour and a half early. This would infuriate me because I wanted to be the first person to practice, just as I had always been at Villanova and Piscataway High in New Jersey. To add insult to injury, I lived only 10 minutes from the practice facility — while Kobe was at least 35 minutes away.

“I am ashamed to say that I was excited the day after his injury because I knew that there was no way that No. 8 (as former Laker point guard Tyronn Lue called him) would be the first to practice, if he would even be there at all.

“As I walked through the training room, I became stricken with fear when I heard a ball bouncing. No, no, it couldn’t be! Yes it could. Kobe was already in a full sweat with a cast on his right arm and dribbling and shooting with his left.”

“You know it was so funny, my first experience when I was out in LA, me and Kwame Brown got traded to the Lakers [in Summer of 2005]. We were playing a pick-up game before the season started, we were playing 3-on-3, and it was game point.

“Kobe had the ball and it came off, Kwame knocked the ball away from him.

“Again [this was] a pick-up game, September, nothing on the line. And the ball rolled to half court.

“Kobe then ran to half-court, dived under Kwame’s legs with the ball for about 10 feet, picked the ball up, came back down, made some incredible move, then hit the game-winning shot to end the pick-up game.

“I walked off the court, and I called my mom, and I said, “I think I’ve just seen the second best player ever [behind Jordan].”

“But then around him, you understand that nothing he does is by accident, that all this is a result of hours and hours and hours of preparation. So that when he gets into a situation in a game, in a playoffs game, in a Finals game, his confidence comes from his prepration.

“He once told me at a halftime of a game, he was struggling, I think we were playing Seattle [Sonics] and he was struggling, and I asked him, “How do you feel?” and he said, “I feel great! The second half… the second half. Hey Prof, I work too hard. These shots HAVE to fall eventually because I’ve worked too hard, I’ve shot too many shots.”

“So his belief in himself… when we look at it and see it as arrogance, some people see as may have too much confidence. It’s really just a result of how hard he works, of how much preparation time he puts in his game. That once he steps on the court, he really believes that he will be successful. And that’s what I think I took away from him more than anything else, it’s that your belief in yourself has to come from your confidence and your preparation.

A lot of ppl wondered why Bean spoke so highly of me last yr. First day of camp Mike Brown tried to throw me in the fire right away. Made me &amp; Bean 1 on 1 partners for the whole first practice. What Mike Brown didn’t know is that’s what I was waiting for. That whole day we went head up. At one point it damn near came to blows bc Bean will do anything for an edge. So he was elbowing me on the low for separation &amp; I couldn’t let that go as a competitor. As a man. The refs were too scared to call the foul bc he was intimidating them all practice. But at then end it was all love. The respect is mutual. Gave me some pointers that are priceless. It’s a misconception on Bean. Ppl think he’s a sucker…hard to play with. It’s just that he expects the most of his teammates bc he works so hard. Easily realist hooper I’ve met. He never lies and I respect that. #ClosestThingtoJordan #HeNeverSleepsEither#ImOut

**Robert (The USA Trainer)**

The night before the first scrimmage I remember I was just watched “Casablanca” for the first time and it was about 3:30 AM. I lay in bed, slowly fading away when I hear my cell ring. It was Kobe. I nervously picked up.

“Hey, uhh Rob, I hope I’m not disturbing anything right?”

“Uhh no, what’s up Kob?”

“Just wondering if you could just help me out with some conditioning work, that’s all.”

I checked my clock. 4:15 AM.

“Yeah sure, I’ll see you in the facility in a bit.”

It took me about twenty minutes to get my gear and out of the hotel. When I arrived and opened the room to the main practice floor I saw Kobe. Alone. He was drenched in sweat as if he had just taken a swim. It wasn’t even 5AM.

We did some conditioning work for the next hour and fifteen minutes. Then we entered the weight room, where he would do a multitude of strength training exercises for the next 45 minutes. After that we parted ways and he went back to the practice floor to shoot. I went back to the hotel and crashed. Wow.

I was expected to be at the floor again at about 11 AM. I woke up feeling sleepy, drowsy, and almost pretty much every side effect of sleep deprivation. Thanks, Kobe. I had a bagel and headed to the practice facility.

This next part I remember very vividly. All the Team USA players were there, feeling good for the first scrimmage. LeBron was talking to Carmelo if I remember correctly and Coach Krzyzewski was trying to explain something to Kevin Durant. On the right side of the practice facility was Kobe by himself shooting jumpers. And this is how our next conversation went — I went over to him, patted him on the back and said, “Good work this morning.”

“Huh?”

“Like, the conditioning. Good work.”

“Oh. Yeah, thanks Rob. I really appreciate it.”

“So when did you finish?”

“Finish what?”

“Getting your shots up. What time did you leave the facility?”

“Oh just now. I wanted 800 makes so yeah, just now.”

My jaw dropped. Mother of holy God. It was then that I realized that there’s no surprise to why he’s been as effective as he was last season. Every story about his dedication, every quote that he’s said about hard work all came together and hit me like a train. It’s no surprise to me now that he’s dunking on players ten years younger than him and it wasn’t a surprise to me earlier this year when he led the league in scoring.

**Excerpt from Shaq Uncut (/u/teenageboy69)**
***
""Kobe stands up and goes face-to-face with me and says, ""You always said you're my big brother, you'd do anything for me, and then this Colorado thing happens and you never even called me."" I did call him. ... So here we are now, and we find out he really was hurt that we didn't stand behind him. That was something new. I didn't think he gave a rat's ass about us either way. ""Well, I thought you'd publicly support me, at least,"" Kobe said. ""You're supposed to be my friend."" Brian Shaw chimed in with ""Kobe, why would you think that? Shaq had all these parties and you never showed up for any of them. We invited you to dinner on the road and you didn't come. Shaq invited you to his wedding and you weren't there. Then you got married and didn't invite any of us. And now you are in the middle of this problem, this sensitive situation, and now you want all of us to step up for you. We don't even know you."" ...

**Kobe Goes to the Movies (from Lee Jenkins/SI) (/u/ij_reilly)**
***
Years ago, upon returning from the horror flick Saw II, Bryant described for Lakers trainer Gary Vitti a scene in which a victim awakens to find a contraption locked around his neck lined with nails pointed at his head. A videotape explains that the victim can unlock the device with a key, but it has been surgically implanted behind his right eye, and he can only extract it with a scalpel. He has a minute before it closes over his face and kills him. ""I think I could get that key,"" Bryant said.

**SHAQ (/u/johnazoidberg-)**
***
He was so young and so immature in some ways, but I can tell you this: everything Kobe is doing now, he told me all the way back then he was going to do it. We were sitting on the bus once and he told me, ""I'm going to be the number one scorer for the Lakers, I'm going to win five or six championships, and I'm going to be the best player in the game."" I was like, ""Okay, whatever."" Then he looked me right in the eye and said, ""I'm going to be the Will Smith of the NBA.""
***
**Dawgs**
***
Kobe is a scientific dawg. He works out every day, practices every day. Most of the other stars are just dawgs, not scientific dawgs. 

Me, I’m a freak-of-nature dawg because of my size. LeBron could be a scientific dawg like Kobe, but he’s not, he's got a lot going on like I did, so that’s preventing him from being one.

What are your thoughts on Kobe? 

I thought you'd never ask. We'll be on the plane, playing cards. Kobe will walk up, stop the game and say, ""Ron, come to the back of the plane."" Then, he'll show me some tape and say, ""Look at this. Here's what you need to do."" I'll go back to my seat, and then he'll walk up to Shannon Brown, stop the card game and do the same thing. And it doesn't matter if you're sleeping. He'll wake you up and show you things you've never thought about. He puts so much time and passion into the game. I have no problem following somebody who's worth being followed, who works as hard as me. I will follow Kobe anywhere.

**Pre-Match Preamble:**

&gt;If ever there was a makeshift rivalry, this has got to be one. Born of two fixtures from each of the last two World Cups, ""USA vs. Ghana"" is certainly an interesting, heated series of coincidences. 

&gt;With Ghana defeating the United States 2-1 in Germany 2006 in the group stages, a game which effectively determined which of the two would advance from Group E, and then once again triumphing over the Yanks in another 2-1 victory, this time in the Round of 16 and in Extra Time to boot, the US are out for revenge.

&gt;The Africans are headlined by captain, co-leading scorer on the team of all time and Al-Ain forward Asamoah Gyan, Schalke's Kevin Prince-Boateng, and AC Milan's two Ghanaian midfielders, Sulley Muntari and Michael Essien. 

&gt;The Americans will be touting Everton Goalkeeper Tim Howard, Toronto FC midfielder Michael Bradley, and Seattle Sounders striker, second-leading scorer on the team of all time, and team captain, Clint Dempsey.

**Match Events**

[](#icon-whistle-big) It's Overconfidence vs. Proven Results. **GHANA vs. USA IS UNDERWAY!!**

1': [United States](#sprite1-p7) [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL USA!!**](http://gfycat.com/EmbellishedShorttermAndeancockoftherock) Off a DaMarcus Beasley throw in, Clint Dempsey gets a ball from Jones, cuts inside on Boye, and slots it home for the USA after just thirty-three seconds! 1-0 USA[.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Bald_Eagle_Portrait.jpg)

5': Free-kick to Ghana from 35 yards. Boye gets a head to it and it's out of play.

8': Ayew waits for a dangerous-looking cross into the box, but Howard collects and distributes it away.

12': Beasley looking an early weak link for the USA matching up with Ayew on the US left side, but so far Ghana are running into a string of offsides and crosses into the arms of Howard.

16': Gyan looks in on goal but Howard is out quick and slide tackles it away, collects it at his feet outside the box, and kicks it out of play up the touch line and away from harm. [**GFY**](http://gfycat.com/HardLightheartedHeterodontosaurus)

18': Ghana really favoring that in-swinger from the right offensive flank and they seem to be trying to dial it in.

19': Fabian Johnson with a really good ball in on the ground for Jozy Altidore but he's blocked by two Ghanaian defenders. The US was almost up 2 in 20 minutes there.

21': Jozy Altidore gets a long ball from Michael Bradley down the line, but the big American pulls up short with what looks to be a hamstring injury. He's stretchered off, and Johannsson looks to be coming on.

23': [](#icon-up-big) Aron Johannsson [](#icon-down-big) Jozy Altidore

25': Ayew with a tackle from behind on Kyle Beckerman. He gets absolutely no ball but the referee, likely not wanting to open the yellow-card-floodgate, gives Ayew a talk-to instead of a booking. 

29': Kyle Beckerman fouls Atsu on the edge of the 18, pretty blatantly so, but the referee chooses not to give the foul for some reason, despite being 5 yards from the incident. No advantage was played either. [**GFY**](http://gfycat.com/DeafeningGreedyAsiantrumpetfish)

31': Beckerman and Rabiu go up for a 50/50 ball and Beckerman comes out of it worse, on the ground from an accidental elbow to the face. Remarkably so, the referee extends Rabiu a [](//#yellow) yellow card. Strange few minutes of officiating.

33': Gyan with a RIP from 18 yards but Howard gets over, gets down, and gets it out of the way. [**GFY**](http://gfycat.com/UnderstatedImpeccableAfricangroundhornbill)

34': Boye goes up with Dempsey for a ball and tumbles in the air, smacking Dempsey in the face with his leg on the way. That looked painful. Bloody nose, Wondo warms up, but Dempsey wants to go on.

40': The US undoubtedly on the back-foot after those first few minutes, but defending well.

41': The United States counter well after a solid takeaway from Ghana. A cross from Johnson to Dempsey for a header is blocked away, and then a shot from Johannsson from 18 is too weak to trouble Kwarasey, who collects easily. 

45': Alejandro Bedoya takes a free kick near the corner, and it looks to the swinging into the top, far corner but it's not too dangerous. Kwarasey knocks it away.

45+2': Sulley Muntari and Jermaine Jones collide after Muntari's challenge on Jones. Jones, falling, accidentally wraps his boots around a Muntari who continues forward through momentum. Muntari is not happy and puts his hands on Jones' neck on the ground. Jonas Eriksson is over quickly and, as he has done for much of the game barring the bit near the 30th minute, handles the situation very well, displays no cards, and calms down both players.

45+4': Ghana look to be away on goal after Beasley is caught up the field and Ayew breaks down the right. The ball comes in, but it's bungled by the Ghanaian attack and hit in lazily, and subsequently cleared.

[](#icon-whistle-big) **HALF TIME IN NATAL**

    Ghana 0 - 1 United States

[](#icon-up-big) John Brooks [](#icon-down-big) Matt Besler

[](#icon-whistle-big) **SECOND HALF UNDERWAY!!**

46': Beckerman seems to step on Gyan's foot as the Ghanaian is mobbed by 3 US players. He's on the ground for a bit but back up for the free-kick, which is wasted.

51': John Brooks has a sloppy nonclearance right to Gyan, but as they battle into the box, it's determined that Gyan fouls Brooks and the US gets the free-kick. That looked dangerous.

53': Atsu tries to get around Jones and get a shot on goal, but it's well-wide and well-high, so much so that the ball is not even out of bounds before Howard is back instructing his defense. [**GFY**](http://gfycat.com/OrdinarySpitefulChevrotain)

56': HOLY SHIT! Muntari from 18 has a hard shot , but its off-frame and wide. That looked dangerous, but the outside of the boot curve is too much. [**GFY**](http://gfycat.com/ObviousHospitableHarborporpoise)

56': An in-swinger finds Gyan's head and its put in fast but over the bar.

58': A lofted ball into the box finds Gyan's head but Howard dives, stretches, and puts it away wide. The USA goal is being absolutely assaulted right now. [**GFY**](http://gfycat.com/TotalPracticalEstuarinecrocodile)

59': [](#icon-up-big) Kevin Prince-Boateng [](#icon-down-big) Jordan Ayew

63': Jermaine Jones has a great shot from range and Kwarasey is caught wrong-footed and stumbles for the save, but collects.

65': A shot from range is dipping on Howard and looks dangerous but it's held well.

71': [](#icon-up-big) Michael Essien [](#icon-down-big) Mohammed Rabiu

77': [](#icon-up-big) Graham Zusi [](#icon-down-big) Alejandro Bedoya

77': [](#icon-up-big) Albert Adomah [](#icon-down-big) Christian Atsu

79': United States with a great bit of forward counter-attacking. Beckerman works it up the line, drops it to Fabian Johnson who uses a bit of skill to get past a Ghanaian defender, lays it off to Dempsey, who puts a shot on target only to be saved by Kwarasey. They quickly transition back to parking the Freedom Bus.

82': [Ghana](#sprite1-p303) [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL GHANA!!**](http://gfycat.com/LeadingEqualJaeger) A quick one-two with Asamoah Gyan, who delivers a great back-heel to Andre Ayew, who slams it home with the outside of his left foot past Howard, who's caught wrong footed. 1-1 All.

86': [United States](#sprite1-p7) [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL USA!!**](http://gfycat.com/CloseAngryJay) Mid-level, hard, driving corner kick from Graham Zusi finds John Brooks' head who heads it down and bounces it into the goal past a confused Kwawasey who knows nothing about it. 2-1 USA.

88': A hard cross in finds Kevin Prince-Boateng who flicks it in but it's deflected out for a corner, which goes nowhere.

90+1': [](#icon-yellow) Muntari gets a yellow for a foul that didn't even look that bad. Perhaps Eriksson got the wrong angle on it? It didn't look a yellow to me. But I'm just a humble Reddit dude.

[](//#whistle-big) **FULL TIME!!**

Andromansis,2014-05-17 22:51:41+00:00,"Dear United States of America, RE: Net Neutrality, I don't think you have what it takes to be a free and democratic society anymore.","You don't even know how to find political candidates at the local and municipal level and communicate with those candidates, or campaign for those candidates.  You are all so inclined to believe that any efforts you put forth won't matter because Comcast and whatever big business can just throw 16 tonnes of money at the problem.  You've already been beaten because you don't even have the will to fight.

I'll admit it, the big ""movement"" of this generation, the Occupy Wallstreet camping fluffy feelgood *protest*, was horribly orchestrated, horribly executed, and a horrible example of what to do.  

Your generation needs a Rotten Stinking Mouthpiece.  You need a politician.  You need to find a candidate, at least one, at every level of your government.  If you can't find one, you can create one.  Honestly, the biggest criticism of this model of politicing is that it ""isn't easy"".  No.  Its not.  Your ""easy"" methods aren't very effective or at least they haven't been in the last 15 years.

People complaining that poor people get the shit end of the stick in terms of politics and how the richest 1% dominates the political scene.  It has to do with organization.  Here is an example of political involvement cross referenced with income stratification : http://www.pewinternet.org/2009/09/01/the-demographics-of-online-and-offline-political-participation/

You need to, especially if you are poor and can not find a job, spend time getting politically involved.  I'm not talking about spending days/months/weeks at the campaign headquarters.  Spend 5 hours this month reading your voters pamphlet for this years elections, take note that its a bit too late this year to find somebody that truly represents you and figure out when and where to vote this year in the mid term.  

5 hours next week figuring out what sort of platform would truly represent your demography.  5 hours the week after that figuring out how that platform can be adapted to fit the local, municipal (county), and state levels.  Now that you have your platforms, spend 5 hours prioritizing them.  (protip, should look something like : jobs, internet, freedom), be ready to run a candidate that agrees with 65% of that platform.  

Now, find a capable and charismatic person to run.  Find more than one?  Run them at different levels of government.  Be ready to compromise on some things.  

Now, you need to get the rest of your friends and family involved and people of your generation.  You know that thing you keep in your pocket?  It has ALL of their telephone numbers in it.  Don't get preachy.  Ask them about their political affiliation.  Respect their opinions, don't argue, but ask them a couple questions about your platform and their thoughts about that and if they'd like a politician to run on that platform or if they have a prepackaged politician in mind ask them to speak with that politician about that platform.  

Be committed to change.  Don't be too committed that you can't change.  What do I mean by that?  The sort of change you are looking for is going to take time.  I don't mean like... its going take years and then happen naturally.  There is a certain threshold for the number of man hours that this is going to take.  If you're pledging 5 hours a week, that is 20 hours a month, and that is 240 hours a year.  If you can get one other people do pledge that amount of time with you, that is 480 hours a year.  Now.  If you get 3 people and they each get two people that is a total of 1920 man hours annually.  

I estimate that it is going to take about 1,900,000,000 man hours to get us close to the point where we need to be (whatever your ideal.  I'm not picky.  But that time has to be spent correctly for optimal results.)  That sounds like a lot?  It is.  But it is achievable.  If you get 2 percent of people under 30 to pledge that 20 hours monthly to the cause that is 235,200,000 annually.  More if you can get more people. 

""But third parties..."".  Nobody mentioned anything about third parties in this discussion of political landscaping.  If you can get 2% of people under 30 to pledge that sort of time to one of the national parties at the local level then you can pretty much dictate what candidate is going to be run during the primaries.  

Think of it like your generation is Odysseus.  Its going to take you 10 years to get home (wherever you want to go).  Now if one of your generation has already done some of the work to organize a political platform that amenable to your generation (here's looking at you Seattle) then you probably already have somewhere you can report for duty.  

I'm not saying its all going to be sunshine and rainbows, but the overarching goals that my generation seems to be very vocal about valuing are achievable, you just have to trek uphill a bit to get there.

Little things like revoking franchise agreements for ISP, telcos, and TV companies that provide them support for a regional monopoly.  Little things like banning ISPs that are not classified as Title II Common Carriers at the state level.  Once you have the base, for the local, municipal, and state levels taken care of then you can essentially make the federal level your bitch.  

So yea.  I don't think my generation (ages 18-30) has the wherewithal to create a political apparatus, to perform that sort of political landscaping, or to get anything done politically.  Its not a factor of money, its a matter of boots on the ground.   ",politics,2294
TheTVDB,2014-05-11 05:15:58+00:00,Distribute the prize pool more this year,"Some numbers from last year...

Alliance: $1,437,190  
Na'Vi: $632,364  
Orange.Neolution: $287,438  
TongFu: $201,207  
Invictus Gaming &amp; DK: $114,975  
Team Liquid &amp; Fnatic: $43,116  
8 other teams: $0  

Now, take a moment to read [Loda's blog entry](http://www.tv6.se/blog/loda/little-note-about-scheduling-drama-random-rambling-discussing-low-salarys-dota-2) from last fall.  Ignoring the drama with SIGMA, he made some excellent points about how only the top teams can afford to dedicate much time to playing and that it makes scheduling much harder as well.

With TI4 already having the biggest single prize pool in eSports history, I think Valve should look at setting an example by providing some amount to all participants instead of just the top teams.  Keep in mind that some of these players have to take time off of their real jobs in order to travel to Seattle, so it would be nice to at least compensate for that lost income.

Since it's a nice round number, let's assume that the prize pool this year will be $5 million.  Now imagine if it was divided in this manner (ignoring team manager and sponsor payouts for the per player numbers)...

**1st Place:**  
50%  
$2.5m or $500k/player

**2nd Place:**  
25% 
$1.25m or $250k/player

**3rd Place:**  
8%  
$400k or $80k/player

**4th Place:**
5%  
$250k or $50k/player

**5th &amp; 6th Place:**  
5% divided evenly  
$250k or $25k/player

**7th &amp; 8th Place:**  
3% divided evenly  
$150k or $15k/player

**9th-16th Place (and Wildcards?):**  
4% divided evenly  
$200k or $5k/player

**Why?**

Because it will benefit Dota esports as a whole.  Even if other tournaments don't follow this example, there are now 80 pro players that have a decent amount of money that can likely allow them to dedicate more time to practicing and playing.  If other tournaments follow this example, then invited/qualifying teams can likely live off their tournament money and sponsorships without having to work other jobs.  The quality of pro Dota will improve, and it's likely that there will be more parity across more teams instead of having around 6 standout teams.

**Note that the exact numbers can be changed.**  The goal is to simply have all participants earn something but have the earnings increase a decent amount per step.  The numbers I used really reduce the 7th &amp; 8th place earnings in order to give money to the rest, but it could be pulled more evenly as well.

and [Chibiham on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Chibiham) because non-fat-logic is not for FPS. 

**The Aftertaste**     
     
I'm sorry to disappoint those of you who were expecting a Hollywood-esque final twist that Paprika is Chibiham, or that Chibiham was the one writing the stories, or that Chibiham was really an alien or that this was all a big dream, but nope, I'm just plain old Paprika, typing here in my dinosaur shirt and real-deal myopic geek glasses.     
     
[But I am happy to tell you that this story has a happy ending.](http://i.imgur.com/RWGir0Y)      
     
Yep, she's gonna make it.      
     
Chibiham spent the last week in Japan-land showing her parents around to all the places she had gone herself. When she returned to the US, she actually switched colleges to one in Seattle, and cut out the destructive HAES crowd from her life. It was as easy as clicking 'unfriend' on their Facebook pages. At her new college, surprise surprise, Chibiham actually made friends easily since she had realised somewhere along the line that she didn't need to throw her weight around to get noticed.
She started a Japanese dance club at her new college, and Mama and I continued to send her one video of a new dance per month for her and her friends to practice. Chibiham no longer identified herself as 'the fat girl,' but became 'the girl who does Japanese dancing.'      
     
It wasn't the last time Chibiham came to Japan, either. She came every summer after that, and is planning to come back again this summer. Last summer she brought one of her own friends from college around – I have plenty of fun stories to tell you about that time, too. And I will.      
     
Best of all (in terms of FPS), Chibiham is down 180 pounds as of last week. I still refuse to tell you what her weight is, but let's just say [she doesn't need to go shopping in sumo city anymore](https://i.imgur.com/GeTQ1xq.jpg).      
     
The story has come to a close.     
     
But I'm not going anywhere – Chibiham, after hearing about these stories and reading them herself, told me she has a whole bunch of FPS herself from that awful Tennessee HAES crowd. She's telling me over Skype about the tales, and I'm rewriting and illustrating them for you guys. I'll have the first one up in a couple days.      
      
But for those of you who loved the Chibiham story, [you can download the free e-book or PDF I have put up on the Chibiham Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Chibiham). I'll be putting up Mama recipes and mini-comics on the Chibiham page, and update you all on the progress (because I'm trying to get the thing made into a dorama here.... anyone interested in helping?)      
     
Finally, the FAT LOGIC, because I can't make a post on FPS without a little fat logic. This story comes to me via Chibiham on Skype.   
     
When Chibiham returned to Tennessee, she had one day of sleeping in before she had planned to go back to work. Chibiham had a part-time job at a bookstore, which happened to be across the street from a Dunkin Donuts. We can all imagine the temptation.      
Well, a couple of her so-called friends came to visit her on her first day back to work. Naturally, they brought boxes and boxes of donuts. They smiled at her as they came in the door.     
“Welcome back, Chibiham!!” They squealed at her as if everything they had written to her on FB had been forgotten. “We brought you some treats!”     
“We were so worried about you,” said Flabriella, “since you seemed like you were whithering away out there in Japanorexia We need to help you get your sugars back up before you die.”     
Chibiham hesitated. She had not forgotten anything.     
“Erm, thanks, but you guys aren't allowed to eat in here,” she told them, eyeing around nervously for the manager.      
“This is a special occasion,” said Blubette, [opening the top of the delicious-smelling donut box and waving the wafting beetus in her face](http://i.imgur.com/3tXGH8Z). “Or don't you love us anymore?”     
Strangely enough, Chibiham wasn't interested. There was something in the sickening sweetness that  icked her out... the smell of sugar, something so prominent in American sweets, is something that doesn't exist in Japanese sweets. She had gotten used to going without it. Realising this for the first time, she felt proud of herself. She didn't want the donuts. She didn't want the donuts!!     
“Actually, no thanks,” she said, beaming.     
Blubette whipped the box away from Chibiham. “What do you mean, 'no thanks?!' Are you refusing  the donuts because you think you're better than us or something?”     
Chibiham shrugged. “Yeah, actually.”      
Fatterina and the other girls gasped. “Oh look at me, little miss bony pile, coming back all geisha-like! Skinny little wisp. No wonder no one likes you at school.”    
Chibiham made a face. “Actually, I think it's you guys that no one likes at school. And I was only stuck with you because I couldn't get out from under you.”     
“Is that a fat joke!!!???” oinked Meanie Ham. “How could you?!”     
“Yeah,” [Chibiham shrugged](http://i.imgur.com/2EkF1rZ). “I guess it kind of is a fat joke. Get a sense of humor,” she smiled, “and get out.”     
Meanie Ham came back strong. “They've brainwashed you. How come you're acting like this after only one month of them pouring poison in your ears? You're denying your true self! You're giving in to their years of hatred and vitriol! You're not yourself, Chibiham! You don't know what you're saying!”     
Still, Chibiham was not fazed. She laughed to herself when she realized what they were throwing at her, and how desperate they looked.      
“Nah, I think I really am myself today, more than I have been in a long time,” she told them. “And frankly, I don't think we're made to be friends anymore. We're just not compatible.”     
     
The girls snorted and bitched and left. Fatsy Patsy took the box of cream donuts she was carrying and threw it in the lobby before she exited the door. It made a mess all over the linoleum and carpet. The manager came running in with the timing of your parents when a sex scene comes on the TV. He demanded to know what happened.      
Chibiham smiled. “Sorry, I'll clean it up.” And she pulled out the rags and windex from underneath the counter.      
I suppose, after all, Chibiham was the most alpha of any of us. Except Mama.     
      
**The End.**

milkyjoe241,2012-12-25 03:53:33+00:00,Survey Results!!!,"Here are the results from [this survey](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/157ld7/quick_survey_about_opinions_on_nfl_teams/) I posted last week. If you didn't participate, it simply asked you, for each team, if you loved,liked,hated,disliked or are indifferent towards them. I was inspired by a /r/baseball survey which gave [this chart](http://i.imgur.com/ZniXm.png).

Now onto our results. Sit back, relax, and grab a good drink because I analyzed the heck out of this data.

- in 2 days we had 3006 survey takers
- The average respondent loves 1.5 teams, likes 5.8 teams,is indifferent towards 14.4 teams, dislikes 5.6 teams, and hates 4.2 teams
- The average team had 151 loves, 556 likes, 1372 indifferent's, 531 dislikes and 397 hates
- 13 respondents love their team and hate every other team.

""Score"" - the score is the averaging of the results. It counts hates as -2, dislikes as -1, indifferent's as 0, likes as 1, and loves as 2, then divides by total responses. Scores range from -2 to 2. -2 is pure hate, 2 is pure love, 0 is balanced.

- The average score was -.15 which means people were more negative than positive.
- 13 people scored the lowest -1.85, those were the people who scored their team as love and the rest as hate
- 2208 people scored negatively (rating more teams hates/dislikes than like/loves)
- 177 people scored 0 (balancing the amount of hates/dislikes with likes/loves)
- 663 people were positive (more likes/loves)
- 11 teams scored positively (more people gave them likes/loves than hates/dislikes) : Bills, Colts, Packers, Bengals, Niners, Vikings, Browns, Seahawks, Redskins, Broncos and Texans. All other teams have a negative score (more dislikes/hates)

**The CHART!!!** Here's the /r/NFL version of that baseball chart :

- [Sorted by score](http://i.imgur.com/WTPE6.png)
- [Sorted by love](http://i.imgur.com/kZVW4.png)
- [Sorted by love+like](http://i.imgur.com/y0xeL.png)
- [Sorted by indifference](http://i.imgur.com/7Tgmk.png)
- [Sorted by dislikes+hate](http://i.imgur.com/IK6hs.png)
- [Sorted by hate](http://i.imgur.com/kIil0.png)
- [As a vertical bar chart instead of a horizontal stacked] (http://i.imgur.com/MiAVD.png)
 
So congrats to Houston for being the best liked team (by score). Seattle got the most loved. Dallas most hated. Jets worst overall opinion (lowest scored).

[Here's a chart showing each division summed together, and NFC/AFC](http://i.imgur.com/Nzu0V.png)

[Here's a table showing the numbers behind the chart](http://i.imgur.com/cmHfQ.png) or [with percentages](http://i.imgur.com/mUKhq.png)

**The Fans**

For simplicity, a Fan of a team is someone who put a 'love' vote for a team. I know that's not the definition of a fan, but fan is easier to put than ""people who put love"". So from now on the ""Fan opinions"" are from selecting the opinions of people who put love for a specific team. (Makes sense right?)

[A table of fan opinions of other teams](http://i.imgur.com/tdBwH.png) Red = negative, blue = positive. 

If you don't want to look at a bunch of numbers, here are some quick fun facts

- The only fanbase to not have a negative score against New England is Arizona (scored 0)
- The only fanbase to score Houstan negatively are Titans fans
- The only fanbase to score the Bengals negatively were the other AFC north teams. The only fanbase to score the Browns negatively were the Steelers fans.
- The only fanbases to score Washington negatively are other NFC East teams.
- Tampa Bay is only disiked by the NFC South and NFC East
- The only fanbases who dislike the Vikings are the other NFC North teams.
- Every fanbase dislikes the Jets, the Cowboys and the Eagles.
- Your opinion of a team is more based on what team it is and less about who your team is.

**FAN CHARTS**

Here are charts like the one above, but from the perspective of the fans of these teams, in two forms : stacked = horizontal bars on top of each other, bars = vertical bars. From these charts you can see the opinions a team's fans have of other teams.

Fan Positivity : [This chart](http://i.imgur.com/N0pIB.png) shows the average score of how fans of one team scored all the other teams. From it you can see that Chiefs, Bills and Rams fans are the only fans who on average, think positively of other teams. Cowboy fans think the most negatively of other teams.

**Fan Rivalry**

To get a measure of rivalries, I added the two teams opinions of each other. (I had a better measurement method, but it was too complicated an crashed my spreedsheets, so we'll keep it simple). This simple method should make sense, as if team A rates team B -1 and B rates A -1 their score is -2 which since both fans don't like each other we'll call that a rivalry. If A rates B -1, and B rates A 1, add them together = 0 - which isn't much of a rivalry as not both teams are competitive against each other.

[Here's a table of the rivalries](http://i.imgur.com/djMkT.png).  I highlighted scores less than -2 as Black - which are the biggest rivalries. Scores less than -1 are highlighted Red - which are pretty good rivalries. And scores greater than one are highlighted blue aren't rivalries but more ""friends"" (each team has a 4 next to themselves because 2+2).

Once again if you don't want to look at a wall of numbers here are some key points

- NE v. NYJ biggest 'rivalry' scoring -3.11
- Other big rivalries are : NE v. MIA (-2.7), SD v. OAK (-2.36), CIN v. PIT (-2.26), BAL v. PIT (-2.58), DAL v. PIT (-2.32), NYG v. NE (-2.39), NO v. ATL (-2.41), GB v CHI (-2.67), DAL v. NYG (-3), DAL v. PHI (-2.98), DAL v. WAS (-2.6), PHI v. NYG (-2.5)
- There are 53 other rivalries which scored less then -1 (but greater than -2)
- Since there are 512 'match-ups' between teams, 10% of match-ups are between 'rivals'.
- There are 4 ""friends"" : Denver and Houston (+1.66) Broncos and Colts (+1.59) &lt;- who would think the two horse teams would band together (and I know, it's really because of Manning),  Seattle and Houston (+1.03), and Niners and Ravens (+1.1) &lt;- Harbros!!!

Edit : As requested- the largest asymmetries between two teams (biggest difference between what two teams think of each other)

- Seahawks and Steelers (1.7 difference)
- Jets and Texans (1.57 difference)
- Redskins and Steelers (1.47 difference)
- Jets and Denver (1.46 difference)
- Broncos and Cowboys (1.37 difference)
- Bills and Cowboys (1.37 difference)
- Texans and Steelers (1.31 difference)

**vs. R/Baseball**

the analyzers at /r/baseball did a least sum of squares test to see which teams opinions most closely resembles each other. I did something similar (but much cooler), I used the test to see which Football team matches up with what baseball team and vice versa. 

[Here's Football teams to Baseball teams] (http://i.imgur.com/jNOhC.png)

[and Baseball teams to Football teams](http://i.imgur.com/wxq4n.png)

[Here's a list of baseball abbreviations if you are unfamiliar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Baseball/Team_abbreviations)

- Note : The /r/NFL column is always referring to the football team, the /r/baseball columns are always referring to the baseball teams. So because the Seahawks and Mariners are both abbreviated SEA, you have to read the table correctly to know which one it's talking about. Hopefully the table isn't that confusing.

[Here's a graph showing the Baseball and Football results together!](http://i.imgur.com/RpQf1.png) - in the chart all baseball teams have white diagonal stripes in their bars, every football team has brackets [] around their name.

From what you can see, the R/NFL's hate of the Cowboys is not as impressive as R/Baseball's hate of the Yankees.

**DATA**

If you are as statistically sadistic as I am here's the data I analyzed : 

[part 1](http://www.mediafire.com/view/?by92b4mn403wkt9)

[part 2](http://www.mediafire.com/view/?8x9hgacxfrrdfb4)

[Here are all the images used](http://imgur.com/a/mcutp#0)


Whew!!!! Finished this whole project before the end of the Two Towers!!! Now time to do some stats for my Fantasy football league.

Edit : Given how well this has worked, if I can remember, I'll be doing this again at the start of next season and compare the results (and again a year from now).

Edit 2 : Thank you very much to the anonymous user who gave me reddit gold. That was very nice of you and just made my morning. (Much better than a bunch of screaming kids). 

Also - Thunderkleize proposed the idea to do this survey, but with players, instead of teams. I'll be up for doing it around the pro-bowl week, as that seems like the most appropriate time.",nfl,1378

phantombree,2012-10-27 21:49:45+00:00,"Well, THAT was unexpected...!","So, this morning I'm sitting on a bale of straw in front of the bar I work at. I was waiting for the bartender to show up and unlock the door so I could set up the kitchen. 
I'm fiddling around on my phone when a group of four men approach me. One has a video camera, one has a DSLR, another with a tape recorder and the last guy was empty handed.

""Hey! Could we interview you? We're visiting all the neighborhoods of Seattle and interviewing people.""

I say sure, why not.

Well, it happens to be my birthday today and I off-handedly mentioned it. Suddenly, these strangers are singing me happy birthday, giving me hugs and filming the whole thing. (and I'm trying to discreetly pull bits of straw off the ass of my dress) 

While I'm recovering from the embarrassment, they ask me about the neighborhood. The bar I work at is in an area of Seattle called Magnolia. I only work here so I couldn't give them much information. They continue to ask generic questions before asking me, ""How many churches are around here?""

""Uh, I wouldn't really know. I'm not a church-y person.""

""What's a church-y person?""

I pause, ""Er... Someone who goes to church. I literally don't know anyone who goes to church.""

They all seem a little surprised, but it's Seattle so not that odd. They ask if I have any religious affiliation. I say no, I'm an atheist.

""What would you say drives you to be moral and good?""

I tell them that it's how I want to be treated so why wouldn't I be a kind person? 

They light up. They explain to me that, yes, they're Christians and this was a little 'crusade' they were on. But not one to convert individuals, but to actually encourage people to do good deeds and be good people without using their religious background as their reasoning.

I was really surprised by this. And my heart, a little warmed. I even told them how uncommon that kind of mentality is and they agreed.

""Yes, God wants is to be good to one another. But not because he 'says so' but because it should just be in our nature.""

My bartender finally shows up, 20 minutes late. I shake all their hands and they wish me well. No 'Bless You', no religious anything, just the final words of, ""Keep being who you are."" and keep in mind... I'm a pink mohawk rockin, tattoo covered, metal head. To have a Christian tell me to keep being a nonbeliever, to be myself, to be a good person is astonishing to me.

Tl;dr
Was interviewed by small mob of Christians. Told them I was a nonbeliever. They thought that was great. Went better than expected.

speciate,2012-09-14 05:28:50+00:00,"Our dog disappeared 6.5 years ago, and just turned up. This is our reunion.","(reposting about [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/za8kq/dog_missing_for_65_years_just_turned_up_also/) story, with lots of updates and new content)

In March of 2006, we lost our dog, Coconut, in LA. She was being looked after by a friend near the USC campus while my (now) wife was in Louisiana doing post-Katrina volunteering. A door was left open, and she was gone without a trace, and that was it. A thousand posters, flyers, bumper stickers, etc. were put up but to no avail. It was pretty devastating, as anyone who loves dogs can imagine.

We've since moved back to Seattle. We have two dogs and a cat, but a photo of Coconut remains on our night stand. Not knowing is the worst.

A week and a half ago, we got a call from an LA-area vet. Coconut had been brought in, and her microchip identified her as a missing dog. My wife actually got the call, and somehow had the foresight to [videotape](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNrYcOQCTUs) my reaction when she told me.

Our nephew flew her up from LA the day before yesterday, and two different news stations met us at the airport to cover the story. [Here's](http://www.king5.com/news/local/Dog-reunited-with-owners-after-6-years-169391876.html) the better of the two, from King 5 (with video).

She's mostly blind--her right eye is completely blind, and appears to have been injured or suffered an infection. Doubtful if she'll ever see out of it again. She can see out of the left eye, but it has a cataract that limits visibility to about 6 inches in front of her face. It's heartbreaking but we're optimistic that she can recover most of her vision in that eye through a ~$2,500 surgery (!!!).

She's also missing a few teeth, and will probably need to have more extracted. Otherwise, amazingly, she's the same happy, playful, energetic, well-socialized, super sweet little dog that she was 6.5 years ago--so I have to assume that while she may have been neglected, she at least wasn't abused. I only wish she could talk for 15 minutes to tell us where she's been.

Here are a [couple](http://i.imgur.com/qI2F6.jpg) of [photos](http://i.imgur.com/Xbq7f.jpg) of Coconut from before she was lost.

EDIT: 1) this awful poodle haircut is not our fault and will be dealt with shortly; 2) we got her bloodwork results back and she is totally healthy other than the eyes and teeth; and 3) the obvious moral here is MICROCHIP YOUR PETS. It costs less than a bag of food.",aww,1412

Epistaxis,2012-09-10 15:05:53+00:00,AskScience Special AMA: We are the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium. Last week we published more than 30 papers and a giant collection of data on the function of the human genome. Ask us anything!,"The ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium is a collection of 442 scientists from 32 laboratories around the world, which has been using a wide variety of high-throughput methods to annotate functional elements in the human genome: namely, 24 different kinds of experiments in 147 different kinds of cells. It was launched by the US National Human Genome Research Institute in 2003, and the ""pilot phase"" analyzed 1% of the genome in great detail. The initial results were published in 2007, and ENCODE moved on to the ""production phase"", which scaled it up to the entire genome; the full-genome results were published last Wednesday in ENCODE-focused issues of [*Nature*](http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue.html#af), [*Genome Research*](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/current), and [*Genome Biology*](http://genomebiology.com/).

Or you might have read about it in [*The New York Times*](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/science/far-from-junk-dna-dark-matter-proves-crucial-to-health.html), [*The Washington Post*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/junk-dna-concept-debunked-by-new-analysis-of-human-genome/2012/09/05/cf296720-f772-11e1-8398-0327ab83ab91_story.html), [*The Economist*](http://www.economist.com/node/21562186), or [*Not Exactly Rocket Science*](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2012/09/05/encode-the-rough-guide-to-the-human-genome/).

**What are the results?**

[Eric Lander](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Lander) characterizes ENCODE as the successor to the [Human Genome Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project): where the genome project simply gave us an assembled sequence of all the letters of the genome, ""like getting a picture of Earth from space"", ""it doesn’t tell you where the roads are, it doesn’t tell you what traffic is like at what time of the day, it doesn’t tell you where the good restaurants are, or the hospitals or the cities or the rivers."" In contrast, ENCODE is more like Google Maps: a layer of functional annotations on top of the basic geography.

ArenaNetTeam,2012-08-30 22:51:09+00:00,"Guild Wars 2 status - Thursday, August 30","This is the current status of the most important issues we're tracking with Guild Wars 2 live service.

**Account security** - Hackers are systematically scanning email addresses and passwords harvested from other games, web sites, and trojans to see if they match *Guild Wars 2* accounts. We're taking a number of steps to protect our players from this, listed below, but we need your help too. To protect your account, make sure you use a strong, unique password for *Guild Wars 2* that you've never used anywhere else. If your password isn't strong and unique, change it right now. For the highest level of protection, also create a unique email address to use solely for *Guild Wars 2*.

Here are the things we're doing to protect your accounts.

* We have the ""password reset"" feature temporarily disabled. If you need to reset your password, contact our [customer support team](http://support.guildwars2.com/app/account/support).

* We now have email authentication turned on for all players with verified email addresses. With this feature, even if someone guesses your password, when he tries to login from a location that you've never logged in from before, you'll have an opportunity to approve or disapprove of the login through an email check.

* We've noticed that hackers who discover a working email address and password combination don't always immediately exploit the compromised account. We sent email to everyone whose account has been suspiciously logged into asking them to immediately change their email address and password.

* We will also be sending email to all customers whose accounts have been unsuccessfully tested by hackers. We strongly recommend that these customers create a new, unique email address for their account.

* We left in-game mail disabled for another half-day, because it's difficult for hackers to loot accounts when both in-game mail and the trading post are disabled. Keeping mail disabled this morning to prevent account looting gave us time to get email authentication turned on for all players, and gave players time to secure their accounts. But we will be turning in-game mail back on soon, so we ask everyone to quickly secure their accounts.

**Email authentication** - We started ramping up email authentication after last night's server update, and it's now enabled for 100% of players with verified email addresses. Email authentication provides a high level of security for everyone, and can provide an even higher level of security when combined with two-factor email authentication. Here's how you can set that up. Create a new unique Google or Yahoo email address solely for your *Guild Wars 2* account. Verify that email address with *Guild Wars 2* to turn on email authentication. Then follow the instructions at [Google](https://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=185839&amp;topic=1056283&amp;ctx=topic) or [Yahoo](http://www.ymailblog.com/blog/2011/12/yahoo-introduces-stronger-user-authentication-%E2%80%93-second-sign-in-verification/) to enable two-factor authentication for all logins to your email address.

**Parties, guilds, etc.** - We're working to address problems with parties, guilds, and other social features, which cause symptoms such as party members not appearing on the map, party members not staying in the same overflow servers as they travel between maps, and guild invites and guild chat failing intermittently.

**Overflow servers** - During this initial surge of high concurrency, and especially while most characters are low-level and thus playing in the same starting areas, it's common for players to be directed to overflow servers. If you want to play with a friend, but you're not on the same overflow servers, you can form a party together, then right-click on your friend's portrait in the party list and click ""join"". Note that this functionality is sometimes intermittently unavailable due to the issues with parties and guilds noted above.

We expect the use of overflow servers to naturally subside as players spread out more through the world.

**Botting** - Yesterday we applied 72-hour account suspensions to 500 players who were running bots. We're continuing to detect and ban bots. Soon we will ramp up to our normal policy of applying permanent account bans to anyone who runs a bot.

**Exploits** - If you discover an exploit in the game, do not exploit it or publicize it, but instead notify us immediately at this new email address: exploits (at) arena (dot) net.

This morning there was a widely-publicized, newly-introduced exploit in which specific cultural weapons were selling for one-thousandth of their normal price. We fixed it with an emergency build this morning. We want to thank the vast majority of players who became aware of the issue, responsibly reported it, and did not exploit it. However, a smaller group of players did significantly exploit it, each purchasing hundreds or thousands of these weapons. We permanently banned 3,000 accounts of players who substantially exploited it, and applied 72-hours bans to another 1,000 accounts of players who mildly exploited it.

**In-game mail** - In last night's software update we fixed the potential abuse of the in-game mail system that we identified yesterday. We kept in-game mail turned off for another half-day while working to secure accounts against hackers, since in-game mail can be used to loot an account. And we kept in-game mail turned off while responding to this morning's exploit. We're now ready to re-enable it, and will do so this afternoon.

**Trading Post** - Yesterday we tested Trading Post with a random 15% of players. This test helped us gather valuable data to fix important bottlenecks. This afternoon we will test Trading Post with a random 25% of players, and then work to ramp up from there.

**Tournament Rewards** - We're working on fixing tournament chest rewards. Because this requires substantial testing, we do not have an estimated release timeframe to provide at this time.

**Forums** - Our most important priority at the moment is to ensure that the game runs stably and flawlessly. So as to not create additional demand on our infrastructure and on our programming team, we made the decision not to open the forums until the initial mass influx of players has calmed down a bit.

**Next software updates** - We're making non-disruptive changes throughout the day. We'll publish the next back-end server update tonight at midnight Seattle time. The game may be unavailable for approximately 20-60 minutes while we perform this update.

ArenaNetTeam,2012-08-29 23:31:29+00:00,"Guild Wars 2 status - Wednesday, August 29","This is the current status of the most important issues we're tracking with *Guild Wars 2* live service.

**Account security** - We're seeing an uptick in reports of account theft and attempted account theft. We believe hackers are using databases of email addresses and passwords stolen from other games and web sites, and pre-existing trojan horses, to search for matching *Guild Wars 2* accounts which they attempt to compromise. To prevent this, we have temporarily disabled the ""reset password"" feature, and we're working to bring email authentication online. To protect yourself, please ensure that you use a unique password for *Guild Wars 2* that you don't use for any other game, email account, forum or web account.

**Email authentication** - Email authentication is a feature that notifies you if someone tries to log into your account from a location you've never logged in from before. Thus, even if someone guesses your game password, he can't log in unless he also guesses your email account password. You can make email authentication even more secure by using an email provider that supports two-factor authentication, such as [Google](https://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=185839&amp;topic=1056283&amp;ctx=topic) or [Yahoo](http://www.ymailblog.com/blog/2011/12/yahoo-introduces-stronger-user-authentication-%E2%80%93-second-sign-in-verification/), and taking advantage of that. We're currently preparing email authentication and intend to deploy it in a phased rollout, starting on Thursday, August 30.

**Parties, guilds, etc.** - Parties, guilds, and other social features are periodically failing. This causes issues such as party members not appearing on the map, and party members not staying in the same overflow servers as they travel between maps. This happens particularly during times of peak usage. We're working to fix related problems and mitigate this issue with each subsequent update.

**Worlds** - Many worlds are filling up. We're keeping the number of worlds constrained so that worlds stay well populated even after the initial surge of high concurrency. However, we will add worlds as necessary. As of Wednesday, August 30, all German language worlds are full and all French language worlds are at high usage, so we're adding two new German language worlds and one new French language world.

**Overflow worlds** - During this initial surge of high concurrency, and especially while many characters are low-level and thus playing in the same starting areas, it's common for players to be directed to overflow maps. If you want to play with a friend, but you’re not on the same overflow map, you can form a party together, then right-click on your friend's portrait in the party list and click ""join"". Note that this functionality is sometimes intermittently unavailable due to the ""parties, guilds, etc."" issues noted above.

**Trading Post** - We're working to bring the Trading Post back online. To help test, we've temporarily made it available to a random 15% of players, while we work to resolve remaining capacity constraints that will allow us to open it to everyone.

**Edit: We have completed our live testing of the Trading Post for today and the Trading Post is now in maintenance for all players. Thank you everyone that participated; this test has helped us tremendously.**

**In-game mail** - We detected a potential abuse of the in-game mail system and have temporarily disabled in-game mail to prevent any such abuse. We'll reenable it soon, hopefully in tonight's update.

**Edit: The fact that in-game mail is disabled means that it's currently impossible for account hackers to loot stolen accounts, so we're going to leave it disabled for just a little while longer, while we work to ramp up email authentication.**

**Botting** - We'll start substantial banning of bots on Wednesday, August 29. Since we're currently seeing widespread casual, unsophisticated botting, we will start with 72-hour bans for first offenses. In the coming days, as we address the casual botting problem, we plan to switch to our normal policy of permanently banning anyone who runs a bot.

**Forums** - Our most important priority at the moment is to ensure that the game runs stably and flawlessly. So as to not create additional demand on our infrastructure and on our programming team, we made the decision not to open the forums until the initial mass influx of players has calmed down a bit.

**Next software updates** - The next update of the game server and back-end server software will take place tonight at midnight Seattle time. The game may be unavailable for approximately 20-60 minutes while we perform the update. We expect this update to have fixes for email authentication and in-game mail. Our continued work on the Trading Post is not tied to game updates, so we will continue to test Trading Post updates throughout the day.

Netflix instant viewing is an obvious choice because it gives the makers money and would give us full access to all the shows.  Judging from Wikipedia the production companies are KCTS Seattle, Rabbit Ears Productions, and Disney Educational Productions. The Distributor is Disney-ABC Domestic Television.  I have no idea who to contact or get this started, but I think this would be a good thing.  

Anybody have any ideas?  

Edit:  I was reading online and someone said because Disney, but Disney has loads of shows on Netflix, including some of their most popular like Phieas and Ferb.  So I don't think that's the reason why not.  ",AskReddit,1662

And, ever since then he has been mentioning how big of a response he got, how big the reddit community is, and how people wanted me to do an AMA. Alot of you actually came to my website and liked my stuff, and even asked about voicemails.

Well, here I am.
My Name is Earl Alexander, I am a actor, voice actor, I am best known for playing Louis from Left 4 Dead, but I have done other acting/voice acting jobs, such as Half-Life Episode 2, The Suffering I &amp; II, SAW I &amp; II, and Casino Empire.

Ask me anything about, playing louis, working with valve, living in Seattle, or anything you want. Also, this is my first time using Reddit so please bear with me.

**If you want to hear/see more of me...**

Go to my website at earlswebsite.com  where you can to check my previous work, bio, resume, critic reviews, and voice demo. 

**If you want to take me home**, I have a pack of pre-recorded voicemail messages and gamer lines. It's a cheap package of $1.50 so help a brother eat!  Also, I am available to do custom recordings where you tell me what you want me to record. These are for personal use only and can be easily ordered off my site. The customs are more expensive because I have to record one specifically for you, which takes time. I am trying to make it affordable for broke people, so I am asking from $5 to $9. If you want extra background noise (like street traffic or any other ambiance) then it will be $9.
 
I will be giving away six autograph copies of L4D video game, if you buy a the cheap package or custom voice recording then you will be automatically entered to win, so check you emails.

Originally I was planning on traveling through till the end of July but surprise tooth ache had me grounded early (turns out I need my wisdom teeth removed).  I've been home for the last week, catching up on sleep and getting organized for the upcoming school year (which starts next week).

I also [donated the money](http://i.imgur.com/DZhKK.jpg) I raised (via reddit) for filming costs since I managed to stay underbudget all trip (mainly by living off of the hospitality of redditors instead of staying in hostels).  

I'm interested in doing something similar next summer, but on a bigger scale/actually organized.  Something where you could vote on where to send me a on week to week basis.  In the mean time I'm going to work on turning the footage I took this summer into something (short documentary or music video or something).

I just wanted to thank everyone once again,

LookInTheDog,2012-07-14 16:51:47+00:00,I quit my job and rode my motorcycle through 48 U.S. States in 100 days. AMA,"**I forgot the best part! [The macarena](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/wl1qe/finished_my_ama_now_heres_the_48_states_macarena/)**

**Sorry if I didn't answer your question, but I think I got to most of them. 11 hours later, my carpal tunnel is killing me and I need to go outside. Thanks for all the questions guys.**

Last year, I quit my job in Illinois, put all of my belongings in storage except a backpack, and rode my motorcycle 22,000 miles through all 48 continental U.S. states. Name a major U.S. city, I was probably there. I was inspired to do an AMA by [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/we3jw/i_quit_my_job_broke_up_with_my_longtime/).

I stayed with friends and family, camped, and used [couchsurfing](http://www.couchsurfing.org/) to find places to stay, only staying in a hotel 5 nights and a hostel 2 nights. I survived a hurricane, an earthquake, and an attempt at getting me to join the creepiest cult I've ever heard of. I occasionally planned out which cities I would be in over the next 2-3 days for lodging purposes, but the route was only ever planned out the morning of (or sometimes the afternoon, depending on how much I drank with whomever I stayed with).

The trip was exactly 100 days of travel from June 2 to September 17, with a few days break at the halfway point where I flew from Vegas back to Illinois to see family for an extended weekend, and then flew back out to Vegas and started up again. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/UTTlW.jpg)'s a map.

It's the kind of trip that you expect to be pretty cool, but it was way better than I ever could have expected - so many random things just sort of happen to you when you're open to it. Here's a [brief photo album](http://imgur.com/a/brlt5#1) with a few things from the trip, including a map of my route for the entire trip.

I have tons of stories from the trip - from the Chicago stock trader who retired to Montana, to watching the Seattle 4th of July fireworks on a yacht with people I'd met the day before, to clinging to a lamppost in New Orleans hoping my friend would find me and lead me back to the hotel - so fire away.

**EDIT**: Since it's the most asked question: I started the trip with about $10k saved up (I had been an engineer, single, with a roommate, in a low cost-of-living area). I finished with about $1000, and by the time I got a job, had a significant amount of credit card debt.

Gas was probably about $1700 I think. I get about 50mpg, so 22k miles/50mpg = 440 gallons, and gas was between $3.20 (Wyoming) and $4+ (big cities/California), so yeah, around $1700.

I spent most of my money on food and [beer](http://imgur.com/a/RmHTx).

**EDIT2**: I was 25 when I started the trip, and single/no kids. That's why I did it now, when I had time and availability.

**EDIT3**: Here's the major stories that I've posted:

isthisadream,2012-07-11 16:33:38+00:00,"I quit my job, broke up with my long-time girlfriend, and then traveled the US by train for two months alone, staying only with random people I met off the internet days in advance. I made an AMA about it exactly a year ago today - and in it - I made you all a promise. I'm back. AMA!","A year ago today I made [this AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/imp9j/i_quit_my_job_ended_a_4yr_relationship_and_then/) about my chaotic adventure across the US by train, and spent the following weeks talking with redditors about what happened during my journey. The response was...*unexpected.* Psychologists, newspapers, magazines, college professors, and screenwriters approached me afterward trying to interview me, or write out my story. I answered question after question, and wrote email after email for weeks after my initial post, but when it came time to actually sell my story...I knew I couldn't. I'd made a promise to you all, and I have every intention of keeping it.

After a full year of writing and editing, I am finally able to say that I have completed the story of my travels. All of it, written out in detail from start to finish in the vein of an adventure book. Every chapter takes places in a different city, with different situations, and with different people. It's fair to say that each chapter is a mini-story in-and-of itself, and the whole trip ties it together. If you've ever wondered what it would be like to debate a US diplomat on Wikileaks, or to fall in love in Seattle, or maybe cross two state-lines following a fever-induced dream, getting sloshed on tequila with an overly aggressive 40yr old cougar and then wake up scared and alone, live on a train, or perhaps what it would be like finding yourself at knife-point in a dark and dingy train station near midnight...all of this is written in here, and more. This was the craziest period of my life (especially being introverted), and I'm more than happy to be able to share what happened, and what invaluable lessons I've learned because of it.

Here is my [prologue](http://www.elf-clan.com/ichosetherailsprologue.pdf) if you're interested (note:this is a *true* story, and so it contains some profanity), and below is the actual book if you want to read more...

* **[I Chose the Rails (Kindle)](http://www.amazon.com/I-Chose-the-Rails-ebook/dp/B008IW2AOQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341988366&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=i+chose+the+rails)** - I left the file open so you can convert and share with any/all devices.
* **[I Chose the Rails (Paperback)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0985881305/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;seller=)** - *This link points to the Amazon copy of the book.* **If you ordered with me on the day of the AMA or a couple after, the books are all shipped!!! :)**

**Giving Back** - Though eating ramen is getting old, I can't in good conscience do something like this without finding a way to give back. **20%** of any profit I make will go to the charity of **your** combined choice. Just vote [here](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/LWFBLL5) and choose/add as many charities as you like.

Thanks to redditor [mcdevimm](http://www.reddit.com/user/mcdevimm) for spending countless hours editing this for me over the past year, and a very special thanks to redditor [must_draw_cats](http://www.reddit.com/user/must_draw_cats) (alt account) for the unexpectedly amazing [cover art](http://imgur.com/THxl3) she made. [Her other stuff is awesome too.](http://www.considerchromatic.com/Photos/Art/Art2/index.html) Thanks to their help, this book is 100% created by, and for, reddit. I think that's pretty cool ;P (Oh and ... they are definitely available for work /shameless plug)

If you guys have any questions about my trip, what it was like to going back to society, what it was like learning to become an author, self-publishing, writing a true story from memory and journals, or anything else... **AMA!!**

**EDIT** - This post, besides being dedicated to reddit, the IAMA community, and the [[two]](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/u7ikn/inspired_by_a_fellow_redditor_i_put_my_life_on/) [[redditors]](http://traveltoallthethings.wordpress.com/) who traveled solo around the country because of reading my post, is dedicated to a person who I've never met, and yet, whose life I have somehow dramatically impacted. I received a message from him about three months after my OP, telling me that because of my AMA - he divorced his wife. 

I didn't really know how to respond, but I tried. 

Every day since then I've thought about that message, and tried to wrap my head around the fact that something I did/wrote could have had such an impact as to separate the bond of marriage within the lives of people I didn't even know. Wherever you are man, I hope you found the happiness you were looking for, and if it means anything, just know that your message has kept me going for the months that followed. The completion of this book, it's for you. If you could do something like that because of me, then I sure as hell could do something like this.

**EDIT** - Holy crap [it actually happened](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taADLPtyDb0)

**EDIT** - Thanks to Indolence for this link http://www.charitynavigator.org/ . Before voting for the charity you can see what they do with the money. Doctors without Borders looks like it's going to win, and National Space Society is a semi-close second. (In case you're wondering)

**EDIT** - Okay I've extended the paperback purchasing for 5 days total. To be honest, I can't wait for my brief moment in the spotlight to fade, it's unnerving and awkward. I made a promise to myself that I would write the book and then post about it. I've done that, I fulfilled what I was meant to do. Now, I need to start getting these orders processed, and then return to my quiet life. :) Thank you everyone for your support. If you have any more posts/questions I'll still answer them when I can.

nathancrumpton,2012-07-06 15:57:53+00:00,"With the Olympics coming up, there are tons of commercials asking viewers to donate to the US Olympic Committee, but PLEASE DON’T.  Here’s why:","First off, I need to say that few people believe in the Olympic spirit more than I do.  The Olympic Games are, in my opinion, the single greatest event to foster global peace and international accord that mankind has ever created.  And other than the largely ineffectual and intermittently corrupt United Nations, nothing brings together more people from more countries with a more diverse background than the Olympic Games. On a personal level, participating in the Olympic Games is one of the premiere goals in my life.  In 2008, capping a 9 year track &amp; field career, I tried to qualify for the US Olympic Trials in the triple jump, but competing with chronic injury had me fall 15 inches short of the first trials standard.  I’ve since switched to winter sports, and compete as an [Olympic Development Bobsled &amp; Skeleton athlete](https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/105421990294348679176/albums/5761166061455094241). So please don’t knock me for hating on the Olympics; few people have put as much time, effort, and sacrifice towards that very endeavor as I have.

My chief complaint is with the United States Olympic Committee.  It does not take adequate care of its athletes when compared to most other first-world nations.  The sad irony is that the USOC is one of the richest national Olympic Committees in the world, if not THE richest, and yet its athletes are some of the poorest and least supported.  

In total, less than 10% of the USOC’s funds are earmarked for directly supporting the athletes.  In 2002 Salt Lake City it was 7% of funds, and in 2004 Athens it was 6.7%.  And in 2007 - a non-Olympic year when revenues are typically lower - 9.5% was allocated to athletes. And of the portion that the USOC allocates to National Governing Bodies, the organizations that oversee individual sports, only 3% of funds go directly toward supporting athletes.  (As 501 non-profits, the USOC and NGBs must have publicly available 990 IRS forms, so more recent figures are out there if someone wants to dig up.  ([Read more about financial side of Olympic Endeavors](http://usatelitetrack.org/dhac/?page_id=29)) 

Those numbers are abysmal.  Imagine another NGO or a charity that only directed 3%-10% of its funds toward direct aid.  (For reference the American Institute for Philanthropy sets 60% as a minimum and 75% as the preferred amount for direct support.)  At best the USOC would be lampooned as a joke in the industry, and at worst they’d be accused of a blatant money grubbing scam.  In any other area of philanthropy, people would stop donating immediately.

And yet the USOC gets away with it because it is the only officially sanctioned institution (other than individual athletes and their funds, which can’t compete with the budget and manpower of the USOC) to represent the United States at the Olympics.  In effect, the USOC is a legal non-profit monopoly that is empowered by the veils of patriotism and Olympic spirit. 

They further justify their dearth of support for athletes by claiming that athletes receive adequate financial aid from private enterprises and through lucrative endorsement contracts.  That’s a wild fantasy for most athletes.  For every millionaire Shaun White or Lindsey Vonn, there are scores upon scores of unknown nobodies who work just as hard and who struggle heroically to make ends meet, as NBC will surely remind you during their coverage. Just imagine the challenge of convincing an employer to hire you when you can only commit half of your year to the job because the other half of the year you’re in competition.  That generally only leaves low-paying hourly wage jobs without any benefits.  (Benefits and/or salaries that if you lived in many other countries, their Olympic Committee would provide.)  That brings up the challenge of trying to convince a health insurance company to provide you with coverage.  And even if you’re a paragon of health and phsyical vigor, that’s not an easy sell when you’re engaged in activities such as ski jumping, snowboarding, or sliding down a chute of serpentine ice at over 70mph/112kph, and where [serious injury is always a risk](http://www.sportsnet.ca/magazine/2012/05/04/sportsnet_magazine_bobsled_accident_zwelling/). Most insurance companies view that as a terrible business proposition, and will find any way to either deny coverage or charge a ridiculous premium.  

As a result of this lack of USOC support, I’m working three jobs (one full time office job for an hourly wage with no benefits, and then two freelance circuits) and I’m nowhere near saving enough money to be able to compete full time next season.  And on top of that I’m supposed to dedicate 2 to 4 hours each day to training.  I do have an individual athlete training fund that allows sponsors to make tax-deductible donations to support me, but I’ve yet to convince anyone that it’s a worthwhile cause (and with all the sick, starving, and less fortunate people in the world who could be better served by charitable donations, I completely understand the reticence to support an Olympic Development Athlete).  That financial gap is where the USOC should really be stepping up to help support its athletes, but it doesn’t.  I’m seriously thinking about taking to the streets in my spare time and begging for cash.  

And yet the USOC rakes in well over $100 million a year.  In non-Olympic years, it will haul in ~$140-150 million ($147 million in 2007), and during Olympic years that number swells profusely.  This year’s broadcast rights alone will likely breach $120 million, and corporate sponsorship will likely bring in another $60-80 million.  And they’re still asking individual viewers through NBC commercials and web campaigns to donate to the USOC on top of that.   

So where is all that money going?  

Not towards athlete performance bonuses apparently: a US athlete who brings home the gold medal in his or her event will receive just $25,000 from the USOC.  By comparison, a Russian athlete who brought home the gold in Beijing earned $100,000 from their Olympic committee.  Japan also gave fourfold what a US athlete earned.  China awarded their gold medal athletes $131,000, Uzbekistan &amp; Italy ~$200,000, Kazakhstan $250,000, UAE $272,000, Iran &amp; Greece $290,000, Thailand and Malaysia ~$300,000, Philippines $340,000, and Singapore [topped the list](http://100kjob.info/2008/08/12/how-much-does-an-olympic-gold-medal-bring-you/) with $708,800, or over 28 times what a US athlete earned for a gold medal.  

Rather, over 60% of their budget goes towards “administrative expenses,” which includes over $35 million in salaries, and included COO &amp; former CEO salaries of over $600,000 per year.   In 2008, 8 USOC officials made more than $300,000 per year, and at least 20 made over $200,000 per year.  Of the remaining ~40%, most of that is earmarked for the NGBs (eg. The Speedskating Association, USA Track &amp; Field, US Bobsled &amp; Skeleton Federation, and all the other individual sports), and within that remaining ~40%, only ~3% goes directly toward athlete support.  That’s a whole lot of money getting whittled away through administrative and bureaucratic inefficiencies, as well as outright greed masquerading as patriotism.  In the meantime, I’m going to go hit the gym and brainstorm some strategies for street peddling.  

**TL;DR: Please do not donate to the US Olympic Committee; they’re one of the richest Olympic Committees in the world, yet their athletes are among the poorest of any developed country.  If you want to support the Olympic Spirit, sponsor an individual athlete.**

fauxman,2012-06-22 19:59:01+00:00,I wore the same clothes for 56 days before someone finally said something.  What amateur psychology experiments have you done?,"A little more detail.  I changed my underwear, undershirt, and socks (I have like, 9 pairs of the same type of socks), and I showered regularly.  And no, I never washed the clothes.

I was noticed at work by an employee (I have a normal 5 days/40 hr week job) and I regularly am in contact with people.  It's not like I was in my house for 56 days.  What gave me away according to her was my hair.  I had woken up later than usual so I kind of rushed to work.  I arrived on time but my hair was unkempt.  I say good morning to everyone at my office as I pass to get to my office.  When I said good morning to the woman she said to me, ""I guess you had a long night.  You're wearing the same clothes as yesterday.""

Oh, I forgot to put it here, I worse a black fleece and jeans with black socks and the same coat, even on sunny days.  (Albeit I live in Seattle where sun pretty much doesn't exist w/o an overcast of some sort)

Camouflaj,2012-05-09 22:08:18+00:00,[Effortpost] Convert your upvotes into an awesome video game!,"[Hi Reddit!](http://i.imgur.com/1lGzX.jpg)

My name is Jeremy Romanowski and I'm an artist on the team currently working on the iOS/PC/Mac title *Republique*. Republique is a story-driven stealth/action game being developed by [Camouflaj](http://www.camouflaj.com), a Seattle based indie dev with a lot of ambition.

The quickest way to digest the scope of Republique would be to watch the trailer/project video on Kickstarter [here!](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/486250632/republique-by-camouflaj-logan?ref=live) (I'm the big guy in the back doing my best warcry at the end)

To those unfamiliar with how Kickstarter works, each project has a funding goal, and if it doesn't reach that goal by the deadline all the funds are returned to the backers. It's been 4 weeks since we launched our Kickstarter, and in that time we've raised about $325,000 (awesome!), but with only ~48 hours to go we're still about $175,000 away from reaching our goal of $500,000. :(

So although it's a beautiful sunny day in Seattle, I've elected to stay inside the studio that has become my home away from home and reach out to Reddit for help. I've spent the majority of the past 7 months inside these walls, getting to know the most hardworking and talented people I've ever known. It's been a herculean effort by any measure, and we're incredibly proud of what we've accomplished, (unfortunately it has also left many of us with sleep disorders and an alienating amount of inside jokes) but I really think we're in need of Reddit's help right now.

I've seen this community (myself included) come together to support many causes over the years and it has never ceased to amaze me how much you guys can accomplish when called to action. In fact my love for Reddit has been the source of many laughs in the office because I am such a vocal advocate. If anyone here wants to get under my skin they just say ""*where'd you find that, 9gag? Facebook?*"" and I'm ragefacing up and down the hall. They love it. I hate them. 

We've given everything we can possibly give to the project at this point, and we've become a family in the process. We eat all of our meals together, huddled around our modest roundtable, elbow to elbow. We fall asleep in our chairs and on the ground while groggily arguing over floorspace. We're comrades in battle, and I know I'm not alone when I say I've felt true survivor's guilt when I couldn't be here to fight alongside these amazing bastards. 

But the fate of the Camouflaj family (CamFam for short) may not be so bright depending on what happens in the next 48 hours... So, Reddit, I am calling on you to keep us together. If only in the form of an upvote, your support would mean the world to us! Oh and this is of course a throwaway account, so the karma doesn't matter. 

I will be checking and updating this post frantically over the next 48 hours, so if you have any questions for me or the team please fire away!

**TL;DR Indie game is in the final hours of Kickstarter campaign and needs Reddit's help getting the word out.**


**EDIT: Reddit user *Migrego* had the idea to include a Reddit easter egg in the game if we reach the frontpage and the team really thinks it's a great idea so upvote away! Let's get some in-game computer monitors browsing the Reddit frontpage! (Or something cooler, we're open to suggestions!)**

**UPDATE:** We made it to $400,000! YOU GUYS ROCK! We just might make it after all!!

**UPDATE #2 WE DID IT!! WE HIT $500,000!!! THANK YOU REDDIT! Im really sorry for the lack of responses and upates yesterday, I've been slammed with Kickstarter stuffs. We're hosting a [Live uStream broadcast](https://s3.amazonaws.com/Republique_Kickstarter/Final_Countdown.png) today from noon-3pm PST to celebrate! Come celebrate with us!

I've been a national correspondent for The Atlantic since the late
1970s. Through about half that time I've lived in Washington DC. In
the other half, I've lived in and reported from Seattle, Berkeley, Austin, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, Shanghai, and Beijing. I spent two years as chief White House speechwriter for Jimmy Carter, two years as the editor of US News &amp; World Report, and six months as a program designer at Microsoft. I'm also an instrument-rated private pilot.

failure? genius? pawn? -- that will 

appear in the next issue of The Atlantic, online next week. Here's a

alukima,2011-11-15 10:22:55+00:00,Today I received non-stop phone calls and emails from an internet pitchfork mob that started in r/gaming.,"Let me start out by saying that I've been a member of reddit for over three years. During that time I've tried to be a positive member of the community. I organized the [San Francisco Bay Area meetup group](http://groups.google.com/group/SFredditors?hl=en) and have held other meetups in Boston, Kansas City and Seattle. Whenever I'm free on weekend nights I try to sit in r/suicidewatch and r/depression and help posters. Last year I hosted an ""Orphan Thanksgiving"" and invited all local redditors who needed a place to have dinner into my home. I've met all of my close friends through this community, including my boyfriend. I even adopted my dog through r/bayarea. I've seen some of the previous reddit outrages and generally wonder in, tell people to calm down and then downvote the thread. Obviously I'm not always perfect, I sometimes argue with people over silly things and later regret it. But for the most part I love this site and try to make everyones experience as positive as mine has been. 


But today I received a call where all I could hear was ""Kevin"" and ""Jeep"" before the caller hung up. Then my phone rang again, and again and again. This started in the airport when I was trying to get on a flight after a SF redditors trip to Las Vegas.  I had no idea what was going on. Some of the calls were threatening- one caller even asked me if I wanted to know what it was like to be raped. I know that most internet bullies are harmless offline, but the panic created by receiving multiple threatening calls and emails is uncontrollable. As soon as I could check my email (while in line to go through security) I found multiple emails from friends linking me [to the offending thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/mbydq/i_let_telltale_borrow_my_jurassic_park_jeep_and/). 

Up until a few weeks ago I worked for Telltale Games, I was the event coordinator and the person responsible for getting the Jeep in the [previously linked thread to Seattle](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/mbydq/i_let_telltale_borrow_my_jurassic_park_jeep_and/). Boomer decided to name me directly as the person responsible [in a comment that was later deleted by the admins](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/mbydq/i_let_telltale_borrow_my_jurassic_park_jeep_and/c2zqc4x).  

Because I host so many meetups all of my information was readily available by Googling my name and many redditors decided to do just that. I've always wondered how many people see low ranked comments. Although I still don't have a good answer I know that this comment only had about 20 upvotes before it was deleted and was halfway down the page when sorted by top. From it I received 83 phone calls (according to Google voice), 41 Facebook messages, and 19 emails. I was lucky enough to put most of my online accounts on the most secure privacy setting while this was happening so I don't know if it could have been worse. I was also able to contact some admins directly so the comment was deleted quickly. 

If you, for someone reason, feel like one sided stories with zero proof are a reason to harass someone let me explain exactly how this affected me. I was in Las Vegas for my birthday. When I turned on my phone I was trying to return my parents call to me for my birthday, I never got to talk to them. I know this sounds very /firstworldproblems but both of my parents are sick and older. I don't know how many more times I'll get birthday calls from them. That was also my first real vacation, I'm 28 now. 

Like I said above, I'm online more than I'm off and I know how brave people can get behind a phone or computer. But the fear and panic that sets in is horrifying. I knew that something was going on but I didn't know exactly what or how bad it was. I've never once gotten sick from fear but some of the initial calls were so bad that I became physically sick. I started to worry about everything from my job to my home to my parents. Many hours of crying  followed. Even ten hours later I am afraid to turn on my phone. Beyond that it makes me think again about my involvement in any community. My information was only posted because I tried to do something positive on this site. 


Further more, Boomer was lying about almost everything. I feel like an awful person for posting these but maybe it will make people stop and think twice when it comes to participating in these mobs. Here are screenshots from a few emails that disprove his major points. ~~Here and here~~. ( I removed the images before posting, I can't do that, but they have been sent to boomer via a reply to his threatening emails to me even after he knew I left Telltale) The dates in the top right are the from the first time he started a fake smear campaign and I had to compile emails so *our lawyer could help him file claims. Even though at that point he was obviously scamming us we still tried to help him.* I won't post anything else but I have hundreds of emails concerning this. Even before the event he kept demanding that we change the terms. It got so bad that I refused to talk to him and asked him to email me so there was a record. As soon as I met him at PAX I knew something was off, he started claiming damage before he got there and saw the jeep. Even now his massive exaggerations are showing through. What he calls a ""[joyride](http://www.jurassicjeep.com/jeep-18/tell-tale-games-damaged-our-jeep-and-refuses-to-pay-for-it/)"" was the thirty feet we had to take the car to be inspected and the gas removed. The only reason I wasn't driving it was because my license was expired by a few **days** and we wanted everything to be 100% legit. I know there is more than one PAX enforcer here that can confirm the distance.


I won't lie, that thread crushed me in multiple ways. The only reason I took a job at Telltale was because I loved their games and they had recently acquired the rights to two of my favorite movies- Jurassic Park and BttF. I was paid just above the area minimum wage, worked around 50-60 hours a week and had a three to six hour daily commute. I was just happy to be involved in those games in any possible way. But above all I was very proud of the PAX booth and it stings to hear these things as he keeps posting them online over and over again, making me out to be an even bigger bad guy every time. 

**TLDR: Please don't get involved in these mobs. Activism comes in many forms but harassing a single person isn't one of them.

kevbru,2011-11-15 00:11:35+00:00,About that Jurassic Park Jeep...,"Hello Reddit,

Kevin Bruner from Telltale here. Today there has been quite the buzz about how Telltale reportedly damaged the Jurassic Park Jeep lent to us at PAX. Telltale (though not myself, personally) has in fact been in regular contact with the owner of the Jeep and the last we heard, he was in the process of completing an insurance claim.

The Jeep was damaged on the way to Seattle, before anyone from Telltale ever saw or touched it.  Telltale used the shipping company that the owner asked us to use. When it arrived we just saw an awesome, well loved, but also well used, Jeep. We had no way of knowing that anything had happened to the Jeep in transport, as it appeared in reasonable condition.  Anyone who came by the show and took a picture with the Jeep can attest that the Jeep looked pretty damn cool, and not obviously damaged. 

The fact that the Jeep was damaged before we had access to it, and some dispute over the amount of damage caused in transport vs. existing damage has complicated the claim, which has made the process take a long time.

But, today I wake up to find that there is a campaign the day before our game launch to discredit Telltale. Since Telltale didn't actually do anything negligent, we've been using the insurance we purchased to cover this, but it has been time consuming. Apparently too time consuming.  To expedite this, I'll be writing a personal check to cover what we understand the damages to be - this way we won't need to hash this out publicly any longer.

Some people seem to think that Telltale has grown into some giant corporation that doesn't care about people anymore. Nothing could be further from the truth.  We started the company to make games that are about writing, acting and atmosphere and not about blowing shit up. Since we've gone out on this limb, we've had some successes (and failures) and earned the chance to work with great licenses like Monkey Island, Back to the Future, Jurassic Park and Walking Dead.  All of our games are super faithful to the licenses, and lovingly crafted to make the best fan experience possible. Fans seem to enjoy them, which makes us super proud. We hate that most licensed games are a driver or a shooter with a license slapped on it, which we've never been about.

So I'll fast track getting the Jeep fixed by paying for it personally, even though I don't like the circumstances this is going down in. Perhaps some of you who are hating on Telltale might be inclined to check out Jurassic Park tomorrow and give us a chance to change your mind.


&lt;edit&gt;
Since this seems to be getting a lot of attention, I'll take the opportunity to mention something that irks me to no end. Telltale != TellTale !!!

So I've got this JP Jeep, right?
http://i.imgur.com/K9Xcd.jpg

Earlier this summer I was contacted by a representative from TellTale Games.They informed me that they were developing a Jurassic Park adventure title for multiple platforms and were looking for a JP Jeep that they could use in a promotional booth at a Seattle gaming convention called PAX in August.

Last year they had produced a Back to the Future game and used the DeLorean that belongs to a acquaintance of mine. As I was unsure how to respond, I contacted my DeLorean owner friend and asked him what kind of deal they approached him with. He said he asked TellTale for insured, enclosed transport -both ways- for his car, airfare, hotel, con passes, and daily per diem. He also received several grand from them for the use of the car alone.

So I was all like ""That sounds terrific! If you provide enclosed,  insured shipping both ways, airfare, badges for the con, hotel, and per  diem then you've got yourself a deal!""

They were pretty appreciative of me providing the Jeep to them for free, so they booked transport for my Jeep and we were on our way. 

The morning of the pickup I walked aaaaaaall the way around my Jeep and  took quite a few pictures of the condition I gave it to them in. Like  these:

http://i.imgur.com/DdgnO.jpg

Then I was off to meet the enclosed transport! Except the transport showed up and was NOT enclosed! I could have been a dick and said, ""No dice, friends"" and not given them the Jeep. But unfortunately I'm not a dick.

The Jeep goes on it's way and I fly out a week later. The Jeep was  delivered that morning and signed for by one TellTale's employees, a  self-professed ""person who doesn't know anything about cars and in fact  does not even own a car!""

Here's what I saw during my walkaround.

http://i.imgur.com/NWS7R.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/NUAYB.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/NxQK5.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/EEX6M.jpg

After the walkaround, and before the convention, I talk to the guys at  TellTale, among them Kevin Bruner, the company's CEO. I tell them, ""Look I could be ""that guy"" and throw a fit,  threatening to take my Jeep out of here tonight unless you cut me a  check right now, but I know this is a huge fuckinging weekend for you guys,  that you need to promote your game and you've gone a ton of shit to  worry about. So, we can but this on a back burner until the expo is  over, but I'd like your word that you'll take care of this immediately  afterwards."" They were pretty appreciative, and even though I received  no per diem or additional badges, I decided to not be a dick about  things.

Then the Jeep came home, I didn't hear from TellTale. A week later I  reached out to them, and it was a few more days before they got back to  me, telling me that I'd have to file a claim with the auto transport  company (Advance Car Carrier Corp.). I told them that I did not arrange  for the transportation, and that I should not have to be the middleman.  They insist that they are not responsible for the damage in any way, and  that only the car owner can file a claim.

So I send all my claim information (scanned receipts and delivery  invoices, before and after photos) to the car carrier, and they reply  with:

""We have completed our assessment of the above loss and have determined  that this is not car carrier damage. After carefully reviewing the  damage pictures that you have sent to us, we found that all the damages  was noted on the Bill of Lading before transporting your vehicle. Also  please note that vehicle was inspected in rain and possible that not all  the damages were visible. For that reason the box, where it says that  vehicle going ASIS was marked.

Enclosed with this letter is a copy of the Bill of Lading signed by  ""xxxx"" on August 30, 2011 in where was noted that vehicle had  pre-existing damages before transporting from WA to CO.""

Now, the damage was done on the way TO Seattle, not FROM. And here's a photo of it ""raining"" while they loaded up my Jeep.
http://i.imgur.com/IQLaK.jpg
Sure is hard to see stuff with all that rain!

So TellTale hired the sketchiest-possible carrier company, and then one  of TellTale's employees(who admitted she doesn't know the first thing  about cars) signed the bill of lading upon delivery without inspecting  the Jeep for damage, thereby releasing the car carrier from  responsibility.

I'm disputing their decision, but I have the sinking feeling that I am  going to be one of those cases that is just ignored until I go away.  Bullshit man.

I guess my lesson is ""next time get stuff in writing and be a big dick about everything.""

I haven't heard from TellTale in months regarding this issue, it seems to be resolved as far as they are concerned. Now, the Jurassic Park game is set to be launched this week. I don't really know if there's anything I can do, but it seems like if there was ever a time for visibility on this problem, it's now.",gaming,1121

EDIT: PLEASE READ.
(This article has dropped from the first page, down to 3-4 pages down, however there are many other threads that are popping up about this. Do not let this movement die! We cannot allow our protests and demonstrations be a trend in the media. This needs to stay relevant, for a very, very long time. If you, like the thousands of others who have PM'd me support this, do what ever you can proactively to continue coverage on everything happening. Thank you.)

Tuesday, Oct. 11

At around 12 AM this morning, I heard of the police raids on Boston at the “Occupy Wallstreet” protest. Within three hours of the first raid, over four more demonstrations were raided. People were beaten, their possessions taken and thrown away. The demonstrations' aid, housing and food tents were all also destroyed by local police forces. A brazen demonstration of censorship by our government.

Within hours of all this happening, the internet caught fire with the news of these atrocities. Millions of people were outraged, calling for justice over our governments wrong-doings… Including myself. I, personally am outraged. We as a nation have been sheeped and lied to. We have been brainwashed into thinking that our government is for our people. That they will protect us, and take care of us. People are starting to realize that we have been lied to, for too long. Our government no longer upholds its word to protect us. Their brutality towards us is proof enough that we don’t have the rights we once did. We as a body of people are slowly becoming more and more censored. Today has been a great example of censorship.

We’ve finally hit a true nerve by protesting against the one entity that rules every aspect of our lives: Wall Street. What the majority of America doesn’t realize, or refuses to realize, is that people in Wall Street control our media. Our government. Our Jobs and markets. Everything. We are in a depression because of Wall Street’s shady dealings. People in our government are paid by major corporations to promote ideas that benefit said corporations. Not the people. Personally, I feel like we as a nation can trust no one but ourselves now. Our government has given into the power of the all mighty dollar. I feel as if even my fellow citizens are misguided about what’s going on. News media does not tell the whole truth on what happens in our country and world. We know only what they choose to show us. News casters and reporters for CNN, FOX news and other outlets like them label these protesters as “Anarchist”, “Crazy” and “Clowns”. Let me ask you this question: What’s crazier? People fighting wall street to reform it’s policies because we as a nation are becoming more crippled economically day by day; or one man having the net worth of over a billion dollars because he manipulated our markets and got away with it?

We as americans, as brothers and sisters of our country, need to open our eyes to the truth. We can only ignore our problems for so long before it comes to a head. The way things are going right now, there will be riots in the streets, and we will see how quickly our government reacts to protect their interests.

Many of you will disagree with me. I’m sure some of you will think of me as being crazy and radical. I expect that. But can any of you really deny that there is something very wrong going on in our country? There is a great social unrest in this country, and people are starting to act upon it… Whether you like it or not.

It’s time for revolution, and where will you stand? With the people who lie to you on a daily basis? Or the voices of reason? This isn’t a matter of race, sex or political affiliation. It’s a matter of national stability. A matter of regaining what it means to be America and American. If you agree with what I say, then join the cause. Make our world a better place. Stand up for what is right. If you don’t agree with me, that’s fine too.

I can promise you that change will come. Whether anyone wants it or not.

All across the world, there are riots, protests, and wars going on under the same premises of our problems. It is more than America. It is the world.

Everyone is starting to see how led astray we’ve been for so many years by our governments. You cannot expect us as a body of people to idly sit by any longer and put up with the mistreatment of our families and communities. There has to come a time where we have to say enough is enough.

That time is now.

So I’ll ask you again. Where will you stand when it’s you against our government? Where will your allegiances lie?With your country or your government?

This message is bigger than Wall Street protests. These demonstrations are but a mere catalyst for what’s to come. Now is not the time to be afraid.

EDIT: Proof of internet censorship bill: [1] http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s111-3804Videos on the bill: [2] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb1UQgujPyg&amp;feature=related Mandelson's Internet Censorship video: [3] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sgUaPBvDlA&amp;feature=related Bradley Manning Mistreatment: [4] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GX4XUGQ434 Discussions of Wall Street undermindings: [5]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgdG-al5Azw [6] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V_D2Sg7YjA&amp;feature=related Federal bailout discussions: [7] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAYvv2xT8yI&amp;feature=related More information will be provided later. This is just a bit of the basis of where I'm coming from. We are actively trying to be censored by our government. We deal with shady dealings from wallstreet, even when we bailed these companies out. Bradley Manning's case is another case of censorship. ALSO! I want this to be a message spread around to anywhere you guys see fit. I want people to add to this, to make it the voice of the people, not just the voice of a person.

EDIT 2: I just realized that I put Detroit. I fixed it to Boston. I'm starting to realize that a small chunk of you are not even pointing out anything except my grammatical errors. I used the wrong ""There or Their"" a few times. If your sole purpose for being here is to worry about minor grammatical errors, then you're not here for the right reasons. I do realize that this is very vague, and it needs work.. but its the overall message that should matter.

PLEASE DON'T LET THIS DIE! It needs to be seen by as many people as possible. All of you who are asking how to help, this is how. Spread the word. Words can have more power than anything else in this world if enough see it as truth. For those who don't see it that way, it just causes more fuel to the fire for what we stand for.

EDIT 3: Someone was nice of enough to edit this posting for me. I have reposted this completely updated to be correct. 

Also, Funny how my personal life is being brought into this now. Some people will do whatever they can to discredit a person because of something in a persons past. I do have my GED, I am 19. I have made mistakes, I have gone through my fair share of grief. 

And yet, I find all that irrelevant. 

I'd also like to thank the people who have gotten me reddit gold, and sending me PM's. I appreciate everything you guys are doing.


A NEWLY RELEASED MESSAGE FROM ANONYMOUS: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZA3y05Dcz8

Hello world, hello protestors. This is a message from anonymous. This is a message to the 99 percent. This is a message to the American Autumn. It is clear that from the beginning of this movement we have been censored. Despite the fact that, massive demonstrations, were planning to occupy wallstreet, we were ignored in the media. Despite the fact that the protestors were flocking from every corner of the nation to join the protest they remained silent. However, the era of the internet is upon us. The power to circumvent the mass media has become trivial. You are paper tigers, and we are a scorching wildfire. The elites have been forced to recognize the movement, they have been forced to stand against us. And so began the campaign to mock us. We are dirty, homeless, unAmerican, stupid, voiceless, disorganized, violent. We are a mob, we are young, foolish, liberal, unemployed. We are leeches, parasites, anarchists, brainwashed. We are communists, dangerous, untrustworthy, rabble rousers, terrorists. However, despite the frantic and desparate moves by the elites to slander this movement, despite their vain efforts to curtail and skew our image, we have shattered through ther lies. The truth was spread, the lies were snuffed out. We will not be set aside by mere insults and disgusting propaganda. We are the people, and this is what democracy looks like. The elites now are being pushed up against the walls. They are resorting to their trump cards, and the strong arms have arrived. The camps of boston have been raided. The camps of San Francisco have been dispersed. The protests in New York have been violently curtailed and beaten. The protests in Seattle are on the verge of being raided by riot police. This is the final step in our strategy. A famous man once said that at first they will ignore you. Then they will mock you. Thirdly they will fight you. And then you win. There is nothing you can do. There are no more moves to make, this is checkmate. The game is over wall street. You fell into our trap, you repeated history. You planted the seeds for civil dissent, and now you will watch as what you reap is sowed, you will watch as the entire country blossoms and you are consumed. All the dominos are falling, and you will watch as one by one we prevail. The protestors have won. Stop your vain efforts, the wildfires are all around you. Stop preparing for revolution. Its upon you.

You may remember me from such media appearances such as ""losing on Jeopardy! to an evil supercomputer"" and ""That one AMA that wasn't quite as popular as the Bear Grylls one.""

My new book [Maphead](http://www.ken-jennings.com/maphead.html), about geography geekery of all kinds, comes out today (only $15 on Amazon hint hint!) but I'm actually more worried about the next book I'm writing.  It's a trivia book that sets out to prove or debunk all the nutty things that parents tell kids.  Don't sit too close to the TV!  Don't eat your Halloween candy before I check it for razor blades!  Wait half an hour after lunch to go swimming!  That kind of thing.

I heard all this stuff as a kid, and now that I have kids, I repeat it all back verbatim, but is it really true?  Who knows?  That's the point of the book, but I'm a few dozen myths short of a book right now.  Help me Reddit!  You're my only hope!  If you heard any dubious parental warnings as a kid, I'd love to know.  (Obviously these should be factually testable propositions, not obvious parental lies like ""If you pee in the pool it'll turn blue and everyone will know!"" or ""Santa Claus is real!"" or ""Your dad and I can't live together anymore, but we both still love you the same!"")

If you have a new suggestion for me that actually makes it in the book, you'll be credited by name/non-obscene Reddit handle and get a signed copy.

I just got back. AMA","Well the title is a bit misleading because I actually quit my CAREER, broke up with the girl I was going to MARRY (eventually), and then moved to a new city where I knew nobody except my roommate before I actually left.

On May 3rd I left Denver Union Station at around 7pm and returned July 4th around 2pm after traveling the entire US (north,south,east,west) via train and using couchsurfing.com for places to stay.  

I bought two Amtrak US Rail passes (45 day and 15 day) and planned each stop on my trip only a day or so in advance - and sometimes even from the station.  I traveled to Chicago, Milwaukee, Wausau, St. Paul, Seattle, Portland, San Fran, Los Angeles, Sante Fe, Kansas City, St. Louis, New Orleans, Atlanta, Washington D.C., and Boston.  I returned to Denver from Boston.

The whole trip I used a website called couchsurfing.com and never once had to pay for a hotel or hostel.  I stayed with a US diplomat on leave from Saudi Arabia, CEO of an insturance company, a forager, a Los Alamos nuclear physicist, a lobbyist, a retired bass player, a spiritual guru, a group of hippies... to name a few of the hosts I had the pleasure of staying with.  (It was fun talking about Wikileaks with the diplomat for sure)

Everyday I lived out of my suitcase and backpack.  Everyday I was somewhere new and meeting new people; people I had to stay with for long periods of time in some cases.  

During my trip I was almost mugged, had a knife pulled on me (separate incident), got tonsillitis, went sailing, fell in 'love', drank way too much in new orleans, drank just enough everywhere else (go local brewed), got lost in a swamp, got attacked by a cougar with loads of tequilla (not the animal hah) and more.

I've been back for a bit now and it is still VERY weird.  Nothing seems familiar and all the 'things' I once held dear to me now mean almost nothing.  In fact in the 7 days I've been back - this is my first time on the computer and the only thing I can think of is how weird this all feels.  In fact, in the two months I was gone it seemed like almost eight months - time slowed down in an extreme way.  My roommate said to me when I got back how quickly time had flown, and all I could think of was how I completely forgot what he looked like.

Never expected this much discussion and I'm really grateful to have been able to help you guys in any way that I could with your desire to travel - or questions about cs and amtrak.  For everyone that is calling me their hero and an inspiration - I sincerely thank you for the flattery - But I have to say it wasn't that you saw me as these things, it was that you saw a part of yourself in the decisions I made.  If you're not happy with your life and your situation, you have the power to change all of that by just making the choice to do so.  If you have any other questions just send me a pm - I'm so exhausted from sitting in front of my computer... it's been hard to sit on here for a long period of time after not being on in so long. 

I made a promise in some of my pm's and replies that I'd write out a book of my travels for you all and so that's what I am going to do... I just don't know quite how to do it. Expect it to be in the vein of an adventure tale, since that's what I enjoy writing in my spare time. Till then...

One lovely gentleman was kind enough to get on, pay his fare, sit down, take his entire weekend dose, and promptly pissed himself like a racehorse wearing pants.  It ran down the isle at the first stop I made, flowed down the steps and out the door.  Welcome to Metro.


Since I know this is going to be asked...
** Uncle Sal's Guide to catching a bus:**

*  [Trip Planner](http://tripplanner.kingcounty.gov) Most major agencies have something like this.
*  Track your bus:

     a) If you have a smart phone download [OneBusAway](http://onebusaway.org)

     b) If you don't call 206-456-0609 or text ""onebus [stop_number_here]"" to 41411.
*  Go to the bus stop, stand within ** 10 feet ** of the sign, with any bags or boxes you have in front of you.
*  Get your fare out and unfolded in your hand.  Face toward the direction the bus is coming from.
*  When you see a bus;

  a) Human eyes are set up to detect motion: Don't just stand there, move around a bit.

  b) Make and maintain eye contact with the driver.

  c) Wave vertically (""HI"") if you want the bus, maintain eye contact and move toward the sign.

  d) Wave off (Horizontally, like you are wiping a table) if you don't.

* Get on the bus, smile, and pay your fare:

  a) If you are leaving downtown and it is between 6am and 7pm, pay as you leave.

  b) Otherwise, pay as you enter.

*  Park your butt on a seat and pull the cord two blocks from your stop.
*  Say ""Thank You"" when you leave.  I do notice and do appreciate it.

** Examples of what NOT to do:**

* DON'T turn your back to the bus if you want it, this is a sign that will get you passed.
* DON'T wander around kinda by the bus stop.  I can't tell if you are out for a walk or if you want me.  Especially if your back is turned to me.
* DON'T wave like you want me, then walk away.  
* DON'T leave any bodily fluids or items on the bus.  

With that out of the way:  Feel free to AMA.  I've got to go play in traffic later this afternoon, but will try to answer on breaks.

**EDIT**  Time to go play in traffic.  I will answer more questions and tell more stories as I can!  Thanks for reading AND Riding!

**EDIT 2** Now with more stories!  But I think this is all the good ones I have.

**EDIT 3** I have been off work for a while now.  Every time you see me say ""Cheers"" at the end of a post, I have taken a sip of scotch.  I predict this plan may not be my finest.  Cheers!

**EDIT4** The sun is coming up and I am going to hit the hay, back in a few hours to continue answering.  Since this will probably be off the front page when I get up, I want to say I love almost all my passengers and those I despise it is with the utmost respect.  Cheers!",IAmA,1079

Just this past month they all decided to take a vacation down to SoCal to visit with us. We all had a great time but when they got back home their son's favorite stuffed animal, Penguiny, was missing. This was his go-to comfort toy and we are absolutely DESPERATE to get it, or another like it for him as soon as we can. Please, if any of you internet sleuths out there can find this stuffed animal we would all be VERY appreciative.

EDIT: Whoa, evidently I wasn't clear on what we need. If we could find the original that would be out of this world awesome but I don't think anyone thinks that's going to happen. What we really need is to find that particular kind of stuffed penguin. That stuffed penguin was bought at a Target about year ago in Seattle.

EDIT2: Wow! What a response! I'm talking to a couple people about parting with their dearly beloved pseudo-Penguiny as it looks like we have a couple very strong matches. I can't wait to tell my sister in-law that we found a replacement for their son's cherished stuffed animal. You all rock! Thank you all so much - More to come!

EDIT3: I will be meeting up with rustyrambo tomorrow at around 1 PM PDT and I'll see if we can do a picture. Thanks so much to everyone for offering their kind words and a special GREAT BIG THANKS to those that tried to find a doppelganger Penguiny. Will try to update tomorrow.

EDIT4: The exchange is complete! He will be in Seattle on Tuesday!

jining,2011-01-20 20:02:33+00:00,This is a long shot: Any sushi chefs need a job in the Seattle area? I need one in 2 days. :|,"So... you may have seen my post previously: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/eyx29/i_want_to_help_my_girlfriend_with_her_business/

about my girlfriends restaurant being slow at dinner time. Well, since that post, business seems to be picking up, I don't know if reddit has been coming in or what, but its improving, thanks for all of the help.

Anyways, the new sushi chef that she hired turned out to be very lazy, and is quitting because he doesn't want to put forth the effort to memorize the ingredients/way to make various sushi rolls. :|I know right?

So, he has given her a 2 day notice and is leaving on Saturday. Maybe someone on here is a sushi chef that needs a job, or knows a sushi chef that needs a job in Seattle? 

This is a small restaurant, so there is only 1 chef, so they need to know their stuff.


Please email me at needasushichef@gmail.com, I will respond immediately!

Thanks for any help!

**[UPDATE 1]**: Thanks for all of the replies, I never thought that this would reach front page! So far, I've had a few very nice people email me with great culinary experience, but unfortunately no one with much Sushi chef experience that needs a job. I have heard that there may be a business around here that contracts Japanese sushi chefs, does anyone know anything about that? Thanks again!

**[UPDATE 2]**: Thanks for your help reddit!! Sushi wave now has a great new Japanese sushi chef who has over 15 years experience!

ok2tryagain,2010-10-31 15:24:21+00:00,"My heart tells me to find my boys who are young men now.  I don't know why, but I am following my inner voice.","Don't want either son to think, ""he hasn't tried to find me""? ""He never cared""? 
My name is OK Connett, (alias' Oak, Oakie, or Casey)
I am in my 50's, lived in Spokane through 70's and early 80's. My life is still a struggle and I have put this off because of my own view of MY worthiness.  But have discovered; ""It is not just about me"", so I want open the doors so BJ and Dustin have the opportunity if they want it.

I have two boys that due to life's path and some errors on my part are absent from my life and I from theirs.  I want to open the door to change that. I hope someone will recognize what little I know and connect us.

My oldest would be BJ Bennett, originally from Spokane, Wash.  His Mother Denise Bennett, Gma Lorraine.  BJ approx 34 yr/old.  BJ has lived in Seattle and Spokane, did work in Hotel/Motel Mgmt. His step dad I believe owned Bennett Contracting.  I know BJ has had some medical issues and I think it is important to make sure he has access to me for whatever, history, genetics. Besides I miss him !  Last contact by mail 1998 or 1999.

Second son is more difficult since I know very little and I want to pursue genetic testing so he and I both know, but I accept Dustin as my son.
His name is Dustin, he would be 27 or 28 yr/old. His mother's name was Brenda but was raised by his Grandmother.  He is also from Spokane.  The last I heard his Gma asked if they could tell him I was his father, I said yes.  Because I was across the state, he went to meet my brother RK (Ark or Arkie) Connett.  RK saw him as a young boy and said; ""he looks just like us, pretty good chance he is yours"".  Last I heard he might have been having problems and leaning towards a troubling crowd.  Since our efforts to get together and never heard anything else, I feel compelled to try and make contact.

Sorry I must update due to much confusion about me being a ""dead beat dad"", the boys being adopted, or me ""abandoning"" them.  I didn't do any of that.  So, here is a little more info to help place this in context.

Denise didn't tell me because when we were dating I had been being respectful in regards to not rushing intimate relations, I was respectful to her decisions to wait or just make out. Then she went out and hooked up with her ex, parties, DID HIM and hid it. After we had begun having relations, HE bumped into us and dropped the bomb... and the lies came out... A bunch of betrayal and lies. I walked away... She chose not to tell me... When she did she said she had hurt me enough and wanted to convince herself that the man she was with after me was BJ's dad. Finally decided that wasn't fair and told us both, BJ and me. go figure.

As for Dustin's mom... she was.. uh promiscuous ?! And her Grandmother who raised Dustin contacted me when he was 14. (mom was off doing her thing, Gma raising Dustin) Because his mother had the other possible fathers tested. When Gma contacted me, he was 14 and I was married and across the state. I said that I was okay with her letting him know and that we could test too if needed, but I was okay with filling the role, glad to be his dad. 

Then things fell through and don't know why. I think maybe my wife at that time may have done some things, maybe intercepted mail or screened calls too, I loved my step daughters, but she wanted to have a baby and we were trying. 

So don't even know for sure if they are my biological for sure but I am okay with that, wanted to open the door and give the options. Anyway... that's the additional info.

Any help, clues, questions or assistance can be placed here or at personal email at ok2tryagain at yahoo dot com.
Thank you all for any help you may provide.

Darthfuzzy,2010-09-22 06:27:11+00:00,"Reddit, I beg you, for society's sake do not buy Civilization V.","I woke up this morning to my roommate, banging at my door telling me that to my surprise Steam had allowed for Civ V activations at 6am this morning.

I was so excited. I activated my pre-loaded copy and then began playing. I did a quick start game which made me Catherine the Great. I created my Capital, Moscow, and began exploring. The hex system is phenomenal. Unit movements are so much better now. While exploring, I ran into Rio de Janerio, a city-state.

I was perplexed by the new city-state system. It adds a great and unique interaction to the game. They don't expand and they don't make any attempts to win the game, they're just your pawn if you want them to be. Either way, I met Rio and kept exploring until I met 4 other city-states. I then asked where the heck the other players were.

Bismarck, who spoke in German approached me first. He came off as a dick, but whatever, he wanted to have open borders and engage in a research objective together. I accepted. Then came Mr. Washington, riding in on his horse like always. However, instead of a research pact, he waned to sign a secret protection agreement behind Bismarck's back.

Well that's not very nice I thought. But what the hell, the Russians and the Americans worked together in WWII, I'm sure they can do the same now! I built up my empire rather quickly. I even got an achievement -- ""My little pony"" -- Oh come on, that's gross. I then realized, ""Damn it. Germany is in my way."" So I built up an army as fast as possible, and due to my superior technology, easily began conquering the German Empire.

Mr. Washington approached me and informed me that our secret alliance was over, and that he could never be allies with such warmongering scum as myself. ""That's fine George, you'll just be next,"" I said. Germany quickly fell to the might of the Russian Empire. I began making friends with several city-states, offering them ""cash gifts"" to be my friend. That's when George got pissy, ""Back off of Geneva"" he said, ""he's my friend!"" I laughed.

First fell Seattle. Then came Boston, followed by Atlanta, then came the rest of them, until Washington was in my sights. George tried to fight back with some pikemen, unfortunately for him, I had already amassed cannons and riflemen. Yep, the Russians were certainly more advanced than the Americans this time around in History.

But then came Mr. Augustus Caesar. God, what a cocky prick. He had built a vast empire, conquering Napoleon on his continent leaving only him and the Arabian Empire together engaged in a great alliance. Mr. Caesar however had left a small peninsula open for me to get a settler on. But it didn't matter for I had conquered the entire continent I was on, which meant that I didn't need to garrison any units! I gathered up my forces and had 20 battalions land on the shores of Rome.

Rome quickly fell. The Arabian Empire didn't even help him. In fact, half way through our war, the Arabian Empire declared war on Caesar. He begged for Mercy. I showed none. He was done for.

That's when I got notification from my Science Advisor -- the Manhattan Project had been completed. Needless to say, the Arabian Empire didn't stand a chance from the 6 nuclear bombings I did on their capital. Over kill? Probably. Did it guarantee me victory? It did.

I spent 10 hours straight playing this game before I realized that I had skipped not one, but TWO of my classes. I had also neglected my homework that was due tomorrow. And I forgot to eat breakfast and lunch. Hell, I just now remembered to feed my cat when she began clawing at my face.

If everyone in this world purchases Civilization V, nothing will get done. NOTHING. For the love of Bacon, don't buy this game.

We talked the entire flight. He taught me that game where you try to make more boxes than the other guy. I was reading a nerdy animal behavior book, he was ready a nerdy science magazine. He was visiting friends in Seattle for new years. 

After the flight, he went to the bathroom and I'm pretty sure he assumed we'd meet back up at baggage claim. I hopped on a bus, never to be seen again...

Anyways, he was a redditor(!) so I'm hoping he will see this and it will be one of those stories you tell your grandchildren...
