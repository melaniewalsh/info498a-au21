&gt;After three [days of fanning nationalistic outrage](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/09/world/asia/china-apple-nba-hong-kong.html?module=inline), the Chinese government abruptly moved on Thursday to tamp down public anger at the N.B.A. as concerns spread in Beijing that the rhetoric was damaging China’s interests and image around the world.

The bottom line is that China tried to throw its weight around again and American corporations (here, Blizzard and the NBA initially)  caved.  So China ramped up.  But as backlash has spread in the West against Blizzard and the NBA, China is realizing they are merely creating more awareness of the repugnant, authoritarian actions that have taken in Hong Kong, against the Uyghurs, and even the basic suppression of information against their own citizens.  China realizes that the more eyes are on them, the worse pressure will get.  They are already backing down from the fight so that it will hopefully go away quietly and they can get back to rolling tanks over dissenters as desired.  

**So, yeah, don't listen to the calls for everyone to shut up and go back to playing the game.  This kind of concerted effort can have wide reaching implications!** And since I've been posting the below to a bunch of threads, I figure, I will throw it in here and stop posting elsewhere: 

People who say “keep politics out of my (insert thing here)” are not only gutless but mindless. Politics pervasively shapes every aspect of our lives, and for those without the privilege of living in even a fairly democratic society it’s the equivalent of hearing the rest of the world saying: “I don’t want your suffering to ruin my good time. “",hearthstone,29046

SolitaryEgg,2019-10-11 11:38:59+00:00,"Honestly, forget the NBA. Forget Blizzard. Forget Apple. BOYCOTT TIKTOK.","I'm not saying that the NBA, Apple, and Blizzard don't deserve everything that has been said about them. They 100% do.

*but*

I propose that we take all this energy we're using to shame them and aim it towards **TikTok.**

And if you use it, uninstall it.

TikTok is owned by a massive Chinese conglomerate called ""ByteDance,"" and they censor content *not just in China,* but in the US and Europe as well, based on Chinese censorship guidelines:

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing

&gt;The documents, revealed by the Guardian for the first time, lay out how ByteDance, the Beijing-headquartered technology company that owns TikTok, is advancing Chinese foreign policy aims abroad through the app.

And they are staunch supporters of the CCP (if not just directly run by the CCP):

&gt;CEO Zhang Yiming issued a letter in 2018 stating that his company would ""further deepen cooperation"" with Communist Party of China authorities to promote their policies.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok#National_security_concerns_in_the_US

Reddit is here destroying US companies for making concessions to China, which is totally fair. But, at the same time, we're all posting TikToks all over reddit, and it's a top 5 app on both Google Play and the App Store.

I worry that we have forgotten who we're really trying to punish, here. Did Apple and Blizzard and the NBA fuck up? Yes. Do they deserve the heat? Yes. But damaging US companies to punish the CCP is a small hit. At worst, it actually *helps* the chinese economy if we boycott US companies.

Going after TikTok, who is deeply-entangled with the Chinese government (and lets be honest, probably just *is* the Chinese government) and is directly implementing China-style censorship around the globe is a much better move, IMO.

Per the movie's screenwriter: ""*if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he’s Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people who think that that’s bullshit*"". Now you can't even acknowledge that Tibet is a place lest our Chinese overlord be displeased.

* Marriott: [fired](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2128124/marriott-sacks-employee-who-liked-twitter-post-tibet-independence) employee who liked tweet from an Tibetan group

After decades of opening up wide the Western market to China while turning a blind eye to rampant Chinese IP thefts, forced tech transfers, and protectionism, we are looking at widespread control of Western businesses by China. Businesses that are not under outright Chinese control are still kowtowing to China out of sheer fear of China's retaliation.

This is just a very incomplete list of what we're seeing publicly. Imagine how bad it really is behind closed doors.

More broadly, it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period, sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: 八九民运, bājiǔ mínyùn). The protests were forcibly suppressed after Chinese Premier Li Pengdeclared martial law. In what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators trying to block the military's advance towards Tiananmen Square. The number of civilian deaths was internally estimated by the Chinese government to be near or above 10,000.",Blizzard,1039

jrsyinzei,2019-10-07 03:53:15+00:00,"An open letter from Joe Tsai, owner of the Brooklyn Nets.","Open letter to all NBA fans: 

When I bought controlling interest in the Brooklyn Nets in September, I didn’t expect my first public communication with our fans would be to comment on something as politically charged and grossly misunderstood as the way hundreds of millions of Chinese NBA fans feel about what just happened.

By now you have heard that Chinese fans have reacted extremely negatively to a tweet put out by Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey in support of protests in Hong Kong. 

The Rockets, who by far had been the favorite team in China, are now effectively shut out of the Chinese market as fans abandon their love for the team, broadcasters refuse to air their games and Chinese corporates pull sponsorships in droves.  

Fans in China are calling for an explanation – if they are not getting it from the Houston Rockets, then it is natural that they ask others associated with the NBA to express a view.

The NBA is a fan-first league. When hundreds of millions of fans are furious over an issue, the league, and anyone associated with the NBA, will have to pay attention.  As a Governor of one of the 30 NBA teams, and a Chinese having spent a good part of my professional life in China, I need to speak up.

What is the problem with people freely expressing their opinion? This freedom is an inherent American value and the NBA has been very progressive in allowing players and other constituents a platform to speak out on issues.  

The problem is, there are certain topics that are third-rail issues in certain countries, societies and communities. 

Supporting a separatist movement in a Chinese territory is one of those third-rail issues, not only for the Chinese government, but also for all citizens in China. 

The one thing that is terribly misunderstood, and often ignored, by the western press and those critical of China is that 1.4 billion Chinese citizens stand united when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country’s sovereignty over her homeland. This issue is non-negotiable.

A bit of historical perspective is important.  In the mid-19thcentury, China fought two Opium Wars with the British, aided by the French, who forced through illegal trade of opium to China. A very weak Qing Dynasty government lost the wars and the result was the ceding of Hong Kong to the British as a colony. 

The invasion of Chinese territories by foreign forces continued against a weak and defenseless Qing government, which precipitated in the Boxer Rebellion by Chinese peasants at the turn of the 20th century. In response, the Eight Nations Alliance – comprised of Japan, Russia, Britain, France, United States, Germany, Italy and Austria-Hungary – dispatched their forces to occupy Chinese territories in the name of humanitarian intervention. The foreign forces marched into the Chinese capital Peking (now called Beijing), defeated the peasant rebels and proceeded to loot and pillage the capital city. 

In 1937, Japan invaded China by capturing Beijing, Shanghai and the then-Chinese capital Nanjing.  Imperial Japanese troops committed mass murder and rape against the residents of Nanjing, resulting in several hundred thousand civilian deaths. The war of resistance by the Chinese against Japan ended after tens of millions of Chinese casualties, and only after America joined the war against Japan post-Pearl Harbor.

I am going into all of this because a student of history will understand that the Chinese psyche has heavy baggage when it comes to any threat, foreign or domestic, to carve up Chinese territories. 

When the topic of any separatist movement comes up, Chinese people feel a strong sense of shame and anger because of this history of foreign occupation.  

By now I hope you can begin to understand why the Daryl Morey tweet is so damaging to the relationship with our fans in China.  I don’t know Daryl personally. I am sure he’s a fine NBA general manager, and I will take at face value his subsequent apology that he was not as well informed as he should have been.  But the hurt that this incident has caused will take a long time to repair.  

I hope to help the League to move on from this incident. I will continue to be an outspoken NBA Governor on issues that are important to China. I ask that our Chinese fans keep the faith in what the NBA and basketball can do to unite people from all over the world. 

Sincerely,
Joe Tsai

NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Rueters) - U.S. stocks fell on Friday after reports that a Howler Monkey housed in the Cincinnati Zoo reached down to itch its balls for over 90 seconds straight, raising worries about a further escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.

High-level trade talks between Washington and Beijing are scheduled for Oct. 10-11, before the start of the U.S. third-quarter earnings season.  When asked about his take on the trade war talks, the Howler Money refused to comment.

Is there a historical precedent for this?","For example, here's the in-game text that pops up when Theravada Buddhism is ""harmonized"":

&gt; *The Pali Cannons of Theravada Buddhism are in many ways a familiar way to organize tradition and learning to our Confucian elites. Over time these collections of laws and rites have come to be studied and made part of the corpus that every educated and influential member of our society must study and adhere to. The tradition have been harmonized and the wider Theravada Buddhist community consider us their equal just as we consider the Theravada Buddhists within our borders as an integral part of our monarchy.*

and when Islam is ""harmonized"":

&gt;Islam has been a minority religion for centuries in our lands and was so not a new religion to us when we first became the overlord of the people of Kutai. Over time however it has grown into a more and more integrated part of our society. Muslim ideals have been integrated and harmonized with our traditions, rites and methods and we have taken the best of what the religion has had to offer to mould to our own uses. Islamic scholars, doctors, merchants, farmers and peasants can be found even in the districts around Beijing. As long as they bend the knee to our king, the followers of Allah are an integral part of our society.

I know various belief systems such as Benzhuism or Manichaeism (as it entered China) became influenced by Chinese folk religion, but I believe that has more to do with being influenced by their location, rather than any state-supported attempts to integrate them. 

With that being said, was there any precedent behind a Confucian ruler trying to officially integrate these religions in such a manner as to incorporate their rituals, traditions, and even religious texts?",AskHistorians,2190

&amp;#x200B;

This happened to me almost a year ago. My friends and I were going to our favorite Chinese noodle place near our university campus. The place was well known for selling a bowl of noodles for a decent price and they don't skimp on the noodles (my favorite is the Chong Qing Small Noodles). I often talk to the manager and because she doesn't speak english our conversations are in mandarin.

After a quick talk with the manager, my friends and I were waiting near the entrance for a table to open up when suddenly this little old lady holding a toddler came up to me and said ""四位"" (4 seats, normal way of telling restaurant workers  how many is in your party). I realized she mistook me for an employee and quickly told her that I don't work here. She gave me this mortified look and profusely apologized. I told her it was fine and directed her to an employee and shortly after my friends and I's table was ready. In the middle of our dinner I saw a young couple come up and join the old lady in waiting for their table (I assumed that the couple was the toddler's parents after seeing the toddler being passed onto the woman).  


A while later I ran into the old woman while walking through a grove area of campus ( the young couple and their toddler were nearby having a picnic). She apologized again for the mix up which again I told her is fine. Turn out she was visiting her son (who is a professor at my school) and wanted to meet her grandson. She also complimented my mandarin stating I sounded like a Old Beijing native (to which i explained my parents were both from Beijing hence the accent). We said good by and I continued my walk feeling a bit more happy.",IDontWorkHereLady,3963

vikingbiochemist,2019-08-28 12:17:30+00:00,Don't drown the signal in noise: Unsolicited advice for the fine people of this sub from a PR professional,"r/HongKong is growing like crazy. People all over the world care about the anti-ELAB protests and pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, and they're coming here to learn about it. This is good.

If you want to help, please try to keep this sub coherent. A clear and positive message here will be powerful.

I work in PR. I'm not totally terrible at it. Here is some friendly advice:

# Don't drown the signal in noise. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Respect the message of the protest movement.** 

The protest movement has clear goals. If you want to support the protesters, know these goals and promote them.

This is going to mean stepping back from a few highly popular themes of the past couple of weeks. Yes, the CCP has done terrible things. Yes, they've lied about them to their own people. Yes, they're still doing terrible things now and are continuing to lie about it.

But the goals of the Hong Kong protests do not include ""making Beijing admit they massacred students in 1989"" or ""bringing down the CCP regime"". If you flood this sub with posts on this stuff, you are drowning the signal of the protest movement. 

Yes, raising clear and specific examples of what the CCP is doing which puts them out of line with civil liberties is useful, and helps draw a clear distinction in people's minds between the people of Hong Kong and the threat they're facing. Arbitrary arrests, misinformation in the media, intimidation campaigns overseas, surveillance tech and so on are all good things to be discussing. 

Keep them specific, verifiable and newsworthy. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Avoid pointless drama, and remember it's okay for things to go quiet for a little while.** 

It's okay that there are quiet days. It's okay if the Hong Kong protests aren't on the front page of every newspaper, every day. Emotional intensity is intoxicating, but it's also exhausting. If this movement is going to work, it's in for a long haul, not a hot burn. In the end, it's probably better for the media narrative in the rest of the world if there are breaks. It's definitely better for the people of Hong Kong.

This means not trying to blow everything up into a huge deal. Take time to make sure stories are confirmed. Take time to make sure you're not duplicating posts. There's so many powerful and important stories from the last few weeks, please don't drown them out with manufactured angst and low-effort posts.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Be clear, be intelligent, and be positive. Be better than your adversaries.**

Pooh meme spamming, #chinazi tags and bitching about Wumao and brainwashing ranges from the frivolous to the actively counterproductive.

Memes are brilliant, if they actually say something interesting. LMFAO XITLER LOOKS LIKE POOH LOL TRY AND BAN ME is just noise.

Unity and mutual support of the protest movement is powerful. Paranoia and ceaseless accusations of being brainwashed zombies or paid agents directed at anyone who expresses the slightest shred of concern is destructive.

I realise there are a lot of legit trolls out there, but if you're going to fight them, remember everything you do has an audience. Make an effort to refute their argument or be stay quiet, insults will not win you anything.

One of the most impressive things from the Hong Kong #antiELAB movement has been how good, clear and consistent their PR messaging has been. This has included apologies at appropriate times, to spectacular effect. It's better messaging than some major corporations manage, let alone most national governments.  

Follow their lead, particularly if you're not actually from Hong Kong.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Respect the people of Hong Kong. This is their fight.**

I am assuming here that a hell of a lot of people in this sub are not Hong Kongers. 

I'm not either. My husband is, and most of his family is there right now, some of them taking part in the protests, and some of them just quietly supporting. But I'm several thousand kilometres away, keyboard-warrioring on their behalf because I want to do something to help.  I'm sure as hell not going to tell them what their goals should be, or try and hijack their political cause with what I think it should become.

People are coming to this sub for unfiltered news. They're coming here for information outside what they get on the major news sources. They're coming here for the voice of Hong Kong.

Don't drown their signal.

August 2009 at the World Championships in Berlin. Bolt already held both the 100m and 200m records at that time, but those performances at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 were incremental improvements on the performances of other athletes.

In Beijing he ran the 100m in 9.69s, beating his own record of 9.72s which itself was just a fraction ahead of his compatriot Asafa Powell's 9.74s. In the 200m he ran 19.30s, narrowly beating Michael Johnson's longstanding record of 19.32s.

A year later in Berlin it was another story entirely.

First came the 100m where he ran a ridiculous 9.58s, close to what his team said he \*could\* have run in Beijing if he hadn't jogged over the line. Taking the record down from 9.69s to 9.58s was the biggest jump since the introduction of electronic timing.

What sticks in my mind more though was the 200m. This was the fastest race in history, with a record three athletes running sub-19.90s times. Usain Bolt made them all look like children, such was his dominance. He destroyed them, starting well and powering away from the other fastest men in history, winning in a scarcely credible 19.19s. Michael Johnsons's record had stood since 1996 and was thought unbeatable until Bolt squeaked past it in Beijing. A year later he destroyed his own new record, while \*\*running into a headwind.\*\* It was unfathomable. As Michael Johnson himself memorably said in the booth after the race, the man who can break these records hasn't been born yet.

I'm a fan of many sports, but nothing has ever made me feel close to what I felt watching that race. Sports achievements can often be a little convoluted - there's something slightly niche and contrived about being the best jump shooter in the world, or the best penalty kicker. Sprinting is different. That one week in August 2009 we watched a man move literally \*\*faster than anyone else in history\*\*. I think that's something worth celebrating and remembering.",running,1196

Even though I’m pissed off at the pro-china communities in vancouver and other canadian cities, i am a mainland chinese myself and i do not wish harm upon the place where i was born, but i simply wish that they will be shown the truth and the hypocrisy in their ways of protest in this city.

Im 100% on the side of the hong kong protestors.

Tldr:  the pro-china community should think about what they are protesting against/for and i want both sides to know the whole truth before engaging in a non-violent debates and protest.",vancouver,1203

I follow political topics closely and read news both from Chinese perspective and western media. Ask me anything about China's dystopian society, Hong Kong, public opinions, etc.","My short bio: I was born in southern China and went to US for College education. Then moved back to Beijing for a job in media. I'm very interested in history and politics, very active in Chinese online forums discussions. 

Reason why I wanted to do a IAmA is that Chinese people and their views are very underrepresented in Reddit, and I feel there are many misinformation over life in China, such as the debunked Social Credit System, the belief that most Chinese live under constant fear.

I want to provide my side of information, and trying to be objective. When answering the questions, I'll refrain from expressing politic opinions, unless I'm trying to capture what the public think. 

Please don't spam ""commie"" ""wumao army"" ""troll"" or ""bot"", I'm a real 
redditor and I have being using reddit for quite few years. If you disagree, attack my argument, not my personality.

pinner52,2019-08-16 11:04:25+00:00,I am combing through all the Epstein files. You asked for it. Here it is. PART 2 - The next 300+ page breakdown.,"Well, I didn’t get much sleep and [posting this goes against the recommendation of my doctor](https://nypost.com/2019/08/15/jeffrey-epsteins-gal-pal-ghislaine-maxwell-spotted-at-in-n-out-burger-in-first-photos-since-his-death/ “Epstein Gal pal found at IN-N-OUT reading book on Deaths of CIA Operatives”), but I finished it and just in time for Friday morning.
First, I would just like to say thank you to everyone who upvoted, shared this and gave me an award. You guys really motivated me to keep reading this stuff and broke my reddit with all the messages. Last night we reached 17th on the front page. I almost died when I saw that (not by two shots to the back of the head either just shock). So many people must have seen it and that is my biggest hope for this work. The more eyes the better. 
Second, for all of you asking, no I do not intend to kill myself by shooting myself in the back of the head twice, [strangling myself in a way more common with murder then suicide](https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Autopsy-finds-broken-bones-in-Epstein-s-neck-14305473.php?utm_campaign=CMS%20Sharing%20Tools%20(Desktop)&amp;utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_medium=referral “Such breaks can occur in those who hang themselves, particularly if they are older, according to forensics experts and studies on the subject. But they are more common in victims of homicide by strangulation, the experts said”) , or any other way to be clear? I am a little exhausted, grossed out, stopped following a few people, broke my reddit, but not my neck thankfully in a mysterious fall, but other then that I am great.
Third, there is one section of pages, 34-90, exhibit E through K, that you might want to skip over, if you are trying to save time. I feel this section is important because it shows the lengths Maxwell would go try to discredit Giuffre, even though in the first dump it appears the lawyers for Giuffre argued that very little of this was used in the defenses case in their motion to dismiss, and what is going on in the underlining proceedings involved in with the documents. Lawyers will probably enjoy this the most and go read those sources directly, otherwise you can skip that content if you want. Personally, I would still read it. There are some names you might want.
Since many of you also keep asking, yes you can share this content. Do what ever you want with it. Copy and paste, save it, put it on your own blogs, use it for your own research, make a video out of it, make fun of it. Anything is approved. [Censorship is a issue we all have to help to overcome](https://youtu.be/wSTHgoaVtSw). The only thing I ask is if you share it please try to link back the original reddit page so people can upvote it. I don’t mind if you are looking for karma or views but the more upvotes on a single post the more we get boosted to the front page and the more eyes that will see it. If you do not want to lose it, you can bookmark it by clicking the little flag on the top right.

Finally, here are a few things to look out for:

-	Names of lawyers, associates to Epstein. 
-	Claims about Prince Andrews shady deals and friends. 
-	What the newspapers wrote at the time.
-	How Giuffre got the job at Mar-a-Lago.
-	Testimony from Fiancé at time, father and others 
Overall this dump is less salacious then the first, but I feel just as important, especially for trying to answer certain questions you guys were asking in the first post.

-	Ms. Giuffre objects to Defendant’s Second Set of Discovery Requests to the extent they seek information that is protected by any applicable privilege
(Missing pages)
Page 72
-	A request that each of these attorneys list all communications with the media is facially overbroad
-	Ms. Giuffre objects to this Interrogatory because a response would cause Ms. Giuffre the incredible and undue burden of having to catalogue literally hundreds of communications that she has already produced in this case.
-	Giuffre objects because this interrogatory calls for the production of documents that are irrelevant to this action and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence
-	Giuffre objects to the extent that this interrogatory seeks the communications of her attorneys, any author, reporter, correspondent, columnist, writer, commentator, investigative journalist, photojournalist, newspaper person, freelance reporter, stringer, or any other employee of any media organization or independent consultant

Page 87
-	Needed to do was issue an immediate denial and that necessarily had to be short and to the point 
-	Claimed they were “obvious lies”
-	Barden goes after Giuffre credibility for not stating certain claims sooner or claiming that they have changed 
-	For example – “Yet in her joinder motion she claimed she did have sex with Prince Andrew and that the sex occurred in what can only be described as a very small bathtub, too small for a man of Prince Andrew’s size to enjoy a bath in let alone sex”
Page 88
-	Barden did not intend the January 2015 statement as a traditional press release solely to disseminate information to the media
-	purpose in preparing and causing the statement to be disseminated to those media representatives was twofold. 
-	First, wanted to mitigate the harm to Ms. Maxwell’s reputation
-	Second, intended statement to be “a shot across the bow” of the media, which I believed had been unduly eager to publish plaintiff’s allegations without conducting any inquiry of their own
-	intended as a cease and desist letter to the media-recipients
Page 90
-	Continues to try to attack Giuffre’s credibility
-	Brings up Alan Dershowitz

I mean, I was there year round but a lot of people are seasonal, you know, because it's like snowbirds, you know, summertime comes and nobody wants to be down in south Florida. 
-	Q) What would you call the season, the seasonal aspect of Mar-a-Lago? What's the season? 
-	A) Probably from September or October to, you know, maybe May, I guess. 
-	Q) Is that the coolest time? 
-	A) Times of the year, yes. 
-	Q) And it's more guests that come during that period of time? 
-	A) Yes. 
-	Q) And is there more staff brought on during that period of time?
Page 224
-	A) Yes. 
-	Q) You saw that happen every year that you were there? 
-	A) Every year. 
-	Q) And in the summer, it's relatively dead because it's so hot? 
-	A) Basically, it closed during the summer. That's when we would kind of work on everything and then make sure everything is up to snuff for the next year, you know. 
-	Q) Do you remember what capacity Virginia was hired to work in, what her job title was, for example? 
-	A) I don't know. I would have lunch with Virginia. That's about as much as I know about what she did. I was busy all the time. 
-	Q) I understand. 
-	A) I didn't have time to go see what she was doing. I didn't really talk to Angela about what she had to do. I think that was her name, Angela. But it's kind of the name that sticks out. 
(Missing pages)
Page 225
-	A Where did I learn that? 
-	Q) Uh-huh. 
-	A) I think Virginia had told me that there was a lady in the spa area named Ms. Maxwell. I don't know her. I couldn't tell you what she looked like. But just she said Ms. Maxwell said she can get me a job with Jeffrey Epstein who is a friend of Donald Trump, so I figured, well, he was a good guy or whatever, you know, and that she was going to learn massage therapy. 
-	Q) When did Virginia tell you this? 
-	A) Oh, I can't tell you what date and time but I don't remember.
-	Q I understand. Did she tell you this while she was working at Mar-a-Lago? 
-	A) Yes. I mean, after she had been there for a little bit, you know, and then she told me, yes, that she could possibly get this other job
Page 226
-	Q) Did you ever meet Jeffrey Epstein? 
-	A) Once. 
-	Q) When was that? 
-	A) I dropped Virginia off at the house once and he came out and I met him and seemed just fine to me. I mean, you can't tell people by looking at them. I mean, I know now from, you know, what I've read that he's not a good guy. But you can't tell. You know, you don't even know your neighbors sometimes, you know.
-	Q) Was it about the same time Virginia started working with him? 
-	A) Yeah. 
-	Q) Was it later? 
-	A) I think it was about the time she started. Because I wanted to see where she was at, you know. And it was just a mansion down the street from, you know, Mar-a-Lago. So I didn't think twice about it. I didn't think nothing of it. He came out. He was very cordial, very nice.
Page 228
-	Q) Okay. Have you ever met Ms. Maxwell? 
-	A) Not that I remember ever meeting her.

If you have made it this far, THANK YOU!!!",conspiracy,14241
pinner52,2019-08-16 11:01:10+00:00,I am combing through all of the Epstein files. You asked for it. Here it is. Part 2 - The next 300+ page breakdown.,"Well, I didn’t get much sleep and \[posting this goes against the recommendation of my doctor\]([https://nypost.com/2019/08/15/jeffrey-epsteins-gal-pal-ghislaine-maxwell-spotted-at-in-n-out-burger-in-first-photos-since-his-death/](https://nypost.com/2019/08/15/jeffrey-epsteins-gal-pal-ghislaine-maxwell-spotted-at-in-n-out-burger-in-first-photos-since-his-death/) “Epstein Gal pal found at IN-N-OUT reading book on Deaths of CIA Operatives”), but I finished it and just in time for Friday morning.

First, I would just like to say thank you to everyone who upvoted, shared this and gave me an award. You guys really motivated me to keep reading this stuff and broke my Reddit with all the comments. Last night we reached 17th on the front page. I almost died when I saw that (just shock don't worry). So many people must have seen it and that is my biggest hope for this work. The more eyes the better. We need to bring an end to this international pedo sex operation. The first step is being informed. 

Second, for all of you asking, no I do not intend to kill myself by shooting myself in the back of the head twice, \[strangling myself in a way more common with murder then suicide\]([https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Autopsy-finds-broken-bones-in-Epstein-s-neck-14305473.php?utm\_campaign=CMS%20Sharing%20Tools%20(Desktop)&amp;utm\_source=t.co&amp;utm\_medium=referral](https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Autopsy-finds-broken-bones-in-Epstein-s-neck-14305473.php?utm_campaign=CMS%20Sharing%20Tools%20(Desktop)&amp;utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_medium=referral) “Such breaks can occur in those who hang themselves, particularly if they are older, according to forensics experts and studies on the subject. But they are more common in victims of homicide by strangulation, the experts said”) , or any other way to be clear? I am a little exhausted, grossed out, stopped following a few people, broke my Reddit, but not my neck thankfully in a mysterious fall, but other then that I am great.

Third, there is one section of pages, 34-90, exhibit E through K, that you might want to skip over, if you are trying to save time. I feel this section is important because it shows the lengths Maxwell would go try to discredit Giuffre, even though in the first dump it appears the lawyers for Giuffre argued that very little of this was used in the defenses case in their motion to dismiss, and what is going on in the underlining proceedings involved in with the documents. Lawyers will probably enjoy this the most and go read those sources directly, otherwise you can skip that content if you want. Personally, I would still read it. There are some names you might want.

Since many of you also keep asking, yes you can share this content. Do what ever you want with it. Copy and paste, save it, put it on your own blogs, use it for your own research, make a video out of it, make fun of it. Anything is approved. \[Censorship is a issue we all have to help to overcome\]([https://youtu.be/wSTHgoaVtSw](https://youtu.be/wSTHgoaVtSw)). The only thing I ask is if you share it please try to link back the original Reddit page so people can upvote it. I don’t mind if you are looking for karma or views but the more upvotes on a single post the more we get boosted to the front page and the more eyes that will see it. If you do not want to lose it, you can bookmark it by clicking the little flag on the top right.

Finally, here are a few things to look out for:

\- Names of lawyers, associates to Epstein. 

\- Claims about Prince Andrews shady deals and friends. 

\- What the newspapers wrote at the time.

\- How Giuffre got the job at Mar-a-Lago.

\- Testimony from Fiancé at time, father and others 

Overall this dump is less salacious then the first, but I feel just as important, especially for trying to answer certain questions you guys were asking in the first post.

\- Failed to join under rule 15 because undue delay joining, undue prejudice that amendment will cause. 

Page 35-36

Page 38

\- Alan Dershowitz intervened “for the limited purposes of moving to strike the outrageous and impertinent allegations made against him and requesting a show cause order to the attorney that have made them”. Court strike’s anyways so motion to intervene will be denied as moot.

\- It is unnecessary for jane doe 3 and 4 to be parties rather then act witnesses (seems to be telling them to file their own lawsuits)

Page 40

P., which provides “a party may serve on any other party no more than 25 interrogatories, including all discrete subparts” – in that Defendant has served a total of 59 interrogatories in this case, including subparts, in violation of Rule 33

\- Ms. Giuffre objects to Defendant’s Second Set of Discovery Requests to the extent they seek information that is protected by any applicable privilege

(Missing pages)

Page 72

\- A request that each of these attorneys list all communications with the media is facially overbroad

\- Ms. Giuffre objects to this Interrogatory because a response would cause Ms. Giuffre the incredible and undue burden of having to catalogue literally hundreds of communications that she has already produced in this case.

\- Giuffre objects because this interrogatory calls for the production of documents that are irrelevant to this action and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence

\- Giuffre objects to the extent that this interrogatory seeks the communications of her attorneys, any author, reporter, correspondent, columnist, writer, commentator, investigative journalist, photojournalist, newspaper person, freelance reporter, stringer, or any other employee of any media organization or independent consultant

\- Ms. Giuffre is not obligated to produce anything currently in the possession of Defendant Maxwell or her attorneys.

\- Ms. Giuffre has already produced her responsive communications, which are found in documents Bates labelled GIUFFRE000001 to GIUFFRE007566

Page 73

\- Ms. Giuffre objects because the information interrogatory above is in the possession of Defendant who has failed to comply with her production obligations in this matter.

Page 74

\- Ms. Giuffre further objects because the information requested above is in the possession of Defendant’s agent, who caused the false statements to be issued to various media outlets

\- Giuffre has not had the opportunity to depose Maxwell’s agent Ross Gow.

Exhibit I

PLAINTIFF’S SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSES TO DEFENDANT’S INTERROGATORIES 6, 12 AND 13

Page 78-79

\- Violate rule 33

\- Some information protected by applicable privilege

\- Certain request invades Giuffre’s privacy

\- Overly broad and unduly burdensome

\- No. 12 – Related to healthcare provider information at that time

Exhibit J

Page 83

\- Declaration of Ghislaine Maxwell

\- “I have no control over any media organization, including those media organizations that published any part of a January 2015 statement on my behalf at the direction of my attorney, Philip Barden”

\- “Neither I, nor any agent acting on my behalf approved or participated in any activity of any media organization in its decision to publish or not to publish any part of the January 2015 statement” 

Exhibit K

Page 85

\- Declaration of **Philip Barden**

\- Solicitor of the Senior Courts of England &amp; Wales based in London, England.

\- **Represented Ms. Maxwell since 2011 regarding the allegations made by Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre**

\- **Hired during Sharon Churcher Articles**

Page 86

\- December 30, 2014, Ms. Giuffre made numerous salacious and improper allegations against Ms. Maxwell 

\- Continued to represent Ms. Maxwell at that time and I coordinated the response to the media

\- Cannot remember where he was when he prepared statement but did it January 2, 2015,

Page 87

\- Needed to do was issue an immediate denial and that necessarily had to be short and to the point 

\- Claimed they were “obvious lies”

\- Barden goes after Giuffre credibility for not stating certain claims sooner or claiming that they have changed 

\- For example – “Yet in her joinder motion she claimed she did have sex with Prince Andrew and that the sex occurred in what can only be described as a very small bathtub, too small for a man of Prince Andrew’s size to enjoy a bath in let alone sex”

Page 88

\- Barden did not intend the January 2015 statement as a traditional press release solely to disseminate information to the media

\- purpose in preparing and causing the statement to be disseminated to those media representatives was twofold. 

\- First, wanted to mitigate the harm to Ms. Maxwell’s reputation

\- Second, intended statement to be “a shot across the bow” of the media, which I believed had been unduly eager to publish plaintiff’s allegations without conducting any inquiry of their own

\- intended as a cease and desist letter to the media-recipients

Page 90

\- Continues to try to attack Giuffre’s credibility

\- Brings up Alan Dershowitz

\- Barden claims it was his opinion Giuffre was lying

\- Q) Do you remember there being a job posting that you felt like was appropriate for Virginia or did you just go out and talk to the woman who ran the spa area on your own? 

\- A) I just talked to Angela. 

\- Q) Okay. Do you recall whether this was intended to be a full-time job? 

\- A) I don't remember if it was full time or just summer jobs or, you know, during season. It was probably for a season because Mar-a-Lago is seasonal. I mean, I was there year round but a lot of people are seasonal, you know, because it's like snowbirds, you know, summertime comes and nobody wants to be down in south Florida. 

\- Q) What would you call the season, the seasonal aspect of Mar-a-Lago? What's the season? 

\- A) Probably from September or October to, you know, maybe May, I guess. 

\- Q) Is that the coolest time? 

\- A) Times of the year, yes. 

\- Q) And it's more guests that come during that period of time? 

\- A) Yes. 

\- Q) And is there more staff brought on during that period of time?

Page 224

\- A) Yes. 

\- Q) You saw that happen every year that you were there? 

\- A) Every year. 

\- Q) And in the summer, it's relatively dead because it's so hot? 

\- A) Basically, it closed during the summer. That's when we would kind of work on everything and then make sure everything is up to snuff for the next year, you know. 

\- Q) Do you remember what capacity Virginia was hired to work in, what her job title was, for example? 

\- A) I don't know. I would have lunch with Virginia. That's about as much as I know about what she did. I was busy all the time. 

\- Q) I understand. 

\- A) I didn't have time to go see what she was doing. I didn't really talk to Angela about what she had to do. I think that was her name, Angela. But it's kind of the name that sticks out.

\- A Where did I learn that? 

\- Q) Uh-huh. 

\- A) I think Virginia had told me that there was a lady in the spa area named Ms. Maxwell. I don't know her. I couldn't tell you what she looked like. But just she said Ms. Maxwell said she can get me a job with Jeffrey Epstein who is a friend of Donald Trump, so I figured, well, he was a good guy or whatever, you know, and that she was going to learn massage therapy. 

\- Q) When did Virginia tell you this? 

\- A) Oh, I can't tell you what date and time but I don't remember.

\- Q I understand. Did she tell you this while she was working at Mar-a-Lago? 

\- A) Yes. I mean, after she had been there for a little bit, you know, and then she told me, yes, that she could possibly get this other job

Page 226

\- **Q) Did you ever meet Jeffrey Epstein?** 

\- **A) Once.** 

\- **Q) When was that?** 

\- **A) I dropped Virginia off at the house once and he came out and I met him and seemed just fine to me. I mean, you can't tell people by looking at them. I mean, I know now from, you know, what I've read that he's not a good guy. But you can't tell. You know, you don't even know your neighbors sometimes, you know.**

\- **Q) Was it about the same time Virginia started working with him?** 

\- **A) Yeah.** 

\- **Q) Was it later?** 

\- **A) I think it was about the time she started. Because I wanted to see where she was at, you know. And it was just a mansion down the street from, you know, Mar-a-Lago. So I didn't think twice about it. I didn't think nothing of it. He came out. He was very cordial, very nice.**

\- Q) Okay. Have you ever met Ms. Maxwell? 

\- A) Not that I remember ever meeting her.

BoxerYan,2019-08-14 06:13:14+00:00,A few words from a mainlander who stands with the people,"First I want to say, stay strong. This movement is for freedom and justice, neither controlled by ""foreign hands"", nor the thugs and criminals, but the people, the heart of this beautiful city.

Chinese government is trying their best to smear this movement and the protesters. We all know how media and internet work in mainland, only lies and exaggeration at best. They have been upping the scale of this propaganda campaign recently, and sadly, people believe them. They would cheer and rejoice when pla tanks roll onto HK streets as if it was 1989.

I know it's hard, but I believe in your cause. Deception and disinformation wouldn't stop the true compassionate ones among mainlanders, and if you could convey a more crystal clear image that what you want is not violence but justice, through your peaceful protests, I'm sure even the mainland will eventually see through this arrogant government that has been blinding and misleading them for years.

About the undercover thing, thats a dirty tactic. Living under this regime for so long, I believe they will use this tactic. So make the world aware that they are trying all-out to destroy your image! Speak out, but don't beat out, I plea you. When mass mentality becomes a thing, violence is usually unavoidable, but you can keep it controlled, I hate to see if this movement devolve into a street war and nothing more.

But that's just the worst case. You are resilient and adamant people, and we all hold this conviction that freedom will prevail. So we should.

You see, I am going stateside for criminal justice study next year, being a cop is actually my lifelong dream, but this time, I don't stand on their side. They are not doing the right thing.

And seeing how ridiculous that beijing just blames it all on foreign influence, the incompetence of this regime and its glory leader is clearly evident. Look, in mainland, although less people cared, the political environment is also deteriorating rapidly. In a few years, there's gonna be almost no room for freedom. You made an excellent example of rising up, because you are braver. When you are no longer misunderstood by the mainlanders, a time of change should come. And that all starts with you.

Remember, the world is watching. The world is with you. I just want to say, I admire you. Hope that this day will eventually come when we, HK and mainland, all live in a country where people's voice actually matters.

ryeander,2019-08-02 16:17:17+00:00,Chinese Auditors Are on the Hook After Clients Are Caught Cooking the Books: “There has long been suspicion that Chinese companies have a tendency to fabricate results when necessary. And that seems to be a well-grounded concern”,"SHANGHAI—An accounting scandal has disrupted dozens of initial public offerings and other fundraising plans in China, intensifying investor concerns about the amount of trust they can place in audited financial results in the country.

In recent weeks, a string of Chinese companies have halted financing plans, with many saying the China Securities Regulatory Commission was investigating their auditor, Ruihua Certified Public Accountants, for suspected violation of securities law. The regulator and Ruihua officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The apparent investigation into Ruihua, China’s second-largest homegrown accounting firm by revenue, follows revelations of overstated earnings by a client.

In May, the securities commission began a probe of Ruihua’s smaller rival GP Certified Public Accountants Co., after finding that GP client Kangmei Pharmaceutical Co. had inflated cash holdings by more than $4 billion.

With economic growth at its slowest since at least 1992, investors and analysts say many companies are experiencing financial distress, which in turn is revealing accounting problems that were easier to hide when credit was freely available and businesses were growing rapidly.

Beijing is probably also pressuring accountants to be more rigorous, they say, especially since foreign investors are now playing a larger role in China’s financial markets.

Economic and market weakness has prompted greater scrutiny of listed companies and auditors, as regulators seek to contain financial risk and “purify the market environment,” said Landing Zhang, chief executive of Shanghai asset-management firm CYAMLAN Investment.

The reliability of financial statements is one of several challenges facing investors in China. There are also question marks over the quality of local credit ratings and official economic data, while critical commentary by analysts and investors is often censored.

Chinese bookkeeping is also a sore point in Washington, since Beijing doesn’t allow U.S. authorities to inspect audits of Chinese companies listed in New York.

“There has long been suspicion that Chinese companies have a tendency to fabricate results when necessary. And that seems to be a well-grounded concern,” said Paul Gillis, an accounting professor at Peking University’s Guanghua School of Management.

Mr. Gillis said part of the reason is that it is extremely difficult to bet against companies by selling stocks short in China. “It’s short sellers who tend to identify most of the fraudulent companies because they have the incentives to do so.”

Auditors declined to endorse—or endorsed only partially—a record 219 annual reports last year, nearly double the 113 in the previous year, according to Wind Information Co., a data provider. These actions suggest an auditor has found issues with the results or has doubts about the company’s status as a going concern.

Earlier this year, the securities commission found a Ruihua client, Kangde Xin Composite Material Group Co., had overstated profits for the four years through 2018 by $1.7 billion. After endorsing Kangde Xin’s financial statements for three years, Ruihua said it couldn’t express any opinion about the most recent annual report. Ruihua has said it completely fulfilled its auditing duties.

Since then, at least 23 listed companies that are Ruihua clients have flagged delays to refinancing plans, which can mean selling shares or convertible bonds, as have 28 IPO candidates. The Shanghai Stock Exchange has also postponed reviews of four Ruihua-linked applications to list on its new Science and Technology Innovation Board.

This is isn’t the first time Ruihua and peers have gotten into trouble. In 2017, the Ministry of Finance and the CSRC suspended Ruihua and rival BDO China from auditing public companies for roughly two months, according to the ministry’s website, after each was hit by two disciplinary actions within two years.

Ruihua was also fined by the market regulator in December 2018 because of problems with a client’s annual reports, and three years ago, served a one-year ban for some work related to the interbank bond market, after failing to assist a regulatory probe into a client that defaulted.

The local arms of international accountancy networks are the largest players in China, but vie with many local outfits, to whom they have lost market share in recent years, according to the Asian Corporate Governance Association.

Firms affiliated with the Big Four—PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Ernst &amp; Young and KPMG—and midtier player BDO are the five largest players.

Their combined revenue made up 26% of the total Chinese accounting market, according to a 2018 report by the Chinese Institute of Certified Public Accountants. In the U.S., arms of the Big Four and BDO audit about half of all listed companies, according to Audit Analytics.

Amy Lin, a Shanghai-based senior analyst at Capital Securities, said the cost of breaking the law was too low in China. The maximum fine for false financial disclosures is 600,000 yuan ($87,000), while the top criminal punishment for hiding or destroying accounting records is a prison term of five years and a fine of up to 200,000 yuan.

On July 26, the market regulator said it would increase prison terms and fines for capital-markets misdeeds, and would revoke licenses of intermediaries, including accounting firms, that failed to fulfill their duties.

“The authorities have a clear intention to use the outburst of financial fraud as an opportunity to clean up the market, partly because they have limited capacity to bail out all the troubled companies,” said Shen Meng, director at Chanson &amp; Co., a Beijing-based boutique investment bank.

Happiquint23,2019-07-16 17:54:07+00:00,So I’m racist because I won’t date your son?,"So for the past couple of years I’ve lived in Beijing with my dad and younger brother. I’ve posted stories before and this is my last encounter with an EP.

I’m casually at work when a young couple walk in with their 3 kids, all teens. The father asked if he could have 5 chocolate cones with vanilla and just a couple drinks from the fridge. Now even though I’ve lived in Beijing for a few years doesn’t mean my Mandarin is up to date. I still struggle a lot but I’m getting better.

No one else was in the shop at the time apart from us and my co-worker so I took my time filling each cone up. When I handed them over the mother whispered under her breath ‘man zhu’ which means slow pig. I was taking back by it as I wasn’t exactly in a rush to fill up each cone on a slow day. 

I noticed one of the boys staring at me. As I went to go grab more ice cream from the fridge he walked over and started to just stare at me. I asked what’s up and he replied with a straight ‘be my girlfriend’. I thought he was joking and laughed it off and went back to my station.

The father pays and I hand over the rest of the cones to his family. They walk away but the father comes back in a couple seconds later and apologises to me. I told him it was nothing and hoped they enjoyed the cones. Not a second later the mother walks back in and throws her cone at me...ice cream all over my uniform. 

She then starts berating me and I could barely translate everything she said. She then spurts out ‘Ni shi zhongzu zhuyi zhe’ which means ‘you racist pig’. Not gonna lie I was shocked and infuriated at her behaviour. Her husband tried to calm her down but she was like a tank. She then went on the lines of how I rejected her son and that it’s because I’m not Asian. 

My co-worker ran out to see this lady in full rage mode and decided to pull out one of the brooms and threatened her to leave the shop immediately. She backed off in a hurry and yelled out ‘ni yongyuan bu hui rang nan pengyou bian de ’ which translates to ‘you'll never get a boyfriend fatty’. Funny enough I’m quite built for my age and all that time in the gym payed off.

Work was fine afterwords and to my surprise the husband came back the next day and profusely apologised to me. According to him one of his kids were ‘irritated’ that I rejected him even when I hadn’t even said yes/no and the mother went into full mama bear mode over my nationality because she thought it was because I’m not Asian...just let that sink in for a moment. 

I’ve never experienced another EP encounter since then but I’d like to point out that no I don’t mean for this to be a rant about China. I loved living there and I’ve moved back to Australia. Thanks you all for reading and have a lovely day.",entitledparents,1815

Our people get paid a living wage, get holiday and sick pay - but I found out that not everyone gets that - and that they don't have their own union. It's totally down to the local factory owner to not be a dick. Workers aren't even mandated to get a share of the business.

jasonrogersusa,2019-05-02 00:33:13+00:00,I'm Jason Rogers — I won a medal at the Olympics but my toughest battle was in the bedroom. Ask me anything!,"In 2008, I did a cool thing: Along with three teammates, I won a silver medal in fencing at the Beijing Olympic Games. When I began writing a memoir about those years, I always had a sense that I should focus on my struggle to deal with the immense pressure of Olympics (I crashed and burned at my first Games in Athens before Beijing). However, as I dug beneath the events of my life during the creative process, I realized that I could not ignore a secret that, until recently, I have hidden from nearly everyone around me. 

Since I was a teen, I have struggled with sexual performance anxiety. It constantly affected my confidence as an athlete, and it is impossible to ignore that my relentless pursuit to become an Olympian was, in some part, motivated by my fears that I was not enough of a man. 

Now, I feel compelled to share my story, not for its own sake, but because I have long seen a trend in sport and culture that I think needs to change. Many men still run outdated mental software that leads them to equate masculinity with winning, materialism, and sexual prowess. And with so many young boys sketching out the map for who they will become as they observe the men around them, I think it’s high time we think about what they are learning. 

You can read more about my story in my recent article for [Men’s Health](https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/a27255036/jason-rogers-olympics-fencing-performance-anxiety/#) or get updates on my forthcoming book at Web: [www.jasonrogers.co](https://jasonrogers.co/) / IG: [@jasonrogersusa](https://www.instagram.com/jasonrogersusa/) / TW: [@jasonrogersusa](https://twitter.com/jasonrogersusa) / FB: [@jasonrogers.co](https://www.facebook.com/jasonrogers.co)

mthmchris,2018-07-19 11:57:13+00:00,"Recipe(s): Guide to Dumplings, from scratch - many fillings, many cooking methods (showing 猪肉大葱, 牛肉茴香, 韭菜鸡蛋)","So we wanted to show you how to make dumplings in the Northern Chinese style – from scratch.

Now, dumplings are one of those things that’re really more of a *category* than a dish itself: walk into a dumpling shop in China, and there’ll be an absolute myriad of fillings that you could choose from. And at many restaurants, you can opt for any of those dumplings to be boiled, steamed, or pan-fried. 

So this post is a touch on the ambitious side. What I’d like to do is generalize the idea of how to go about making dumplings so that you have a framework to play around with it. Of course, the question of ‘how to make dumplings’ is kind of akin to ‘how to make sandwiches’… where do you even begin? Something all-encompassing would be better suited in a textbook than a reddit post. But against my better judgement, I’ll charge forward here, undoubtedly overgeneralizing along the way. So apologies in advance. 

[Video is here if you’d like a visual to follow along](). In the video, we go over how to make the wrappers, three fillings (Pork with Leek, Beef with Common Fennel, and Egg with Jiucai), and how to wrap and boil those. We’ll cover all that here too, but with a bit more background on some of the underlying techniques. 

######How to Make Dumpling Wrappers

So if you got access to a Chinese supermarket, you can usually swoop in and buy a big ‘ol pack of dumpling wrappers. If they’re so easy to buy, why the hell would you make them yourself?

The thing is that dumpling wrappers aren’t, say, like puff pastry where the store bought stuff works just as well. Think of it more like, I don’t know, pre-minced garlic? They work in the sense that everything *works*, but there’s an obvious and marked quality difference between store bought and homemade.

First problem with store bought is that they’re usually rather dry. In an ideal world, there shouldn’t be munch of a lag between the time you roll out the skins and when you wrap the dumpling.  Second problem is that the store bought ones are usually machine rolled – not too much of an issue for something like wontons, but for dumplings it’s quite important for the inner portion of the dumpling wrapper to be a bit thicker than the outside. This not only makes the dumpling easier to wrap, but also allows you to hold a greater quantity of filling without the dumpling potentially breaking on you.

I get that they’re helpful if you’re feeling lazy, no judgement there.  But try to make the wrappers if you can.

**Ingredients, Dumpling Wrappers:**

1.	*Dumpling-flour -or- a lower protein bread flour -or- a mix of all purpose flour and higher protein bread flour, 500g.* So if you’ve got access to dumpling flour, great, use that. If not, take a look at your flour’s protein content. Our dumpling flour clocks in at 12.8%. If you use the King Arthur brand, their bread flour is 12.7%, so that’d work just as well.  Some bread flours can get up to 14% protein, so if you’re working with something heftier like that it’d probably be best to mix in a bit of AP. E.g. if you have 14% bread flour and 10% all purpose flour, mix 70% bread flour with 30% AP to arrive at something like dumpling flour.

2.	*Salt, ½ tsp.* Helps develop the gluten in the dough.

3.	*Egg, 1 medium.* Helps make the dough a bit softer and easier to roll.

4.	*Hot, Boiled Water, 200g.* Right, so dumpling wrappers are a hot water dough. The hot water slightly cooks the gluten in the dough, making the whole thing stretchier for when you’re filling the dumplings.

**Process, Dumpling Wrappers:**

1.	*Mix together the flour, the salt, and the egg.* I used a stand mixer in the video, but you can absolutely do all this by hand.

2.	*Slowly drizzle in the hot water, making sure that all the flour gets some.* If you’re using a stand mixer like me, this step’s dirt easy. Speed one with the hook attachment, drizzle in the water bit by bit, making sure you get all the sides. If you’re kneading by hand, drizzle in the hot water and mix it in with some chopsticks (there’s a good visual for that at [0:46 in our scallion video](https://youtu.be/Iblk2-1QNGM?t=46s if you’re going that route).

3.	*Knead -or- use a stand mixer on speed one for ~8 minutes until a smooth dough forms.* It’ll be smooth when it’s no longer sticking to the sides of the mixing bowl.

4.	*Place in a plastic bag and let rest for at least a half hour, and up to overnight.* To relax the gluten in the dough. We’ve found that a plastic bag keeps the dough much moister than the cover-with-a-wet-towel method.

5.	*Punch a hole in the dough, and get it into a sort of ‘monster-sized Montreal bagel’ shape. Then tear, and roll it a touch thinner.* So the whole idea of getting the dough into a big ring is to basically just get it into a really even round log. If you’re weighing each dumpling skin it’s less imperative, but it still gets you a good starting point for the dumpling skin.

6.	*Cut the dough into 20g pieces, twisting the dough 90 degrees after each cut to help maintain a circular shape.* If you don’t twist, by the end your pieces will be more ‘ovular’ than circular due to the force of the knife. Also, **please note that 20g makes for a rather large dumpling**. We were aiming for the style you can get in Beijing where the dumplings are like these massive ping-pong balls. Most dumpling shops I’ve eaten at are about 10-15g per skin. If you’d like a smaller dumpling, please feel free  to go that route. The advantage of the bigger dumplings is a larger ratio of filling to skin, the disadvantage is that they’re only ‘bite-sized’ for the determined (though if you’re American, you probably got enough practice with large burgers/sandwiches to do the job).

7.	*Press down on the pieces with your palm to slightly flatten them.* Gives you a starting place to roll them into a round shape. If you’re having trouble getting the skins round, you can also slightly roll them from the center out once in each direction.

8.	*Starting with the rolling pin on the board, roll inward, then add a little force for when you’re rolling things back out. Twist around the dumpling skin.* Rolling stuff’s always a bit difficult to describe in writing, so take a look at [3:45 in the video for a visual](https://youtu.be/JBfKsS0ASMo?t=3m45s) of this whole process. The whole idea here is that we’ll want the center of the dumpling skin to be slightly thicker than the outside – the filling will rest on the center (so it’ll need to be a bit sturdier), and you’ll want a thinner edge in order to pleat/seal everything up.

From here, it’s best if you *immediately* wrap up your dumplings. If you’re not interested in learning the fillings, jump down to ‘how to wrap dumplings’.

#######How to Make Meat Fillings

So what I hope you can take away from this post is a basic formula for how to approach your fillings. We’ll toss out two tested recipes, both of which are pretty classic at dumpling joints – pork with leek, and beef with common fennel.

But don’t let that dissuade you from trying different things out. There’s a ton of different combinations that’re popular – [take a look at this menu from a dumpling joint in Beijing](http://qcloud.dpfile.com/pc/ryc1rVgel6ZYJDOUET-Ratniysu14Fie9VLgPyZFNtlCuOLBp4VcPfUu7tXbiRZdTYGVDmosZWTLal1WbWRW3A.jpg). There’s everything from lamb with leek to pork with pickled cabbage. Wanna see if beef with tarragon works? Why not! One you have the basic approach down, there’s a million different directions you can go with this.
As always, quick reminder that there’s more than one way to skin this cat. If you already know how to make dumplings and this contradicts a tried-and-true approach you already know, stick with what you know. For something as widespread as dumplings, there can be a bunch of variation from region to region, household to household, and dish to dish. This is simple our best shot at a generalization based off what we know: 

**Basic Ratios:**

1.	By weight, 9/10 of your filling will be meat and fats, and 1/10 of the filling with be whatever accoutrement you’re added in. This ratio is extremely flexible, I often add more stuff in.

2.	By weight, 2/3 of the meat will be lean and 1/3 will be the ‘fats’.

3.	By weight, 2/3 of the ‘fats’ will be animal fat and 1/3 will be a seasoned oil mixture.

4.	The seasoned oil mixture can contain pretty much whatever you like. We fried leek, star anise, and fennel in peanut oil. The animal fat will be finely diced and added in later.

5.	The lean will be chopped by hand into a paste-like consistency. Pre-minced meat can work but it can be a bit more finicky.

6.	You’ll season the lean and stir it. Seasoning is really up to you – the only mandatory bit is salt. We used salt, sugar, chicken boullion, white pepper, liaojiu (i.e. Shaoxing wine), and soy sauce. Note in place of that seasoned oil, many people opt to simply add spices straight to the meat (usually five spice powder, thirteen spice powder, or specially-sold dumpling seasoning mixes) – you can go that route too, but we feel the spices are a bit more mellow and less in-your-face with the seasoned oil.  

7.	Stir it in one direction only to develop the myocin in the meat, making it a more uniform whole. A big issue in some homemade dumplings from inexperienced cooks is that the meat is far too loose – the goal is something cohesive, not ‘hamburger helper in a dumpling’.

8.	Add in a seasoned water mixture while stirring, a tablespoon at a time. The seasoned water will be roughly the same quantity as your seasoned oil.  For the seasoned water, we opted for some pounded ginger and a touch of Sichuan peppercorn mixed with hot, boiled water.  Some restaurants use stock in place of water. Some households use plain ‘ol water, and just add minced ginger to the filling.

9.	Once the filling is sticky enough where you can see streaks on the side of the bowl, fold in the accoutrement, the diced fat, and the seasoned oil.

So that’s the general idea.  From that framework you can start to play around and experiment with whatever you want to cook. We’ll start off with the pork and leek filling here, apologies in advance when I inevitably repeat myself a bit. The way I’ll organize this is go over the ingredients for the pork first, then the beef, and finally the process (which’s basically the same for both).

**Ingredients, Pork with Leek:**

1.	*Pork ham (后腿肉) -or- belly (五花肉), 315g lean; 135g fat.* So we use the cut of pork called the ‘ham’, which’s from the butt of the pig. It’s a nice cut to use for this because it’s really easy to separate the lean from the fat. Pork belly works great too, it’s just a bit more of a pain to cut.

2.	*Leek (大葱), 1.* A few slices saved for the seasoned oil, the remainder minced.

3.	*Seasoned oil: Peanut oil (花生油), 6 tbsp; Leek (大葱), ~6 slices or so from before; Star Anise (八角), 4; fennel seed (茴香籽), 1 tbsp.* These’ll be fried in the peanut oil and then strained.

4.	*Seasoned water: Hot, Boiled Water, 6 tbsp; Ginger (姜), ~1.5 inches; Sichuan peppercorn (花椒), ~1/2 tsp.* So the burning question – why put the ginger and Sichuan peppercorn in the water instead of the oil? While Sichuan peppercorn’s famous for its numbing quality, it’s also got a nice floral taste to it too. The flavonoids that cause the numbing sensation aren’t water soluble, so if you want the flavor of the peppercorns instead of the numbingness, using this sort of Sichuan peppercorn water’s the way to go. For the ginger, we’re using ginger-water primarily as a replacement for adding minced ginger into the mix – ginger-water has that same sort of raw ginger ‘spiciness’ but with the benefit of not having chunks of ginger in your filling.

5.	*Seasoning: salt, 1 tsp; sugar, 1 tsp; chicken boullion powder (鸡粉), ½ tsp; white pepper powder (白胡椒粉), ¼ tsp; liaojiu a.k.a. Shaoxing wine (料酒), ½ tbsp; light soy sauce (生抽), 1 tbsp.* If you don’t want to use chicken boullion powder, you could swap it for a sprinkle of MSG or skip it.

**Ingredients, Beef with Common Fennel:**

Ok, now with beef we’re breaking some of the rules we set out earlier regarding hand mincing and separating out the lean from the fat. Why? The fat’s much too interspersed within the meat, and beef’s a good bit tougher than pork is. 

So after a few tries, I broke down and had my butcher grind it up for me. I suppose that’s alright in the end though, because now I get to talk about how you’d go about working with pre-ground meat.

For your ground meat… with the approach that we’re going with here (separating out the lean and fat), the leaner the better. As anyone that’s ever cooked a burger over charcoal knows, the fat in ground beef melts really easily – the fattier your ground beef, the greasier the dumpling’ll feel in the end. For us, we were using some ground beef that was around ~20 percent fat in the video. That made a final product that was tasty but a little oily in my personal opinion. So opt for something leaner if it’s an option. Hell, I’d even recommend those 96/4 blends you guys got abroad if I wasn’t so skeptical of the how they processed them.

So your ground meat to diced fat ratio will change depending on how fatty your beef is:

* 90/10: 350g ground beef, 100g beef fat
* 85/15: 370g ground beef, 80g beef fat
* 80/20: 400g ground beef, 50g beef fat
  
1.	*Ground beef brisket (胸口肉) -or- top sirloin (肥牛) -or- chuck (上脑), quantities as above.* So the two cuts that are used most often for dumpling fillings are called ‘xiongkourou’ and ‘feiniu’ –I’ll be totally straight with you, Chinese cuts are a bit different and I’ve had a devil of a time translating those two. In the video we used ‘xiongkourou’, which I erroneously translated as ‘chuck’ in my narration. Whoops. From what I can tell, ‘feiniu’ can refer to a few cuts… but is generally a fatty cut that’s from right below the tenderloin, so I’m 90% sure that’s top sirloin. Regardless, you could use almost any cut you’d like – a buddy of mine even uses shank.  

2.	*Beef fat (牛油) -or- pork fat (猪板油), quantities as above.* So outside of Muslim areas of China, they’ll often use pork fat in these sorts of dumplings. Either works great, we used beef fat to keep everything kosher.

3.	*Common fennel (茴香) -or- dill, ~50g.* So the fennel that’s used is these is ‘common fennel’, not the bulb fennel that’s often used in the West. Not sure how easy it is to source this. Dill’s a touch stronger of a taste but hits many of the same notes – if you were interested in replicating this but didn’t have a way to source common fennel (ironic name, no?), I’d personally try dill. Quick note that that 50g is the amount *after* picking the fennel – a huge chunk of the weight comes from the stems, so you’d likely need to buy ~150g to get to that amount.

4.	*Seasoned oil: Peanut oil (花生油), 6 tbsp; Leek (大葱), ~6 slices or so from before; Star Anise (八角), 4; fennel seed (茴香籽), 1 tbsp.* Same as above.

5.	*Seasoned water: Hot, Boiled Water, 6 tbsp; Ginger (姜), ~1.5 inches; Sichuan peppercorn (花椒), ~1/2 tsp.* Same as above.

6.	*Seasoning: salt, 1 tsp; sugar, 1 tsp; chicken boullion powder (鸡粉), ½ tsp; white pepper powder (白胡椒粉), ¼ tsp; liaojiu a.k.a. Shaoxing wine (料酒), ½ tbsp; light soy sauce (生抽), 1 tbsp.* Same as above.

**Process, Either meat filling:**

1.	*Make the seasoned oil.* Over medium low heat, fry the leek and the star anise for about two minutes. Then add in the fennel seed, and fry for another two minutes – I toss in the fennel later mostly because I’m paranoid that it’ll burn. Strain out the spices, and set it aside to cool completely.

2.	*Make the seasoned water.* Smash your ginger in a mortar or a bowl (or, alternatively, you could mince it), then add in the Sichuan peppercorn. Add in the six tablespoons of hot water, then let it infuse for at least 10 minutes. Strain, and set aside to cool completely.

3.	*Prep the accountrement.* For the pork dumpling, finely mince the leek. For the beef dumpling, pick the leaves off the fennel.

4.	*Dice the animal fat.* Get the pork or beef fat into a fine dice, and set it aside.

5.	*If using meat (i.e. NOT ground meat), get it into chunks and continuously chop it… periodically folding the meat over itself.* Be patient with this step. We’re looking for the meat to become a sort of ‘pasty’ whole. Going at this with two cleavers can make quick work of this. If you’re new to mincing by hand, take a look [at 2:33 in the video](https://youtu.be/JBfKsS0ASMo?t=2m33s) for a visual.

6.	*If using ground meat, use the back of a heavy knife to pound it until pasty.* This is a primary reason why we usually don’t use ground meat for fillings – it generally doesn’t actually save any time. You’ll still need to pound and fold it, just using the back of the knife in place of the front as it’s already choppped. 

7.	*Season the meat, and begin to stir.* I.e. add in the salt, sugar, chicken bouillon powder, white pepper powder, liaojiu wine, and light soy sauce. Stir in one direction only – you can use your hands, but using chopsticks to stir makes things a bit more obvious to see what’s going on.

8.	*Add in the seasoned water one tablespoon at a time, stirring until the meat until it leaves streaks on the side of the bowl.* Another thing that you just gotta take your time with. For the pork, this’ll take about five minutes to get where you wanna be.  For the beef, because we have some fat already mixed in, it’ll take a bit longer – oil gets in the way of your myocin developing, which’s a big reason why we separated out the fat. Ten minutes of stirring should get you there.

9.	*Fold in the accoutrement (i.e. the leek or fennel), the fat dice, and the oil.* Then those are ready to wrap.

#######How to Make Not-meat fillings

So there’s this whole category of dumpling fillings called ‘Su fillings’ (i.e. ‘素饺子馅’) which I haven’t really found a nice translation for yet. While ‘Su’ can often refer to ‘vegetarian’ in Chinese, it can also refer to something that’s ‘light’ or ‘not a meat dish’. And the latter’s what this kind of filling’s referring to.

While a solid chunk of these sorts of dumpling fillings are vegetarian, many of them use stuff like dried shellfish or oyster sauce.  Almost universally in play for the pescatarian crowd out there, however.

Here’s the thing though, they’re bloody difficult to generalize. They can include a combination of anything from smoked bean curd, to fresh shrimp, to mushrooms, to vermicelli rice noodles. And, of course, each of those ingredients has its own variables to consider when prepping.  The best I can give is that (1) the ingredients are usually used reconstituted (if a dried ingredient) or fresh, i.e. not pre-fried (though egg’s an outlier there) (2) there’s *roughly* an equal quantity of each main ingredient in the filling (though I’m using extremely liberal definitions of ‘roughly’ and ‘main ingredient’) and (3) the fresh ingredients are coated with oil, then mixed and seasoned at the last possible second.

So apologies there. The best I can do is give a recipe for one classic kind – Egg with Jiucai (Chinese Chives) – and hope that that gives enough perspective.  For some more options, [check out this translated link of 20 Not-Meat Dumpling recipes](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=destination_language&amp;u=https://www.haocai777.com/Article/ruchu/12698.html) or [here for the original link if you can read Chinese or would rather translate directly within Chrome](https://www.haocai777.com/Article/ruchu/12698.html).

**Ingredients, Egg with Jiucai Filling**

1.	*Jiucai a.k.a. Chinese Chives (韭菜), 250g.* So Jiucai – a.k.a. Chinese Chives (apologies, I irrationally dislike that translation) are a pungent green that’re probably about halfway between a vegetable and an herb. They go great with egg. We’ll need 250g minced, but when prepping you’ll need to chop off the hard ends… so buy 350g just to be safe.

2.	*4 medium eggs.* We’ll be scrambling these.

3.	*Optional: 1 tsp liaojiu wine (料酒).* To mix in with the eggs and season it before scrambling. I always add a bit in, you don’t have to.

4.	*Oil to Coat: 1 tbsp peanut oil (花生油), 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil (麻油).* We’ll be using half sesame oil to add a bit more flavor in here.

5.	*Optional: ½ tsp baking soda (苏打粉).* To mix in with the Jiucai. Helps keep it a nice vibrant green color through cooking.

6.	*Seasoning: 1 tsp salt, ½ tsp chicken bouillon powder (鸡粉).* We’ll be adding these in at the last possible second.

**Process, Eggs with Jiucai:**

1.	*Chop the hard end off the Jiucai, as well as the brown bits on the other side. Wash, then sit out to dry completely.* Jiucai’s often quite dirty/sandy as sold. To wash, soak in water for about 10 minutes, drain the dirty water, then continuously slam the jiucai into a big bowl of water to get any dirt off. Rinse until the water runs clear. Set it aside to dry completely – it’ll take a bit of time (like, hours), so if you’re in a rush opt for a salad spinner.

2.	*Crack the eggs, mix in the optional liaojiu wine, then beat.* Really beat the snot out of those guys until there’s no strands of egg white remaining.

3.	*Scramble the eggs.* You can scramble the eggs using any method you want, just add a bit more oil than you usually would. If using a wok, first *longyau*: i.e. get that wok piping hot, shut off the heat, add in the oil (we used about four tablespoons) and give it a swirl to get a nice non-stick surface. Flame on medium, get the oil up until bubbles begin to form around a pair of chopsticks (about 160C), then pour in your egg. It’ll puff and set, so stir and flip it around… let it set again… stir and flip it around again… continuing the motion until the egg’s ~90% done. Then shut off the heat, give it a good scrambled, and take it out.

4.	*Thinly slice the Jiucai, then coat with the oil and baking soda.* Slice the Jiucai as thin as you can feasibly get it, then mix with the oil and the baking soda. The reason we’re mixing these in with the veg at first is to form a bit of a ‘protective barrier’ so that the Jiucai won’t release moisture as easily while we’re wrapping them.

5.	*As the last possible second before wrapping, mix in the egg, salt, and bouillon powder in with the Jiucai.* Salt makes Jiucai weep like crazy, so as soon as you mix that in, the shot clock’s running.  Do this after you’ve finished rolling some skins and are about ready to wrap.

######How to Wrap Dumplings

Ok, so there’s a bunch of different ways to wrap dumplings. We only did one sort of wrapping in the video – the original, basic sort. It’s the wrapping style that’s usually used at dumpling joints… and to be honest, if you’re boiling dumplings (like we did in the video), it’s probably the best method. It makes for the sturdiest dumpling that’s least likely to break apart when boiling.

If you’d like to fry or (especially) steam your dumplings, the alternative styles give the dumplings much better visual flair. We didn’t include this in our video, so I’ve got two clips for you – first one’s [here](https://youtu.be/W2cAkkrRDT4?t=5m16s), which’s in Chinese but has some old Northeastern women showing how it’s done; second one’s [here](https://youtu.be/84-QPpmIleA), which’s a Portland restaurant owner from Taiwan explaining them in English.  

Also, note that even for this basic style, there’s a few slight variations to the theme. We learned this exact method from a dumpling shop owner downstairs from our apartment, which is a touch different than those Northeastern women in the video, which’s a touch different from the Portland restaurant owner.

1.	*Add 1-1.5 tbsp of filling in the center of the dumpling.* Again, our dumplings were the really big sort, so we used about 1.5 tbsp of filling. If you’re doing the 10-15 gram dumpling skins, then you’re probably aim for about 1 tbsp or a touch less. The goal is to get as much filling as possible in the dumpling without it bursting out, and not a touch more.

2.	*Pull two of the side up to get a sort of ‘taco’ shape, pressing and sealing at the top.* Again, always difficult to describe this sort of process, so check out [4:24 in the video](https://youtu.be/JBfKsS0ASMo?t=4m24s) if you’d prefer a visual.

3.	*Fold one end of the dumpling inward, then seal up the top. Do the same on the other side.* You might need to press a bit of the filling in, that’s normal.

4.	*Optionally add two pleats to the top of the dumpling.* This helps everything seal and makes things ever so slightly good looking.

5.	*Hold the dumpling in between your two thumbs. Press down and slightly inward.* This accomplishes two things: first, it’ll seal the sucker up; second, it’ll add a slight crease in the middle of the dumpling.

Best way to go about this is to roll the skins and wrap the dumplings basically concurrently so that things don’t dry out. So get your friends or family to join in and make a little assembly line.

######How to Cook Dumplings

Four ways to cook dumplings: pan-fry and steam (i.e. ‘pot stickers’), boil then pan-fry (i.e. ‘fried dumplings’), steam, or boil. It seems like I might’ve just listed those in descending order of popularity for Americans, which’s really a shame because I quite like my dumplings boiled.

But they’re all good really. Boiled dumplings have a bit smoother of a texture as compared to steamed dumplings, which have more of a bite to them (though again steamed dumplings are great for the more intense wrapping techniques). Fried dumplings are a bit ‘crispier’ than potstickers, which have that one really crunchy side.

**How to Boil Dumplings:**

1.	*Get a pot of water to a boil, and add in ~1/2 tsp salt.* In an ideal world, the pot wouldn’t be stainless steel – stick pots can easily risk the dumplings, well, sticking to them. If you’re using a stainless steel pot, just periodically make sure that the dumplings aren’t sticking to the bottom.

2.	*Carefully add in the dumplings, then bring the water back to a boil.* Make sure the dumplings aren’t sticking to the bottom when you’re adding them in. Tossing them in one or two at a time is a good idea.

3.	*Add a bit of cool water to get the water back down to a really light simmer, then cover.* I’ve heard different things as to why you should add water – maybe it’s because a heavy boil can potentially break apart the dumplings, maybe it’s because it’ll cook the filling a bit more evenly. Either way, add enough water so it’s no longer boiling, then cover.

4.	*Once it’s boiling again… open the lid, add some water again, then cover.* Continue doing this at least three times in total.  

5.	*Once the dumplings are floating, give them ~30 seconds in the hot water, then take them out.*

**How to Steam Dumplings:**

1.	*Place the dumplings on a lightly oiled plate, then place in a steamer.* The dumplings will not be steamed on a bamboo steamer directly in order to prevent sticking.

2.	*Sprinkle a touch of water over the dumplings.* Not too much, this’s just to help keep the skins from drying out.

3.	*Steam for 15 minutes.* If opting for smaller dumplings, check on them earlier, at ~12 minutes. The dumplings will be done once slightly translucent.

**How to Make Fried Dumplings:**

1.	*Boil the dumplings.* As above. Note that this’s great for leftovers.

2.	*Add about 1cm of oil to a pan and put the flame to medium. Fry the dumpings for ~2min on each of the three sides.* Basically, you’re just looking for the side of the dumpling to get golden brown, then you’ll flip to another side.

IIRC there’s also a way to pan-fry fresh ones, but unfortunately that’s a bit of a blind spot for us.

**How to make pot stickers:**

1.	*Add a thin layer of oil to a pot and put the flame to medium-low. Add in the dumplings.* The side facing down is going to be the crispy side.

2.	*After about two minutes, add enough water to get ~1/3 of the way up the dumpling. Cover.* Water and oil obviously have the potential to sizzle like crazy, which’s why (1) your oil quantity shouldn’t be very high (2) the heat should be rather low and (3) you should be ready with the lid in your hand.

3.	*Cook for ~6 minutes.* If you touch the top of the dumpling, and it’s soft, it should be done.

######Dumpling Dipping Sauce(s)

So in China, the question of what you dip your dumplings in is sort of the cultural equivalent of what you put on a hotdog. There’s two camps: dark vinegar and soy sauce.

In my personal view… the soy sauce camp, like those that put ketchup on hotdogs, are misguided heathens and dark vinegar is ultimately the only correct choice ;) But it’s all personal preference. Steph likes soy sauce.

There’s some really complex dumpling dipping sauces out there, so let’s just zero in on what would be at the table at a standard little dumpling shop:

1.	*Dark Chinese Vinegar (陈醋).* So this’s as good a time as any to make a note that there’s two sorts of dark Chinese vinegar – ‘mature vinegar’ and ‘Chinkiang vinegar’. They’re both aged, and in most recipes we post here they can be used interchangeably. I prefer the ‘mature vinegar’ as a dumpling dipping sauce.

2.	*Youlazi Chili Oil (油辣子).* This’s the Chinese chili oil that’s most commonly found in English language sources. [Mike Chen’s recipe](https://youtu.be/ZlIiADdh-QY) is super popular on YT, and you can also find one within our [Sichuan Liangmian video at 2:26](https://youtu.be/95ENQDE7nvg?t=2m26s).

3.	*Light soy sauce (生抽).* Ideally a nicer one if possible. 

4.	*Garlic.* Either minced or pounded, and mixed with water. ",Cooking,1147

noschooliscool,2018-06-25 01:46:31+00:00,(Long Post) I've attempted a breakdown of Spurs' Heungmin Son and his situation with the military draft of South Korea.,"(This is a long effort post)

I'm generally a casual lurker of r/soccer, and after I've seen https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/8tjb65/tottenham_hotspur_south_korea_professional_heung/ this thread about Son's military situation with so many misleading info from both the article and the comments, I'm going to chime in a bit of info. FYI, I'm a mod of r/kleague and I'm a Korean serving the duty (civic service - which what Son could be doing in the near future) this very moment, so at least I'm qualified to talk about this??

**&lt; What must Son do to be exempt from the South Korean military draft in legal boundaries? (while being able to keep his Korean citizenship?) &gt;**

It's very simple - **Win the Asian Games in Indonesia this August, or seek a medal at the Tokyo olympic games.** Those are the only two options. If he fails to win the tournament this August, his time at Spurs will be over in a very short time. (probably ending at summer 2019 or summer 2020, if he's lucky)

To begin with - let me repeat this - **The Asian Cup (held by the AFC), and the FIFA World Cup  has absolutely no relation with the status of Son's military draft.** 

The logic is that *all athletes, regardless of which sport they play in, should have equal chances of getting military exemptions with their achievements.* The actual reason is, being serious - because of baseball. 

The reason why the entire member of the 2002 Korea squad got exempted was not because it was legally written. Upon receiving the draw of that WC (with Portugal, US and Poland), South Korea was genuinely terrified to face embarrassment as possibly the first host nation to fail to qualify to the knockout stages (keep in mind the first host nation to not qualify to the knockouts was 2010's South Africa). Along with Japan getting a dream draw (with Belgium, Russia and Tunisia), the fear intensified. 

The outcome was the Korean government deciding to hand out a special deal to the Korean squad for 2002 - should they qualify to the round of 16, they are exempt.

And we all know what happened - Jisung Park etc. got exempted from military duty because of their efforts in the group stages.

But the problem started after Korea's national baseball team got to the semifinals of the 1st World Baseball Classic of 2006. Considering Baseball is the No. 1 sport of South Korea, the ego-filled baseball people absolutely could not accept that the footballers (Korea's ""secondary"" sport) were getting military exemptions for ""just"" being out of the group stage in a world cup, while baseball reached the semifinals and weren't getting anything. In their perspective, the World Baseball Classic was starting to be the baseball equivalent of the FIFA World Cup, so by their logic handing the baseball squad of 2006 military exemptions were fair. The majority of the Korean population were/still are baseball fans so the general consensus were also positive.

The military manpower association (the government officials) accepted this and gave millitary exemptions to the baseball squad of 2006. 

What happened afterwards were a series of controversies. Pretty much every single sporting, entertainment organization in Korea, other than football and baseball protested the decision. Among the most vocal were the sporting organizations who competed at the Olympics. For example - the archery players, the judo - taekwondo players, the volleyball, baseball, swimming, badminton, table tennis, hockey ..... all the sports have their own international tournaments akin to the world cup of football, why do they have to face unfair lack of opportunities just because they are playing in an unpopular sport??

So the government came to a conclusion - **only to hand military exemptions to those who excelled at tournaments where every sport can have a fair chance of opportunities.** And that can only mean these 2 tournaments can do that - **Any medal in the Olympics or a gold medal in the Asian Games. (NOT the FIFA World Cup or the AFC Asian Cup)**

By that new guideline, here's what happened - 

Baseball: 2008 Beijing Gold, 2010 Asian Games Gold, 2014 Asian Games Gold - all squad exempt from duty

2009 World Baseball Classic finalists - no exemptions from military duty

Football: 2012 London Bronze, 2014 Asian Games Gold - all squad exempt from duty

2010 FIFA World Cup round of 16 - no exemptions from military duty



**&lt;Then, why does Son only have two more chances, the 2018 Asian Games and the 2020 Olympics? What is the deadline?&gt;**

To preface, Son's birthday is July 8th, 1992.

As per the military manpower association guidelines, a person who has not yet served military duty can legally withhold from duty until the age of 27. (It's the western age 27.) Strictly speaking it's until 24 if you're not doing any studying at a university or working abroad, until 27 if you're working abroad or studying with a working/student visa (you have to repeat this every year until the 27 threshold), and until 28 if you're in Korea doing university scholarship or field work.

Son, as now, fits under the ""working abroad with a working permit from the UK"" status, **his waiver ends with age 27**, so he has to return before he reaches his 28th birthday - which is, very hopefully speaking, around June 2020.

So, brace yourself Spurs fans, **if he doesn't win the 2018 Jakarta Asian games, his time with Spurs will be over in maximum 2 years. (It could possibly be even earlier, like summer 2019, depending on the military manpower association's decisive ruling)** He will likely fail to get a work permit, return to Korea and fight with the slim hope with a bronze at the Tokyo olympics, (he will try every possible legal loop to compete his last chance in Japan) but the chances are slim.

**&lt;Were there any other similar cases with what Son is facing right now?&gt;**

Yes - **Chuyoung Park** with Monaco and Arsenal. He, also, faced the threat of military duty when he reached his age limit in 2011, when he was an AS Monaco player. To loophole this, he got a 10-year residency from the monarchy of Monaco, effectively nullifying his military draft!

This deservedly cased massive controversy, which made the military to revise its guidelines for workers working in foreign countries with a residency visa. Before Chuyoung Park, delaying military duty with a foreign visa was possible. Now the loophole is blocked, it's impossible. (A golf player called Sangmoon Bae, tried this after Park Chuyoung and lost his case in Korea court, and got drafted to the military afterwards) **Son is now impossible to delay his draft with a UK visa.** Sucks even worse for Son, amiright??

**&lt;What club will Son play if the worst happens and he returns to Korea?&gt;**

If there's any more bad news for Son, brace yourself. **Son can NOT play in Korea's domestic K League.**

The reason for this is because he has finished his middle school, **but has not graduated high school.** He spent a few months in a Korean high school(Dongbuk high school) before going to Hamburg.

If he didn't graduate middle school, like **Chungyong Lee** of Crystal Palace(who's exempt from military duty), Son would've been free from all of this in the first place, but how unfortunate is he.

That makes him a 4th-rate manpower, which makes Son qualified for **Civic Service** - which is for men who can't exactly be a soldier, but are not really fit to be exempt either. **He will serve for 2 full years.**

This means Son will not be able to go to the military teams in the K League - Sangju Sangmu FC (1st tier) and Asan Mugunghwa FC (Second tier). **He will not be able to play at a professional level for 2 years.** (He can't repeal the status of the draft to force himself to be in the military army itself because of this either, because what made him civic service in the first place was his high school drop, not because of his physical/mental health)

Men in Civic service are mainly for welfare and government work. Which will mean Son will likely babysit someone in a public kindergarten, take care of old people in dementia clinic or just sit and work in a cubicle inside a government office.

Men in Civic Service MUST work from 9am to 6pm every week, Monday to Friday. This means that Son will not be able to play in the Korea National League (semi-pro league, 3rd tier) because the National League's matchdays are mostly at weekdays.

This means that Son will have to play in the **K3 League** - a 4th tier league for amateurs. All K3 league matchdays are at a Saturday. The league itself is basically an equivalent of England's **Sunday League.** He will likely play in a club with a proximity to Seoul - possibly Hwaseong FC, Yangpyong FC or Pocheon FC, who are the powerhouses(...) of the K3 league.

A player like Son, imagining Son playing in Sunday League...wow....

**&lt;Presuming Son fails at August's Asian Games...is there no hope for him? Is there any other way?&gt;**

There are 2 possible ways.

The first, is **him sustaining a very serious injury.** It is possible to be exempt from the military draft itself, with a very serious injury. The two most common ones are 1) the dislocation of a shoulder (like what Salah got injured by Ramos), or 2) the rupture or an ACL. The problem is that by sustaining these injuries Son will not be the great player that he once was.

The important thing is that this *has to be an accident injury.* Baseball players were caught with actively dislocating their shoulders in 2004, now that loophole is closed.

Another possible way, a more realistic way, is **the Minister of Manpower Association, General Chansoo Ki** (기찬수, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf0DE7WFNjw here's him doing an interview) **making a possible exception for him, and delaying the draft for Son until he plays his prime years at Tottenham.** I consider this outcome most likely.

This is a big call though. The most prominent K-Pop stars like G-Dragon are serving in the army right now. To make an exception for Heungmin Son, while not making exceptions for K-pop stars, will make the fandoms there angry. And you know what happens when you rustle the K-pop beehive....

**&lt;What will happen if he ultimately decides to ignore the draft?&gt;**

He will have extreme difficulty living in Korea's society. The society absolutely upholds military duty to be the most ""fair"". It's ironically the most complete form of Korean social justice. To endanger possibly the most ""fair"" thing in this (still) corrupted country right now will anger many people.

If he has the courage, he can decide to emigrate to a new country. But by doing that he will never be able to set foot on South Korean soil ever again.

She said that someone else in the Obama White House did this, using her security clearance.","Ignoring the Samantha Power bombshell
By Jay Latimer
One of the challenges of Spygate is that it’s such a sprawling, complicated tale, filled with competing narratives and motives open to interpretation. We understand this is a serious situation; possibly the biggest scandal in U.S. history. But how can one get the message across to the average American without his eyes glazing over?

To cut through the complexity, it helps to focus on specific actions by individuals that we all can agree are suspect. Which brings us to Samantha Power.

Of all the political stories from 2017, surely the most curious is this: why is everyone ignoring the bombshell revelations from Samantha Power?

As you recall, Power was caught using her security clearance as a UN ambassador to review private conversations by U.S. citizens. According to official records, she requested the unmasking of these private citizens over 260 times in 2016 (this was an election year). She was brought before the House Intelligence Committee to explain her actions.  

Her defense? It wasn’t me. Someone else in the Obama White House did this, using her security clearance.

There are two possibilities: that she is telling the truth, in which case someone else in the Obama administration is lying. Or she is lying herself.

Let’s consider the implications if she’s lying. Power, a supposed human rights activist and darling of the left, came into her office every day –- Monday through Friday, 52 weeks a year –- and did some reading. But instead of the New York Times, or her favorite blog, she was reading the transcripts of private conversations of her fellow Americans, wiretapped by federal agents. And not only that, but she made a request each day on average to unmask a U.S. citizen in those transcripts.

Why are our supposed human rights activists not horrified? Why is this not a daily banner headline in every major newspaper in the country? I could see the MSM attempting to hide this damning evidence of Obama administration malfeasance, but why are the conservative news outlets not clamoring for answers?

Perhaps 2017 just saw too many revelations of government abuse? But this one does not deserve to be forgotten. And if we don’t act soon it will go down the memory hole.

Here’s how Power’s Wiki page spins it: “On May 31, 2017, Power's testimony and relevant records were subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee as part of its investigation into the unmasking of Americans whose conversations were inadvertently captured during intelligence surveillance.”

There is nothing “inadvertent” about a White House official making over 260 unmasking requests during an election year. And lying about it.

No one, it seems, is asking even the most basic questions: Who was this mysterious, nameless Obama administration official? Why would they use Samantha Power’s security clearance to unmask U.S. citizens? What did they have to hide? And if they were researching something that was purely legal, why the necessity for such subterfuge and deceit?

The only answer that makes sense is that they were using her security clearance for reasons that would not stand up to legal scrutiny, most likely for political or possibly illegal ends. Such as spying on the Trump campaign.

A final thought: Why is Samantha Power herself so seemingly unconcerned about this violation of public trust? Wouldn’t you expect this brave journalist, the winner of the Pulitzer Prize, the champion of the people, to be at least a little bit curious as to exactly who it was in the Obama Administration that stole her passwords and used her security clearance in such a blatantly undemocratic and unlawful manner?

And wouldn’t you expect her to speak up about it?

This week, our offline AMA kicked off with a flurry. We were hoping for 10 quality questions in the first week, instead we received over 30 submissions in the first few days, and to date we have over 40!
 

As I’m sure you could imagine this made it difficult to pick the top 10 questions and we know there are some great questions we have not answers this week! But we have done our best and below are our answers to the questions selected for this week.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

***1\)*** ***Is aelf competing with EOS or ETH directly? What advantages do you have?***

Ethereum is seen as the progression from Bitcoin as Blockchain 2.0 if you will.
 It brings turing complete smart contracts to blockchain so that more complex business logics can be executed.
 However, it's currently struggling with problems such as scalability and governance and the use cases are limited.
 Both aelf and EOS are efforts to solve these remaining problems and both projects add more functionalities so that the next\-gen
 blockchain technology will be easily adopted by businesses. However, it's not accurate to say we are competitors as we approach the problems in different ways
 and the overlap of the use cases of these two projects may be small if there is. aelf's features like resource segregation, cloud computing and customizable side chains
 will enable existing industries to quickly migrate to blockchain as well as enable new forms of businesses in the ecosystem.

***2\)*** ***When will be the mainnet launch for aelf?***

The aelf Mainnet is due for release at the start of Q1 2019, aelf Testnet is due for release in Q3 2018

***3\)*** ***HPB team is developing kind of ASIC unit along with software interface API to achieve highly concurrent computation. For example, single board will be capable to process 10000 TCP/IP connections in parallel \(from HPB whitepaper\). What do you think about hardware acceleration idea, are you going to develop hardware acceleration for yourself, or aelf blockchain structure don't need this?***

The aelf chain will not need this type of hardware as it does not employ PoW. The Mainchain will be running DPoS. In addition to this, each node will be run as a cluster in a cloud computing format. This will eliminate the bottleneck from slower computers and miners in the system by each one running in parallel with all others in the node.

***4\)*** ***How did aelf get its name?***

At the very beginning, we named the project ""Grid"" to reflect the multi\-chain structure. However we soon realized that there is another project called ""Grid plus"" which focuses on energy market. In order to avoid the confusion in the market, Haobo and Zhuling decided to make a name change. Both of them are game players: Zhuling is crazy about Starcraft while Haobo likes Warcraft. Tens of names were proposed from each game and ultimately the ""elf race"" from Warcraft got the attention. To make it more fun, they decided to use an ancient spelling of elf \- aelf as the project name. That's how the legend begins

***5\)*** ***How can we mine the coins? How many algorithms for mining?***

There will be no Proof of Work mining for the Mainchain as it is running DPoS. This will mean rewards are handed out to mining nodes who have been elected into their position by the community voting system. Sidechains may also run DPoS, but they could run PoS, PoW, or other consensus protocols. As such, there may be mining opportunities for these sidechains which are different to the Mainchain, but this will depend on each organisation and the rewards will be in their own coin, not aelf.

***6\)*** ***Is aelf's true purpose Web 4.0? A blockchain based operating system? To run dapps?***

Yes and no, aelf is building a framework which is designed to run dApps through sidechains on the network. This is focused mainly for businesses and other corporations who intent to incorporate blockchain technology into their business. Running as an operating system is more of an example, similar to how lots of businesses run their systems on linux, but it is not a main operating system for everyday public use.

***7\)*** ***Can I bring aelfie to aelf Singapore office to meet the team and take picture?***

Sure, if you happen to be in Singapore you can contact the team to meet for a chat. However, we do recommend aelfie pictures to be creative and fun. That means there are many more places that you can take a picture with aelfie in Singapore.

***8\)*** ***What is a witness? What will be considered as a ""good vote"" by such witnesses?***

***9\)*** ***Do you guys have a calm atmosphere where everyone is doing their job or do you have to be watched to not have too much fun instead of working? just curious***

Our team has one of the best dynamics just like our community. Although the team is quite distributed \(except the tech team is mostly in Beijing\), we responsibly deliver the best to the project and coordiante among each other. Calm is probably not the best word to describe the atmosphere as in Blockchain space, it is really exciting and people are motivated to make diferences.

DriesMertens,2018-03-20 11:41:40+00:00,[OC] I’ve tallied the number of cards shown in the 5 most recent instances of 141 different club rivalries around the world to try to determine the “craziest” rivalries in world football.,"I’ve tallied the number of yellow and red cards shown in the most recent 5 matches between a collection of 141 rival clubs (in all competitions). My main goal here was to use the cards-per-match data to figure out which rivalries are the “craziest”. I know it’s nowhere near the best metric for this purpose, but it was relatively easy to obtain all the data using this metric and I think it’s still accurate for the most part if you look at the results.

---

All data taken from the 5 most recent matches for which soccerpunter.com had card data on record.

I suggest sorting by average yellow/red/total cards in descending order to get a picture of the rivalries ranked from “craziest” to “tamest”.

^^1 This sample was taken over 5 matches from 2010 to 2013. Literally wtf.

^^2 Only includes 3 matches.

^^3 Only includes 4 matches.

^^4 Two of the last 5 matches have ended in 0-3 awarded victories due to fan trouble.

The #1 most-carded rivalry was Universidad de Chile vs. Colo-Colo from 2010 to 2013 — by far. As you can see from the box-and-whisker plots, this select sample was a huge outlier. I was astonished when I saw that streak so I just had to include it.

On the other hand, the “tamest” rivalry (excluding the small-sample West Brom vs. Wolves) in terms of average total cards shown was Brighton &amp; Hove Albion vs. Crystal Palace.

[Link to Excel spreadsheet here](https://sheet.zoho.com/sheet/editor.do?doc=6832ab0661e0a2dabfefe689d67ea169b1662d253a806fa5b571ba7e8ce0afa5124d849707cb3f940a3fa7de77fb4cbb62ee767c4d6a53ccbc2620e8c4fc8bee). I know it throws errors for the average calculations, not sure why. I think if you download the spreadsheet and open it in Excel it should be fine.

---

Sorry for leaving out rivalries like the Casablanca derby and Al Ahly vs. Zamalek, for which I couldn’t find any card data. If you want to include one that isn’t here, give me the card data and I’ll include it. I hope you enjoyed reading this!",soccer,1545

MobileLegendsBB,2017-12-19 13:35:31+00:00,"I used to work on the popular mobile game Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, and I want to talk about about the racism, sexism and lying that persists within the company. Moonton have been trying to silence me the last few days but I will keep going.","Hi all,

I originally posted this on r/gaming over [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/7k5ept/i_used_to_work_for_mobile_legends_bang_bang_the/).  The thread however got locked, so I will post it again here. 

&gt; I worked at Shanghai Moonton, the developers of Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, for a bit more than three months. My main role was to localize the game files for a western audience, manage social media and do some voice stuff. The hours were far tougher comparatively to my home country of Australia, but I did not mind since I wanted something new.
&gt; 
&gt; Discrimination
&gt; 
&gt; Moonton's hiring policy is influenced strongly by race and ethnicity. Moonton wanted to hire a Malaysian and Chinese translator. Most of the applicants of course were Chinese Malaysians, some of them had impeccable backgrounds and experience. We rejected everyone of them. It turns out the COO thought that all Malaysian Chinese, could not truly understand Malaysia as a country. They wanted a 'full blooded Malay' to fill in to this position.
&gt; 
&gt; I also heard that the CEO of our parent company, Elex Tech, gave direct orders to not hire any 'Blacks' as they were all 'criminals' according to him. This meant that all English speaking staff could not be of dark complexion, but White people were given extra marks, as it 'boosted' the image of the company.
&gt; 
&gt; Microtransactions
&gt; 
&gt; The game is totally funded by microtransactions. Most of the revenue comes from the sale of skins and heros. Some of the in-game skins can cost up to $200 USD. These skins are mostly low quality revamps done through Unity, they do provide some extra but barely noticeable stat increases but other than that are mainly cosmetic.
&gt; 
&gt; What was mostly appalling was that the newest hero (they released one every 2 weeks) had to be the strongest by far, so overpowered that if you don't buy it, you will fall behind. Despite the in-game slogan of 'Fair 5v5 MOBA' (which they totally ripped off from Arena of Valor's Chinese version, Wang Zhe Rong Yao), you are heavily incentivised to buy the newest hero. Of course you can purchase heroes using their battle point system, the IP of the Mobile Legends world, but the cap is so small on purpose, you pretty much have to spend money if you want to keep up with the meta.
&gt; 
&gt; One of the most disgusting things was the huge emphasis placed on the 'Lucky Spin' and 'Wheel' elements of purchasing. You spin a wheel to get items and heroes, and usually this meant purchasing the tickets with real money. This game is played by many young kids and was totally exploitative.
&gt; 
&gt; This is a company with over 10 million daily average players. I saw grosses of around 600 thousand to 1.1 million USD a day just from in-game items. Where does this money go? Somedays they spend over a hundred thousand on Facebook just for advertising, you see those cringy ads with the dogs and stuff? yeah they spend that much to spread it around. It's not going back to the community.
&gt; 
&gt; Balancing
&gt; 
&gt; As the game is not available in China, so the development team themselves all use VPNs to try and test out their own game. This means all the balancing ideas are done from point of a view of 100+ ping players. This makes playing Mobile Legends: Bang Bang a huge drag for the team and in the Beijing office, where I worked, most people preferred playing the Chinese version of Arena of Valor. It got to the point that the COO of our company had spent thousands of USD and bought out every single skin in our competitor game.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang fans, if you are wondering why the game's balancing is so bad, it's because we can barely play it without lagging out.
&gt; 
&gt; Work Abuse
&gt; 
&gt; The abusive nature of the executive staff made it hard for employees to make any counterarguments against the discriminatory policies of the company. The HR department said that they were scared to speak out against the policies, as the executives would typically go into tantrums.
&gt; 
&gt; I totally believe them, as everyday the COO would berate and yell at employees, calling them by names. He constantly berates one of our shorter employees for his 5'6 (168cm) height, despite he himself being only 5'7 (170cm), even once saying he must have a small penis in front of everyone 'as a joke'.
&gt; 
&gt; Certain female employees were also hired due to the intimate relations they had with our COO and they were pretty much exempt from doing any proper work, putting the burden on lesser paid employees, who were soon let go as they had to do double the workload. Letting those employees go wasn't the big problem, but more the abuse and mental abuse they go through from the bosses, asking them why they can't do better.
&gt; 
&gt; Plagiarism
&gt; 
&gt; Employees were constantly told to look at other similar games such as Vainglory and Arena of Valor for 'inspiration. This meant that many of our heroes were direct copies with small changes. Even our marketing team was taking ideas from their marketing team.
&gt; 
&gt; TLDR; Moonton is a horrible place to work at and wouldn't hire you based on skin colour, they are also only out there to exploit kids through methods of gambling. All that gambling money then goes into their cringy ad campaigns and barely any into improving the game.
&gt; 
&gt; I could keep going but honestly it'd take me forever....there's a huge issue with sexism as well.
&gt; 
&gt; 

**Moonton's attempt at silencing me**

Anyway after that I went and did an AMA on /r/mobilelegends  You can see it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mobilelegends/comments/7kjbej/ex_moonton_employee_ama/).
This is when Moonton starts to trying to silence me. I've heard rumours of lawsuits and other ideas they were cooking up in the background. They wanted 咬回一口 or ""take a bite back"" basically take a shot at me. I felt horrible for all the former native Chinese employees of the company, may of whom are scared to express their opinions due to the influence that Moonton executives have within the industry.

After a while, moderators started messaging me, asking if I was the real person on the account. One moderator said that Moonton were claiming the official Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Reddit was hacked.

Picture proof: [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/LfURLjY.jpg)

That didn't actually trick the moderators, then they started called the moderators through WhatsApp, saying I was not the one who had given them the special in-game Avatar Borders for their service etc and tried to posthumously badmouth me as just a 'bad translator'.

Picture proof: [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Jd17J3i.jpg)

Moonton wanted them to delete the thread but I guess the moderators knew Moonton's story didn't add up and they just suspended me from the subreddit and left the post there.

Either way, Moonton is lying...because am I a 'hacker' or am I a 'bad translator'? You decide, because I was given this account on August the 17th this year, because no one could be bothered to interact with the Reddit community. You can check the posting history and see the gaps in posting before that.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The issue that still really bothers me is the discriminatory hiring policy, which I heard they might be changing now (which is good that they've learned something) and the non-stop copying from games like League of Legends, Vainglory, Arena of Valor and so on. Their newest Battlerite clone ripoff will surely hit similar hurdles of IP infringement, but who knows.

Operation: Scorched Earth—Israeli Shin Bet Yamas
-
Yamas (Hebrew: יחידת המסתערבים‎‎, Yehidat HaMista'arvim) is a special operations unit attached to the Israeli Border Police, but directly subordinate to Shin Bet. A secret unit, its personnel do not wear uniforms and are not allowed to disclose their membership of the organization. (Wikipedia)

Secret service taken to the extreme, next to nothing is publicly known about these elite operators. Numbers? Classified. Operational readiness? Classified. Deployment history? Classified. Even their level of funding cannot be accurately estimated. So when Rainbow went to Israel to recruit the best of the best, the choice was pretty obvious. Now attached to Rainbow, the operators Selah ""Wildfire"" David and Ishmael ""Razor"" Kaplowitz stand ready to destroy all who may oppose the sovereign security of Israel, and will not accept defeat as an option.

######Attacker: Selah ""Wildfire"" David######
1 Armor, 3 speed

Primary weapon: IMI Galatz DMR or IMI Negev LMG

Secondary weapon: G22 .40cal or G18 9mm

Gadget: Breach charges or Smoke grenades

Special ability: Wildfire carries a specialized incendiary charge that, when attached to a flammable material such as wood, plaster, or drywall, starts a medium speed burn that will eventually, if not cut off, consume the entire floor or wall it is placed on. The charge cannot burn through metal supports or ceramic tile, and can be ""cut off"" if its path is manually destroyed (leaving it with nothing to burn) or if the point it began its burn at is destroyed before it spreads. If a floor or wall has two layers, it will burn through both. She carries one of these charges with her kit.

######Defender: Ishmael ""Razor"" Kaplowitz######
2 armor, 2 speed

Primary weapon: IWI X95 MTAR or Armsel DAO12 Stryker

Secondary weapon: G22 .40cal or G18 9mm

Gadget: Deployable shield or barbed wire

Special ability: wrapped around his left arm, Razor wears a rolled up, partitioned, magnetically reactive riot shield. Made of bullet resistant glass and containing deployable magnetic fibers, the shield can be extended with the push of a button. Like any ballistic shield, he can ADS with his sidearm, but is forced into a severely inaccurate hipfire with his primary weapon equipped (though he can use his shield and primary together, it's just not very effective). The shield is not large enough to cover his entire body, forcing him to choose between exposing his head (more accurate fire) or legs (less chance of getting domed) the same way Capitão chooses his bolts. Movement speed is reduced to 1 while the shield is deployed, and it has 300 health.

######Map: Safehouse, Tel Aviv######
A smallish, House style map consisting of two floors, a sub level op center, and a heavily destructible interior environment, this map favors chaotic, close quarters combat and rewards players with good map knowledge and fast reflexes. The trick here is to not blink: between the collapsing floors, burning walls, scorching hot earth and baking Israeli sun, you might miss something.

Operation: Broken Diamond—Mexican CdFE
-
The Mexican Cuerpo de Fuerzas Especiales (Special Forces Corps) is a special forces unit of the Mexican Army. Formerly the GAFE (Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales | Special Forces Airmobile Group), the SF Corps has six battalions; one is the Fuerza especial de reaccion, a quick response unit, and one is assigned to the Paratroopers Rifle Brigade; the motto of the SF Corps is Todo por México (Everything for Mexico). Within the SF Corps, there are regular, intermediate, and veteran service troops. The  soldiers usually operate as light infantry. The intermediate service soldiers (lieutenants and captains) usually are instructors. The veteran service soldiers of the Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales del Alto Mando (GAFE High Command) handle Black Ops missions. Also known as the COIFE, the Special Forces Corps of the Mexican Army is equivalent to the U.S. Army Special Forces. Wikipedia

The White Masks have recently began looking for funding outside of their normal operating procedures—drugs. Lots and lots of drugs. Without access to that money, the White Masks are almost nothing more than a blog. Rainbow, I'm sending you to cut off the head of this snake in Mexico. Joining your for the op are two of the country's finest, hailing from the Special Forces Corps. They've been fighting these drug lords for a while, and have taken the fight to the terrorists since day one. You'll find few more loyal allies. Meet Marco ""Acero"" Ramirez and Alicia ""Reina"" Flores. Gear up, Operators. We've got work to do.

######Attacker: Marco ""Acero"" Ramirez######
1 Armor 3 speed

Primary weapon: H&amp;K PSG1

Secondary weapon: P7M13 9mm

Gadgets​: Claymore or flashbang

Special ability: Acero loads a special explosive round into his rifle, one at a time. When fired, the round will travel through two pieces of destroyable cover or until it impacts a body, indestructible surface, or reinforced wall. When it hits a reinforced wall as intended, the round will prime for 1 second and then detonate, leaving a single hole roughly the size of 1 X-KAIROS pellet. Acero carries 5 such rounds in his kit, ensuring that he cannot breach a reinforced wall by himself—he can only open it.

######Defender: Alicia ""Reina"" Flores######
3 armor 1 speed

Primary weapon: FAMAE SAF 9mm SMG or AA-12 shotgun

Secondary weapon: P7M13 9mm

Gadget: Barbed wire or Nitro Cell

Special ability: Reina can place down up to 4 high powered electromagnets on floors and walls in the same way Jäger can place down his ADS. Instead of destroying the grenade, the device pulls the grenade towards itself. A lethal (frag or cluster charge) will destroy the magnet, but non-lethals will not. The grenade will still go off, but simply while being pulled in or attached to the magnet.

######Map: Cartel, outside Ciudad Juarez######
Taking place inside of a drug kingpin's hacienda, Cartel offers medium range sight lines in the foyer, CQC in the drug tunnels, and plenty of exterior shacks and huts for Glaz and Acero to have plenty of fun.

Operation: Fallen Tide—Australian SOCOMD
-
The Special Operations Command (SOCOMD) is a command within the Australian Defence Force (ADF). Special Operations Command was established on 5 May 2003 to unite all of the Australian Army Special forces units and by 2008 was fully operational.[2][3][4] Australia's Special Operations Command is of equivalent status to Australia's Maritime, Land and Air Commands.[2] It is modelled on the equivalent commands in the United States and British militaries. Led by a Major General (Special Operations Commander Australia, SOCAUST). Wikipedia

Rainbow, you're going down under. We've received actionable intelligence that the White Masks are attempting to secure several points of coastline along Australian territory. That much sea access, if left unchecked, could be disastrous for global counterterrorism operations around the globe. Help secure their country, and the Australian SOCOMD has promised to of their best to our mission. Meet up with Jamison “Dragon” Rutledge and Chloe “Angel” Williams and make sure it gets done.

######Attacker: Jamison “Dragon” Rutledge######
2 armor 2 speed

Primary weapon: FN Herstal F2000, H&amp;K G36SV-SL8 DMR, or 
KelTec KSG12

Secondary weapon: SL9mk3 sidearm

Gadget: Frag Grenade or Breach Charge

Ability: Dragon replaces his standard drones with hover capable airborne variants, capable of reaching places other drones cannot. In addition, each drone is loaded with 2 tracking darts. When a dart is placed on an enemy, they transmit real time position data, Caveira Style, to the attacking team for 5 seconds. After the 5 seconds, that target is immune to the effects for an additional 30 seconds. If the drone is destroyed, the tracking signal is lost.

######Defender: Chloe “Angel” Williams######
2 armor 2 speed

Primary weapon: Steyr AUGA3 XS-Para or KelTec KSG12

Secondary weapon: SL9mk3 sidearm

2 armor 2 speed

Gadget: Barbed wire or nitro cell

Ability: Angel is equipped with a grenade launcher loaded with 2 cluster flashbang grenades. After being fired, these grenades are armed by hitting a surface or person, then detonate 1.5 seconds later. The charge then spits out 9 flashbangs in various directions which are all less intense than their attacking counterpart, but with a shorter fuse.

######Map: Carrier, off the Western coast of Australia######

Some metallic hulls are less destructible (but still destructible) than wood and drywall, and the floor to floor bulkheads won't be quite as clean as regular trapdoors. If you listen closely, you can hear fighting in other areas of the ship (at least for prep phase).

Operation: White Storm—Ukrainian Alpha Group
-
Like all post Soviet states, Ukraine inherited its special forces (Spetsnaz) units from the remnants of the Soviet armed forces, GRU and KGB units. Ukraine now maintains its own Spetsnaz structure under the control of the Ministry of Interior, and under the Ministry of Defense, while the Security Service of Ukraine maintains its own Spetsnaz force, the Alpha group. The term ""Alpha"" is also used by many other post Soviet states such as Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan as these units are based on the Soviet Union's Alpha Group. Ukraine's Berkut special police force gained mainstream attention during the 2014 Ukrainian revolution as it was one of the main forces used by the government to quell the uprising. Ukraine relies on Spetsnaz forces for various activities from intelligence gathering, fighting fraud and organized crime, responding to terrorism, electronic warfare, as well as responding to mass protests. Wikipedia

Rainbow, I wish I had good news. Kiev has been attacked by the White Masks. Casualties are still counting, but estimates already place it at several hundred dead after a radiological weapon detonated at a Victory Day parade that who even knows how many people watched. Luckily, Ukrainian Intelligence has tracked the materials back to a source. Not so luckily, the materials came from Chernobyl. Yeah, that Chernobyl. Alpha Group has already prepped a team to hit the main operating base of the White Mask cell responsible, and they're requesting backup. This is the first time we've had to respond to a homeland attack on allied soil since Bartlett. Wipe them out. Natalia “Obrazet” Vann and Alexi “Havok” Yevtukh will brief you en route. Godspeed, Rainbow.

######Attacker: Natalia “Obraza” Vann######
3 armor 1 speed

Primary weapon: CZ805 BREN A2, SKS DMR, or FORT 500T 
shotgun

Secondary weapon: FORT17 or Serbu Super Shorty 12g

Gadget: Breach Charge or Smoke grenade

Ability: Obraza can fire a single shot from a unique, custom grenade launcher loaded with a soft-penetration thermal imaging camera. When fired onto a soft wall or floor, the camera will pierce through one layer and then imbed itself in between the two layers of the structure, then activate. While active, the camera is accessible to all teammates and can see through the wall or floor it’s placed in, as well as one additional soft surface beyond it using full spectrum (black-blue-green-red-white) thermal imaging.

######Defender: Alexi “Havok” Yevtukh######
1 Armor 3 speed

Primary weapon: FORT-224 9mm, AKS-74U, or FORT500T

Secondary weapon: FORT17 or Serbu Super Shorty 12g

Gadget: impact grenades or deployable shield

Ability: Havok can place up to 4 RFID traps on the sides of doors or windows. If an attacker passes through a trap, a tag (a la Jackal) will be placed on their position every 5 seconds for 20 seconds. The trap Israel is simply an RFID sprayer mounted to the side of the entrance, and makes a very distinct sound when discharged. Each trap can only yeah one enemy and cannot ID. The trap can be destroyed with an EMP, bullets, or frags, but not by breach charges or Ash grenades. A tag can be removed via EMP or death.

######Map: Warehouse, location unspecified######

Operation: Frozen Sun—South African Recces
-
The South African Special Forces Brigade, colloquially known as the Recces, is South Africa's principal special operations unit and counterinsurgency elite, specialising in combat reconnaissance as well as unconventional parachute techniques. Only about 8% of recruits who undergo South African special forces training pass the course. Wikipedia

Rainbow, I think we got them. Yesterday, South African police intercepted a phone call from a known White Mask agent which suggested that they may be planning a strike soon on a government run diamond mine. By all accounts, no such thing has happened yet, so this may be our opportunity. I want you to travel to South Africa, rendezvous with the Recces operators, and lick that place down. If possible, secure the Commander and​ see what​he knows. I want them running scared.

######Attacker: Amose “Nakala” Louw######
2 armor 2 speed

Primary weapon: Barrett REC7 Commando or SRM 1216 shotgun

Secondary weapon: .410 Judge or Mateba revolver

Gadget: claymore or smoke grenade

Ability: after working undercover for several years, Nakala feels uncomfortable using only one kit. Instead, he prefers to be whatever is needed to best get the job done. Once per round, Nakala can retrieve the gadget off of a dead ally or injured enemy—for instance, he may pick up Hibana’s launcher or the controller to Echo’s YOKAI. He can only switch once, and for a teammate, they must be dead—for an enemy, downed, but not out. Nakala cannot retrieve gadgets from attackers who have been teamkilled, they must have died to enemy fire.

######Defender: Imanathi “Phantom” Ebrahim######
3 armor 1 speed

Primary weapon: Beretta MX4 or SRM 1216

Secondary weapon: .410 Judge or Mateba revolver

Gadget: Impact grenade or deployable shield

Ability: Phantom is able to is special EMR goggles to see electronic devices at close range, similar to in SC:DA. While viewing through her goggles, Phantom is also able to hack Attackers drones, revealing the positions of all remaining drones and allowing Defenders to view the drone on their camera feed as well as taking control of the drone itself. These goggles can see through walls out to 5 meters, and have a maximum range of 10 meters.

Operation: Rising King—Egyptian TF777
-
Unit 777 (Arabic: الوحدة 777 قتال‎‎), also known as Task Force 777, is an Egyptian military counterterrorism and special operations unit. It was created in 1978 by the government of Anwar Sadat in response to concerns of increased terrorist activity following the expulsion of Soviet military advisors from the country by Sadat and his efforts to achieve peace with Israel. Wikipedia

I don't know how to say it, Rainbow, so I'll just say it. The White Masks took the Suez Canal. No one knows how, it's like they just walked in like they owned the place. The point is, we can't let them keep it. You know more about this enemy than anyone, so the Egyptian government is happy to lend any support they can, including two 777 operators. Best of the Egyptian best, Anum “Pharaoh” Zaid and Zahra “Ruin” Anat. And Rainbow? Give those sick bastards a bullet from me, would you?

######Attacker: Anum “Pharaoh” Zaid######
3 armor 1 speed

Primary weapon: Colt M16A4, Izhmash AK104, or H&amp;K Fabarm FP6 shotgun

Secondary weapon: Helwan 920

Gadget: Breach Charge or Claymore

Ability: in addition to his standard drones, Pharaoh uses a custom built drone (cannot be used in prep phase) with a very special effect: at any time before it is destroyed, it can be self destructed to release a powerful concussive blast, similar to Echo, over a significant radius. However, once detonated, the drone cannot be used again, and if destroyed, it cannot detonate. It does require a 2.5 second charge before detonation.

######Defender: Zahra “Ruin” Anat######
3 armor 1 speed

Primary weapon: PT Pindad PM2 or H&amp;K Fabarm FP6.

Secondary weapon: Helwan 920

Gadget: nitro cell or barbed wire

Ability: Ruin can secure up to 2 trapdoors with a device that will, once placed, destroy the trapdoor underneath. After doing this, the trap will automatically open when a defender is standing over it, or if they die on top of it, dropping them safely into the room below. After dropping the defender, the hatch will remain open for 1 second before reclosing itself. These trapdoors are considered reinforced and require an incendiary explosive to breach.

Operation: Dark Forest—Indian NSG
-
The National Security Guards (NSG) is a commando unit originally created for counterterrorism and hostage rescue missions. Raised in 1986, it is popularly known as the ""Black Cats"" for the uniform worn by its operators. Like most military and elite security units in India, it is media shy and the general Indian public is largely unaware of its capabilities and operational details. Wikipedia

Well, Rainbow, this is it. Everything we've trained for, everything we've done, it all leads up to this. At approximately 0300 this morning, the White Masks made a desperate play—they've taken an Indian nuclear launch facility near the Pakistani border. We don't know how they got in, or how many they have, but our best intel suggests they hit it with everything they have, and they're currently preparing for an allout war. I won't​ lie to you, this will be the hardest mission of your careers. But we cannot let them use that facility, it's just not an option. Rainbow, millions of lives are depending on our success today. Gear up, meet with the two NSG operatives they sent us, and bring this home. And I'll happily accept your retirement after this.

######Attacker: Shiva ""Siren"" Bassi######
3 armor 1 speed

Primary weapon: INSASAR, INSAS-LMG, or USAS12 shotgun

Secondary weapon: GCIM No. 1 .50GI

Gadget: Smoke grenade or flashbang

Ability: Siren carries two dual use antipersonnel mines. When placed onto the ground, the Siren mine will fire it's payload 15 feet (1.5 standard building stories) into the air. If the charge does not impact anything, it will detonate in midair, sending tungsten shrapnel flying outwards from the device like a supercharged frag grenade. This mode of detonation is best used when placed under trapdoors or when fired through steel support beams. If the payload does impact a surface, it will stick there, and after 1.5 seconds, arm itself to be remote detonated. When detonated in this position, the shrapnel fires in a cone shape downwards, guarding doors and other breach points.

######Defender: Imran ""Hornet"" Atwal######
3 armor 1 speed

Primary weapon: MSMC 5.56x30 or USAS12 shotgun

Secondary weapon: GCIM No. 1 .50GI

Gadget: Impact grenade or barbed wire

Ability: when the prep phase is over, Hornet can move to any open exterior window and deploy a large-ish drone, called WASP, out into the approach. Once deployed, WASP will wait 10 seconds​ before cloaking (similar to YOKAI), flying out to a fair distance, and it will start orbiting the building at a medium speed (1 orbit/~45 seconds). WASP can then be viewed as a camera by any Defender. While viewing through WASP's camera, Hornet himself is able to adjust the minimum elevation and maximum orbit distance, though it cannot go lower than 15 feet and no closer than 20 feet. Although cloaked, WASP still makes a fair bit of noise as Attackers get closer to it. Lastly, WASP has 250 health, and the cloak is temporarily ​deactivated for one second if it is struck.

Operation: Hard Gravity—Chinese PLASOF
-
The People's Liberation Army Special Operations Forces (simplified Chinese: 中国特种部队; traditional Chinese: 中國特種部隊; pinyin: Zhōngguó tèzhǒng bùduì) is the special forces branch of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Ground Force. It specialises in rapid reaction combat in a limited regional war under high tech conditions, commando operations, counterterrorism, and intelligence gathering. Although the size of the Special Operations Forces is classified, it is estimated to number 7,000 ~ 14,000 troops. Wikipedia

You ever find a weapon that you really know the world would be a better place without? Yeah, me too. White Masks are trying to make a play in China. Intel says they're using an abandoned PLA camp to make homemade Sarin— they have the materials and knowhow, so I'm calling this actionable. Word is, they want to release it into the Beijing water supply, try to kill off government as much as they can. Obviously, not happening. I won't lie, I had to call in a few favors to approve the op, and PLA is giving two of their own, but I know you'll get it done.

######Attacker: Tao “Yîncáng” Zhang######
3 armor 1 speed

Primary weapon: QBZ95B or HAWK12G
Secondary weapon: QSZ97

Secondary gadget: Breach Charge or claymore

Special ability: Yîncáng can equip a QLZ87 automatic grenade launcher loaded with 3 special “homebrew” tear gas grenades. When fired, the grenades occupy slightly less area than Smoke, and do not deal damage. Instead, the longer a target is in the gas, the more distorted their vision becomes, and the greater effect it has on their accuracy (heavier and heavier recoil). When stepping out of the gas, recovery time is based on how much time was spent in the cloud, and the cloud self disperses after 20 seconds.

######Defender: Xia “Pàotǎ” Dan######
3 armor 1 speed

Primary weapon: Type 79 or HAWK12G

Secondary weapon: QSZ97

Secondary gadget: Deployable shield or impact grenades

Special ability: Pàotǎ can place down a specialized remote turret,  holding 50 rounds with a base damage of 25 per shot firing at 450 RPM. After the 50 rounds has been fired, the turret will need to be reloaded and can do so 2 times. The turret have 600 health and are made to deter more than kill. If an Attacker gets behind the turret, they can remotely deactivate it, and Pàotǎ would have to reactivate. It is disabled, but not destroyed, by EMPs and accessible only to Pàotǎ via camera feed. It uses a headshot multiplier of 1.5x damage (with range and armor factored in) and has a large amount of spread, similar to hipfiring with a riot shield.

Operation: Noble Scars, Swiss TIGRIS
-
The exact budget allocated to the unit has been made classified by the Federal Office of Police, only being known as part of its allocated budget. Due to their covert origin, Swiss media has called them Supercops. As of 2009, TIGRIS operators have been deployed for 130 operations in Switzerland.No shots have been fired by TIGRIS during these operations. Wikipedia

You know all those old stories about Germans and Allies ending up becoming friends in Swiss hospitals during World War II? Which I could say that was the case, but something tells me these White Masks don't want to be friends. You know how I know that, Rainbow? Because this morning they car bombed a goddamned hospital. Suddenly, our Swiss friends don't seem so keen on neutrality. Link up with TIGRIS forces sent to secure that hospital. They'll want help with those Masks, and we need them on our side. Dismissed.

######Attacker: Birgit ""Hydra"" Sankt######
2 armor 2 speed

Primary weapon: H&amp;K HK416A511DS, KelTec RFB DMR, or Mehrzweckgewehr 91 shotgun

Secondary weapon: SP2022 .40SW

Secondary gadget: Smoke grenade or claymore

Ability: Hydra can place down up to 10 linear meters of water dampened high penetration DetCord onto breakable walls and floors. Being water dampened, it detonates much quieter than traditional explosives (more Mira than Kapkan, if that makes sense), and the high pressure jet can cut through steel wall supports (like in House's laundry room).

######Defender: Markus ""Gryphon"" Faust######
3 armor 1 speed

Primary weapon: AR57 or Mehrzweckgewehr 91

Secondary weapon: SP2022 .40SW

Secondary gadget: Barbed wire or impact grenade

Ability: Gryphon can place down a special deployable pillbox, standing only a few feet tall and measuring 2.5 meters across, this semicircular structure is made of a high density tungsten alloy and is completely bulletproof with an explosive resistance of 200 (2 frags, 2 Ash rounds, etc.) on the outside. There are three slits for the occupant to fire out of, and the pillbox can be crouched in to avoid fire. It cannot be paced directly against the wall, so there must be room to climb in (climbing in is its own action, like getting on a turret), and if a grenade finds its way inside, the pillbox will be destroyed.

Operation: Crashing Dagger—Dutch KMar
-
The Koninklijke Marechaussee (KMar) (Royal Gendarmerie) is one of the four services of the Armed forces of the Netherlands. It is a gendarmerie — that is, a military organisation which conducts the duties of a normal police force as well as being the police force to the armed forces. The Marechaussee is a fully military force under the responsibility of the Ministry of Defence. However it does not answer to the Chief of the Defence Staff, but directly to the minister of defence (to secure independence and impartiality when enforcing military law). Wikipedia

I'll keep it brief, I need all of you on the tarmac as soon as possible. 18 hours ago, I got a message from a man calling himself ""The Advocate"", complete with both pictures and coordinates of a facility being used by the White Masks as a storage depot for those damn gas bombs they use. It's on an island just off the coast of the Netherlands. Given your expertise, the Dutch have agreed to allow you to run the op on their soil. Go there, dig up anything you can on where the weapons are being made, and secure the site for recovery​. Keep it clean, quiet, and make sure everyone comes home. If everything goes according to plan, we've new allies in our pocket and taken out a massive White Masks asset. Now, go!

######Attacker: Daan ""Shockwave"" van Dekken######
2 armor 2 speed

Primary weapon: SIG SG510 or FN TPS shotgun

Secondary weapon: Glock 41 .45ACP Competition

Secondary gadget: Breach Charge or Smoke grenade

Special ability: Shockwave can place 2 Electronic Distortion Devices onto walls and floor. When triggered, the device will will flood enemy radios within 20 feet with an impenetrable white noise, completely deafening them and causing mild vision distortion for 5 seconds. If there is a signal jammer between the device and its target, it will be ineffective. After the 5 seconds is up, Shockwave must wait another 45 seconds until the device recalibrates to the Defenders' new radio frequency. Full recovery time is 6.5 seconds.

######Defender: Piet ""Nomad"" Jongerius######
1 Armor 3 speed

Primary weapon: AAS Honey Badger PDW or FN TPS shotgun

Secondary weapon: Glock 41.45ACP Competition

Secondary gadget: Impact grenade or barbed wire

Ability: Legion can place up to three prototype sonar spikes into any breakable floor or wall. After being placed and triggered, the device will give off 6 sonar pings at 5 second intervals that will place a mark of the her operator icon on enemy positions within 30 feet similar to Jackal. While the Attackers are not notified with a prompt, the sonar ping is both very loud and very distinctive, letting everyone know that the ping is currently in progress. In addition, if the device is found before the 30 seconds is up, it can be destroyed by any Attacker.

Operation: Thunder's Wake—Argentine 602 Commandos
-
The modern Argentine Military Forces are fully committed to international peacekeeping under United Nations mandates, humanitarian aid on emergencies relief and support the country's continuous presence at Antarctica. Democratic governments since 1983 straightened the military budget and did not approve any large scale equipment purchases. Argentina military spending is one of the lowest of South America and as of 2010, its 0.9% of GDP only exceeds Suriname. Since the 2000s, the Argentine defense industry was relaunched after the politics of privatization carried out during the 1990s by Carlos Menem administration virtually eliminated all. While Mercosur is only an economic entity so far, the strengthening of confidence among the member countries has been beneficial to the peace in the region, exercising a useful role in supporting democracy. The Mercosur served, for example, to discourage the Paraguayan military from an attempted coup in early 2000. In 2003, for the first time, the Argentine Navy (classified as major non NATO ally) interoperated with a United States Navy battlegroup when destroyer ARA Sarandí (D13) joined the USS Enterprise Carrier Strike Group and Destroyer Squadron 18 as a part of Exercise Solid Step during their tour in the Mediterranean Sea. Wikipedia

Alright, Rainbow. Good news, bad news. The bad news is that the Argentine Ministry of Security has officially confirmed White Masks presence on their sovereign soil. Good news is, they don't seem to be doing much. In fact, all they really seem to be doing is scouting out some old weather monitoring stations up in the mountains. Yeah, that's it. Nothing has happened yet, and I really, really don't like that. Go down there and put a stop to it. I'm sure I don't need to remind you all of the incredible efforts of the Argentinians during world peacekeeping operations recently, so you know they'll be tremendous allies. I'm counting on you. Get it done.

######Attacker: Sofiá ""Lanza"" Ruiz######
2 armor 2 speed

Primary weapon: Full clear polymer police issue riot shield

Secondary weapon: Colt Python .44 revolver or Bersa Thunder .380ACP

Secondary gadget: Smoke grenade or Claymore

Special ability: Lanza wears a pneumatic grappling hook on her right wrist. When activated, this hook can do one of three things. 1.) When fired at wooden barricades or destructible walls, the grapple will tear down the barricade or open the wall with a hole similar in size to Ash. When used in this way, the hook has a limited range of 20 feet. 2.) When fired at enemy operators, the hook will begin pulling them into Lanza, ending once in melee range. A Defender can break free of the grapple by knifing the rope or if Lanza dies. Alternatively, going prone will stop the movement of the hook, but not free you from it. When used in this way, the hook has a limited range of 20 feet. 3.) When standing next to a wall that can be rappelled up, the hook will fire straight up and transport Lanza to the top of the wall she is rappelling at the same speed of a ""quick descent"" while rappelling down. Because of the force needed to use the hook in these ways, it can be used a maximum of 10 times. In addition to the grappling hook, Lanza's shield also provides her with an ability. While facing a wooden barricaded window that is placed on the same level she is standing, she can take one action to both break the barricade and vault through the window. If she is rappelling on the window, she will swing in shield first to break it.

######Defender: Mateo ""Cazador"" Acevedo######
2 armor 2 speed

Primary weapon: Colt RO635 9mm or M870MAG14""

Secondary weapon: Colt Python .44 revolver or Bersa Thunder .380ACP

Secondary Gadget: Impact grenade or barbed wire x3

Special ability: Cazador can use three specially modified throwing knives to slay his enemies. One the knife is thrown, if it hits a target, it will always down them, regardless of where it hits. The knife can then be retrieved, and if it still resides in an injured enemy, removing it will kill them. Targets downed by the knife will bleed out faster than other enemies. However, after the knife is thrown, it could also be detonated, exploding in the radius of an impact grenade with the force of a nitro cell. As soon as the knife is in the field, it must be either retrieved or detonated in order to use the next one, so no throwing it twice in a row. The knife, although nonlethal, does count as a melee attack and will stager shield users, though detonating the knife will still be absorbed by the shield, not the operator.

Operation: Blood Sky—Irish Army Rangers
-
The Army Ranger Wing (ARW) (Irish: Sciathán Fiannóglaigh an Airm, ""SFA"") is the special operations force of the Irish Defense Forces, the military of Ireland. A branch of the Irish Army, it also recruits personnel from the Naval Service and Air Corps. It serves at the behest of the Defense Forces and Government of Ireland, operating internally and overseas, and reports directly to the Chief of Staff. The ARW was established in 1980 with the primary role of counter terrorism and evolved to both special operations and counterterrorism roles from 2000 after the end of conflict in Northern Ireland. The unit is based in the Curragh Camp, County Kildare. The 2015 White Paper on Defense announced that the strength of the Wing would be considerably increased. Rangers have served abroad in a number of international peacekeeping missions, including in Somalia, East Timor, Liberia, and Chad. The ARW trains with special forces units around the world, particularly in Europe. The ARW in its domestic counterterrorism role trains with the Garda Síochána (national police) specialist armed intervention unit, the Emergency Response Unit (ERU). Wikipedia

We've got them backed into a corner now, Rainbow! A man claiming to be leading the White Masks, calling himself ""The Engineer"", and a force of terrorists have taken over a convention center in Dublin, with almost a dozen hostages. Thing is, our old friend ""The Advocate"" got us access to the guys cell records, and he's the real deal. The actual bastard in charge. The man responsible for a chemical attack at Bartlett, for attacking an American carrier, for bombing a Victory Day parade in Kiev, for capturing the Suez canal and for threatening the world with Indian nukes, Rainbow, we got him! I fully expect this to be a trap, and that's why I'm sending all my best. All my operators. Rainbow, get to Dublin and take this bastard out once and for all. Godspe... Someone's here. Someone's in the command bunker? Shit, somebody get me the [CONNECTION LOST]

######Attacker: Emily ""Blackout"" McGowan######
2 armor 2 speed

Primary weapon: IA-2 DMR or AWS sniper rifle

Secondary weapon: Beretta Px4 Storm 9mm

Secondary gadget: Smoke Grenades or Breach charges

Special ability: Blackout opens the chamber of her rifle and inserts one of her five EMP rounds to fire from the weapon. After striking a surface, the round goes off, resulting in all electronics within its radius and in line of site of the impact to be temporarily disabled. Though the effect cannot travel through walls or hard cover and does not permanently destroy the gadgets it affects, it has a significantly longer deployment and effect range compared to EMP grenades. What it lacks in power, it makes up for utility.

######Defender: Michael ""Tone"" Graves######
3 armor 1 speed

Primary weapon: Magpul PDR, Agram 2000, or Benelli M4-MAG

Secondary weapon: Beretta Px4 Storm 9mm

Secondary gadget: Deployable shield or Nitro Cell

Special ability: Tone places down 2 ""Boomerang"" Sniper Detection Systems, each with 100 ""charges"". When a round enters the setup's 2.5 meter range, it will transmit one ""tone"", or spotting mark, on the shooter's position 5 seconds later for every shot that was fired within that five seconds. After the five seconds, additional rounds with 1 second of each other cost no charges. LMGs, DMRs, Shotguns, and Sniper Rifles use 1 charge per round, or 2 if suppressed. Assault Rifles, SMGs and handguns use 2 charges, or 4 if suppressed. Handguns use 10 charges, or 15 if suppressed. If a device does not have sufficient charges to place all tags accumulated during the 5 second period, no tags will be placed. One time per setup, the device can be recharged from a charge of 15 or below by Tone, up to 75 charges.

GaryLeeONE,2017-11-09 18:47:37+00:00,From China's Hupu to LaVar Ball: Please Respect Chinese Fans,"Original Post: https://bbs.hupu.com/20687216.html

[This article was posted by the official Hupu account. This is a translation from the original article and does not reflect the translator’s own opinion.]

Mr. LaVar Ball and his 2 sons, LaMelo and LiAngelo, are currently attending BBB promotional events in China. During his trip, Hupu collaborated with Mr. Ball’s business team (abbr. LVB) and its partner Gung-Ho Films (abbr. GHF) to schedule a pickup game for 20 faithful fans to play with LaMelo Ball. Disappointingly, during the preparation of this game, LVB and GHF broke their commitment twice, displayed negative attitudes towards Hupu employees, and probably cheated Hupu and faithful fans from all over the country.

Oct 19, LVB contacted Hupu, hoping to collaborate with Hupu during their November trip. After a series of discussion, LVB and GHF agreed that the Ball family would visit Hupu HQ, and allow Hupu to post on social media platform Weibo to recruit fans to play a pickup game with LaMelo. Hupu successfully recruited 20 fans from around the country,

However, just 15 hours before the scheduled game time, LVB suddenly announced the game be canceled due to health concerns of LaMelo Ball, without any compensation. Although we are very confused why LVB made this decision without considering the feelings of the fans, but considering the fans are still waiting to meet them, we made an effort to communicate with LVB &amp; GHF, and eventually managed to made an agreement: to let the fans play with LaMelo Ball after the scheduled Hupu HQ visit on the following day. However, very shockingly, Mr LaVar Ball and LaMelo Ball appeared at the exact same court at the originally scheduled game time stated in the previous agreement, and were playing basketball like normal. This is witnessed by a Hupu user and posted online.

Hupu hadn’t lose all hope, but even more disappointingly, the same drama occurred once again. Nov 9, 6 hours before the second event, LVB and GHF once again declared the event canceled without communicating with Hupu, and also without compensation. Hupu was still trying to make things better and communicate with LVB and GHF, and proposing multiple compensation plans, hoping they would show respect or, at least, some consolation towards Chinese fans, but no agreement had been reached. At the same time, Hupu deeply apologized to 20 very disappointed fans, and was still trying our best to compensate. We are extremely thankful for the fans’ understanding.

The whole issue has now concluded, we would like to tell you everything, and we still hope that LVB and GHF can give us, and give the faithful fans so eager to meet your family, an explanation. The complete communication process is described below.

Oct 19, the Ball family and its team authorized Beijing Gung-Ho Films Company to contact Hupu via email, hoping to organize a special interview event exclusively with Hupu during their November trip to China for the PAC-12 China Games.

[https://i.imgur.com/TPX3B7c.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/TPX3B7c.jpg)
&gt;	GHF was in charge of filming the Ball family during their trip, and asked if Hupu would like to schedule a special interview with LaVar Ball.

After making contact, both sides agreed to a collaboration plan: to hold an interview + live stream event on Nov 9 with the Ball family at Hupu HQ. Basic procedures are also discussed and agreed. The preparation continued to proceed smoothly.

Nov 2 afternoon, GHF contacted Hupu, hoping Hupu would help recruit 20 fans to play a pickup game with LaMelo on Nov 8 evening. Considering the good cooperation relationship up to this time, and the fact that LVB and GHF didn’t have a direct channel to recruit fans, Hupu agreed to their proposal, and allowed the fans to directly contact Mr Liu (刘) from GHF to sign up.

[https://i.imgur.com/cQ0jlMa.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/cQ0jlMa.jpg)
&gt;	GHF side contacting with Hupu employee to discuss the pickup game event, the time, venue, fan activities, etc.

Nov 5, Hupu published a promotional Weibo post. The same evening, Mr Liu had finished recruiting fans, and set up a WeChat group to inform the fans about the details of the event.

[https://i.imgur.com/ZKMwd2k.png](https://i.imgur.com/ZKMwd2k.png)
&gt;	The first promotional Weibo post. “1. Melo fan; 2. Have basketball skills, must show up on Nov 8.”

Nov 6, Hupu published a Weibo post, saying that Mr LaVar Ball will visit Hupu HQ.

[https://i.imgur.com/U2zVOh1.png](https://i.imgur.com/U2zVOh1.png)
&gt;	Post about the visit, live stream etc. “Any questions you’d like to ask the Ball family? Just send it to us!”

The preparation for both the Nov 8 pickup game and the Nov 9 visit continued very smoothly, until just past midnight on Nov 8, LVB informed Hupu the game had been canceled.

[https://i.imgur.com/TwBpqiE.png](https://i.imgur.com/TwBpqiE.png)

At the same time, Mr Liu from GHF informed the fans in the WeChat group the event had been cancelled, but LaMelo would still play basketball at the scheduled venue, but fans could only watch, but not enter the court and play with him.

[https://i.imgur.com/bpGfaaj.png](https://i.imgur.com/bpGfaaj.png)

Some of the fans came from other provinces, and were absent from work, school, etc. We felt that this is very inappropriate, without any explanation to the fans. Hupu called the GHF representative at 10:00 am, Nov 8, and asked about the reason for cancelling the event. The representative said that LaMelo was feeling unwell and had to cancel the game. Hupu told GHF about fans coming from other provinces, and asked if the game would still be played if LaMelo felt better at game time.

10 minutes after the call is made, GHF informed us that the game was officially canceled, and the reservation for the basketball court is also canceled.

[https://i.imgur.com/n3JAPZM.png](https://i.imgur.com/n3JAPZM.png)
&gt;	“Are the fans still allowed to watch? The previous announcement says they are.” Reply: “The game is officially canceled this morning.”

Later, Mr Liu announced the game would be canceled, and LaMelo would not show up.

[https://i.imgur.com/kYdynO5.png](https://i.imgur.com/kYdynO5.png)

After that, Hupu tried to contact LVB and GHF, and discussed how to compensate the fans. Hupu asked if LVB could provide some BBB merchandise for the fans. Besides, considering the Ball family would visit Hupu HQ the next day, Hupu suggested that the game be played on a court near the HQ, after the visit/interview event is over. LVB said he would talk to the team.

During the communication process, LVB invited Hupu representatives to meet at the soon-to-be-open BBB store at 15:00 that day, to meet and discuss the matter in person, and organize a pop-up interview event. Hupu representatives arrived on time at 15:00, but waited for 2 hours before LVB team showed up.

[https://i.imgur.com/3bJxqx4.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/3bJxqx4.jpg)

LVB team proposed that the fans would be able to skip the queue and come to the front row at the pop-up interview event when the BBB store opens on Friday. Hupu believed that many fans wouldn’t be able to stay till Friday, and LVB only providing a front row view of the event was not extremely sincere, and suggested again if they were able to provide BBB merchandise. LVB replied that the front row view “is all we can offer at this time”.

[https://i.imgur.com/NumNBF0.png](https://i.imgur.com/NumNBF0.png)

At 17:00 that day, LVB team finally arrived. During the interview, Mr LaVar Ball showed good spirits and his talkativeness. Before the special interview, Hupu repeatedly confirmed with LVB if there would be a game after the Hupu HQ visit. LVB eventually agreed and made sure that there would be a game played.

That evening, Hupu informed the 20 fans the results of the communication, and invited them to also come and visit Hupu HQ along with the Ball family. The fans showed great passion and excitement, some of them took a few more days of absence, or rescheduled their transportation to attend the events in Shanghai.

Unfortunately, at 10:00 am Nov 9, LVB once again informed Hupu that all events be canceled (including the visit/interview), and all events must be postponed to the second day. During the phone call with the LVB team, the representatives replied very reluctantly. They did not provide any reason to cancel the events, and also refused to provide any compensation for breaking the commitment for the second time. The representatives used expressions like “celebrity” multiple times as defense, and used strong language, and provided no chance to further discuss the problem.

[https://i.imgur.com/XQNhWiU.png](https://i.imgur.com/XQNhWiU.png)

We are very dispirited because of LVB breaking the commitment twice. Hupu were forced to accept the fact that the interview and the events were canceled. At the beginning we started the cooperation smoothly, and helped recruit the fans before the events, but LVB and GHF breaking their commitment twice made us feel very sad. Mr Liu from GHF, never spoke a single word after informing the fans the pickup game had been canceled. We felt we must take actions to compensate the fans for their loss.

Hupu paid for all accommodations and transportation for the fans, and 1000 RMB each fan as compensation. We fully understand the fans’ disappointment after the whole series of unfortunate events, and are very thankful for the fans’ great support. By the way, we also decided to still host the pickup game, even if the Ball family didn’t show up. There were about a dozen fans, we had a very good time.

Sorry, and thank you once again to all the fans.

[https://i.imgur.com/ZjaNTkD.png](https://i.imgur.com/ZjaNTkD.png)

There are three questions concerning the decisions LVB team made:

1.	The LVB team broke their commitment twice, both announcements are made suddenly on the day of event, from only the LVB side. We wonder if the events and commitments with the fans/media can be freely changed according to your personal will.
2.	The LVB team told us that LaMelo Ball was feeling unwell, and twice confirmed the Nov 8 pickup game had been cancelled, and also said that LaMelo would not be present at the court that evening. We wonder why both LaMelo and LaVar Ball arrived at the exact same court and played basketball. This is witnessed and published online by another Hupu user.

[https://i.imgur.com/j6bwgEz.png](https://i.imgur.com/j6bwgEz.png)

3.	The LVB team did not show sincerity after breaking the commitment, were unwilling to provide anything to compensate, and were very reluctant when communicating with Hupu. We wonder the reason why.",nba,1841

Some tickets are already at above 2000 U.S dollars, and it's only been hours since the official ticket release.      
Also, the tickets for Semi Final of RNG and SKT are currently at around 12.5 times the original price (950 U.S dollars for 75 U.S dollars original priced tickets). Tickets priced at other different levels vary from at least 5 to 20 times the original prices.  



Note that the tickets sold officially at damai.cn requires personal ID and a unique league account reached at least lv 10, which is the reason why fans accuse damai.cn for conspiring.   



Follow up:   
Tencent officials just announced through social media that a large amount of ""problematic"" tickets will be revoked and released again at some point in the future, the exact time of the new ticket release is yet to be announced. Such emergent action taken by Tencent is unprecedented and is reasonably believed due to the huge wave of complaints on the internet and media as well as the importance and the social influence of this Final in the Beijing National Stadium. (Few days ago many official shoutcasters, pros, former pros and even the WE's owner complained about how they can't buy tickets of Group Stages and Quarterfinals for themselves or their friends. LoL)   
  
Most recent update:
International tickets have just been sold out literally under one second on en.damai.cn. (As of 10:00AM PST OCT 25)  

And there is at least one scalper selling VIP booth tickets which is unobtainable by public sales.  
Rumors: People claim that many scalpers told them the official seller provided their tickets at high prices, the scalpers themselves are only making the small money. Judging from some scalpers sell VIP booth tickets which is unobtainable by official sale, I'd say it has at least some degree of authenticity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Below is to international visitors who can't get a ticket:  

This is the official website with information and contacts of official Final viewing parties in several cities in China:   
http://lpl.qq.com/es/act/a20170921watch/index.html  
I can't find a English page though but it's the least I could do to help.  
At the bottom of this page there are two drop down menus, the left one is to choose Province/Municipality, the right one is to choose City/Zone, you don't have to choose specific zone if you choose Municipality like Beijing or Shanghai. And the button to the right of the City/Zone menu is the search button.  
The search result will show you results with information from left to right:   
Province/Municipality, City, Name of the Location, Dates, Address, Name of the Contact, Phone Number(Don't expect English speaking), QQ group number(if it says 123456, it's default number so this location don't have an actual QQ group number.)
I have looked it up and there is a Final viewing party in Beijing, located in the largest Wangyu net cafe(Largest chain net cafe in China) which is near Beijing worker's stadium.  
Location Name: Wangyu E-sports (网鱼电竞)
Address is: 6 Gongti xi(west) Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing. (北京市朝阳区工人体育场西路6号)  
Telephone No. : 010-58349867   
Mobile Phone is either: 18518560158 Mr. Wang or 15811125268 Mr.Zhang or both correct? (Again don't expect English speaking from any numbers.)  

Be sure to make reservations as soon as possible if required, even though the net cafe has a capacity over 1000 people, I bet it's filled already or soon to be.

KingNashII,2017-08-15 01:53:58+00:00,"Guys, Paulinho is good now.","OK, so after the news broke yesterday of Paulinho's move to Barca, I've been seeing a hell of a lot of mockery on this sub, a lot of which I feel is unwarranted. Here's why.

As a background, I am an English expat in China, and have lived in Beijing for the past 14 months. During the majority of that period, Newcastle have been in the Championship (not widely followed here at all), meaning the games are harder to come by on both streams and in the bars. Plus, to be frank, we won the majority of them, and promotion looked pretty foregone for the lions share of the season.

As a result of this stark absence of my weekly fix of Mike Ashley's Wild Ride™, I have taken on Beijing Guoan as my team of choice. The stadiums only 10 minutes bike ride away and tickets are reasonably priced with a fantastic atmosphere, so why the fuck not.

I can't say I've been to them all, but I managed to hit around 10-15 games in that period, usually against the bigger clubs with players I know. Your Shanghai's, your Jiangsu's and your Tianjin's. Some have been dire, but overall, it's live football - it's very hard to make that unwatchable.

**Paulinho is by far and away the best player I have seen in the entire division this year, and really the only man who comes close is Renato Augusto (and I just think that's my Beijing bias talking).** 

After a few games, it became increasingly obvious to me that there are two types of *laowai* players (foreigners) in this league. The first group who could not give less of a toss about playing football, barely move outside of the centre circle and throw their hands up every time they don't get the ball like they're at a Fat Boy Slim rave, and the ones who just straight want to win football games as a member of a team. For posterity's sake, I'd put Jackson Martinez, Axel Witsel, Alexandre Pato and Oscar in the first group. The 'tryhards' include Hulk, Demba Ba, Lavezzi and of course Paulinho.

His performances in a Guangzhou team that really relies on an unbelievably solid structure and miserly defence were simply breathtaking when they came to the Capital. Could not be more of a complete midfielder. He comes deep to collect the ball from a team that don't exactly play a high line, drives the team forward, distributes extremely well and has a real scoring touch now too. There's a reason he's getting picked so much for the National Team, and his performances there are an exact replica of his game here. It's not some backstage dodgy dealings with management, he actually deserves to play. CSL may be a lot of things, but the standard isn't exactly shut your eyes and pray to the football gods bad.

I think there's a lot to be said for moving to a new team, new country, entirely new culture (believe me), and becoming 'the man' instantly as well. It shows a strong personality and a willingness to just play football. I wouldn't like to just go ahead and make stuff up, but I'm guessing his move to China wasn't 100% all his decision backstage, it's well known that there's a lot of family/agent pressures for Brazilian players with rough backgrounds to chase the money, but he's just got on with it.

Now, Barcelona have come in for him, and the world is panning the transfer based on the fact he was unceremoniously dropped by Spurs in favour of, well would you look at that, some of the key lynchpins in arguably the second best team in the Prem. He's said enough's enough, I want to play for Barca and tried his best to make it happen.

Good on him, good luck to you Paulinho, and thank you for all the work you put in here in China. You deserve your move, and I have no doubt that you'll succeed.

Pippinacious,2017-07-20 17:32:43+00:00,Groundskeeper To A Ghost Town,"Ghost towns aren't exactly uncommon out west. The massive population explosion of the gold rush era dotted the landscape with little pop-up mining camps that were abandoned when the riches ran out, leaving only the skeletons of their buildings behind. Sometimes, if you're lucky, you'll find small tools or other everyday artifacts that the miners used, but mostly they sit empty and forgotten in the scrubland.


My sister and I made a hobby of finding these towns and photographing them. It was exactly like urban exploration, just with scorpions instead of rats. 


Marissa got me started on it after we'd taken a short road trip through some desert back roads and came across a small settlement of aged buildings. They were worn by weather and near constant sun, but still sturdy, and my sister convinced me to go in some of them. It was a bit spooky, a bit exciting, and entirely fun.


We were hooked after that first time.


Every few weekends became dedicated to finding ghost towns and driving out to them to spend a few hours going through whatever had been left behind. Marissa would do some research on them before we went and fill me in on the history during the drive over and I'd try to find things to photograph that matched up with what she'd told me. We'd post a few pictures with the corresponding facts to an online blog, but mostly we just did it for our own entertainment. 


“I found a new one,” Marissa said by way of greeting when she met me for lunch one day.


“New town?”


“Yeah, about two hours drive out. Not much about it online, I guess it wasn't active for very long.”


“Think it's worth checking out?”


My sister rolled her eyes with slow exaggeration at me. “Uh, duh?”


“You free Saturday?”


“Thought you'd never ask!”


And so our next adventure was born. We met at my apartment early Saturday morning and, armed with only my camera, a GPS, and a cooler full of snacks and water, we set out. 


There really isn't much to see out in the desert. It's a vast expanse of sand and scrubland topped off by an inescapable sun. The mountains off on the horizon can be pretty impressive, but even they start to lose their appeal after an hour of staring out the window. 


I knew we had to be getting close when Marissa pulled off the highway onto a narrow two lane road that wound us closer to those mountains.


“Is there some kind of sign or something I should be keeping an eye out for?” I asked.


“No. From what I read, you just kind of have to know where you're going to find it,” she said. 


In typical Marissa fashion, she turned down the music and leaned forward with a deep frown of concentration. Apparently, the quiet and narrowed eyes were essential to her being able to find where we were supposed to be.


“I think I see something, over there,” she pointed off to our left, where I could just make out the dark silhouettes of buildings against the blue sky.


The dirt path we had to take to get over to them was bumpy and I clung to my door to keep from being jostled around too much. As we neared the town, those outlines we'd seen from a distance solidified into old, faded wood. At least half a dozen buildings were scattered about and, surprisingly, each seemed to be in pretty fair condition. 


“Jesus!” Marissa cried suddenly and she wrenched the wheel to one side while slamming on the brakes. 


My seatbelt caught me sharply across the front as I was thrown forward and I let out a surprised yelp. As we skid to a stop, a black cat went slinking away from our car to vanish behind the nearest building.


“Sorry,” Marissa said shakily, her smile both relieved and embarrassed, “you ok?”


“Yeah, yeah,” I assured her. “Stupid cat.”


“Stupid cat,” she agreed.


After we'd taken a moment to settle ourselves, we shared a little giggle and grabbed the camera from the back seat to begin our exploration.


The saloon was first, little more than a plywood bar stretched across the back wall with some tables and chairs spread around the room. I was taking busy taking pictures of some boots left in one corner when my sister called me over to the bar. 


“Look at this,” she said, gesturing to the shelves beneath the countertop, where rows of beer bottles were lined up.


“Oh, cool,” I knelt to set up a shot, but Marissa jostled my shoulder.


“No, Selene, *look*! These are modern bottles and they're clean, no dust.”


A quick inspection proved her right and I lowered my camera. It occurred to me that the boots hadn't been particularly dirty either. In fact, a look around the room showed that it was all pretty clean. Usually there were layers of dust and sand and spiderwebs. Not even the windows had the typical cracks in them.


“You think someone comes out here and uses this as a bar?” I asked skeptically. 


“I dunno. It's pretty far out in the middle of nowhere for a quick drink.”


“Let's check out the others and see what they're like.”


We walked from building to building, doing walk-throughs of each, and they were all in a similar, bafflingly cared for condition. We had just finished going through the small upstairs of one of the bunk houses and were descending the stairs when a voice from the front door almost had us tumbling over one another.


“What are you doing here?”


An Asian man just shy of being elderly was standing in the entryway. He was glaring up at us from beneath the brim of a stained cap, one hand still on the doorknob and the other clutching a baseball bat. 


“Just looking!” Marissa said quickly. I shyly held up my camera to help confirm her words.


Although his dark eyes remained suspicious, he seemed to relax slightly. 


“You shouldn't be here,” he said.


“Sorry, we'll go,” I grabbed Marissa’s arm and we scurried down the steps and out past the man. 


Being out in the open seemed to embolden my sister.


“Wait,” she said, pulling herself free. She turned back to him and put her hands on her hips, her favored pose for when she was about to offer some attitude. “Why should we have to leave? Who even are you?”


“Henry Lee, the groundskeeper,” he said, clearly unimpressed with my sister.


“For a ghost town?” She ignored my pleading tugs towards the car and stood her ground. 


“Yep.”


“Even if that's true, we're not doing anything wrong and we came a long way to get here, so we're not going to leave until we're ready.”


“Marissa,” I hissed.


“This isn't a playground, young lady,” Henry said testily.


“And we're not playing, we’re just taking pictures.”


“You shouldn't be doing that, either.”


Marissa scoffed. “Why not?”


“They don't like it.”


My sister and I exchanged a glance, mine uncertain, her’s clearly asking if this guy was for real. It wasn't lost on him and he shut the door firmly behind him with a sigh.


“You have no idea what this place is, do you?” He asked, speaking slowly as if addressing small children.


“Of course we do, we came here *because* of what it is,” Marissa replied. 


“Then you'd know you're standing in a graveyard.”


“A graveyard?” I peeked over Marissa’s shoulder at him.


“Yep, so show some respect and leave.”


He walked around the side of the building and despite my whispered urges to go, Marissa followed him doggedly. We found him putting the bat back into his truck, which was parked behind the bunk houses, and when he saw we hadn't been so easily shaken, he slammed his door and crossed his arms over his chest. 


“There's nothing online that says that,” she said and I almost groaned. Of course my history nerd of a sister wouldn't be able to just go without demanding more answers.


“There wouldn't be,” Henry replied sourly. “It was just some dead chinks after all. Nobody gave a shit then, nobody gives a shit now.”


“This was a Chinese mining camp?” Marissa perked up slightly and her genuine interest seemed to soften Henry just a bit. 


“Back in the 1850s, yeah. They called it Golden Beijing after they actually managed to strike some gold, but a tunnel collapse killed almost all of the men. The few women took their kids and ran. Good thing, too, because it was found out later that the collapse was intentionally set up by American miners who wanted the land and I'm pretty sure they wouldn't have looked kindly upon a couple widows and daddyless babies hanging around.”


“Even with proof of their involvement, the law favored the Americans and swept the murders under the rug. The Chinese families weren't allowed to try and dig out the bodies and, after the gold dried up, Golden Beijing was scratched from the records.”


As he talked, he went back around the bunk house and we followed him as he cleaned and swept down the line of buildings and set out beers and jerky along the bartop in the saloon. We learned he was a descendant of one of the murdered miners and he had taken up keeping the town clean and stocked after his mother, who had done the same, passed away. 


“Those men never left,” he said soberly while twisting the cap off a bottle of beer. “Without a proper burial, their spirits can't rest. There are rituals that have to be performed so that they can cross over. Without bodies, however, it is impossible for that to happen and so they exist in a tortured state. That's why I come here, to try and offer some relief to them with offerings of food and drinks and new clothing when I can. It's little comfort after what they've been forced to become, but it's something.”


“So you really believe the ghost of your great grandpa is wandering around?” Marissa asked bluntly and I immediately apologized on her behalf.


Henry just nodded, his expression as grave as his voice. “Oh yes, I've seen them. They’re visible to the living at night, but you had best pray they don't see you, too.”


“You're messing with us,” Marissa laughed. 


“Do you know what a hungry ghost is?” He asked, and when we shook our heads, he continued. “They are driven by anger or want and a constant, unfillable ache in their bellies. These were poor men, so they are poor ghosts, too, unable to purchase any relief in the afterlife. They are always looking for a way to ease their pain. They can take other forms, like a beautiful woman or a cat, and they'll try to lure you outside, where some will hurt you if they can, and others will try to possess you.”


The hair on the back of my neck rose slightly when he mentioned cats and I was reminded of the one we'd almost hit on our way in. Marissa wasn't the least bit bothered and continued to pepper Henry with questions about the town, which he answered more often than not. He remained gruff and busy, but it was also fairly obvious that he enjoyed passing on his knowledge of what had happened there. 


By the time any of realized how late it had gotten, the sun was starting to slip behind the mountains, leaving a bright red streak across the sky overhead. 


“We should get going,” Marissa said at last, but Henry shook his head. His glance out the window beside us was an anxious one and I followed his gaze to the black cat perched on the railing just outside. It stared back, unblinking. 


“No, if we leave now, they will come for us,” Henry said. “We should have been gone already! I shouldn't have let you distract me so much!”


“Come on, you don't *really* believe in all that stuff,  do you?” Marissa cocked her head to one side and snorted.


They went back and forth, each insisting they were right, and all the while, darkness crept over the town.


Marissa was mid sentence when the crying started. It was soft and sad and coming from just outside the door. It sounded like a man. My breath caught in my chest and I looked to Marissa, whose face had lost all color. Henry motioned for us to be quiet and to follow him quickly behind the bar, where we all ducked down and huddled together. All of Marissa’s bravado had vanished. 


The crying faded into a heavy silence until the only thing we could hear was our own breathing.


“Can they get in?” I squeaked the words out.


“There are seals on all of these buildings that should keep them out if the door is closed,” Henry said, “but they are very old now.”


Something scratched the door lightly, as if testing it, and a cat meowed from the other side. When it remained unopened, the scratching became more fervent, more desperate, and the meows turned to a piercing, howling screech that shook me down to my bones. The crying began again, and then a chorus of voices joined in, all speaking rapidly and crawling over one another in their effort to be heard, and it felt as if they were all pressing against the door.


Marissa and I clung to one another and Henry told us more than once to stay still and silent. 


When the noises faded again, he dared to lift himself just enough to peer over the top of the bar.


“Shit,” he whispered. 


A terrified curiosity took hold then and Marissa and I couldn't help but look at whatever had caused him to swear. 


Faces were pressed against every window, held up on impossibly thin, needlelike necks. Some had tiny mouths that opened and closed wildly, the swollen tongues within lapping at the air, others had bright flames burning in the back of their throats. Their bellies were swollen and distended and the flesh sloughed away as they writhed and contorted.


Their eyes, bulging and alight with feverish want, were all fixed on us.


“What do we do, Henry?” I asked, unable to look away from the swarm at the windows.


“We wait until dawn,” he said quietly. “And we hope the seals hold.”


“We can't make a run for it? Our car isn't that far,” Marissa said.


“It won't work. Lights, cars, phones. When they're gathered like this, none of it works.”


“We can't just sit here all night!” A sob escaped Marissa and she sank back behind the bar.


“We can't leave,” Henry said. “You step outside, that's it.”


The heavy groan of stressed wood accompanied his words. We all popped up again to see the door starting to bow inwards, pushed by the frenzied, clawing, hungry ghosts. 


“Upstairs,” Henry was already moving, “there's another sealed door. Come on!”


As we scurried beneath the windows, those outside wailed and pushed and thrashed. 


We had only managed to kick the upstairs door shut behind us when the one below splintered and gave way. There were no footsteps on the stairs to tell us of the spirits’ ascent, no telltale creaking of the floorboards, only a cold darkness that filled the entire space beneath the door. Hushed whispers filled the small room and I could feel their despair and desperation twisting its way around us, clogging the air until it was almost hard to breathe.


While Marissa and I embraced each other against the opposite wall, Henry sat cross legged in the middle of the room, pressed his hands together, and began to murmur in what I assumed was prayer. The whispers from the other side of the door continued, and they scratched and banged against the wood, still trying to get in.


None of us slept at all that night; the ghosts wouldn't let us. At some points, we each had to take turns to keep one of us from giving in to the cloud of hopelessness that the ghosts cast over the room and running out. Henry remained the most composed and, if it hadn't been for him, I wasn't sure my sister or I would have made it.


At the first light of dawn, all of their cries suddenly ceased and we were immediately able to shake off anguish that had plagued us for so many hours. 


We waited for a bit, until the sun was streaming brightly through every window, and then we hurried down the steps and out of the saloon.


“Thank you,” Marissa stopped long enough to say to Henry. “For...keeping us safe even though I was rude to you.”


He just nodded.


We wasted no time in leaving after that and, even though he was exhausted and eager to be on his own way, Henry remained in the middle of the street, watching us go.


We put that ghost town and its groundskeeper in our rear view mirror as fast as we could and, although we did not say it aloud, both of us instinctively knew that it would be the last one we'd ever visit.",nosleep,1018

Operation: Scorched Earth—Israeli Shin-Bet Yamas
-
Yamas (Hebrew: יחידת המסתערבים‎‎, Yehidat HaMista'arvim) is a special operations unit attached to the Israeli Border Police, but directly subordinate to Shin Bet. A secret unit, its personnel do not wear uniforms and are not allowed to disclose their membership of the organization. (Wikipedia)

Secret service taken to the extreme, next to nothing is publicly known about these elite operators. Numbers? Classified. Operational readiness? Classified. Deployment history? Classified. Even their level of funding cannot be accurately estimated. So when Rainbow went to Israel to recruit the best of the best, the choice was pretty obvious. Now attached to Rainbow, the operators Selah ""Wildfire"" David and Ishmael ""Razor"" Kaplowitz stand ready to destroy all who may oppose the sovereign security of Israel, and will not accept defeat as an option.

######ATTACKER: Selah ""Wildfire"" David

1 Armor, 3 speed

Primary weapon: IMI Galatz DMR or IMI Negev LMG

Secondary weapon: G22  .40cal or G18 9mm

Gadget: Breach charges or Smoke grenades

Special ability: Wildfire carries a specialized incendiary charge that, when attached to a flammable material such as wood, plaster, or drywall, starts a medium-speed burn that will eventually, if not cut off, consume the entire floor or wall it is placed on. The charge cannot burn through metal supports or ceramic tile, and can be ""cut off"" if its path is manually destroyed (leaving it with nothing to burn) or if the point it began its burn at is destroyed before it spreads. If a floor has two layers, it will burn through both, but if a wall has two layers, it will only burn through one, though it can be placed on an exposed interior layer. She carries one of these charges with her kit.

######DEFENDER: Ishmael ""Razor"" Kaplowitz

2 armor, 2 speed

Primary weapon: IWI X-95 MTAR or Armsel DAO-12 Stryker

Secondary weapon: G22 .40cal or G18 9mm

Gadget: Deployable shield or barbed wire

Special ability: wrapped around his left arm, Razor wears a rolled up, partitioned, magnetically-reactive riot shield. Made of bullet-resistant glass and containing deployable magnetic fibers, the shield can be extended with the push of a button. Like any ballistic shield, he can ADS with his sidearm, but is forced into a severely inaccurate hipfire with his primary weapon equipped (though he can use his shield and primary together, it's just not very effective). The shield is not large enough to cover his entire body, forcing him to choose between exposing his head (more accurate fire) or legs (less chance of getting domed) the same way Capitão chooses his bolts. Movement speed is reduced to 1 while the shield is deployed, and it has 300 health. 

######Map: Safehouse, Tel Aviv

A smallish, House style map consisting of two floors, a sub level op center, and a heavily destructible interior environment, this map favors chaotic, close quarters combat and rewards players with good map knowledge and fast reflexes. The trick here is to not blink: between the collapsing floors, burning walls, scorching hot earth and baking Israeli sun, you might miss something.

Operation: Broken Diamond—Mexican CdFE
-
The Mexican Cuerpo de Fuerzas Especiales (Special Forces Corps) is a special forces unit of the Mexican Army. Formerly the GAFE (Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales | Special-Forces Airmobile Group), the SF Corps has six battalions; one is the Fuerza especial de reaccion, a quick-response unit, and one is assigned to the Paratroopers Rifle Brigade; the motto of the SF Corps is Todo por México (Everything for Mexico). Within the SF Corps, there are regular, intermediate, and veteran -service troops. The regular-service soldiers usually operate as light infantry. The intermediate-service soldiers (lieutenants and captains) usually are instructors. The veteran-service soldiers of the Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales del Alto Mando (GAFE High Command) handle Black-Ops missions. Also known as the COIFE, the Special Forces Corps of the Mexican Army is equivalent to the U.S. Army Special Forces. -Wikipedia

The White Masks have recently began looking for funding outside of their normal operating procedures—drugs. Lots and lots of drugs. Without access to that money, the White Masks are almost nothing more than a blog. Rainbow, I'm sending you to cut off the head of this snake in Mexico. Joining your for the op are two of the country's finest, hailing from the Special Forces Corps. They've been fighting these drug lords for a while, and have taken the fight to the terrorists since day one. You'll find few more loyal allies. Meet Marco ""Acero"" Ramirez and Alicia ""Reina"" Flores. Gear up, Operators. We've got work to do.

######Attacker: Marco ""Acero"" Ramirez

1 Armor 3 speed

Primary weapon: H&amp;K PSG1 semi-automatic sniper rifle, with full complement of barrels and sights, including ACOG. Deals slightly less damage than the OTS-O3, but keeping the ability to fire though armor panels and bullet proof glass.

Secondary weapon: P7M13 9mm

Gadgets​: Claymore or flashbang

Special ability: Acero loads a special explosive round into his rifle, one at a time. When fired, the round will travel through two pieces of destroyable cover or until it impacts a body, indestructible surface, or reinforced wall. When it hits a reinforced wall as intended, the round will prime for 1 second and then detonate, leaving a single hole roughly the size of 1 X-KAIROS pellet. Acero carries 5 such rounds in his kit, ensuring that he cannot breach an reinforced wall by himself—he can only open it.

######Defender: Alicia ""Reina"" Flores

3 armor 1 speed

Primary weapon: FAMAE SAF 9mm SMG or Pancor Jackhammer 12g

Secondary weapon: P7M13 9mm

Gadget: Barbed wire or Nitro Cell

Special ability: Reina can place down up to 4 high powered electromagnets on floors and walls in the same way Jäger can place down his ADS. Instead of destroying the grenade, the device pulls the grenade towards itself. A lethal (frag or cluster charge) will destroy the magnet, but non-lethals will not. The grenade will still go off, but simply while being pulled in or attached to the magnet.

######Map: Cartel, outside Ciudad Juarez
Taking place inside of a drug kingpin's hacienda, Cartel offers medium range sight lines in the foyer, CQC in the drug tunnels, and plenty of exterior shacks and huts for Glaz and Acero to have plenty of fun.

Operation: Fallen Tide—Australian SOCOMD
-
The Special Operations Command (SOCOMD) is a command within the Australian Defence Force (ADF). Special Operations Command was established on 5 May 2003 to unite all of the Australian Army Special forces units and by 2008 was fully operational.[2][3][4] Australia's Special Operations Command is of equivalent status to Australia's Maritime, Land and Air Commands.[2] It is modelled on the equivalent commands in the United States and British militaries. Led by a Major General (Special Operations Commander Australia, SOCAUST). -Wikipedia

Rainbow, you're going down under. We've received actionable intelligence that the White Masks are attempting to secure several points of coastline along Australian territory. That much sea access, if left unchecked, could be disastrous for global counter-terrorism operations around the globe. Help secure their country, and the Australian SOCOMD has promised to of their best to our mission. Meet up with Jamison “Dragon” Rutledge and Chloe “Angel” Williams and make sure it gets done.

######Attacker: Jamison “Dragon” Rutledge

2 armor 2 speed

Primary weapon: FN Herstel F2000, H&amp;K G36SV-SL8 DMR, or Kel-Tec KSG12

Secondary weapon: SL9mk3 sidearm

Gadget: Frag Grenade or Breach Charge

Ability: Dragon replaces his standard drones with hover-capable airborne variants, capable of reaching places other drones cannot. In addition, each drone is loaded with 2 tracking darts. When a dart is placed on an enemy, they transmit real-time position data, Caveira-style, to the attacking team for 5 seconds. After the 5 seconds, that target is immune to the effects for an additional 30 seconds. If the drone is destroyed, the tracking signal is lost.

######Defender: Chloe “Angel” Williams  

Primary weapon: Steyr AUG Para or Kel-Tec KSG12

Secondary weapon: SL9mk3 sidearm

2 armor 2 speed

Gadget: Barbed wire or nitro cell

Ability: Angel is equipped with a grenade launcher loaded with 2 cluster flashbang grenades. After being fired, these grenades are armed by hitting a surface or person, then detonate 1.5 seconds later. The charge then spits out 9 flashbangs in various directions which are all less intense than their attacking counterpart, but with a shorter fuse.

######Map: Carrier, off the Western coast of Australia

A boarded US aircraft carrier which was hosting Rainbow's negotiations with the Australians. Some metallic hulls are less destructible than wood and drywall, and the floor-to-floor bulkheads won't be quite as clean as regular trapdoors. If you listen closely, you can hear fighting in other areas of the ship (at least for prep phase).

Operation: White Storm—Ukrainian Alpha Group
-
Like all post-Soviet states, Ukraine inherited its special forces (Spetsnaz) units from the remnants of the Soviet armed forces, GRU and KGB units. Ukraine now maintains its own Spetsnaz structure under the control of the Ministry of Interior, and under the Ministry of Defense, while the Security Service of Ukraine maintains its own Spetsnaz force, the Alpha group. The term ""Alpha"" is also used by many other post Soviet states such as Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan as these units are based on the Soviet Union's Alpha Group. Ukraine's Berkut special police force gained mainstream attention during the 2014 Ukrainian revolution as it was one of the main forces used by the government to quell the uprising. Ukraine relies on Spetsnaz forces for various activities from intelligence gathering, fighting fraud and organized crime, responding to terrorism, electronic warfare, as well as responding to mass protests. -Wikipedia

Rainbow, I wish I had good news. Kiev has been attacked by the White Masks. Casualties are still counting, but estimates already place it at several hundred dead after a radiological weapon detonated at a Victory Day parade that who even knows how many people watched. Luckily, Ukrainian Intelligence has tracked the materials back to a source. Not so luckily, the materials came from Chernobyl. Yeah, that Chernobyl. Alpha Group has already prepped a team to hit the main operating base of the White Mask cell responsible, and they're requesting backup. This is the first time we've had to respond to a homeland attack on allied soil since Bartlett. Wipe them out. Natalia “Obrazet” Vann and Alexi “Havok” Yevtukh will brief you en route. Godspeed, Rainbow.

######Attacker: Natalia “Obraza” Vann

3 armor 1 speed

Primary weapon: CZ805 BREN A2 or FORT-500T shotgun

Secondary weapon: CZ75 semi-auto

Gadget: Breach Charge or Smoke grenade

Ability: Obraza can place down a single 1m² thermal imaging scanner (actual, full spectrum black-red-white thermal, not Glaz thermal) onto non-reinforced walls, floors, and trapdoors. Once placed, the device begins transmitting a wide-angle video of the adjacent room. The scan only travels through one wall, double or not, and cannot scan through metal supports/reinforcements or heavy wooden studs. Because of the wide-angle shot, looking at different angles does lead to different sight lines, though the image becomes more and more distorted the greater the angle. Though it can be penetrated, one shot will disable the device.

######Defender: Alexi “Havok” Yevtukh

1 Armor 3 speed

Primary weapon: CZ3A1 Scorpion Evo or FORT-500T

Secondary weapon: CZ75 semi-auto

Gadget: impact grenades or deployable shield

Ability: Havok can place up to 4 RFID traps on the sides of doors or windows. If an attacker passes through a trap, a tag (a la Jackal) will be placed on their position every 5 seconds for 20 seconds. The trap Israel is simply an RFID sprayer mounted to the side of the entrance, and makes a very distinct sound when discharged. Each trap can only yeah one enemy and cannot ID. The trap can be destroyed with an EMP, bullets, or frags, but not by breach charges or Ash grenades. A tag can be removed via EMP or death.

######Map: Warehouse, location unspecified

Taking place in an emptied out, half underground, Soviet-era nuclear storage facility the Ukrainians would rather forget about. A complex tunnel system is great to evade and flank your enemies, but take care not to get lost. 

Operation: Frozen Sun—South African Recces
-
The South African Special Forces Brigade, colloquially known as the Recces, is South Africa's principal special operations unit and counter-insurgency elite, specialising in combat reconnaissance as well as unconventional parachute techniques. Only about 8% of recruits who undergo South African special forces training pass the course.

Rainbow, I think we got them. Yesterday, South African police intercepted a phone call from a known White Mask agent which suggested that they may be planning a strike soon on a government run diamond mine. By all accounts, no such thing has happened yet, so this may be our opportunity. I want to to travel to South Africa, rendezvous with the Recces operators, and lick that place down. If possible, secure the Commander and​ see what​he knows. I want them running scared.

######Attacker: Amose “Nakala” Louw

2 armor 2 speed

Primary weapon: Barrett REC7/11 or SRM 1216 shotgun

Secondary weapon: .410 Judge or Mateba revolver

Gadget: claymore or smoke grenade

Ability: after working undercover for several years, Nakala feels uncomfortable using only one kit. Instead, he prefers to be whatever is needed to best get the job done. Once per round, Nakala can retrieve the gadget off of a dead ally or injured enemy—for instance, he may pick up Hibana’s launcher or the controller to Echo’s YOKAI. He can only switch once, and for a teammate, they must be dead—for an enemy, downed, but not out.

######Defender: Imanathi “Phantom” Ebrahim

3 armor 1 speed

Primary weapon: Beretta MX4 or SRM 1216

Secondary weapon: .410 Judge or Mateba revolver

Gadget: Impact grenade or deployable shield

Ability: Phantom is able to is special EMR goggles to see electronic devices at close range, similar to in SC:DA. While viewing through her goggles, Phantom is also able to hack attackers drones, revealing the positions of all remaining drones and allowing defenders to view the drone on their camera feed. These goggles cannot see through walls and floors like IQ can, and have a maximum range of 10 meters. 

######Map: Mine, just off the Nambian border

Takes place inside the above-ground ore processing facility attached to the diamond mine proper. High destructibility combined with minimal natural sight lines make for high-octane, frantically paced combat. 

Operation: Rising King—Egyptian TF777
-
Unit 777 (Arabic: الوحدة 777 قتال‎‎), also known as Task Force 777, is an Egyptian military counter-terrorism and special operations unit. It was created in 1978 by the government of Anwar Sadat in response to concerns of increased terrorist activity following the expulsion of Soviet military advisors from the country by Sadat and his efforts to achieve peace with Israel. -Wikipedia

I don't know how to say it, Rainbow, so I'll just say it. The White Masks took the Suez Canal. No one knows how, it's like they just walked in like they owned the place. The point is, we can't let them keep it. You know more about this enemy than anyone, so the Egyptian government is happy to lend any support they can, including two 777 operators. Best of the Egyptian best, Anum “Pharaoh” Zaid and Zahra “Ruin” Anat. And Rainbow? Give those sick bastards a bullet from me, would you?

######Attacker: Anum “Pharaoh” Zaid

3 armor 1 speed

Primary weapon: Colt M16A4, Izhmash AK-104, or H&amp;K Fabarm FP6 shotgun

Secondary weapon: Helwan 920

Gadget: Breach Charge or Claymore

Ability: in addition to his standard drones, Pharaoh uses a custom built drone (cannot be used in prep phase) with a very special effect: at any time before it is destroyed, it can be self-destructed to release a powerful concussive blast, similar to Echo, over a significant radius. However, once detonated, the drone cannot be used again, and if destroyed, it cannot detonate. It does require a 2.5 second charge before detonation. 

######Defender: Zahra “Ruin” Anat

3 armor 1 speed

Primary weapon: PT Pindad PM-2 or H&amp;K Fabarm FP6.

Secondary weapon: Helwan 920

Gadget: nitro cell or barbed wire

Ability: Ruin can secure up to 2 trapdoors with a device that will, once placed, destroy the trapdoor underneath. After doing this, the trap will automatically open when a defender is standing over it, or if they die on top of it, dropping them safely into the room below. After dropping the defender, the hatch will remain open for 1 second before re-closing itself. These trapdoors are considered reinforced and require an incendiary explosive to breach.

######Map: Lock, the Suez Canal

Takes place inside of 2 administration buildings on either side of the canal, as well as on top of and inside the lock, this plane-style map will test everything you've learned in Siege thus far.. Long, linear sight lines and minimal flanking routes make Suez a fight to be feared.

Operation: Dark Forest—Indian NSG
-
The National Security Guards (NSG) is a commando unit originally created for counter-terrorism and hostage rescue missions. Raised in 1986, it is popularly known as the ""Black Cats"" for the uniform worn by its operators. Like most military and elite security units in India, it is media-shy and the general Indian public is largely unaware of its capabilities and operational details. -Wikipedia

Well, Rainbow, this is it. Everything we've trained for, everything we've done, it all leads up to this. At approximately 0300 this morning, the White Masks made a desperate play—they've taken an Indian nuclear launch facility near the Pakistani border. We don't know how they got in, or how many they have, but our best intel suggests they hit it with everything they have, and they're currently preparing for an all-out war. I won't​ lie to you, this will be the hardest mission of your careers. But we cannot let them use that facility, it's just not an option. Rainbow, millions of lives are depending on our success today. Gear up, meet with the two NSG operatives they sent us, and bring this home. And I'll happily accept your retirement after this.

######Attacker: Shiva ""Siren"" Bassi
3 armor 1 speed

Primary weapon: INSAS-AR or AA-12 shotgun

Secondary weapon: GCIM No. 1 .50GI

Gadget: Smoke grenade or flashbang

Ability: Siren carries two dual-use anti-personnel mines. When placed onto the ground, the Siren mine will fire it's payload 15 feet (1.5 standard building stories) into the air. If the charge does not impact anything, it will detonate in mid-air, sending tungsten shrapnel flying outwards from the device like a supercharged frag grenade. This mode of detonation is best used when placed under trapdoors or when fired through steel support beams. If the payload does impact a surface, it will stick there, and after 1.5 seconds, arm itself to be remote detonated. When detonated in this position, the shrapnel fires in a cone shape downwards, guarding doors and other breach points.

######Defender: Imran ""Hornet"" Atwal
3 armor 1 speed

Primary weapon: MSMC 5.56x30 or AA-12 shotgun

Secondary weapon: GCIM No. 1 .50GI

Gadget: Impact grenade or barbed wire

Ability: when the prep phase is over, Hornet can move to any open exterior window and deploy a large-ish drone, called WASP, out into the approach. Once deployed, WASP will wait 10 seconds​ before cloaking (similar to YOKAI), flying out to a fair distance, and it will start orbiting the building at a medium speed (1 orbit/~45 seconds). WASP can then be viewed as a camera by any defender. While viewing through WASP's camera, Hornet himself is able to adjust the minimum elevation and maximum orbit distance, though it cannot go lower than 15 feet and no closer than 20 feet. Although cloaked, WASP still makes a fair bit of noise as attackers get closer to it. Lastly, WASP has 250 health, and the cloak is temporarily ​deactivated for one second if it is struck.

######Map: Launch Site, outside of Kolkata

Takes place between a top-side observation post and an underground command center with potential entrances through roof, doors, or rappelling into several open silos. Dimly lit with little sense of direction, Launch site is a test of courage just as much as skill.

Operation: Hard Gravity—Chinese PLASOF
-
The People's Liberation Army Special Operations Forces (simplified Chinese: 中国特种部队; traditional Chinese: 中國特種部隊; pinyin: Zhōngguó tèzhǒng bùduì) is the special forces branch of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Ground Force. It specialises in rapid reaction combat in a limited regional war under high-tech conditions, commando operations, counter-terrorism, and intelligence gathering. Although the size of the Special Operations Forces is classified, it is estimated to number 7,000 ~ 14,000 troops. -Wikipedia

You ever find a weapon that you really know the world would be a better place without? Yeah, me too. White Masks are trying to make a play in China. Intel says their using an abandoned PLA camp to make homemade Sarin— they have the materials and know-how, so I'm calling this actionable. Word is, they want to release it into the Beijing water supply, try to kill off government as much as they can. Obviously, not happening. I won't lie, I had to call in a few favors to approve the op, and PLA is giving two of their own, but I know you'll get it done.

######Attacker: Tao “Yîncáng” Zhang

3 armor 1 speed

Primary weapon: QBZ-95B or HAWK-12G

Secondary weapon: Type64 7.62x17 Nambu

Secondary gadget: Breach Charge or claymore

Special ability: Yîncáng can equip a QLZ-87 automatic grenade launcher loaded with 3 special “homebrew” tear gas grenades. When fired, the grenades occupy slightly less area than Smoke, and do not deal damage. Instead, the longer a target is in the gas, the more distorted their vision becomes, and the greater effect it has on their accuracy (heavier and heavier recoil). When stepping out of the gas, recovery time is based on how much time was spent in the cloud, and the cloud self-disperses after 20 seconds.

######Defender: Xia “Pàotǎ” Dan

3 armor 1 speed

Primary weapon: Type 79 or HAWK-12G

Secondary weapon: Type64 7.62x17 Nambu

Secondary gadget: Deployable shield or impact grenades

Special ability: Pàotǎ can place down a specialized remote turret,  holding 50 rounds with a base damage of 25 per shot firing at 450 RPM. After the 50 rounds has been fired, the turret will need to be reloaded and can do so 2 times. The turret have 600 health and are made to deter more than kill. If an attacker gets behind the turret, they can remotely deactivate it, and Pàotǎ would have to reactivate. It is disabled, but not destroyed, by EMPs and accessible only to Pàotǎ via camera feed. It uses the shotgun headshot multiplier of 1.5x damage (with range and armor factored in) and has a large amount of spread, similar to hipfiring with a riot shield.

######Map: Containment, abandoned PLA camp outside of Tianjin

An old PLA camp that the White Masks have converted into a functional bio-dome. Main fighting takes place in the lab, where lots of interior cover combined with many internal windows make for interesting, unique, and memorable firefights. 

Operation: Noble Scars, Swiss TIGRIS
-
The exact budget allocated to the unit has been made classified by the Federal Office of Police, only being known as part of its allocated budget. Due to their covert origin, Swiss media has called them Supercops. As of 2009, TIGRIS operators have been deployed for 130 operations in Switzerland.No shots have been fired by TIGRIS during these operations. -Wikipedia

You know all those old stories about Germans and Allies ending up becoming friends in Swiss hospitals during World War II? Which I could say that was the case, but something tells me these White Masks don't want to be friends. You know how I know that, Rainbow? Because this morning they car bombed a goddamned hospital. Suddenly, our Swiss friends don't seem so keen on neutrality. Link up with TIGRIS forces sent to secure that hospital. They'll want help with those Masks, and we need them on our side. Dismissed.

######Attacker: Birgit ""Hydra"" Sankt
2 armor 2 speed

Primary weapon: H&amp;K HK416A5-11DS, Kel-Tec RFB DMR, or Mehrzweckgewehr 91 shotgun

Secondary weapon: SP2022 .40SW

Secondary gadget: Smoke grenade or claymore

Ability: Hydra can place down up to 10 linear meters of water-dampened high penatration DetCord onto breakable walls and floors. Being water dampened, it detonates much quieter than traditional explosives (more Mira than Kapkan, if that makes sense), and the high pressure jet can cut through steel wall supports (like in House's laundry room).

######Defender: Markus ""Gryphon"" Faust
3 armor 1 speed

Primary weapon: AR-57 or Mehrzweckgewehr 91

Secondary weapon: SP2022 .40SW

Secondary gadget: Barbed wire or impact grenade

Ability: Gryphon can place down a special deployable pillbox, standing only a few feet tall and measuring 2.5 meters across, this semicircular structure is made of a high density tungsten alloy and is completely bullet proof with an explosive resistance of 200 (2 frags, 2 Ash rounds, etc.) on the outside. There are three slits for the occupant to fire out of, and the pillbox can be crouched in to avoid fire. It cannot be paced directly against the wall, so there must be room to climb in (climbing in is its own action, like getting on a turret), and if a grenade finds its way inside, the pillbox will be destroyed.

######Map: Intensive Care, Bellinzona, Switzerland

The remains of a 4-story hospital after a car bomb. Some rooms have fully exposed views of the street below. Fighting ranges from an ER and ICU to a Medlab and an inpatient commons area.

Operation: Crashing Dagger—Dutch KMar
-
The Koninklijke Marechaussee (KMar) (Royal Gendarmerie) is one of the four services of the Armed forces of the Netherlands. It is a gendarmerie — that is, a military organisation which conducts the duties of a normal police force as well as being the police force to the armed forces. The Marechaussee is a fully military force under the responsibility of the Ministry of Defence. However it does not answer to the Chief of the Defence Staff, but directly to the minister of defence (to secure independence and impartiality when enforcing military law). -Wikipedia

I'll keep it brief, I need all of you on the tarmac as soon as possible. 18 hours ago, I got a message from a man calling himself ""The Advocate"", complete with both pictures and coordinates of a facility being used by the White Masks as a storage depot for those damn gas bombs they use. It's on an island just of the coast of the Netherlands. Given your expertise, the Dutch have agreed to allow you to run the op on their soil. Go there, dig up anything you can on where the weapons are being made, and secure the site for recovery​. Keep it clean, quiet, and make sure everyone comes home. If everything goes according to plan, we've new allies in our pocket and taken out a massive White Masks asset. Now, go!

######Attacker: Daan ""Shockwave"" van Dekken
2 armor 2 speed

Primary weapon: SIG SG510 or FN TPS shotgun

Secondary weapon: Glock 41 .45ACP Competition

Secondary gadget: Breach Charge or Smoke grenade

Special ability: Shockwave can place 2 Electronic Distortion Devices onto walls and floor. When triggered, the device will will flood enemy radios within 20 feet with an impenetrable white noise, completely deafening them and causing mild vision distortion for 5 seconds. If there is a signal jammer between the device and its target, it will be ineffective. After the 5 seconds is up, Shockwave must wait another 45 seconds until the device recalibrates to the defenders' new radio frequency. Full recovery time is 6.5 seconds.

######Defender: Piet ""Legion"" Jongerius
1 Armor 3 speed

Primary weapon: AAS Honey Badger PDW or FN TPS shotgun

Secondary weapon: Glock 41.45ACP Competition

Secondary gadget: Impact grenade or barbed wire

Ability: Legion can place up to three prototype sonar spikes into any breakable floor or wall. After being placed and triggered, the device will give off 6 sonar pings at 5 second intervals that will place a mark of the her operator icon on enemy positions within 30 feet similar to Jackal. While the defenders are not notified with a prompt, the sonar ping is both very loud and very distinctive, letting everyone know that the ping is currently in progress. In addition, if the device is found before the 30 seconds is up, it can be destroyed by any attacker. 

######Map: Museum, Utrecht, Netherlands

A cultural center in downtown Utrecht, Museum is filled with various educational​ tools and exhibits, priceless historical artifacts, and plenty of natural cover combined with a mostly wooden floor structure to have fun out.

But I figure now that it’s the NBA Finals, and since [everyone](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6e4cbm/since_2011_when_rihanna_is_in_the_top_13_during/?st=j3awoz3t&amp;sh=6ca9da62) is now [jumping](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6e41o9/there_is_a_prized_bird_award_in_a_county_fair_in/?st=j3awpglt&amp;sh=8546d2cb) on the [weird stat](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6e26ne/lebron_james_has_never_won_a_championship_if/?st=j3awpvdq&amp;sh=5bd2d967) bandwagon, I figured I might as well bring this over to /r/nba for the finals (and maybe some stuff in the offseason).

Basically, this is the thread where I point out completely unrelated things and how that will translate to the upcoming event, which in this case, is the NBA Finals. [Here’s one I did comparing the NFL to the Eurovision Song Contest](https://np.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/6ar0b0/oc_jaguargator9s_weird_stat_thread_eurovision/?st=j3awsiw9&amp;sh=75273700). This one is [a week 1 prediction with weird stats](https://np.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/5251bo/jaguargator9s_weird_stat_thread_week_1_part_i_100/?st=j3awtoy6&amp;sh=e25d0254). And this one [is my most recent one](https://np.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/6dhlpg/oc_jaguargator9s_weird_stat_thread_stanley_cup/?st=j3awujdo&amp;sh=d8c15ac4), comparing the NFL to the Stanley Cup. I’m doing one of these threads every Friday on /r/NFL, so check that out if you’re interested.

With that being said, let’s dive right into the weird stats.

- The #2 seed in the Eastern Conference has won the NBA Finals six times (1966 and 1968 when the Boston Celtics did it, 1973 when the New York Knicks did it, 1993 when the Chicago Bulls did it, and 2006 and 2012 when the Miami Heat did it). All six times, in the most recent NFL Draft, the Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts chose an offensive player with their first round selection.

Year | Pick | Position
--- | --- | ---
1966 | Sam Ball | Tackle
1968 | John Williams | Tackle
1973 | Bert Jones | Quarterback
1993 | Sean Dawkins | Wide Receiver
2006 | Joseph Addai | Halfback
2012 | Andrew Luck | Quarterback

This year, the Colts chose Malik Hooker with their first round pick, a safety from Ohio State. Since that is a defensive player, the advantage goes to the Warriors.

- After winning their first ever NBA Finals, a team has repeated as champion four times. After winning their first title in 1949, the Minneapolis Lakers won again in 1950, and after winning for the first time in 1991, the Chicago Bulls won again in 1992. After winning their first title in 1989, the Detroit Pistons won again in 1990, and after winning for the first time in 1994, the Houston Rockets won again in 1995. All four times that the team has repeated (1950, 1990, 1992, 1995), the most recent Winter Olympic silver medalist in the men’s slalom had exactly 5 different English letters in their last name. This might be the weirdest stat I have ever come up with.

Year | Most Recent Winter Olympics | Silver Medalist | English Letters in Last Name | Number of Letters
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1950 | 1948 Winter Olympics (St. Moritz) | James Couttet | C, O, U, T (x3), E | 5
1990 | 1988 Winter Olympics (Calgary) | Frank Wörndl | W, R, N, D, L | 5
1992 | 1992 Winter Olympics (Albertville) | Alberto Tomba | T, O, M, B, A | 5
1995 | 1994 Winter Olympics (Lillehammer) | Alberto Tomba | T, O, M, B, A | 5

The most recent Winter Olympics was in 2014 at Sochi. The silver medalist was Austrian skier Marcel Hirscher. He has 6 different English letters in his last name (H, I, R, S, C, E), so advantage to the Warriors here.

- After winning their first ever NBA Finals, a team has repeated as champion four times (1950, 1990, 1992, 1995). All four times that the team has repeated, the most recent Winter Olympic gold medalist in the women’s slalom had a last name that ended in the letter “R”.

Year | Most Recent Winter Olympics | Gold Medalist | Final Letter of Last Name
--- | --- | --- | ---
1950 | 1948 Winter Olympics (St. Moritz) | Gretchen Fraser | R
1990 | 1988 Winter Olympics (Calgary) | Vreni Schneider | R
1992 | 1992 Winter Olympics (Albertville) | Petra Kronberger | R
1995 | 1994 Winter Olympics (Lillehammer) | Vreni Schneider | R

Good news for America? The gold medalist in the 2014 Winter Olympics was Mikaele Shiffrin of the USA, the first winner in this event for the USA since Barbara Cochran won it in 1972. Bad news (depending on what part of America you live in)? Her last name does not end in R, so advantage to the Warriors here.

- After winning their first ever NBA Finals, a team has repeated as champion four times (1950, 1990, 1992, 1995). All four times that the team has repeated, in the pairs figure skating competition at the most recent Winter Olympics, the gold and silver medalists were from Europe, while the bronze medalists were from North America.

Year | Most Recent Winter Olympics | Gold | Silver | Bronze
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1950 | 1948 Winter Olympics (St. Moritz) | Belgium (Lannoy &amp; Bauginet) | Hungary (Kekesy &amp; Kiraly) | Canada (Morrow &amp; Diestelmeyer)
1990 | 1988 Winter Olympics (Calgary) | USSR (Gordeeva &amp; Grinkov) | USSR (Valova &amp; Vasiliev) | USA (Watson &amp; Oppegard)
1992 | 1992 Winter Olympics (Albertville) | Europe (Mishkutenok &amp; Dmitriev) | Europe (Bechke &amp; Petrov) | Canada (Brasseur &amp; Eisler)
1995 | 1994 Winter Olympics (Lillehammer) | Russia (Gordeeva &amp; Grinkov) | Russia (Mishkutenok &amp; Dmitriev) | Canada (Brasseur &amp; Eisler)

At the 2014 Winter Olympics, Russia won the gold and silver medals, but Germany won the bronze medal. Since Germany is not in North America, this stat goes against the Cavs, and is in favor of the Warriors.

- The Warriors have won the NBA Finals four times (1947, 1956, 1975, 2015). All four times, the winning league of the previous MLB All Star Game was the home team.

Year | Most Recent All Star Game Winner | Venue | Home Team
--- | --- | --- | ---
1947 | American League | Fenway Park (Boston Red Sox) | AL
1956 | National League | County Stadium (Milwaukee Braves) | NL
1975 | National League | Three Rivers Stadium (Pittsburgh Pirates) | NL
2015 | American League | Target Field (Minnesota Twins) | AL

The most recent MLB All Star Game was held at Petco Park in San Diego, and was won by the American League. This is not good for the Warriors.

- The Warriors have won the NBA Finals four times (1947, 1956, 1975, 2015). All four times, in the most recent NRL Grand Final (rugby in Australia), exactly one team ending in the letter “N” ended up playing in the Grand Final.

Year | Most Recent Grand Final Teams
--- | ---
1947 | **Balmain** &amp; St. George (1)
1956 | South Sydney &amp; **Newtown** (1)
1975 | Eastern Suburbs &amp; **Canterbury-Bankstown** (1)
2015 | South Sydney &amp; **Canterbury-Bankstown** (1)

This is not a common occurrence; since the 2005 NRL season, this has only happened twice (2012 and 2014), and since 1999, this has only happened three times. Last year’s NRL Grand Final was between Cronulla-Sutherland and Melbourne, so advantage to the Cavaliers with this one. Note that last year, the 2 teams were North Queensland and Brisbane, so the Cavs had the advantage with that weird stat last year.

- LeBron James has played in the NBA Finals seven times prior to this year. When the Golden Boot winner in La Liga (the person that scores the most goals in Spain’s top soccer league) has a first name starting with the letter “L,” then LeBron’s team wins the NBA Finals. When he does not have a first name starting with the letter “L,” then LeBron’s team loses the NBA Finals.

Year | Golden Boot Winner | First Letter of First Name | NBA Finals Result
--- | --- | --- | ---
2006/07 | Ruud van Nistelrooy | R | Cavaliers lose to Spurs
2010/11 | Cristiano Ronaldo | C | Heat lose to Mavericks
2011/12 | Lionel Messi | L | Heat defeat Thunder
2012/13 | Lionel Messi | L | Heat defeat Spurs
2013/14 | Cristiano Ronaldo | C | Heat lose to Spurs
2014/15 | Cristiano Ronaldo | C | Cavaliers lose to Warriors
2015/16 | Luis Suarez | L | Cavaliers defeat Warriors

This year, the Golden Boot winner was Lionel Messi, so advantage to the Cavaliers.

- LeBron James has played in the NBA Finals seven times prior to this year. When the Golden Boot winner in La Liga played on FC Barcelona, then LeBron’s team wins the NBA Finals. When he plays on any other team, then LeBron’s team loses the NBA Finals.

Year | Golden Boot Winner | Team | NBA Finals Result
--- | --- | --- | ---
2006/07 | Ruud van Nistelrooy | Real Madrid | Cavaliers lose to Spurs
2010/11 | Cristiano Ronaldo | Real Madrid | Heat lose to Mavericks
2011/12 | Lionel Messi | FC Barcelona | Heat defeat Thunder
2012/13 | Lionel Messi | FC Barcelona | Heat defeat Spurs
2013/14 | Cristiano Ronaldo | Real Madrid | Heat lose to Spurs
2014/15 | Cristiano Ronaldo | Real Madrid | Cavaliers lose to Warriors
2015/16 | Luis Suarez | FC Barcelona | Cavaliers defeat Warriors

Lionel Messi plays on FC Barcelona. Once again, advantage to the Cavaliers.

- LeBron James has played in the NBA Finals seven times prior to this year. When the Houston Texans’ first round draft pick had exactly seven letters in their full first name, then LeBron’s team wins the NBA Finals. Any other letter combination, and LeBron’s team loses.

Year | Texans’ First Round Pick | Letters in First Name | NBA Finals Result
--- | --- | --- | ---
2007 | Amobi Okoye | 5 | Cavaliers lose to Spurs
2011 | JJ (Justin James) Watt | 2/6/10 | Heat lose to Mavericks
2012 | Whitney Mercilus | 7 | Heat defeat Thunder
2013 | DeAndre Hopkins | 7 | Heat defeat Spurs
2014 | Jadeveon Clowney | 8 | Heat lose to Spurs
2015 | Kevin Johnson | 5 | Cavaliers lose to Warriors
2016 | William Fuller | 7 | Cavaliers defeat Warriors

Will Fuller’s full first name is William, so that counts for last year. This year, the Texans chose quarterback Deshaun Watson out of Clemson. There are 7 letters in Deshaun’s first name. Advantage to the Cavaliers.

- LeBron James has played in the NBA Finals seven times prior to this year. If the previous US Open Cup Final finished with exactly 2 goals scored prior to penalty kicks, then LeBron’s team won the NBA Finals. Any other number, and LeBron’s team lost. 

Year | Most Recent US Open Cup Final Teams | Score Before PKs | Number of Goals | NBA Finals Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2007 | Chicago Fire &amp; Los Angeles Galaxy | 3-1 | 4 | Cavaliers lose to Spurs
2011 | Seattle Sounders FC &amp; Columbus Crew | 2-1 | 3 | Heat lose to Mavericks
2012 | Seattle Sounders FC &amp; Chicago Fire | 2-0 | 2 | Heat defeat Thunder
2013 | Sporting Kansas City &amp; Seattle Sounders | 1-1 | 2 | Heat defeat Spurs
2014 | DC United &amp; Real Salt Lake | 1-0 | 1 | Heat lose to Spurs
2015 | Seattle Sounders FC &amp; Philadelphia Union | 3-1 | 4 | Cavaliers lose to Warriors
2016 | Sporting Kansas City &amp; Philadelphia Union | 1-1 | 2 | Cavaliers defeat Warriors

The most recent US Open Cup Final was between FC Dallas and the New England Revolution. FC Dallas won the game 4-2. Since 6 goals were scored, that’s an advantage for the Warriors.

- LeBron James has played in the NBA Finals seven times prior to this year. When the Green Bay Packers lost in the divisional round of the playoffs in the most recent NFL season, then LeBron’s team won the NBA Finals. Any other result, and LeBron’s team lost.

Year | Green Bay Packers Result | NBA Finals Result
--- | --- | ---
2007 | Didn’t make playoffs (8-8) | Cavaliers lose to Spurs
2011 | Won Super Bowl XLV | Heat lose to Mavericks
2012 | Lose in divisional round to NY Giants | Heat defeat Thunder
2013 | Lose in divisional round to San Francisco | Heat defeat Spurs
2014 | Lose in wild card round to San Francisco | Heat lose to Spurs
2015 | Lose in conference championship to Seattle | Cavaliers lose to Warriors
2016 | Lose in divisional round to Arizona | Cavaliers defeat Warriors

This season, the Packers lost to the Falcons in the conference championship. They got past the divisional round with their dramatic last-second victory over the Dallas Cowboys, so because of this, advantage goes to the Warriors.

- A team has represented the Western Conference in the NBA Finals three straight years in a row 6 times before (1954 with the Minneapolis Lakers, and then 1970, 1984, 1989, 2002, and 2010 with the Los Angeles Lakers). All six times during the three-peat year, the outcome of the series was determined by the most recent Summer Olympics and the 200m dash. If the gold medalist in the men’s 200m dash at the most recent Summer Olympics had a first name containing the letter “N”, then the Western Conference team in their third straight Finals appearance won. If he did not, then the Western Conference team in their third straight Finals appearance lost.

Year | Most Recent Olympics | Men’s 200m Dash Winner | Letter N in First Name? | NBA Finals Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1954 | 1952 Olympics (Helsinki) | Andy Stanfield | Yes | Minneapolis Lakers win (def. New York Knicks)

2002 | 2000 Olympics (Sydney) | Konstantinos Kenteris | Yes | Los Angeles Lakers win (def. New Jersey Nets)
2010 | 2008 Olympics (Beijing) | Usain Bolt | Yes | Los Angeles Lakers win (def. Boston Celtics)

In the most recent Summer Olympics down in Rio de Janeiro, Usain Bolt won. Since he has a letter “n” in his first name, this bodes well for the Golden State Warriors.

- A team has represented the Western Conference in the NBA Finals three straight years in a row 6 times before (1954, 1970, 1984, 1989, 2002, 2010). All six times during the three-peat year, the outcome of the series was determined by the most recent Summer Olympics and the men’s 5000m run. If the silver medalist at the most recent Summer Olympics had a first name starting with an English vowel, then the Western Conference team in their third straight Finals appearance won. If he did not, then the Western Conference team in their third straight Finals appearance lost.

2010 | 2008 Olympics (Beijing) | Eliud Kipchoge | Yes (E) | Los Angeles Lakers win (def. Boston Celtics)

The silver medalist at the 2016 Olympics was American runner Paul Kipkemoi Chelimo. Since his name starts with the letter “P,” and “P” is not a vowel, the advantage goes to the Cavaliers here.

- A team has represented the Western Conference in the NBA Finals three straight years in a row 6 times before (1954, 1970, 1984, 1989, 2002, 2010). All six times during the three-peat year, the outcome of the series was determined by the most recent Summer Olympics and the winner of the men’s 400m hurdles at the most recent Summer Olympics. If the gold medalist’s number of letters in the first and last name add up to exactly 12, then the Western Conference team in their third straight Finals appearance won. Any other number, and the Western Conference team in their third straight Finals appearance lost.

Year | Most Recent Olympics | Men’s 400m Hurdles Gold Medalist | Letters in Name (First + Last) | NBA Finals Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1954 | 1952 Olympics (Helsinki) | Charles Moore | 12 (7 + 5) | Minneapolis Lakers win (def. New York Knicks)
1970 | 1968 Olympics (Mexico City) | David Hemery | 11 (5 + 6) | Los Angeles Lakers lose (Boston Celtics win)

2002 | 2000 Olympics (Sydney) | Angelo Taylor | 12 (6 + 6) | Los Angeles Lakers win (def. New Jersey Nets)
2010 | 2008 Olympics (Beijing) | Angelo Taylor | 12 (6 + 6) | Los Angeles Lakers win (def. Boston Celtics)

This past Olympics, an American by the name of Kerron Clement won the men’s 400m hurdles. Unfortunately for the Warriors, he has 6 letters in his first name and 7 in his last name, meaning that the total adds up to 13.

- A team has represented the Western Conference in the NBA Finals three straight years in a row 6 times before (1954, 1970, 1984, 1989, 2002, 2010). All six times during the three-peat year, the outcome of the series was determined by the most recent Summer Olympics and the winner of the men’s road race individual event in cycling. If the gold medalist had exactly 7 letters in their last name, then the Western Conference team in their third straight Finals appearance won. Any other number, and the Western Conference team in their third straight Finals appearance lost.

2010 | 2008 Olympics (Beijing) | Samuel Sanchez | 7 | Los Angeles Lakers win (def. Boston Celtics)

In the 2016 Summer Olympics, the winning cyclist was a Belgian named Greg van Avermaet. Whether you count it as 8 letters or 11 letters, it still is not 7, so the advantage goes to the Cavaliers here.

- Prior to this season, a Western Conference team with at least 67 wins in the regular season has happened six times; the Warriors did it last year at 73-9, the Lakers did it in 1972 at 69-13, the Lakers did it in 2000 at 67-15, the Spurs did it last year at 67-15, the Mavericks did it in 2007 at 67-15, and the Warriors did it in 2015 at 67-15. All six times, the outcome was determined by the MLB All Star Game. If the most recent edition of the Midsummer Classic was held in an American League ballpark, then the Western Conference team with 67+ wins won the NBA Finals. If it was held in a National League ballpark, then the Western Conference team with 67+ wins did not win the NBA Finals.

Year | Most Recent All Star Game Stadium | League | Team | Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1972 | Tiger Stadium (Detroit Tigers) | American | Los Angeles Lakers (69-13) | Win NBA Finals (def. New York Knicks)
2000 | Fenway Park (Boston Red Sox) | American | Los Angeles Lakers (67-15) | Win NBA Finals (def. Indiana Pacers)

2015 | Target Field (Minnesota Twins) | American | Golden State Warriors (67-15) | Win NBA Finals (def. Cleveland Cavaliers)
2016 | Great American Ballpark (Cincinnati Reds) | National | San Antonio Spurs (67-15) | Lose in second round to Oklahoma City Thunder
2016 | Great American Ballpark (Cincinnati Reds) | National | Golden State Warriors (73-9) | Lose in NBA Finals to Cleveland Cavaliers

This year, the Golden State Warriors went 67-15. However, the most recent MLB All Star Game was held at Petco Park, home of the San Diego Padres. The Padres are a National League team. Advantage to Cleveland here.

- Prior to this season, a Western Conference team with at least 67 wins in the regular season has happened six times (1972, 2000, 2007, 2015, 2016). All six times, the outcome was determined by the most recent gold medalist in the men’s 100m freestyle at the Pan American Games. If the winning swimmer was from Argentina, then the Western Conference team did not win the NBA Finals. However, if the winning swimmer hailed from any other country, then the Western Conference team won the NBA Finals.

Year | Most Recent Pan American Games | Gold Medalist | Country | Team | Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1972 | 1971 Pan American Games (Cali) | Frank Heckl | USA | Los Angeles Lakers (69-13) | Win NBA Finals (def. New York Knicks)
2000 | 1999 Pan American Games (Winnipeg) | Fernando Scherer | Brazil | Los Angeles Lakers (67-15) | Win NBA Finals (def. Indiana Pacers)
2007 | 2003 Pan American Games (Santo Domingo) | Jose Martin Meolans | Argentina | Dallas Mavericks (67-15) | Lose in first round to Golden State Warriors
2015 | 2011 Pan American Games (Guadalajara) | Cesar Cielo | Brazil | Golden State Warriors (67-15) | Win NBA Finals (def. Cleveland Cavaliers)
2016 | 2015 Pan American Games (Toronto) | Federico Grabich | Argentina | San Antonio Spurs (67-15) | Lose in second round to Oklahoma City Thunder
2016 | 2015 Pan American Games (Toronto) | Federico Grabich | Argentina | Golden State Wariors (73-9) | Lose in NBA Finals to Cleveland Cavaliers

Seeing as the Pan American Games happen once every four years in the summer and the next one isn’t until 2019 in Lima, Peru, Federico Grabich is still the most recent gold medalist at this event. Advantage to the Cavaliers here.

- Prior to this season, a Western Conference team with at least 67 wins in the regular season has happened six times (1972, 2000, 2007, 2015, 2016). All six times, the outcome was determined by what the Chicago Bulls did in the season prior. If the Bulls played in a playoff series in the previous year that ended 4-2, then the Western Conference team did not win the NBA Finals. However, if the Bulls did not do this, then the Western Conference team won the NBA Finals.

Year | Previous Chicago Bulls Season | 4-2 Series? | Team | Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1972 | 51-31 (1970/71) | No (lost 4-3 in conference semifinals vs. Lakers) | Los Angeles Lakers (69-13) | Win NBA Finals (def. New York Knicks)
2000 | 13-37 (1998/99) | No (did not make playoffs) | Los Angeles Lakers (67-15) | Win NBA Finals (def. Indiana Pacers)
2007 | 41-41 (2005/06) | Yes (lost 4-2 in first round vs. Heat) | Dallas Mavericks (67-15) | Lose in first round to Golden State Warriors
2015 | 48-34 (2013/14) | No (lost 4-1 in first round vs. Wizards) | Golden State Warriors (67-15) | Win NBA Finals (def. Cleveland Cavaliers)
2016 | 50-32 (2014/15) | Yes (won 4-2 in first round vs. Bucks; lost 4-2 in second round vs. Cavaliers) | San Antonio Spurs (67-15) | Lose in second round to Oklahoma City Thunder
2016 | 50-32 (2014/15) | Yes (won 4-2 in first round vs. Bucks; lost 4-2 in second round vs. Cavaliers) | Golden State Warriors (73-9) | Lose in NBA Finals to Cleveland Cavaliers

Last year, the Bulls missed the playoffs and did not play a series that ended 4-2, so advantage to the Warriors. However, next year, if a Western Conference team finishes with 67+ wins, this stat will work against them, as in this year’s playoffs, the Bulls lost 4-2 to the Celtics in the first round. But for this year, the Warriors get the edge.

- And finally, prior to this season, a Western Conference team with at least 67 wins in the regular season has happened six times (1972, 2000, 2007, 2015, 2016). All six times, the outcome was determined by the Milwaukee Bucks. If the Bucks made the playoffs, then the Western Conference team won the NBA Finals. If the Bucks missed the playoffs, then the Western Conference team did not win the NBA Finals.

Year | Milwaukee Bucks Record | Playoffs? | Team | Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1972 | 63-19 | Yes | Los Angeles Lakers (69-13) | Win NBA Finals (def. New York Knicks)
2000 | 42-40 | Yes | Los Angeles Lakers (67-15) | Win NBA Finals (def. Indiana Pacers)
2007 | 28-54 | No | Dallas Mavericks (67-15) | Lose in first round to Golden State Warriors
2015 | 41-41 | Yes | Golden State Warriors (67-15) | Win NBA Finals (def. Cleveland Cavaliers)
2016 | 33-49 | No | San Antonio Spurs (67-15) | Lose in second round to Oklahoma City Thunder
2016 | 33-49 | No | Golden State Warriors (73-9) | Lose in NBA Finals to Cleveland Cavaliers

This year, the Milwaukee Bucks finished 42-40, making the playoffs. Advantage goes to the Warriors here.

After these 19 weird stats, there are 10 in favor of the Cavaliers, and 9 in favor of the Warriors. Assuming all the weird stats cancel each other out, the weird stats pick the Cavaliers to win the NBA Finals.",nba,1290

DefectiveLaptop,2017-05-01 01:46:11+00:00,"I was an 8th grade dropout, but as of yesterday I'm a college grad.","Like the title says, I dropped out in the middle of 8th grade.  I had been sick with a bunch of respiratory issues, fell too far behind to catch up (and was too prideful back then to even ask for help, plus it took years to get well), got a GED instead, and then kind of floated around a bit.  My grandpa taught me how to weld and make furniture, but I never made enough doing that to even have to file for taxes.  Later when I was working at Subway I thought that maybe I'd like to study Linguistics.  I didn't get into the university I wanted, so I went to the community college and got an AA.  When I applied again, the university that rejected me before accepted me.  Later I even got to study abroad in Beijing for a semester.  Now after years of feeling inadequate and inferior from a lack of education, I've graduated cum laude with a major in Linguistics and a minor in Chinese.  Not that a college education is required to be intelligent, but for me it's the first time in so long that I've felt like I'm not so stupid, like my life isn't fragmented anymore.  I can't single out one reason for wanting to tell my story here, happiness... gratefulness... maybe to encourage others. I just wanted to tell it.  Oh, and if anyone's looking for a linguist.... :p

Edit: Wow, I didn't expect this to get so big.  I don't think I'll be able to respond to each individually, but I'm so grateful for all the congratulatory messages.  It's also great to see so many others that were in a similar situation.  Even if it's late, congrats to you too!  And for those who are still working on it, you can do it! :D",TwoXChromosomes,7617

panda_nectar,2017-04-08 18:50:44+00:00,I made $108 last week having unstructured conversations online with people who need to practice their English.,"[Payment proof](http://imgur.com/XAm7hEn)


I started working with Cambly a little over a week ago. You earn $10.20 per hour to chat with people who are learning English as a second language. For the most part, the conversations are just fun and casual. I talked to a little boy about Batman for half an hour, for example. Occasionally someone will ask me a specific question about English grammar or a certain expression, but if I don't know the answer I can just quickly Google it and send them a link.


The best part about it is that you can do it at literally any time of day. I've worked with other similar websites and most of them want you to have a set schedule, which can be difficult when their peak hours are at an inconvenient time due to time zone differences. For instance, another site I've worked with needs teachers to commit to 6-9 pm Beijing time, which is 5-8 in the morning for me. With Cambly I can just sit down and sign on to take calls whenever I feel like it. Also, a lot of the other sites require you to dress professionally or conduct lessons in a very specific way or have a high-quality headset and this site doesn't have very strict rules in that sense.

It's very casual, very easy, and actually pretty fun. I applied and was approved within a couple of days, and was able to get started right away. I wish I was able to do it from my iPad, but it's not a big deal to use my laptop. I recommend doing the 'priority hours' if you can -- you get paid to be ""on call"" online even if no one calls you!

I just thought you guys might be interested in my take on this site! I can answer any questions you have about how it works!

How will the NFL address this problem?","I know what you’re thinking. We’re just 3 weeks removed from Super Bowl LI, and you’re already looking ahead five years to Super Bowl LVI? However, the NFL has a very interesting dilemma with this Super Bowl. For years, the Super Bowl has been the marquee event of that particular date. There will be programming before the game from other channels, such as college basketball games and celebrity bowling tournaments, but even that pales in comparison to what the pregame shows get.

Once the game starts, everything is about the Super Bowl. Other networks will just concede to the network broadcasting the Super Bowl. No other professional sporting events take place at the same time as the Super Bowl, and from the research I did, the only other sporting event taking place in the USA directly in competition with the Super Bowl was a women’s basketball game on ESPNU that started at 6:30 between Memphis and South Florida (I feel bad for everyone that had to play in that game). There are 2 options for people during the Super Bowl- you either turn on the TV and watch the game, or you don’t. There’s no other alternative. Nothing else is on TV during the Super Bowl, and for years, the NFL has been able to capitalize on this in the first Sunday of February.

Super Bowl LVI, on the other hand? That’s where things get a bit tricky. It’s one thing to go up against re-runs and [the Fish Bowl between the Los Angeles Clams and the Buffalo Gills]( http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/wild/fish-bowl/). It’s another thing to go up against the Winter Olympics.

**The Problem**

Assuming that TV contracts hold up, CBS will be broadcasting Super Bowl LVI (3-year rotation between CBS, NBC, and FOX). NBC has the rights to broadcast the Winter Olympics. Normally, this is not a problem- the Winter Olympics have never interfered with the Super Bowl. For the past four installments of the Winter Olympics dating back to 2002 in Salt Lake City, the Winter Olympics have been held five days after the Super Bowl, so you get no football hangover whatsoever (side note- those years with the Winter Olympics and World Cup are the best years for sports; the years with the European Championships and Summer Olympics are second best, and then any odd numbered years are not fun for the offseason).

Year | Super Bowl | Date of Super Bowl | Site of Olympics | Date of Opening Ceremony
---- | ----- | ------ | ------ | --------
2002 | Super Bowl XXXVI | 2/3/02 | Salt Lake City, USA | 2/8/02
2006 | Super Bowl XL | 2/5/06 | Torino, Italy | 2/10/06
2010 | Super Bowl XLIV | 2/7/10 | Vancouver, Canada | 2/12/10
2014 | Super Bowl XLVIII | 2/2/14 | Sochi, Russia | 2/7/14

It’s going to be the same thing next year. NBC right now is loving life, because they are broadcasting Super Bowl LII, and then five days later, get to broadcast the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. They’ve got the ultimate dream right now.

However, it’s not going to be like that in 2022. Why they awarded the Games to Beijing in the first place, I’m not entirely sure, seeing as they hosted the Summer Olympics, and have no mountains anywhere near the city center. They’re going to use [fake snow](http://www.bbc.com/sport/winter-sports/33747313) down the mountains (and no, that’s not fake news… they’re actually planning on using fake snow), and this will be the third straight Olympics in Asia (2018 in South Korea, 2020 in Tokyo, 2022 in Beijing).

In terms of football, though, the 2022 Winter Olympics poses a major problem. The Opening Ceremony for these Olympics are taking place on February 4, 2022. If the Super Bowl is still held on the first Sunday in February, then Super Bowl LVI will occur on February 6. For the first time ever, if the schedule holds up, the Winter Olympics and Super Bowl will come into conflict with each other.

There are two events that non-sports fans watch. One of them is the Super Bowl. They watch for the halftime show, they watch for the parties, and they watch for the commercials. It’s a fun atmosphere for all involved, even if you’re not a football fan. The other one, unfortunately for the NFL, is the Olympics, whether it’s the Winter Olympics or the Summer Olympics. They watch because it’s the only time you can see particular sports on TV at the highest level, they watch for that sense of American pride, and they watch because it’s an event that happens just once every four years. Here’s what the NFL would be competing against on that Sunday, assuming the 2018 schedule holds of what is taking place that Sunday:

- Alpine skiing (including a gold medal event)

- Biathlon (including a gold medal event)

- Cross country skiing (including a gold medal event)

- Curling

- Figure skating

- Freestyle skiing (including a gold medal event)

- Ice hockey

- Luge

- Snowboarding (including a gold medal event)

- Speed skating (including a gold medal event)

They’d be competing against not just one event, but a variety of them, including the juggernaut that is figure skating (the vast majority of the non-sports fans I know will be glued to the television during figure skating events), and a bunch of gold medal events in the process. That’s a lot different than competing against the Fish Bowl and some World’s Strongest Man re-runs, especially if you get a USA/Russia or USA/Canada hockey game scheduled at the same time as the Super Bowl. According to recent data, the 2014 Winter Olympics were watched in primetime by an average of [21.7 million people per night](http://www.newsday.com/sports/olympics/nbc-releases-sochi-winter-olympics-ratings-data-1.7204742), and [78% of US TV homes tuned into at least some part of the Winter Olympics](http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/network-press-releases/76-of-u-s-tv-homes-tuned-in-to-sochi-games-coverage-on-networks-of-nbcuniversal/).

Would the NFL still win the night if they competed directly against the Olympics? Absolutely. I don’t think anyone, even NBC, would think otherwise. Having said that, would their ratings take an absolute nosedive if they went head-to-head against the Olympics? You bet. There’s a high chance that the ratings dip below 100 million if the NFL actually went up against NBC during these Olympics.

Whether or not the NFL is aware of this problem or is thinking actively about this problem remains to be seen. But the league has three options to address it.

**Solution #1: Change Nothing**

There’s the first option, which is to change absolutely nothing. Play the game on the first Sunday of February at 6:30, and then when NBC comes on with their Olympic coverage, be in direct competition. However, there are a few massive problems with this option.

Number one, if the game becomes a blowout or unwatchable, or football fans tune out for the halftime show, they could switch over to NBC and just never change the game back. If you get a Super Bowl XLVIII-esque situation on your hands, by the end of the night, NBC might actually have comparable ratings with the Super Bowl. Remember what happened at Super Bowl XXVI during the halftime show, [which I wrote about here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/5qbeum/oc_on_this_day_25_years_ago_a_bold_decision_by/?ref=search_posts). In short, FOX decided to counter-program against the halftime show, actually drew a quarter of CBS’ audience away from the game and to FOX, and a large portion of the audience never flipped the game back to CBS because the game was so bad. Remember that Super Bowl XXVI was broadcast by CBS. They are well aware of their history, and they’d be broadcasting Super Bowl LVI thirty years later. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, on the other hand…

Number two, the amount that CBS would be able to charge for advertisements would plummet compared to previous years. Maybe instead of being able to charge $5 million (as is the standard price now), they’ll only be able to charge $3 million. How much a network can charge for ads depends on how many people are watching the game; there’s a reason why an advertisement during a regular season NFL game at 1:00 between the Browns and the Jaguars costs significantly less than a Super Bowl ad. If the NFL decides this option, CBS throws a fit. No way does CBS want to be competing directly against the Olympics, considering their own history and the advertising dollars at stake.

Yes, the NFL is stubborn. Yes, people now associate the Super Bowl with the first Sunday in February at 6:30. But there are so many ways that this could backfire that I doubt the league actually plays the game that Sunday at 6:30.

**Solution #2: Start the Game Earlier**

Of course, they could keep it on the same date as before, but just start the game earlier. If the NFL wants to be bold and place a Super Bowl in London, this is the year to do it. Start the game at 3:00 Eastern (which would be primetime in London), and have your earliest kickoff since Super Bowl X back in 1976, when the game started at 2:14 PM Eastern (for the record, the earliest ever Super Bowl kickoff was Super Bowl V in 1971, starting at 2:00). All data for that comes courtesy of [this chart](http://gawker.com/what-time-is-the-super-bowl-in-one-amazing-chart-1513231876). You keep the game on the first Sunday of February, but just start it at 3:00. Game ends by 7:00, postgame is over at 7:30, and it’s a perfect transition into NBC’s Olympic coverage.

This option isn’t perfect, though. For one, the pregame shows take a hit in terms of ratings. And while this option seems good on the East Coast, it’s an absolute pain on the West Coast. Does the league really want to have the Super Bowl start at noon on the West Coast, when people are just waking up two hours before kickoff? That contributes to the pregame shows taking a ratings hit. Also, CBS might still not be happy about this, because nobody would watch their lead-out show. They’d flip off the lead-out show immediately to go to NBC and the Olympics. While you wouldn’t have to deal with live Olympic events (it’d be 3:00 in the morning in Beijing), and while you would still be able to keep the game on the first Sunday in February, it still poses some problems for all parties involved. If you’re on the East Coast, though, this plan seems like heaven. 

**Solution #3: Move the Date**

And then, there’s the option to just move the game to a different date, like the final Sunday in January like it used to be prior to Super Bowl XXXVIII (Super Bowl XXXVI was supposed to be the final Sunday in January, but because of the attacks on September 11 forcing the league to postpone week 2, the Super Bowl got moved). The league has done this before with moving the season due to other circumstances. In the 1999 season, the NFL [moved the season back a week so that nobody would have to play on January 1, 2000, due to the Y2K concerns](http://a.espncdn.com/nfl/s/1999/0327/30700.html). From Wikipedia:

&gt; The start of the 1999 NFL season was pushed back one week and started the weekend after Labor Day, a change from the previous seasons. Due to the Y2K concerns, the NFL did not want to hold the opening round of the playoffs on Saturday, January 1, 2000, and did not want teams traveling on that day. Week 17 games were held on January 2, 2000, and the opening round of the playoffs would be scheduled for January 8-9.

The NFL needs the double bye before the Super Bowl because of the Pro Bowl (and because of the juggernaut that the game has become), so this means that the season would be pushed up a week, starting Labor Day weekend. Even though the game is on the final Sunday of January, this seems to benefit all parties involved from the NFL’s perspective… right?

Not necessarily. Because even though CBS isn’t angry, college football is to a certain extent. The NCAA has played week 1 of their season on Labor Day weekend, including games that Sunday and Monday that are usually marquee games. This year, the Notre Dame/Texas game that took place that Sunday night was one of the highest rated games of the season. Now, they wouldn’t be able to play that game because they can’t go directly against the NFL. Those Sunday and Monday night games that they had week 1 couldn’t be played. Of course, college football could, in turn, push their season back one weekend, but considering the fact that some schools aren’t even in session yet, attendance would take a dramatic hit in week one.

**Conclusion**

Because of the circumstances with the Olympics and the NFL, someone’s going to get ticked off no matter what the NFL proposes. There’s nothing the league can do about it. The question is what the league wants to do and what battle they want to fight. Do they want to fight a battle against both NBC and CBS, do they want to fight a battle against CBS, or do they want to fight a battle against the NCAA? Either way, the NFL is going to be in competition with some organization.

It may be five years away, but considering the fact that no stadium has been awarded the rights to Super Bowl LVI yet and no date has been determined for the game, the league has time to determine an appropriate solution. We’ll see which route they decide to go. 

**What Would You Do?**

[I decided to add a straw-poll](http://www.strawpoll.me/12423627) to see what /r/NFL would do in this situation. Choose from 1 of the 3 options I mentioned above- keep the game as scheduled, move it to an earlier start time, or move the date.",nfl,3186

&amp;nbsp;
        
**In Summary**    
So in total that means that of the 736 players who turned up at the tournament, there are only 75 still going.    
-	 Midfielders are the best represented with 26, defenders are the lowest with 13.   
-	Japan still have the highest number of active players with 9, while 3 countries (France, Germany &amp; Portugal) have no one still standing    
-	With only 3 players still going, group D is the clear group of ~~death~~ retirement.    
-	The average age of players still going is 37, with three 32 yr olds and incredibly one 49 yr old in the shape of Masashi Nakayama.    
-	There are 6 unfortunate souls however who currently find themselves without a club, so if you’re looking for a bargain after deadline day then look no further.

JamRed10,2016-10-20 20:42:25+00:00,Guide to Chinese Hip-Hop,"Hey /r/hiphopheads,


I’m a kid that’s lived in China my whole life but I’ve recently moved to Canada for university. I’ve been writing lyrics since I was about 11 years but only really started making music since high school. Since the hip hop scene in China hasn’t always been that big, I never used to follow any Chinese rappers since there weren’t any worth following. However, the hip-hop scene in China is bigger than ever now and it’s still growing. As a proud Chinese person, I really wanted to try and diversify this subreddit’s taste in rap music by sharing with you guys some of what I consider to be the best hip-hop artists and groups in China.  

Also, I’m not claiming to be the most-versed in the Chinese hip-hop scene so feel free to share what you guys know too! This list was based mostly off my taste in music so I didn’t really include the entire spectrum of the genre. I hope even if you don’t understand the language that you’d be down to check out China’s up-and-coming artists.
 
&amp;nbsp;

**Notable YouTube Channels:**

[88rising](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZW5lIUz93q_aZIkJPAC0IQ) and [ZHONG.TV](https://www.youtube.com/user/zhongtv) are two of the best channels that are showcasing the talent over in Asia. Some of the artists on ZHONG.TV are kinda wack but hey - whether music is good or not is mostly subjective, right?

&amp;nbsp;

**Chengdu Artists:**

As for trap artists, Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan (yes, as in Szechuan beef), is absolutely killing the game.

[Chengdu Rap House](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd1mB2u7ogMGJssiV0YoBfw) is a hip-hop collective based in Chengdu (duh) and consists of artists such as:

* Ty - This man is crazy. Dude raps about hard drugs like China doesn’t actually execute people for that shit. Some of his stuff is gahbage (again, my opinion) but he definitely has a lot of good tracks. Has quite a bit of material out if you just search him up
	
  * [《嗨药上了瘾》](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvDb8VN4qCU)
  * [“A Lifetime” //《一辈子》](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roLwkQvguvg)
  * [《凹造型》](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T52B1uyiTnU)

* Higher Brothers - My favorite Chinese rappers right now. These guys honestly have so much energy and charisma. I just want to see them succeed. The group consists of Masiwei, DZ, Psy.P, and Melo. Masiwei looks and sounds like a Chinese Swae Lee and the dude is actually lyrical. These boys’ lyrics are actually poetic as fuck if you understand Chinese. I don’t know how to analogize it with English but basically some of their lines are to Chinese what Shakespearian literature is to English. Probably doesn’t make sense but fuck it.

 * [“Black Cab”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfZPz7okidc) - This song is so damn catchy
 * [“Bitch Don’t Kill My Dab”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhrCSb8URFc)
 * [“Panda (Remix)”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwY8CYhOPc)
 * [“Cosplay”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b0cnw11VrE)

 They also have a mixtape out and available for download. MediaFire link though, don’t know if   that’s allowed
 
&amp;nbsp;


**Other Chinese Artists:**

* Purple Soul - Shout out Beijing! This group of Beijing rappers all have that good ol’ thick Beijing accent (jesus, I miss home) and their stuff is more old-school. Content-wise, their music is more philosophical.

 * [“Underpass”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sY6n0sj0rc)

 * [“IN3”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-2KToSVGqk)


* Sean Zh - Another Beijing artist. Seems like old-school hip-hop is more popular in Beijing. Fitting since it’s such an old-school city in general.

 * [“Born ’90”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU-cG_J3EB4)


* Chillgun - Guangzhou rapper so he has more tracks in Cantonese but this is my favorite track of his (in Mandarin):

 * [《你是那种哦》](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMx9ABbZbU)

* 49NybinEra - These guys only have one track out that I know of but it’s pretty good
 * [《不摆你》](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zzKEFAoJco)

* BRIDE - Also only one track that I know of so far:
 * [“DRAGON BO$$”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4eVkgxTtg) - buddy’s stunting pretty hard but the track is not bad.

* BUSY GANG - My friends and I love them because they’re kind of a joke. Music’s not even that great but for some reason, it’s pretty comedic. Pretty sure that wasn’t intentional though…

 * [“Ganja Wang”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BrxqXSOy9w) - The song is about being the “street fight king” (not weed dicks) but in linguistic context, it’s actually stupid and pretty hilarious.

&amp;nbsp;


**Taiwanese Artists:**

Yes - I know the difference. My family is originally from Taiwan but I’m not trying to politick so idgaf. Plus some of these guys are pretty good so why not give them a shout out?


* [Simon &amp; Sowut](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC94G4vYyT7bPazJqq11prwQ/videos?sort=p&amp;view=0&amp;flow=grid) - 
These guys remind me of Yung Lean/Sad Boys/cloud rap type shit. They got some pretty good songs if you’re into that sub-genre but they also dabble in trap and R&amp;B.

 * [《北方》] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7T279oi6Mo)
 * [“PANNA”] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L31V0cC0MY8) - Another Panda remix? C’mon guys.
 * [《阿飛的小蝴蝶 REMIX》](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVSvY3yRPSc More R&amp;B than hip-hop but it’s good)

* Tommy - Another Taiwanese rapper. Don’t know much about dude but this song’s decent:
 * [“GENJI”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDe5o5li_v8)

* [“Life” by MJ116, Barry Chen, Dizzy Dizzo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svHObS_TcgM) - **WARNING:** the music video features hard ass Taiwanese dudes that look like they’d fit right at home in Compton (if you’re from Compton and this is wrong, please don’t take offense).

 * This track is a tribute to [“Life’s a Struggle”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsrXRsXQHmM) by 宋岳庭, a Taiwanese rapper that died from cancer at the age of 23. Really talented kid and known in Taiwan as the “rapper-spokesman for the lower class”.

Let me know what you guys think about these songs and Chinese hip-hop in general. Do you guys like it? Hate it? Either way, we're up and coming and making this post for you guys has been a lot of fun.

wobbly_au,2016-10-06 07:13:00+00:00,Truth about IG.,"(Posting for Ana since his post was removed)

Hi guys,

Everything you're about to read is the truth, and even though it probably won't help me I hope others learn from my mistake.I never wanted to post or bring this drama to the public but I have exhausted all possible channels of communication and I am at my wits end. 

I guess most of you don't know me since I'm not a top player, so I'll give a brief intro to my background. I'm a 16 year old Australian born Chinese/Viet mix who left the final year of high school to try play dota2 professionally and my family isn't exactly well off so my success in dota is very important. My friend &amp; manager, Tian (CEO of gogosu.com, a Chinese dota2 coaching platform) helped me piece my thoughts and write this post. 

Proof its me.

http://imgur.com/a/E5WvS

Tian has been my friend even before I went to China, we used to play Aus pubs together a lot and when he understood my situation he recommended me to try pro dota2 for a year. With the help of Tian I left for China on 17th of Jan and stayed with hes family until end of March, during this period Tian used his connections in China and had vouched for me to trial at different clubs, EHOME.K, VG.R and IG. I was very new to pro dota and seriously sucked so I was beyond ecstatic that IG were interested in offering me a position.

Tian helped me read and alter a thick contract between IG, ACE and myself. Initially the contract was heavily favored toward IG and left very little protection to myself. IG could let go of me as they wished, didn't guarantee me prize money split, couldn't guarantee me play time and was a two year long contract. The offer was for me to play as IGV's main player, but that Ferrari430 may come back at some point and at that point I could either switch to the other IG roster or play as sub.

Because of this Tian made multiple adjustments to the proposed contract including but not limited to the following,

* I would have equal prize money with all 5 players in non valve events whether I was a main player or sub
* I would have equal prize money with 4 players (BBK, XXS, QD, Rong but excluding Ferrari430) in Valve events
* The contract would only last 1 year instead of 2
* That I would be guaranteed some play time in scrims and minor tournaments
* That I would be provided a teacher for Chinese and Math
That all my travel costs to renew my Chinese visa would be paid for

After many iterations back and forth IG finally agreed to these changes, however when we went to sign, none of the agreed upon changes made it into the final contract. I immediately contacted Zhili, IG's COO and he guaranteed that it was a clerical mistake and that everything IG promised will hold even though the contract had been changed. He said that it would be too late to reprint and to trust his word on it. My mother in Australia signed the contract for me as I am still underage.

Fast forward a few weeks, Ferrari430 was suddenly back and IGV renamed to IG and IG renamed to IGV, I was told I could play mid for IGV (Paparazzi's stack) or sub for Ferrari430. It was a very tough decision, but I chose to stay with IG because IG promised me that even though I was a sub I would still get equal share of prize money and IG also promised that it would be the final year for Ferrari430 and that he was definitely retiring after TI regardless of result. Had I known what was about to happen to me I would have never chose to be benched for 4 months as a sub. 

After returning to the team Ferrari430 played very well in the NEA online qualifiers and helped IG secure LAN final in Beijing and then abruptly left the team. I was subbed in last minute and played only in the LAN finals but luckily we were able to secure the victory over Newbee.

Fast forward a few months and a lot has happened or should I say not happened. Ferrari430 came back to train for TI qualifiers and again I was benched. During my entire stay at IG, no attempt at getting me a Chinese tutor or translator was ever made, I was excluded from most team meetings because according to the management I did not understand Chinese, I was never compensated for costs related to renewing my Chinese visa. Overall the management of the team was very poor and there was little communication between management and myself.

Fast forward to the beginning of post TI shuffle, management didn't proactively let me know whether they had a spot on the team for me and whether Ferrari430 would stay or leave. In the end Tian and I had to wrestle the truth out of them, they did not want me on the main or IGV roster but said that they would make a third team for me. This sounded like a poor attempt at benching me again for a season since no players other than myself were confirmed for IG's 3rd team. Guess what? Its October and IG does not have a third roster.

Their excuse was that I could not communicate with the team when in actual fact my mother is Shanghainese and that makes me half Chinese and I understand all the dota2 terminology, items, heroes, skills how to coordinate in fights, I was also willing to learn. 不能给我一个机会？ The truth of the situation is that they were already in talks with bigger name players and they had time left on my contract and didn't know what to do with me. When we asked them who was on this supposed 3rd team of IG or even what the name was no information could be provided to us.

There are a lot of rumors on the Chinese forums that I left IG because I could not speak Chinese or eat Chinese food. That is all false, I can understand enough Chinese for pro dota and I love Chinese food, but I also enjoy western food. Is that a crime? 

I really wanted to continue playing with my boys in IG but management didn’t let me. This is when Tian started negotiating my release from IG because they didn't have any real plans of having a third team, as far as I know I was going to be benched for another season. I would rather go back to school if I could not find a good team and was a sub doing nothing again. 

I was finally paid my winnings from NEA late September and it was ￥51,200 RMB out of a grand total of ￥800,000 RMB and the rest of the players were paid over ￥100,000 RMB. I am also yet to be paid for my DPL (over $2000 USD)  or G-League winnings (over $2000 USD). 

When we contacted IG regarding the discrepancy between what I was paid and what was promised they made excuses and eventually cut contact with us. They simply don't acknowledge that they promised me equal share of prize money even when presented with proof, VK (IG CEO) even went as far as belittling my manager for wanting more than I got and that it was a joke that we were even talking to him for so little money because he is such an important man. In the end VK (CEO), Zhili (COO) have all stopped replying messages from Tian and myself and I am short over $12,000 USD.

I am deeply sad that such a world renowned club would be ruined by such poor management. How many players have been ripped off by IG or other shady clubs? Will Ferrari430 ever receive his Ferrari promised to him by IG? Are promises worth nothing unless written in the form of a contract? 

Here are the transcripts (In Chinese) between Tian and IG.Zhili (IG COO) The transcripts are basically Zhili promising us equal share of prize money and when confronted with his own chat history he ignores us.

Here are the transcripts (In Chinese) between Tian and IG.VK (IG CEO) The transcripts are VK belittling Tian and basically ignoring the evidence that the COO of IG promised us equal pay.

I don't see how I will ever get this 12k back and it is a lot of money for my family and I. I guess I am just really sad about this whole situation but I have learnt my lesson. Finally, I just want to make it clear that my beef is with IG’s management and I have NOTHING against the players in IG, I made many friends there and I am grateful for that and still chat with them day to day. 

If on the off chance that Wang Sicong reads this post, please return to me what I am owed and stop letting bad management ruin IG.

Ana

**Comment from my manager: To those saying I should not have advised Ana to sign an altered contract. I recognise it was a risk however at that time it was a take it or leave it but if we take it IG promised us verbally the terms we wanted. It was still in Ana's best interest to take and sign the contract, as starting a career in a team was more important to Ana than money, this however does not take away from IG's wrong doing. Secondly according to Chinese law wechat chatlogs are absolutely admissible in event of contract dispute.**

This is going to be updating for a while. If anyone has relevant pics or gifs or videos for any of the moments leave them in this thread too, many have been taken from the awards threads as stands so thanks to everyone involved in that.**

Before I get into the many, many amazing comments, moments, pictures and general brilliance of the games I want to write a thank you to everyone that took part in these threads. I originally wrote/stole these from other websites shamelessly for /r/unitedkingdom and got about 20 comments. At the lowest these threads had 4000, at the highest nearly 11,000. You've all made my Olympics and this has been one of the nicest experiences of my sporting life (literally nothing will ever beat Ulster Rugby winning anything or [this David Healy goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F860wWo9wUo)) but this comes very close.

These Games haven't been without their controversy, there's been doping allegations, zika worries, gender questioning, a green pool, poor sportsmanship, blatant cheating in the boxing...but still we had moments where two warring countries had competitors come together to take a selfie, we had a refugee team, we had people crying in joy because they got to see their flag raised high and their anthem played for the first time, the 20th time, the 100th time and we had people setting aside any differences to compete in a massive sporting arena. I hope that's what they'll be remembered as, the great distraction we get from the worlds issues and our own every 4 years to remember that we aren't all that different and that we can all come together for a friendly competition. Unless you sort the medal table like that you sicko! :P

I genuinely think these threads have represented the best of the Olympic spirit, i've seen people from all over the world come together and support random countries in ridiculous sports because an athletes story spoke to them or because they wanted glory to come where it hasn't before and for the most part everyone has been respectful, helpful and kind. It's been amazing and i'm so glad we did this. :)

3) I don't know if people know what this is. It is fending, swimming, show jumping and combined pistol shooting with cross country running.

This is like the happiest place on earth. Crazy. She was furious when we were at the Athletics stadium and this family from my country came up and congratulated me and we're excited to meet me. I'll never forget seeing that look of jealous rage on her face and it was like my lightbulb moment that this was very very wrong and normal mothers aren't like this. Now that Olympics are on I love it but it's triggering for me. She basically soured what should have been one of the most amazing experiences of my life. Oh and two weeks before the Olympics I missed my other brother's wedding party (they eloped so as to avoid the whole family wedding thing).  My SIL was introducing her to people and commented, ""her daughter is competing in the Olympics in two weeks"".  Apparently my mother screwed up her face and said, ""I've never watched my children do sport!"" And walked away. My SIL told me this and again things clicked into place. It's just so fucked up.

https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/4v9cju/discussion_is_pangus_jailbreak_safe_an_hour_after/d5wvkjd?context=3 

Here's my story: I've been jailbreaking for several years. I don't pirate or run any other sketchy programs on my machine, as this is primarily a work computer I built last year for graphic design. When I jailbroke, I downloaded from Pangus site and I used a throwaway apple login. I have never had a breach like this happen.

On July 25th, about an hour after I jailbroke my phone, someone in Beijing accessed my paypal and sent $50 to the email account: novitskvassgs@hotmail.com.

Luckily I was awake, and contacted paypal immediately after I received their email and they refunded the transaction. They confirmed my account was accessed from Beijing.

They also tried to use my credit card, but fraud protection kicked in thankfully. 

I have since changed all passwords, made sure 2FA was on all applicable accounts. (This is how I assume they got my paypal)

-

I don't believe they stole my information by remoting into my phone, but maybe my machine? I have never had team viewer installed either.

When this happened, I immediately thought it was because of the jailbreak application. It just seemed far too coincidental to me. I hesitated in posting this thread because I thought I was just being paranoid.

Tweaks: Only had PokemonGoAnywhere, Masterball, PPappstore (as this breach happened pretty quick after I jailbroke)

Cydia Substrate was installed

No openSHH

The plane was en route to Beijing, but an investigation later concluded the plane had taken an unexplained detour and crashed in the southern Indian Ocean. The original wreckage has never been found, but several pieces have washed ashore the eastern coast of Africa. All on board are presumed dead, and the cause of the crash is unknown.

The update: This story was originally published in New York Magazine, which obtained a copy of a confidential report that detailed the FBI's examination of the pilot's computer.

[From CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/22/asia/mh370-pilot-simulation/):

&gt; An FBI forensic examination shows the pilot of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 conducted a flight simulation on his home computer that closely matched the suspected route of the missing Boeing 777 in the southern Indian Ocean, according to a Malaysian government document obtained by New York magazine.

&gt; The confidential document summarizes Malaysia's police investigation into Zaharie Ahmad Shah, the captain of the plane that has been missing for more than two years.

&gt; According to the magazine, citing the document, the FBI analyzed hard drives from a flight simulator Zaharie had built using Microsoft Flight Simulator X software. The FBI was able to recover data points from the program that pointed to the southern Indian Ocean.

&gt; **The document is quoted as saying the simulated flight was made less than a month before MH370 went missing in March 2014.**

[Here is the original NYMag article](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/07/mh370-pilot-flew-suicide-route-on-home-simulator.html).

CNN goes on to say it hasn't independently confirmed the report, but if this information is true (and so far, there's nothing to indicate that it isn't), that's some strong evidence for the pilot suicide theory.

ETA: The NYMag article contains a picture comparing the computer-simulated route (in red) to the route that investigators believe MH370 took on March 8, 2014 (in yellow).

When I was interviewing for the job they asked if I had any extra things that I enjoyed out of work and I'd read about how languages can make you more employable and seem interesting, so I lied and said 'I speak Chinese actually, taught through self study and some time studying there.' Out of all the lies on my CV that greatly exaggerated my work experience, this one stuck. I've no idea why I said it, but I was just desperate to secure some work and thought it would be forgotten.

Before I'd even started, word got round. For months people have been saying to me around the office 'wow it's really cool you can speak Chinese, what's the word for _____?'.  

I thought it would die out, so I've just been making random noises like 'ming bing' and 'shee chow' and similar thinking that it sounded good enough and people would then soon forget. I've also been telling stories from 'my time in China' which have been horrific, I found out the other day about me saying I visited the great Wall in Beijing was factually incorrect - there is no part of the wall there! 

Anyway, what should I do? Speaking Chinese is nothing to do with my job and there is no foreseeable way it could be, but I'm concerned if I get found out somehow I'll be dismissed. People have been walking around the office making gibberish sounds that are the words I've 'taught' them. 

Please help, any advice?

MrFavs,2016-04-23 00:31:44+00:00,This is Jon Favreau. There are many ways to see The Jungle Book. Here's some info to help you decide what's best for you.,"Hi, this is Jon Favreau.    
Thanks to all of you who came out to see the Jungle Book.  Its warm reception around the world is extremely appreciated. Thank you.

&amp;nbsp;

I’m posting because a lot of people are asking which of the seemingly endless list of formats I recommend to see the movie in. Let me start by saying that the answer’s different for everybody so I’ll try to cover as thoroughly as possible what the best thing is for each taste.

&amp;nbsp;

There is a very exciting new technology out there right now, and Jungle Book is the first film that has been released in the format. It’s called **Dolby Vision 3D**.  Unfortunately, there are only a handful of theaters that have it.  It’s a laser projection system with extended dynamic range. The black levels on the screen are extremely deep, the contrast levels are much higher and the brightness of the screen make for a 3D experience where the glasses disappear.  I think this technology is a game-changer and I applaud Dolby for this breakthrough and look forward to it being more widely available.

&amp;nbsp;

Here are the places where it’s currently available:    
**Los Angeles:** El Capitan Theatre    
**New York:** AMC Empire 25    
**Chicago Area:** AMC Hawthorn 12    

&amp;nbsp;

Internationally- Four locations:    
**Two in The Netherlands** (JT Eindhoven &amp; JT Hilversum)    
Cinesa La Maquinista in **Barcelona**    
The Cinelpexx in **Linz, Austria**    

&amp;nbsp;

You can find out more about it here: http://www.dolby.com/us/en/brands/dolby-cinema/the-jungle-book.html

&amp;nbsp;

If you’re a fan of the big-screen format, **IMAX** has a laser projection system that’s extremely robust and many people that I talk to consider this their top choice.  If you want a more intense experience with a clean bright image and the cutting edge IMAX sound system, then this is a great way to go.  Although the black levels are not as true as the Dolby Vision, the laser projection counteracts the dimming effect of the 3D glasses and I think it is a fantastic premium way to see it that I highly recommend.  If you haven’t checked out **IMAX with laser**, you should definitely give it a shot.    
Unfortunately, there are relatively few locations of these projection systems around the world. IMAX has made it easy to find them through this site: http://www.imax.com/news/experience-jungle-book-imax-laser

&amp;nbsp;

Another format that I am very impressed with is **Cinemark Ultra 3D**. It boasts an extremely bright image that counteracts any dimming associated with traditional 3D. My experience is that the screen size is impressive and the quality is very high. Again, another great choice but not yet widely available. Here’s a link to their current locations: http://www.cinemark.com/cinemark-ultra-3d

&amp;nbsp;

**RealD** is the most common 3D format and they have an exciting new technology to offer as well. The **Ultimate Screen** is available in a few theaters and is designed to deliver a brighter and more uniform image. This means that the dimming effect from the glasses should not be a factor. There is also no hot spot often associated with silver screens used in 3D and the image should be more uniform regardless of seat location.  You can read more about the Ultimate Screen here: https://www.reald.com/#/ultimatescreen    
Here are the current theaters where you can see Ultimate Screen:    
**Burbank, CA** – AMC Burbank 16 – Auditorium 7    
**Boulder, CO** – Century Boulder – 29th St Auditorium 8 &amp; 11    
**Beijing, China** – Wanda Plaza – Auditorium 5

&amp;nbsp;

From here on it’s a matter of personal preference.  **Standard IMAX 3D** has the advantage of a larger screen and many locations.  The key here is to pick your seats wisely.  The closer you are to the projector, the better your experience is going to be.  I would be careful in any 3D environment not to be in the front of the theatre if you’re not towards the center because it can compromise the viewing experience.    
It should also be noted that this particular film was shot digitally and there’s no grain that has to be dealt with in the blow-up and so the large screen projections are exceptionally clean.

&amp;nbsp;

As far as Dolby goes, Atmos sound has an added benefit as we did a **Fantasound** mix.  For more information on the history of Fantasound: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasound    
In short, Walt Disney had developed a new sound system for Fantasia where speakers had to be set up in theaters and it was an immersive experience where the music surrounded you.  It became untenable because of the technical challenges to install the sound system in theaters and was soon abandoned. Here we tasked ourselves with updating it using today’s technology to explore what Walt had set out to do.  Because of the way the Dolby Atmos theaters are speakered, what Disney at the time had to spend a lot of effort and time to do now already exists in theaters and we took advantage of that by mixing the orchestra properly and doing a proper Fantasound mix.  So if you see the film in **Dolby Atmos sound**, you are also hearing a Fantasound mix. 

&amp;nbsp;

If you prefer 2D then your standard DCP is pretty solid in most theaters, but Extended Dynamic Range definitely ups the image quality quite significantly and is well worth seeking out.  Dolby Vision is available in 2D in more locations than its 3D counterpart.    
Here’s a page that can guide you to theaters: http://www.dolby.com/us/en/brands/dolby-cinema/the-jungle-book.html

&amp;nbsp;

If you’re seeing the film in 2D, I’d say the seat location is not as vital as in 3D.

&amp;nbsp;

I hope this clarifies things more than it confuses. I encourage you to read the comments below and to discuss because others might have a different take on each of these formats and specific locations that might give you a better indication of what viewing experience might be best for you.

&amp;nbsp;

It’s a very exciting time to be a filmmaker as well as an audience member. There are a lot of smart people putting a lot of effort into making the theater-going experience exceptional. I look forward to these new formats being more widely available and encourage those of you who can to seek them out and see for yourself.",movies,4469

Ask me Anything!","EDIT 5 We have answered a dozen or so more questions today.  We will try and work through a few more as best we can in the upcoming days.  Thanks again for all the interest and support.  Please bear in mind that many of the more complicated questions will probably have to wait for the book as they are a lot to try and go into as an answer on an AMA.

BTW I realize I did not do a good job of setting this up as I did not specify which day Ann was available.  This was supposed to be for 1 hour on 3/12/2016 and has definitely gone over.   At this point we will try to work though as many questions as we can but apologies to those who posted later on as we may just not be able to get to them all.  

Some sub reddits have requested a future AMA and if we hold one we will try to reach out to those who didn't get answers this time.

Thanks again!

EDIT 4 We have had a lot of questions that basically boil down to ""How do you live with yourself and or justify the atrocities that occurred under Mao during the CR"" often citing millions of deaths, torture, suicides and/or destruction of historical artifacts or culture. 

Rather than respond to them all individually we hope this response will help:

This is a very hard question to answer simply because the explanation involves a significant level of understanding  and views of complex issues that many are not going to have.  Also it involves understanding that much of the information we are given today is biased and or slanted. 

The reality of the CR was that it was not just a case of ""Mao says and everyone does"", many calls were made from the central committee which was in general split between those that wanted to go with capitalism and those who didn't.  There is no revolution in which mistakes and sacrifices haven't been made - life or death issues.  

I was aware of reports of suicides, people who were beaten and I knew there were guns involved in some areas between the PLA and various citizen groups.  One of our foreign comrades was wrongly held for 5 years incommunicado from his family, another held 3 years.  I experienced what we called the Evil Wind about all foreigners being spies and so on. 

I do not feel remorse for participating in a revolution in which some blood was shed and some suffering occurred.  I am still in doubt of many of the ""official"" numbers of the atrocities from either China or other sources. 

Several people have brought up that even the present Chinese government denounces the CR as bad or a failure.  The current government is largely the same people/ideology who opposed Mao so it's somewhat akin to a current republican blaming failures on a previous democratic president. 

So in short I do not in any way deny that horrible mistakes were made during the CR however I do question any set of numbers regarding them.  I do not condone or support those behaviors or actions, they do not, however, change my belief in the underpinnings and goals of the movement and I still believe that is the direction China needs to ultimately go. 

EDIT 3 3/13/2016 Wow this really got way bigger than we had expected.  I (her son) had naively expected this would only generate a few dozen responses - not thousands and hit the front page of Reddit!  Thanks to those who constructive comments regardless of which view you hold!

While most of the comments are attacking vitriol, there are some really good questions and suggestions here and Ann really does want to give some answers to those.  This is quite difficult though as we discovered yesterday as she is pretty slow and it takes a good 30 minutes or so just to get her to properly understand the question, then make and word the answer well.  I (her son) am going to work with her to at least try to answer these, but again apologize for the unexpected slowness of this.  

If you watch the video on her facebook of her, that is her at the best of times so hopefully it sheds some light on how much work it is to get these answers out.

========================================================

I was born in Chicago in 1930 to a family who owned an 85 foot wooden schooner which was the basis for the family income.  Usually young men who wanted to sail would apply to my family for transatlantic/transpacific summer sailing.  We actually had no home on land and so the entire family lived on the ship year round.  This is how my brother and I ended up living on a functioning sailing vessel from as early as 2 weeks old.  

We had no engine or motor power, only wind and father taught navigation to anyone who wanted to learn while on the cruise.  In 1936-1937 due to the beginning of WWII we sailed from Boston around Cape Horn (South America) to San Francisco and Berkley Harbors.  This is widely considered some of the most difficult sailing in the world, however my memory of the journey was mainly positive because my father was such an excellent captain that we managed to navigate the treacherous waters in less than average time for the passage from latitude 50 South to 50 South (which happens to be the title of a book written by my father on the subject.) 

From then on we went to Hawaii every summer through 1941 when about 2 month after our departure the bombing of Pearl Harbor resulted in the Pacific being mined and thus our inability to return to Hawaii in future years. This is how I ended up growing up on a wooden schooner!

From an early age I was interested in bringing peace to the world and at 35 I went abroad to Helsinki Finland to a world peace congress.  It was there that I met delegates from China and eventually was invited to China to work.  That's how I came to be in Beijing when the Cultural Revolution started in 1966.  

I was assigned to teach English in a college level institute in Beijing that I was chauffeured to and from while residing in the elegant “Friendship Hotel.” I objected to these special elegant conditions and wanted to be on the same salary and living conditions as my co-teachers.  This brought me into participation in writing a “Big Character” poster (dao zi bao) which led to full permission for me to take part both in my institute and among all the foreigners who chose to participate in the Cultural Revolution. 

In 1969 the 9th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party called for the correction of several mistakes made during the Cultural Revolution such as ending factionalism, setting up a new constitution for China and keeping criticism of leadership at the highest levels possible including the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.  At this point I had put 5 years of hard work into supporting the movement and with these important steps taken chose to return home to the US to support my ailing mother and felt it was important to support and participate in the movement in the US to oppose the war in Viet Nam.

I developed my fundamental politics as a Marxist from my experience of the war against the Nazi's and the things I observed during my travels across the United State during the McCarthy era. 

In 1979 I requested my FBI file under the freedom of information act and was surprised upon receipt to find that it had information on me dating back to when I was 15 years old.  Interestingly the first entry in my file is due to suspicion because I invited black people to parties in my home!

I recently issued a new request and received over 600 pages detailing their information on me in the time since then and am starting the process of reading through it.

I am now trying to write a memoir so I can pass on as much of my life experiences as I can to anyone who would benefit or be interested.   Due to my age and progressing Parkinson's disease I need a lot of assistance with this process.  Because I believe in paying my helpers a living wage I have started a Kickstarter project to fund my efforts.

BalboaBaggins,2016-02-29 18:16:07+00:00,The Chinese Perspective on the 2GD Drama: Why GabeN's hand might have been forced,"**Warning: Long post ahead**

In the last few days there's been a lot of commentary and speculation on the 2GD drama. One thing that's been missing is the Chinese perspective, which I've seen some people ask for but hasn't been provided. I'll try to give an overview (I am currently living in Shanghai).

I think the fact that this controversy happened in China is important to understanding why thing played out the way they did. A lot of what I'm going to say is speculation, just because nobody knows all the fact right now. But I don't think most people on /r/dota2 get how different China is even with past drama with Chinese tournaments. There's a thread on the front page right now about ""Chris Rock made memey jokes at the Oscars, same thing as 2GD right?"" Completely ignores that one is in USA and one is in China.

I looked on Weibo and Tieba to gauge the average Chinese netizens' reaction to the controversy (one unrelated thing you guys may find interesting that I'd forgotten about, the Chinese nickname for GabeN is Fat G). Anyway, the most common reaction was ""Who the hell is 2GD"", as you might expect. However, the second most common reaction was different variations of **""He was hosting the show and made a sex joke? Serves him right, of course he was fired.""**

China's government tightly controls all media in the country, and one of the most longstanding rules is the near-complete ban on sexual content and pornography. Basically all porn is blocked on the internet. James's opening joke on the first day was possibly the worst you could think of. Not only did he reference porn and masturbation, he talked about circumventing the government internet blocks in order to watch porn. While he was in China. In front of a camera talking into a microphone.

The Shanghai Major is a pretty big deal, when I found out they got the Mercedez-Benz Arena for the finals I was actually very surprised. Its where the World Expo was in 2010, and where big international music stars do concerts. It's like Staples Center in LA or Madison Square Garden in NYC. It's bigger than KeyArena by any measure. I remember a huge Taylor Swift concert being held there last year.

So yeah, it's a pretty big deal and Valve/Perfect World most likely had to do a LOT of negotiating and utilize a great deal of [guanxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanxi) in order to get this confirmed. 

Now imagine Gabe's reaction when he hears about this at Valve HQ. ""James did what??"" Granted, as we know Gabe didn't know about Icefrog telling James to be himself which is definitely a breakdown in communications at Valve. But again, James made one of the worse jokes you could make, basically making a sex joke and subverting the Chinese government joke in the same sentence, the moment after Gabe puts him in front of a camera. At this point Gabe didn't yet fire him, but he was definitely on two strikes. This is speculation, but I'd imagine the ""bottom bitch"" comment was the last straw. Seems pretty innocuous in the USA, but it does have sexual connotations.

I want to note at this point that I'm no prude and most (young) Chinese people aren't either. I, like James, use methods to get around the internet blocks to access certain forbidden sites. But nobody talks about it, that's just how the culture is, and nobody would dare talk about it in front of a camera. I have a (white American) friend who was an exchange student in China two years ago, and he made a minor masturbation joke in his Chinese class at a Beijing university. His teacher, a girl who I also know, was shocked speechless for 2 minutes. This girl isn't a prude either and goes clubbing on weekends but my point is that in China you just. don't. talk about sex in any sort of ""official"" setting.

In this kind of culture, James' actions came across as a boorish ignorant tourist. Except he was a boorish ignorant tourist with a mic in front of a camera. I like James' content and I've been watching GD Studio for a long time. But it was clear that James has no conception of how whats acceptable to say on-air is different in the USA/UK and China.

So Gabe has a decision to make, not just for the group stage, but the main stage. Group stage was more low-key, but I think Gabe ultimately decided he didn't want to run the risk of James making another sex joke while sitting on the main stage in the Mercedes-Benz center. Again, this is the biggest entertainment venue in the biggest city in China - I can almost guarantee the Shanghai municipal government officials will be monitoring the Main Event in some way. One more sex joke on the main stage and there's a lot of bad blood between Valve and Chinese officials, and Valve's access to a huge chunk of the Dota2 playerbase just got a helluva lot more difficult. 

James' ""bottom bitch"" comment was probably interpreted by Gabe as ""well either he didn't get my NO MORE SEX JOKES message or he's intentionally defying it"" and led to the ""James is an ass"" comment. For the record, I'm not saying I agree with Gabe's comment, but I'm trying to explain (as much for myself as for anybody else) what might have led to that comment.

Thanks for reading, and I welcome any comments, especially from any other Chinese people who might be browsing this sub, see if I missed anything.

**EDIT**: To address one of the most common comments on this thread - Yeah, hosting a major in China definitely brings a shit ton of problems. I'm not going to make a judgment on whether Valve should or shouldn't have one in China in the future. It was definitely Valve's fault in regard to the Icefrog miscommunication and not prepping James beforehand. However, I will also say that IMO last year's DAC was a pretty successful large-scale tournament in China, and as many people have said, Valve probably hoped the Shanghai Major would basically be DAC but even better. That obviously hasn't happened with the KeyTV P R O D U C T I O N V A L U E + 2GD Drama

**EDIT 2: REGARDING THE ""NOBODY IN CHINA EVEN WATCHES ENGLISH STREAM WTF"" ARGUMENT:**

I acknowledged that most Chinese dota watchers don't watch English stream and don't know who 2GD is. However, there are those who do, and some of those who do post the news on social media sites, just like how people find out news about Burning, rotK, LaNm, xiao8 here on /r/dota2. Would probably not be a good look for Valve in China if even a few Chinese social media sites started talking about a Valve host making dirty jokes in the Benz arena. ",DotA2,3121

As you know Mongolz got their Visas denied by the U.S. embassy in Mongolia. Today I got the grave news that Mongolz will not be attending MLG Columbus Qualifiers. The reasoning was Mongolz players couldn't provide enough evidence that they will go back to Mongolia. 

Rest assure that Mongolz are trying their best to attend IEM Katowice. They will leave on thursday afternoon to Beijing, China to apply for Polish visa since Mongolia doesn't have a Polish embassy. 

I would like to say thank you on behalf of Mongolz, Hub eSport Center and entire Mongolian Gaming Community for your effort and suggestions for helping Mongolz to obtain their Visas. Sadly our efforts came short :(. Special thank you for /u/MrMLGAdam being a total boss and helping at his best abilities for Mongolz and /u/csgonews for helping me to contact Mr. Adam. 

For fans of Mongolz, let us hope that they get their Polish visas. 

Kind Regards,

EDIT 2: I'm reading a lot of comments saying US sucks and the system is broken etc. This is standard procedure from US embassy. We cannot change the fact Mongolz players couldn't provide enough evidence that they would come back to Mongolia. This is an issue that Mongolz would have to look at. Since Mongolian society does not look at eSport a viable career there no companies would pick them up as sponsors. We are looking every viable option to help them out on future events. Since they did not ask for our formal help in time, we were unable to help them out. I just wanted to let you guys know since after IEM Taipei there are many Mongolz fans.

frjsdq,2016-02-19 19:04:00+00:00,"As a Chinese person who likes to travel, I hereby promise to call out rude/awful behavior by Chinese tourists whenever I see it. But I'd like to respectfully ask something of you, too.","This is in response to the other thread about Chinese tourists, which was pretty hard for me to read because it honestly felt like a slap in the face. In the interest of honest and open-minded discourse, I'd like to make a few points, too.

1. Before this, I honestly had no idea that Chinese tourists had such a bad rap among western travelers. I used to work the information desk at the very busy Smithsonian castle in Washington DC, and I've traveled extensively across China, and in my personal experience, I honestly have not met any Chinese tourists who were outright, offensively rude and intolerable.

2. HOWEVER, that being said, my personal experience (sample size: 1) is anecdotal, and I completely understand that the case being made against rude/offensive Chinese tourists is very real, is based on factual observation, and is not something that is being fabricated by westerners to justify racism against Chinese people. I fully acknowledge this.

3. I'm going to be in Japan and Beijing in a couple of months, where I imagine I'll run into a lot of Chinese tourist groups. I'm fluent in Mandarin and Cantonese, and I promise that whenever I see someone being a cunt in public, I will absolutely not hesitate to call them out on the spot.

4. I won't be doing this because I somehow feel the need to apologize on behalf of the Chinese race, or that it's my responsibility to police ""my people"". I will be doing this because 1) people who are awful tourists need to be called out, period, and 2) because I have the advantage of speaking their language, which means they will understand me.

5. Lastly, I urge you to please not refer to Chinese people as cunts, even if you're writing this anonymously on a message board. It's extremely hurtful. It's an unfair generalization. Most of us are just trying to live our lives, trying to be good people, and as a result, we're invisible in your memories, because we were just normal folks who never did anything awful or outlandish to stick out to you. If you want to have an honest, open dialogue, by all means, let's have one. But opening up a conversation by way of an offensive statement is not exactly a great way to find common ground, I'll tell you that much.",travel,2047

Zombie46,2014-05-25 09:05:39+00:00,I went to North Korea as a tourist - AMA!,"Last september I made a trip to North Korea as a tourist. As of [this AskReddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/26cmzg/what_is_the_most_interesting_documentary_youve/chpvpq2) and the discussion about the Vice documentary I was asked to do an AMA! 
Going to North Korea isn't as hard as it seems anymore. We (my mother and I) booked the trip via a travel agency for trips to NK located in Beijing (I should really get paid by them for advertising! :P) We just contacted them and told them how long we wanted our trip to be and then they proposed a tour. We could request changes regarding what we wanted to see.

So, we went there for 5 nights, 3 of them were in Pyongyang, one in Kaesong and one in the north in Myohyang (famous for the friendship exhibiton where you can see a ton of presents that were given to the three leaders). We got to see the DMZ from the north, the library in Pyongyang, the Juche tower, the friendship exhibiton, the mass games and a lot more!

During the day, we were always together with our two guides (one male in his 50s and a female in her early 30s) as well as our driver. Inside museums there usually was just one of them with us. As we are Swiss, they both spoke German. The driver only spoke Korean. In the hotels we had nice rooms (occasional lack of warm water) and our guides were always staying in the hotel with us (in was less nice rooms and usually with at least 4 people per room as we learned)


So, I want to keep this into rather short because I don't know what you guys are interested in. I took a shitload of pictures (the only rule was no construction, no military and not inside museums) so maybe if you want to see something specific, I can see what I got.

I don't know how much insight I can give on the whole political side of NK and all the answers will be just the way I experienced!
So please, AMA!

China hasn’t found evidence that Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 ever entered its territory. [WSJ](http://on.wsj.com/1osxClu)

**8:10 AM UTC / 4:10 PM MYT - 21st MEDIA STATEMENT**

&gt; The passengers and crew on-board flight MH370, their families and loved ones, have been at the centre of every action Malaysia Airlines has taken as a Company since we first learned the flight disappeared.
&gt; 
&gt; The Malaysian Government is coordinating an unprecedented international search effort covering 2.24 million square nautical miles. With this simply enormous area we cannot determine how long it will take to locate the aircraft.
&gt; 
&gt; Considering these challenges, our caregivers have informed the family members of the missing passengers and crew that we have taken the decision to continue to provide information and assistance through the further enhanced Family Support Centre (FSC) based in Kuala Lumpur which has been operational since 8 March 2014 rather than the various Family Assistance Centers (FACs).
&gt; 
&gt; The Family Support Centre will continue to proactively provide relatives waiting for news at home with daily updates. In addition to personal phone calls, Malaysia Airlines will now send out SMS blasts with brief updates to the families. We have also set up an email address for family members as a channel for them to communicate with us. Updates via the Malaysia Airlines website are also available.
&gt; 
&gt; This Family Support Centre will be open round-the-clock and will house family support representatives trained to assist those who are seeking answers and further information. The representatives will be divided into four shifts with ten staff handling each shift. This will ensure that someone is available to attend to the families at all times. The centre will also have Mandarin speaking personnel.
&gt; 
&gt; Below are the toll-free numbers that has been set-up for eight different countries. A back-up number is also given to the families in the event they are not able to reach the toll-free number. The number to call to get in touch with this centre is +603 8777 5770.
&gt; 
&gt; |**Countries**|**Toll-free number**|
&gt; |:--|:--|
&gt; |China|10-800-130-1364 (South China) / 10-800-713-1404 (North China)|
&gt; |Malaysia|1800-81-4819|
&gt; |Indonesia|001-803-015-203-7708|
&gt; |Australia|1800-198-163|
&gt; |US/Canada|877-504-4210|
&gt; |New Zealand|080-045-4029|
&gt; |India|000-800-100-3449|
&gt; |France|080-091-2622|
&gt; 
&gt; All this while, the families have always been briefed first, followed by the media and then the public whenever new information surfaces. However, the often conflicting information and wild speculation have caused a major distress to the families.
&gt; 
&gt; The Airline continues to work closely with the authorities and we appreciate the help we are receiving from all local and international agencies during this critical and traumatic period.
&gt; 
&gt; Our top priority remains to provide any and all assistance to the families of the passengers and crew.

**TENTH MEDIA STATEMENT, 05:30 PM MYT/9:30 AM UTC**:

&gt;The purpose of this statement is to update on emergency response activities at Malaysia Airlines.

&gt;On notification of the incident the following steps have been taken:-

&gt;The EOC:-

&gt;1. Activation of the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) in the early morning of 8 March 2014. The EOC is the central command and control facility responsible for carrying out emergency management functions at the strategic level during a disaster.

&gt;2. Malaysia Airlines is deploying an additional aircraft to bring the families from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur on 11 March 2014.

&gt;3. When the aircraft is located, a Response Coordination Centre (RCC) will be established within the vicinity to support the needs of the families. This has been communicated specifically to the families.

&gt;4. Once the Response Coordination Centre is operational, we will provide transport and accommodation to the designated areas for the family members.

&gt;We are receiving many queries about how the passengers with the stolen passports purchased their tickets. We are unable to comment on this matter as this is a security issue. We can however confirm that we have given all the flight details to the authorities for further investigation.

&gt;We also confirm that we are making necessary arrangements for MH370 passengers' families from Beijing to travel to Kuala Lumpur. However, flight details of the families’ arrival are highly confidential. This is to protect the privacy and well-being of the families during this difficult time and to respect their space. Our position is not to reveal any information on the flight or movements of the families.

&gt;Malaysia Airlines' primary focus at this point in time is to care for the families of the passengers and crew of MH370. This means providing them with timely information, travel facilities, accommodation, meals, medical and emotional support. The costs for these are all borne by Malaysia Airlines.

&gt;All other Malaysia Airlines’ flights are as per schedule. The safety of our passengers and crew has always been and will continue to be of utmost importance to us.

&gt;The airline continues to work with the authorities and we appreciate the help we are receiving from all local and international parties and agencies during this critical and difficult time.

&gt;""We understand you want answers from us, you want details, we are equally eager as you are to find details and parts of the aircraft and we hope you will be patient and our boys in the rescue control centre on the ships now are trying their best to locate whatever they can find in the areas that we have identified and maybe those beyond that. we are every hour, every minute, every second, looking at every inch of the sea.""

Everyone in the world with the slightest interest in League of Legends should pay close attention to the matches happening next weekend in Los Angeles.  Pre-Season began in August 2011 at Gamescom, Cologne, Germany won by CLG Prime and completed with the Korean Regional Finals in Seoul, South Korea won by NaJin Sword last weekend.

It has been a long road and many air miles for all of the teams involved travelling the globe with almost every corner of the world represented.  Peoples lives will  have changed during this season and I can not express the excitement I feel for it, I may just be hyperventilating come day one.

nathancrumpton,2012-07-06 15:57:53+00:00,"With the Olympics coming up, there are tons of commercials asking viewers to donate to the US Olympic Committee, but PLEASE DON’T.  Here’s why:","First off, I need to say that few people believe in the Olympic spirit more than I do.  The Olympic Games are, in my opinion, the single greatest event to foster global peace and international accord that mankind has ever created.  And other than the largely ineffectual and intermittently corrupt United Nations, nothing brings together more people from more countries with a more diverse background than the Olympic Games. On a personal level, participating in the Olympic Games is one of the premiere goals in my life.  In 2008, capping a 9 year track &amp; field career, I tried to qualify for the US Olympic Trials in the triple jump, but competing with chronic injury had me fall 15 inches short of the first trials standard.  I’ve since switched to winter sports, and compete as an [Olympic Development Bobsled &amp; Skeleton athlete](https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/105421990294348679176/albums/5761166061455094241). So please don’t knock me for hating on the Olympics; few people have put as much time, effort, and sacrifice towards that very endeavor as I have.

My chief complaint is with the United States Olympic Committee.  It does not take adequate care of its athletes when compared to most other first-world nations.  The sad irony is that the USOC is one of the richest national Olympic Committees in the world, if not THE richest, and yet its athletes are some of the poorest and least supported.  

In total, less than 10% of the USOC’s funds are earmarked for directly supporting the athletes.  In 2002 Salt Lake City it was 7% of funds, and in 2004 Athens it was 6.7%.  And in 2007 - a non-Olympic year when revenues are typically lower - 9.5% was allocated to athletes. And of the portion that the USOC allocates to National Governing Bodies, the organizations that oversee individual sports, only 3% of funds go directly toward supporting athletes.  (As 501 non-profits, the USOC and NGBs must have publicly available 990 IRS forms, so more recent figures are out there if someone wants to dig up.  ([Read more about financial side of Olympic Endeavors](http://usatelitetrack.org/dhac/?page_id=29)) 

Those numbers are abysmal.  Imagine another NGO or a charity that only directed 3%-10% of its funds toward direct aid.  (For reference the American Institute for Philanthropy sets 60% as a minimum and 75% as the preferred amount for direct support.)  At best the USOC would be lampooned as a joke in the industry, and at worst they’d be accused of a blatant money grubbing scam.  In any other area of philanthropy, people would stop donating immediately.

And yet the USOC gets away with it because it is the only officially sanctioned institution (other than individual athletes and their funds, which can’t compete with the budget and manpower of the USOC) to represent the United States at the Olympics.  In effect, the USOC is a legal non-profit monopoly that is empowered by the veils of patriotism and Olympic spirit. 

They further justify their dearth of support for athletes by claiming that athletes receive adequate financial aid from private enterprises and through lucrative endorsement contracts.  That’s a wild fantasy for most athletes.  For every millionaire Shaun White or Lindsey Vonn, there are scores upon scores of unknown nobodies who work just as hard and who struggle heroically to make ends meet, as NBC will surely remind you during their coverage. Just imagine the challenge of convincing an employer to hire you when you can only commit half of your year to the job because the other half of the year you’re in competition.  That generally only leaves low-paying hourly wage jobs without any benefits.  (Benefits and/or salaries that if you lived in many other countries, their Olympic Committee would provide.)  That brings up the challenge of trying to convince a health insurance company to provide you with coverage.  And even if you’re a paragon of health and phsyical vigor, that’s not an easy sell when you’re engaged in activities such as ski jumping, snowboarding, or sliding down a chute of serpentine ice at over 70mph/112kph, and where [serious injury is always a risk](http://www.sportsnet.ca/magazine/2012/05/04/sportsnet_magazine_bobsled_accident_zwelling/). Most insurance companies view that as a terrible business proposition, and will find any way to either deny coverage or charge a ridiculous premium.  

As a result of this lack of USOC support, I’m working three jobs (one full time office job for an hourly wage with no benefits, and then two freelance circuits) and I’m nowhere near saving enough money to be able to compete full time next season.  And on top of that I’m supposed to dedicate 2 to 4 hours each day to training.  I do have an individual athlete training fund that allows sponsors to make tax-deductible donations to support me, but I’ve yet to convince anyone that it’s a worthwhile cause (and with all the sick, starving, and less fortunate people in the world who could be better served by charitable donations, I completely understand the reticence to support an Olympic Development Athlete).  That financial gap is where the USOC should really be stepping up to help support its athletes, but it doesn’t.  I’m seriously thinking about taking to the streets in my spare time and begging for cash.  

And yet the USOC rakes in well over $100 million a year.  In non-Olympic years, it will haul in ~$140-150 million ($147 million in 2007), and during Olympic years that number swells profusely.  This year’s broadcast rights alone will likely breach $120 million, and corporate sponsorship will likely bring in another $60-80 million.  And they’re still asking individual viewers through NBC commercials and web campaigns to donate to the USOC on top of that.   

So where is all that money going?  

Not towards athlete performance bonuses apparently: a US athlete who brings home the gold medal in his or her event will receive just $25,000 from the USOC.  By comparison, a Russian athlete who brought home the gold in Beijing earned $100,000 from their Olympic committee.  Japan also gave fourfold what a US athlete earned.  China awarded their gold medal athletes $131,000, Uzbekistan &amp; Italy ~$200,000, Kazakhstan $250,000, UAE $272,000, Iran &amp; Greece $290,000, Thailand and Malaysia ~$300,000, Philippines $340,000, and Singapore [topped the list](http://100kjob.info/2008/08/12/how-much-does-an-olympic-gold-medal-bring-you/) with $708,800, or over 28 times what a US athlete earned for a gold medal.  

Rather, over 60% of their budget goes towards “administrative expenses,” which includes over $35 million in salaries, and included COO &amp; former CEO salaries of over $600,000 per year.   In 2008, 8 USOC officials made more than $300,000 per year, and at least 20 made over $200,000 per year.  Of the remaining ~40%, most of that is earmarked for the NGBs (eg. The Speedskating Association, USA Track &amp; Field, US Bobsled &amp; Skeleton Federation, and all the other individual sports), and within that remaining ~40%, only ~3% goes directly toward athlete support.  That’s a whole lot of money getting whittled away through administrative and bureaucratic inefficiencies, as well as outright greed masquerading as patriotism.  In the meantime, I’m going to go hit the gym and brainstorm some strategies for street peddling.  

**TL;DR: Please do not donate to the US Olympic Committee; they’re one of the richest Olympic Committees in the world, yet their athletes are among the poorest of any developed country.  If you want to support the Olympic Spirit, sponsor an individual athlete.**

I was a staff photographer for the Associated Press in Beijing from 1988-91. I was there for the student protests that began in April, numerous marches and speeches at universities, the long encampment in Tiananmen Square, and the military crackdown on June 3-4, 1989. Verification, and a selection of my China photos [here.](http://www.averyphotog.com/gallery.html?folio=Portfolio&amp;gallery=China)

EDIT: My thanks to everyone, this has been fun.

Edit for all of you aspiring photojournalists asking for advice: Go do something else if you can. Look through this AMA at how many of you are asking the same question. Think about the level of competition you will encounter for a few low paying jobs. Think about the miniscule freelance budgets you will be trying to eek out a living from. Run! Run while you still can! For those of you who refuse to take my advice, there's a world wide web out there where you can publish wonderful photos in a blog about anything your little journalistic heart desires - just don't expect anyone to pay you for doing it.",IAmA,1975

Here's a little more background on my career:

I've been a national correspondent for The Atlantic since the late
1970s. Through about half that time I've lived in Washington DC. In
the other half, I've lived in and reported from Seattle, Berkeley, Austin, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, Shanghai, and Beijing. I spent two years as chief White House speechwriter for Jimmy Carter, two years as the editor of US News &amp; World Report, and six months as a program designer at Microsoft. I'm also an instrument-rated private pilot. 
[Verification](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/02/in-house-news-reddit-session-today-noon-1pm-est/252770/)

I recently finished a long cover story about President Obama -- success?
failure? genius? pawn? -- that will 

appear in the next issue of The Atlantic, online next week. Here's a
link to my [current magazine archive]
(http://www.theatlantic.com/james-fallows/magazine-articles/) and my
blog at [TheAtlantic.com] (http://www.theatlantic.com/james-fallows/). I
write often about politics, foreign policy, and technology.

I'll answer as many questions as I can!",IAmA,1327
