Over the past decade, South Dakota, Nevada and more than a dozen  other U.S. states have transformed themselves into leaders in the  business of peddling financial secrecy. Meanwhile, most of the policy  and law enforcement efforts of the world’s most powerful nations have  stayed focused on “traditional” offshore havens such as the Bahamas, the  Caymans and other island paradises.

The U.S. is one of the  biggest players in the offshore world. It is also the country best  situated to bring an end to offshore financial abuses, thanks to the  outsize role it plays in the international banking system. Because of  the U.S. dollar’s status as the de facto global currency, most   international transactions flow in and out of New York-based banking  operations.

U.S. authorities have taken action over the past two  decades to force banks in Switzerland and other countries to turn over  information about Americans with overseas accounts.

But the U.S.  is more interested in forcing other countries to share information about  Americans banking offshore than in sharing information about money  moving through U.S. bank accounts, companies and trusts.

The U.S.  has refused to join a 2014 agreement supported by more than 100  jurisdictions, including the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg, that would  require American financial institutions to share information they have  about foreigners’ assets.

Year after year in South Dakota, state  lawmakers have approved legislation drafted by trust industry insiders,  providing more and more protections and other benefits for trust  customers in the U.S. and abroad. Customer assets in South Dakota trusts  have more than quadrupled over the past decade to $360 billion.

“As a citizen, I’m so sad that my state was the state that opened Pandora’s box,” Susan Wismer, a former lawmaker, told ICIJ.

By  2020, 17 of the world’s 20 least-restrictive jurisdictions for trusts  were American states, according to a study by Israeli academic Adam  Hofri-Winogradow. In many cases, he said, U.S. laws have made it more  difficult for creditors to put their hands on what they are owed,  including child support payments from absent parents.

Using  documents from the Pandora Papers, ICIJ and The Washington Post  identified nearly 30 U.S.-based trusts linked to foreigners personally  accused of misconduct or whose companies were accused of wrongdoing.

Among them is Federico Kong Vielman, whose family is one of Guatemala’s economic powerhouses.

In  2016, Kong Vielman moved $13.5 million into a trust in Sioux Falls.  Some of the money came from his family’s company, which makes floor  waxes and other products.

Guatemalan media reported for decades  on the family’s ties to politics. In the 1970s, the family was  identified as a key ally of Gen. Carlos Manuel Arana Osorio, the former  Guatemalan dictator known as the “Jackal of Zacapa.” In 2016, the  family’s luxury hotel in Guatemala City made a gift of 100 free nights  to then-President Jimmy Morales. Guatemalan media outlets reported that a  possible payment for “political favors” was suspected.

In 2014,  U.S. labor officials filed a complaint against Guatemala’s government  that included allegations that the family’s palm oil company underpaid  workers and exposed them to toxic chemicals. Company records show Kong  Vielman was previously the company’s treasurer.

**Michael Jordan’s net worth down $500 million in the last year:** The GameStop stock saga may have something to do with it, too.

Two years ago, Jordan — the majority owner of the Hornets  since 2010 — sold a minority share of the Hornets to two investors. One  of them was Gabe Plotkin, founder and chief investment officer of  Melvin Capital, a hedge fund that required billions in additional cash  after incurring major losses due to a short squeeze of GameStop stock by  groups of retail investors.

Details of Jordan’s current business relationship with  Plotkin and the other investor, Daniel Sundheim, aren’t publicly known,  but his Airness said while announcing their deal in 2019 that their  investment was “invaluable” as the Hornets “strive to compete with the  best in the NBA.”

The confrontation: The 10-minute-long  video was published on Sept. 29 to Weibo by local news site Xing Tai  Shen Bian Shi, who did not specify when and where the videos were taken,  according to Insider.

In one of  the videos, a female investor can be seen brandishing a knife and  threatening to kill herself in front of the Evergrande Wealth staff and  other people inside a meeting room.

“I  don't want the interest on my investment, I just want my money back. So  here's what I have to say to you. If Evergrande Wealth doesn't give me  my money today, I'll kill myself right here,” she told the staff. “If  this isn't handled today, I'll die right here, right in front of you. My  retirement savings are all in that investment. I have nothing left to  live for.""

Another clip showed a  group of people trying to block a car outside the company’s building. A  woman can be heard crying and demanding an explanation in the video.

“I don't have any choice but to do this, and I won't listen to you,"" she said. “All my money is gone.""

**China’s Guangzhou R&amp;F emerges as buyer of Dalian Wanda’s London hotel and residential project**         

**R&amp;F  has close ties to Wang Jianlin’s conglomerate, having previously bought  hotels from it as Wanda restructures under pressure from Chinese authorities.**

Chinese  developer Guangzhou R&amp;F Properties was the buyer of conglomerate  Dalian Wanda Group’s hotel and residential project under construction in  London, according to people familiar with the matter.

Wanda  Hotel Development said in a stock exchange filing in Hong Kong late on  Tuesday that it would sell a 60 per cent stake in Wanda International  Real Estate Investment, which was set up to invest in the Nine Elms  project in southwest London, for £35.6 million (US$49.1 million) to an  unnamed buyer.

The  remaining 40 per cent, held by Wanda HK, the parent of Wanda Hotel,  would also be sold, the filing said, without giving details.

As the financial world warily watches the fate of cash-strapped China  Evergrande Group, another big Chinese property developer is facing a ticking clock too, tied to projects in Manhattan, Los Angeles and  Hawaii.

China Oceanwide Holdings’ Hong Kong-based development  subsidiary has been warning in regulatory filings this year that if it can’t complete plans to bolster its finances, such as restructuring  debts and selling part of its portfolio, it might not be able to  continue to “operate as a going concern.”

At the same time, another Oceanwide unit has paused work at a site in San Francisco,  leaving a hole in the ground where it hoped to build the city’s  second-tallest skyscraper. Altogether, Oceanwide has spent $3.5 billion  on U.S. investments that are idle or nowhere near finished.

After a series of failed talks with potential partners, the company is trying  to extend its loans and free up cash amid mounting tumult in China’s  real estate scene. President Xi Jinping is cracking down on debt-fueled  property speculation. In recent days, the world has been watching to see if his government -- wielding a tight grip on lenders -- lets  Evergrande have a financial lifeline to quell protests from jilted customers and investors.

The outcome of that awkwardly timed drama could influence the willingness of investors and lenders to help Oceanwide salvage projects and avoid potential damage to key U.S. property markets.

In the 1950s, Jerry Pournelle imagined the military equivalent of the extinction of the dinosaurs.

Toiling away as a Boeing operations researcher in the afterglow of  the Manhattan Project and the Soviet Union’s First Lightning nuclear  test in 1949, the U.S. Army veteran envisioned a weapons system armed  not with munitions and other chemical explosives, but massive rods  forged from heavy metals dropped from sub-orbital heights. Those  “tungsten thunderbolts,” as the New York Times [called them](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/magazine/10section3a.t-9.html),  would impact enemy strongholds below with the devastating velocity of a  dino-exterminating impact, obliterating highly fortified targets —  like, say, Iranian centrifuges or North Korean bunkers — without the  mess of nuclear fallout.

Pournelle, whose years of experience in aerospace would fuel a career  as a journalist and military science fiction writer, named his  superweapon “Project Thor.” Others just called it “[Rods From God](http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2004-06/rods-god).”  In reality, weapons researchers refer to it as a “kinetic energy  projectile”: a super-dense, super-fast projectile that, operating free  of complex systems and volatile chemicals, destroys everything in its  path.

Damn this was an amazing read.

&gt;Jonathan Kuminga ambled past a horde of drunk college students as he surveyed the spectacle of a Monday night on the Las Vegas Strip. Cascades of neon. The off-pitch melody of an Elvis impersonator. Showgirls posing for pictures.

&gt;“I’m too old for these streets,” Kuminga said. “It’s just the way I look at myself. I’m not that young kid anymore.”

&gt;Las Vegas has been called the adult Disneyland. Kuminga, the Golden State Warriors’ rookie forward, can’t buy beer for another two-plus years. But at 18, he seems wiser than people twice his age.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Growing up in the Congo — formerly Zaire — amid one of the bloodiest conflicts since World War II, Kuminga witnessed atrocities he won’t discuss. “Why dwell on the past?” he said. “The future is bright.”

&gt;Five years ago, Kuminga left all he’d known in Goma, Congo — his parents, his friends, his life — to chase his NBA dream stateside. Now, as the No. 7 pick in last month’s NBA draft, he is set to make about $25 million over the next four years.

&gt;At 6-foot-7 with a 7-foot wingspan and strong scoring instincts, Kuminga draws comparisons to Los Angeles Clippers All-Star forward Kawhi Leonard. Scouts call Kuminga a freak. Warriors fans call him a potential franchise player. And in Kuminga’s Twitter direct messages, young Congolese players call him an inspiration.


&amp;nbsp;
&gt;Though Kuminga hasn’t visited his home country in sub-Saharan Africa since he left his mother and father at age 13, he keeps the Congo’s 92.6 million people front of mind. The Congolese flag sits next to his social media handles. Last year, in an article for the Players’ Tribune — a site that publishes pro athletes’ first-person stories — Kuminga penned a letter to “All the Kids Back Home.”

&gt;Three months ago, as hundreds of thousands of people fled Goma to escape lava from a nearby volcano, he donated a significant portion of his $500,000 salary from the G League — the NBA’s developmental organization — to relief efforts.

&gt;“If I was out there still, I was going to be one of those kids running from the volcano,” he said. “I’ve been through a lot of things in life that the regular person can’t understand. Still, I never forget how fortunate I am. I’m one of the lucky ones.”

&gt;Which helps explain why a night in Sin City doesn’t excite Kuminga the way it might some of his peers. During a 90-minute stroll with The Chronicle along Las Vegas Boulevard, he mentioned how old he felt five times.

&gt;At an age when he could be moving into a freshman dorm in college, Kuminga already has lived largely on his own for a half decade. His relatives, some still in the Congo, depend on him for financial support. Numerous others back home need Kuminga to offer something less quantifiable: hope.",nba,2391

Super thorough, easy to talk to, no bingoes whatsoever (she was disgusted over the fact that women get bingoed at all), and she does a lot of reproductive justice work. Just an amazing woman and amazing doctor. 

BUT THEN she told me that she and some other minimally invasive gynecologic surgery colleagues are trying to start a division SPECIFICALLY to address childfree gynecologic care, after they had so many patients tell them how hard it is for women to get sterilized. They want sterilization to be as accessible as possible, and they want to help normalize sterilization for women in America. 

They need patients who are willing to speak about why this is so important to them to get this off the ground, so if you would like to support her effort, you should reach out to Dr. Schimmoeller!",childfree,1208

GuyCarbonneauGOAT,2021-06-15 23:46:29+00:00,"D’Angelo Russell details what it was like being coached by Byron Scott: ""He’s an idiot … He’s a solid man. But as a coach, he was bad.""","[Source](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/6/15/22535716/lakers-dangelo-russell-calls-byron-scott-idiot-head-coach)
&gt;Scott came to the Lakers having coached two superstar guards, Kyrie Irving and Chris Paul, early in their careers. He was also famously teammates with both Magic Johnson and Kobe Bryant, two of the greatest guards to ever don the purple and gold.

&gt;But, for some reason, he was never able to get on the same page as Russell, and it showed in how strict he was with Russell. Scott’s assistant coach Jim Eyen viewed that as tough love, as he told Jake Fischer for the book “Built To Lose: How the NBA’s Tanking Era Changed the League Forever”:

&gt;Scott would Russell when he thought the rookie was freelancing instead of settling the table for teammates. He’d offer varying reasons as to why he benched Russell during crunch time situations. “I think Byron coached D’Angelo from the heart. He did what he thought the best thing for D’Angelo was. It would have been easier had he just taken the path of least resistance,” Eyen says. “But he didn’t. It’s a lot more difficult to try to do it, what you feel is the right way, and discipline when you need to disciple. Pat him on the butt me give him accolades when he deserves it and just do what you need to do for not only the team, but for the long term of the player.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;Russell viewed their relationship just a bit differently:

&gt;Russell, frankly, disagrees. Scott didn’t handle sophomore forward Julius Randle with the same kids gloves. “He’s an idiot,” Russell says of his coach.

&gt;Russell felt Scott often yanked him from close contests purely to spark controversy and attention for his postgame media availability. “I just think he was malicious for no reason,” Russell says. “He’s a solid man. But as a coach, he was bad. He was just bad at his job.”

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Russell admitted that he didn’t do everything he could to bridge the gap that existed between them, though:

&gt;When Scott summoned Russell back to the bench, Russell would take his most circuitous path in order to duck high-fiving the coaching staff. “I was just young. I used to do all types of shit to avoid talking to him,” Russell says. The guard bristled in his seat at the end of Los Angeles’ pine. Lakers officials diagnosed the dynamic evidence of Russell’s immaturity issues scouts across the league has flagged before the draft.

&gt;But again, if there’s anyone that deserved the benefit of the doubt, it wasn’t Scott.",nba,1903
BadassTrader,2021-06-15 16:46:49+00:00,Billionaire Boys Club (BBC) Part 4 - Recess is over... You didn't think BILL GATES was involved did you?,"(THIS IS GME RELATED)

(Shameless PLUG: Follow me on Twtter for more GME fun: [https://twitter.com/BadassTrader69](https://twitter.com/BadassTrader69) )

&amp;#x200B;

**DISCLAIMER:** I had to dig deep on this one Apes. Some of the information in this Volume of BBC comes through unverified sources. I have used source links where possible, but the sources referenced may have their own Agenda in what they are saying that I can't account for. In saying that... They are mainly referenced to detail my journey, which leads to verified credible sources.

**ALSO...** I am not actually going to claim that anyone did anything, merely just connect some dots and let you form your own opinion.

**ALSO...** This is not financial advice, I am not financially qualified, and full disclosure I am a $GME shareholder.

**ALSO...** this post is an introductory post to BBC part 5. I'm working on more connections to $GME, and this is part of that.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that that's out of the way...

Let's dive in. Shits getting Dark Apes. (But no surprises there)

So we all know that Billionaires love to count themselves as Philatropists right?

This is the ONE thing, nearly all of them have in common.

So since I was looking for connections between all these guys for the BBC, I decided to look at what they all had in common.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm not American, so I am not up to date on the School System, but as I'm sure many of you are, I'm guessing you know a little about Charter Schools?

But again... I'll try to stay out of Pol itics, though a lot of this will hover around the subject.

So on looking into these Billionaires and their Philanthropy... I discovered that ALOT of them were keenly interested in Charter Schools.

(Don't worry, I will look at the other stuff, but up first is Education)

ANYWAY...

I started down my path for curiosity to see if I could uncover why the Super Rich are so interested in these schools and ""Reforming"" education.

I'm sure many of you see this as a worthy endeavor. The school system needs reform as it's severely underfunded right?

# Let's start with WHY

My first stop into this DARK CAVE was a little Infographic I found on Facebook... Claiming that the High Cost of Oaklands Charter Schools were financially impacting the Public School sector by $57 million net loss...

https://preview.redd.it/xf9dzfzj6g571.png?width=1668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca106768b8448950cf274299aca84de1b89d574f

Bu this could be explained away and my source can not be verified. So I carried on searching.

**NEXT UP**

I come across an article discussing **Why Billionaires Love Charter Schools**

This article goes into detail about the 2 main reasons Billionaires love charters...

TINFOIL HAT TIME

Investing in these schools allows them to 1. Avoid Taxes and 2. Disrupt Unions.

Yup... Anti-Union Conspiracy theory. Maybe it makes sense? I don't know to be honest. (I'll let you make up your own mind)

But Avoiding Taxes...

Now that's a language I can see the Hedgies speaking.

Source: [https://eastbaymajority.com/why-billionaires-love-charter-schools/](https://eastbaymajority.com/why-billionaires-love-charter-schools/)

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So I continue down further into the Cave...

It's getting Dark now, and my light is Dim.

I find more and more of these types of articles, hypothesizing different reasons behind the love for Charter Schools...

Some of it may have merit... Some of it may be fluff... I'm not expert.

But I continue to follow the MONEY breadcrumbs.

Before I go there though...

I just wanted to reintroduce our Friend ""Milky"" Milken

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yeb9uf078g571.png?width=660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa4029d7e1c920593ffa63a0e1920976d3e7d5b5

And another SUPERSTONK favorite...

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sqr9lqji8g571.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef764218506532a1dc0f42a2748c3700fd3d4e2c

Yep... Mr Bill gates... NOW... DISCLAIMER... I'm a nerd and love computers and have looked up to old Billy since I was a kid. I honestly respect him until proven otherwise.

But he does come into play here.

I was looking into WHO actually invests in these Charter Schools and I came across this article...

**GOT DOUGH? HOW BILLIONAIRES RULE OUR SCHOOLS.**

Now this article is in a pretty reputable Magazine, with high domain authority, readership and traffic.

(BUT AGAIN... I have not verified this magazines Agenda)

The article details the ongoing campaigns of Billionaires to pump 100s of millions into these schools.

The 3 BIGGEST of these are:

* The Bill and Linda Gates Foundation
* The Broad Foundation
* The Walton Family Foundation

We will get into this in more detail shortly... BUT... BOMB DROP TIME...

***(A bigger bomb is coming)***

Give a guess who else was listed in this article?

FUCKING MILKEN... They didn't even call him by his full name and listed him in a bunch of other names... so much so that if you were skimming the article and not paying attention... you would have missed it.

*""And they fund the same vehicles to achieve their goals: charter schools, high-stakes standardized testing for students, merit pay for teachers whose students improve their test scores, firing teachers and closing schools when scores don’t rise adequately, and longitudinal data collection on the performance of every student and teacher. Other foundations—Ford, Hewlett, Annenberg,* ***Milken***\*, to name just a few—often join in funding one project or another""\*

So DOT CONNECTED... we now have a common interest between Milken and Gates.

(The common Interest between Gates and Kenny... is ALOT more substantial)

**NOW... LET'S GET INTO HOW INTERESTED THESE GUYS ARE IN CHARTERS**

Milken:

Damming Article about Milken and FOR PROFIT Cyber schools from 2013:

[https://www.prwatch.org/news/2013/10/12257/junk-bonds-junk-schools-cyber-schools-fleece-taxpayers-phantom-students-and-faili](https://www.prwatch.org/news/2013/10/12257/junk-bonds-junk-schools-cyber-schools-fleece-taxpayers-phantom-students-and-faili)

(Early Days, before they worked out the kinks)

Article in Bloomberg (Which I refuse to pay for) stating:

***The children attend Agora Cyber Charter School, managed by K12 (LRN), the largest U.S. operator of taxpayer-funded online schools and part-owned by billionaire Michael Milken.***

And goes to say:

***If it were a school district, it would be one of the largest in America. K12 expects to generate $500 million in revenue this year—it earned a $21.5 million profit last year—and its stock has doubled in value since the company went public in December 2007. The financial success of K12 has shown that Milken—the 1980s junk-bond king, convicted felon (securities fraud), and health-care philanthropist—has figured out how to profit from public schools.***

Hang on 1 second now!

This article is saying that Michael Milken, the 1980's junk-bond king, convicted felon (securities fraud), and health-care philanthropist... **HAS FIGURED OUT A WAY TO PROFIT FROM TAX-FUNDED PUBLIC SCHOOLS?**

...fuck me...

Again, I'll let you make your own determination on this... but this seems to tie back into all the Tin Foil hat articles I've been reading today...

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think you get the Point Apes Right?

This is NOT an exhaustive list. They are ALL at it. THE LIST GOES ON.

And RIGHT NOW... I am only looking at education.

Not AMIND the fucking donations to political parties (On both sides) that support charter schools.

**So WHY are they doing it?**

Is it to crush the Unions?

Is it to avoid taxes?

Is it Politics related?

Is it **OUT OF THE GOODWILL OF THEIR HEARTS???**

Is it a combination of everything?

(Image added, because I know you guys love them)

Didn't that 1 article say he **FOUND A WAY TO PROFIT FROM PUBLIC SCHOOLS????**

**(ARE YOU READY FOR THAT BOMB I PROMISED?)**

I started digging...

That's when I came across an article in Forbes on THIS VERY TOPIC...

An article with Credible sources, an actual research paper... and what MAY BE THE TRUTH.

(Up to you to decide)

**IT IS POSSIBLE TO PROFIT, EVEN FROM A NON-PROFIT, CHARTER SCHOOL**

Of course it fucking is...

The rich know how to get richer. That's a language they speak.

And it's even better, when the methods grant you perks, like Tax Haven's and public perception.

**WONDERING HOW BILLIONAIRES MAKE MONEY FROM CHARTER SCHOOLS?**

This research on [Colorado.edu](https://Colorado.edu), highlights 4 major concerns.

1. A substantial share of public expenditure intended for the delivery of direct educational services to children is being extracted inadvertently or intentionally for personal or business financial gain, creating substantial inefficiencies;
2. Public assets are being unnecessarily transferred to private hands, at public expense, risking the future provision of “public” education;
3. Charter school operators are growing highly endogenous, self-serving private entities built on funds derived from lucrative management fees and rent extraction which further compromise the future provision of “public” education; and
4. Current disclosure requirements make it unlikely that any related legal violations, ethical concerns, or merely bad policies and practices are not realized until clever investigative reporting, whistleblowers or litigation brings them to light.

\-- I haven't gone through it all, as it's 56 pages long and I have other fish to fry, but it seems legit. IMO.

The Forbes article is a great read and I recommend everyone do so:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/petergreene/2018/08/13/how-to-profit-from-your-non-profit-charter-school/?sh=6f7583ac3354](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petergreene/2018/08/13/how-to-profit-from-your-non-profit-charter-school/?sh=6f7583ac3354)

The sources on here are great rabbit holes too.

The main methods listed here to profit from these schools are Real Estate and Management Companies.

Furthering this is an article in the WALL STREET JOURNAL about Real Estate Businesses investing HEAVILY in Charter schools.

If there were no financial benefits... how would this make sense?

SOURCE: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/charter-school-movement-growsfor-real-estate-investors-1444750383](https://www.wsj.com/articles/charter-school-movement-growsfor-real-estate-investors-1444750383)

And...

Here's another article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette talking about how Charter Schools are pulling money from the Public School System and being paid to Charter School Landlords

[https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2016/08/03/Charter-school-payments-draw-scrutiny-from-Pennsylvania-auditor-general-Eugene-DePasquale/stories/201608030189](https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2016/08/03/Charter-school-payments-draw-scrutiny-from-Pennsylvania-auditor-general-Eugene-DePasquale/stories/201608030189)

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apes there's tons of this...

SEAS of information about the top 1% pumping money into Charters

This is just the TIP OF THE ICE-BERG

But back to the main focus of this post.

This is further evidence of the **Billionaires Boys Club**...

What you believe in turns of the reason for this, is completely up to you...

But it is Public Information about how much focus these schools are getting from people at that top and they are all connected in some shape or form...

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If they all collaborate on Philantrapy this much when it's theoretically legal... how close are they communicating about things they are NOT ALLOWED TO?

**DISCLAIMER:**

Again... this post is just about me researching the reasons behind certain questions and documenting the public information available to me on these topics.

BadassTrader,2021-06-14 17:17:24+00:00,Billionaire's Boys Club - Part 2: The Inner Circle,"Ok, you apes got me all riled up now after the positive reaction to my last post  ([Ref Boys Club Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nzkzi5/is_this_the_final_boss_john_petry_and_ken_griffin/)) so I've decided to keep digging.

Let's start with Our New Super Villian Michael ""Milky"" Milken:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7li64nzrk9571.png?width=220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bcde810dc36c5dda25784896d52d37d983b9dcb

Disclaimer: I'm Irish and have no real interest in American pol itics, so I know once I mention this shit's gonna get political, but lets try and not...

We're all Apes, we're all here for the Stonk... not for Poli tics.

So... TR UMP pardoned this guy on 18th Feb 2020.

What struck me about this, was that he had 33 people lobbying Tr ump to get his Pardon. ([Ref New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/business/michael-milken-trump-pardon.html))

Now, when you click on the link to get the White Houses statement on who these 33 people are, it brings up a 404 error... The statement no longer exists!

But luckily, this Ape has heard of the way back machine!

So using the way back machine, we can get the 33 names. ([Ref Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20200313203638/https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-executive-grants-clemency-2/))

* **Dr. Miriam Adelson -** Married to Sheldon Adelson
* **Sheldon Adelson -** Tru mps Largest Donor, Casino Tycoon, 28th Richest Person in the world

* **Gary Winnick -** Founder of Global Crossing

So fuck me Apes...

This guy has some friend list willing to go to bat for him right?

Can't even count the amount of Billionaires up there and this is just the list of people issued in the official Whitehouse statement (That mysteriously no longer exists)

**So... on with the connections.**

Let's cross-reference our hedgies with our favorite stonk.

John Paulson Hedgie #1 - Does not have a position in GME according to latest 13F.

Neither does Hedgie #2, though he does have a small up of a million shares on AMC

&amp;#x200B;

**How about our investment firms?**

Josh Harris at Apollo Global Management decided in Q1 of 2021 that he would trade GME for the first time with a small put position of 150,000 Shares. ([Ref Holdings](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/apollo-management-holdings-l-p#tabholdings_tab_link)) - Similar Timing to Sessa Maybe?

But other than that... not a whole load more to report.

&amp;#x200B;

**How about connections to Kenny Himself?**

Well there's a SHITLOAD of that...

Here's just 1 article, referencing 6 of our 33 hitlist in addition to Kenny himself referencing donations to the Repu blican party. (Again... I'll try keep po litics out of this, but this is establishing connections)

[Reference Forbes Article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/windriver/2021/05/07/open-source-brings-collective-creativity-to-the-intelligent-edge/?sh=7f6db7ab321a)

(Can you spot all 6?)

I'm not going to go through ALL of it as there is WAY too much, but it's safe to say... there are a lot of connections

But here are a few examples to wet your confirmation bias...

[Elaine Chao and Kenny hanging out at a Milken event with ""The worlds most powerful thinkers""](https://www.reuters.com/article/cbusiness-us-milken-conference-trump-idCAKBN17Y26U-OCABS)

[Kenny, David Rubenstein, Mark Weinberger, Steven Tananbaum all hanging out at the Milken Global Conference in 2017](https://milkeninstitute.org/events/global-conference-2017/speakers)

[Kenny buys Rupert Murdochs ex Wife's House](https://www.chicagobusiness.com/residential-real-estate/what-will-billionaire-ken-griffin-build-his-huge-palm-beach-estate)

(Can't make this shit up)

\+ This Milken Institute seems to be central for a lot of these guys...

ANYWAY....

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On to the shit we care about.

We've established that there's a Billionaires Boys Club and Kenny is Part of it.

So let's take the Sessa and Apollo pattern and see if we can expand on it.

What are we looking for?

Companies that own Puts, that first reported ownership in Q1 2021 and that have not hedged.

This gives us this list:

**Taconic Capital Advisors:** 537,900 shares valued at $102 million

**Hound Partners LLC:** 241,500 shares valued at $45.8 million

**CMT Capital Markets Trading:** 241,500 shares valued at $45.8 million (Sounds familiar)

**Millennium Management LLC:** 163,400 shares valued at $31 million

**Apollo Management Holdings:** 150,000 shares valued at $28.5 million (We know who this is)

**CSS LLC:** 71,000 Shares valued at $13.5 million

**Jefferies Group LLC:** 48,000 shares valued at $9 million (Jefferies? WTF)

**Ionic Capital Management:** 20,600 shares valued at $4million

There's more... but that's enough for now.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The second biggest NEW put position is **Taconic Capital**

Founder of Taconic, is Frank Brosens.

Frank Brosens was invited to speak at the Invest for Kids Event in Chicago...

As was Kenny

As was Milken

Reference: [Invest for Kids Event Speakers list](https://investforkidschicago.org/past-speakers/)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3rd biggest NEW position without a hedge falls to **Hound Partners**

Couldn't dig up a lot here except this suspiciously convenient article about Kenny having a CURIOUSLY passive stake in TiVo along with Hound Partners, both in a stock that is ""Not exactly widely followed""

[https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b150y1tj6mwz2w/citadels-curiously-passive-stake-in-tivo](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b150y1tj6mwz2w/citadels-curiously-passive-stake-in-tivo)

On the OTHER HAND...

(This shit gets crazy)

Hound Partners was funded by a company called Tiger Management.

Tiger Management was founded by Julian Robertson

And... I really can't believe I am saying this but...

Kenny's Ex-wife, Anne Dias, Managed Money for both Kenny and Julian Robertson!!!!

WTF... THE ACTUAL FUCK

Reference: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/female-hedge-fund-veteran-has-contemplated-a-comeback-11559122201](https://www.wsj.com/articles/female-hedge-fund-veteran-has-contemplated-a-comeback-11559122201)

I don't subscribe to WSJ, so only reading the headline... LMFAO

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next up to get knocked down...

**Millenium Management Company** Run by Israel Englander

Again... a suspiciously convenient example of Citadel and Millennium working in parallel with each other dumping FireEye Shares.

Reference (Warning... this is a motley fool article. Proceed with Skeptisism. [Link)](https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/05/26/these-billionaires-just-dumped-more-than-1-million.aspx)

&amp;#x200B;

And yet again... Milken Global Conference 2010 with Milken, Kenny and Englander

[https://milkeninstitute.org/article/2010-milken-institute-global-conference-brings-world-leaders-los-angeles-foster-ideas](https://milkeninstitute.org/article/2010-milken-institute-global-conference-brings-world-leaders-los-angeles-foster-ideas)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Apollo** we already discussed.

But another cross-referencing showed up this article that has Marc Rowan (Apollo Founder), Kenny AND Julian Robertson all donating to Mitt Romney

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2012/02/01/billionaires-private-equity-ceos-give-big-to-romney-super-pac/?sh=5a6b52443568](https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2012/02/01/billionaires-private-equity-ceos-give-big-to-romney-super-pac/?sh=5a6b52443568)

&amp;#x200B;

And more form the Apollo leadership team heading out to hang out with Milken and Kenny in 2015: [https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/24/milken-time-wall-street-jets-west-for-davos-with-palm-trees.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/24/milken-time-wall-street-jets-west-for-davos-with-palm-trees.html)

&amp;#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

**CSS LLC** was a much tougher nut to crack.

Smaller company. Smaller position.

Finra does have a check on them though ([Ref: LINK](https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/45980))

And it shows a single Director: Peter Anthony Ianello

After doing some solid Googling, it turns out he goes by Peter Ianello and is actually the founder of a different company... OCA Ventures.

I searched them for a 13F, but doesn't exist. (Ref: [https://whalewisdom.com/filer/oca-ventures-llc](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/oca-ventures-llc))

But they are out of Chicago and both Kenny and Peter made it to the Chicago 100 list:

[http://tullman.blogspot.com/2014/06/who-made-list-techweek-chicago-reveals.html](http://tullman.blogspot.com/2014/06/who-made-list-techweek-chicago-reveals.html)

A cross-reference with Milken shows that both guys are listed as business speakers for events... but that's meh...

That's all I could get for this one... but I am even more suspicious of these smaller funds.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Ionic Capital Management** was a hard nut too

Founders were not listed in Linkedin, but I found [an article](https://www.globalvolatilitysummit.com/sponsor/ionic/) listing 3 Co-Founders for the company:

Bart Baum

Adam Radosti

Daniel Stone

&amp;#x200B;

YET AGAIN... another article talking about Kenny and one of these companies making unusual plays.

Here they talk about Citadel And Ionic (Specifically just these 2) being bullish on a company called Verb. -- ONLY 4 hedge funds in total were trading this company!!!

Ken created the largest position and Ionic had the highest weighting.

And weirdly... in the article... it says both companies had $0 million as their position. lol. WTF.

Reference: [https://newsfortomorrow.com/index.php/2019/12/22/hedge-funds-have-never-been-this-bullish-on-verb-technology-company-inc-verb/](https://newsfortomorrow.com/index.php/2019/12/22/hedge-funds-have-never-been-this-bullish-on-verb-technology-company-inc-verb/)

And here... Millenium, Citadel and Ionic all mentioned in a poorly timed position in LATAM Airlines

[https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/these-hedge-funds-couldnt-pick-a-worse-time-to-buy-latam-airlines-group-ltm-823467/](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/these-hedge-funds-couldnt-pick-a-worse-time-to-buy-latam-airlines-group-ltm-823467/)

Another unusual trade in NASDAQ:AVCT mentioning Citadel, Ionic and Millenium...

Another unusual trade for NASDAQ:GSMG mentioning Citadel, Ionic and Millenium...

[https://topnasdaq.com/is-gsmg-a-good-stock-to-buy-now/](https://topnasdaq.com/is-gsmg-a-good-stock-to-buy-now/)

&amp;#x200B;

This list goes on... but I think you get the picture...

Been writing and researching this for a good few hours now, so I hope you find some entertainment in it.

I think the point is clear... and something we all knew all along.

There is 100% a Billionaire's Boys Club... but it's still fun to connect some of the dots!

crayonburrito,2021-03-05 00:45:14+00:00,Is there enough money for $100k per share? Of course there is!,"Some people on the sub have asked, maybe with authentic curiosity or maybe to raise FUD, if it ***is possible that GME could actually be sold for $100,000+ per share***. The gentle and naive ape might think “there isn’t that much money available.” The FUDsters might argue “it will crash the whole economy!” or “Melvin will just go bankrupt leaving us holding the bag.” 

Let me give you a little bit of perspective. 

There is a lot of money in this world. A. LOT. It is spread out in bank accounts, investment funds, stocks, securities, real estate, property, land, and a whole bunch of other “money containers” or what have you. From my understanding of the housing bubble crisis, super-rich people were looking for a place to put their accumulated wealth that would get them a good return and the CDO was the answer. The super-rich couldn’t get enough of them so, unethical as they were, the banks created shitty CDOs to meet the needs. 

As you know, it all went tits up and the wealthy took a small hit to the tune of billions and billions of dollars, recovered very quickly, and became even richer in the last 12 years. The regular folk took a whole lot longer to recover. 

So the CDO is out of fashion and super-rich people still need to invest their money. They have to put it somewhere. The super-rich and I have the same problem! My bank offers me 0.015% interest in my savings account. Not good! So the super-rich buys things that will increase in value while they can also enjoy it at the same time. I don’t really have that option. 

Consider this. Imagine a city with about a million people in it. Like Austin, TX or Columbus, OH. Picture the skyline. Look at one of those nice tall buildings and picture a single condo in one of those buildings. That condo costs a million dollars, maybe more. Now zoom out a bit and think about how many condos are in that one building. Now consider the whole block. Keep adding up the money. Zoom out further and think about the other buildings and what they are worth. Think about the restaurants, even the nice “independent” ones. Do you think one person, the chef, “owns” it? Nah. She has investors. A car wash. Silent investors. Zoom out further and imagine you’re trying to buy a house near downtown, with a good school nearby. What do those houses cost? Either super-rich people bought them outright or coming up wealthy bought them and have big mortgages. Either way, they are backed by investors. Both Austin and Columbus have large universities in it and huge student populations. Nearly all those students are paying rent on apartments and homes owned by someone else as investment properties. Even the working class neighborhood homes are owned by banks and mortgage companies, not the working class. They aren’t payed off. Owned by investors. 

And these are just two cities in the USA. Think about New York, Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles, The Bay Area, Houston, Boston, Philadelphia, rich suburbs and edge cities, vacation towns, resorts, beach towns. There is soooooo much money floating around. ***Massive wealth and it is NOT spread out. It is concentrated. A very few people own a lot.*** Look out your window. Someone owns the whole landscape. 

When we think about the DTCC, a financial company, it is like the collective working-cash bank account of the stock market, but if you recall, wealth is concentrated. So it’s more or less the working-cash bank account of the super-rich people. It has something like 40 trillion dollars in it **(and, for perspective, 400 million shares of GME at $100k each).** But that’s just a working-cash bank account. The real wealth is in their real estate, properties, land, stocks, securities, etc. People don’t let money just sit around not earning its keep. 

If the price of GME hits $100k per share, that money will need to get replenished in order to make the stock market work again. How will they do it? They will do what regular people do when faced with a shortage of cash: ***they will sell a few things.*** Things they don’t find essential like yachts, vacation homes, investment properties, land, helicopters, sports teams, boat slips, air strips, who knows what else. 

They’ll get by. 

So, yes. There is definitely enough money to support $100k per share. The question is do holders have the guts to wait for it. 

**tl:dr Yes, there is enough money. A few people own everything and they won't feel a thing.** 

\[This post is my opinion, open for discussion, and not DD. Of course it’s not financial advice. Blah blah. Though I do advocate everyone buy as much $ASS as you can afford. I’m riding $ASS to the moon!\]",GME,2759

rev0ltingy0uth,2021-03-03 23:42:02+00:00,"For the first time, I left my therapist speechless","I (25f) never realized I had an Ndad until today.

Today in therapy I was talking about the lack of boundaries in my home life.

For context, I live in a side house situation next to my parents' house. I don't have a washer/dryer, they do. I have a microwave, they don't. So it's common for us to go over often. But they take it too far and come and go as they please, as they see it as they are my ""landlords."" I do not have privacy. I wake up to sounds all throughout the night from my dad coming in for whatever reason. I've been walked in on while in bed with my partner. There is no knocking, even after I've asked for them to. And I can't lock the door, because I'll literally be accused of ""doing drugs.""

So anyways, we were talking about where this lack of boundaries comes from and I suddenly remembered a situation that happened in high school. I was in my room (in my parents house, not the side house where I live now), and my mom came in to ""escape from them fighting"" (she always comes into my room when they fought, even as a child, and even now) and my dad followed her in. They started screaming and yelling about my mom catching my dad cheating. And I watched my dad lie straight to my mom's face about ""being a sex addict."" He gaslit her into believing he'd told her that before and that she'd always known that. I told my therapist how laughable it was to see him lie like that. But my therapist was silent, and said ""I'm at a loss for words. That isn't funny, that's completely disgusting."" And began talking about how not only do neither of my parents have respect enough for me to not fight in my room, to not fight in front of me, but to also not talk about private things like that in front of me, regardless of my age. And my therapist said my dad is most definitely a narcissist, amongst many other things.

I don't know why I'm writing all of this. I guess to get it off my chest, and to also communicate how good to feels to be validated and hear that the experiences I've rationalized actually aren't okay.

EDIT: I just wanted to pop on and say thank you for all of the support, kind words, and rewards! It means a lot to know there are plenty of other people out there that know exactly what I'm going through.

Also just wanted to include this: I live near Los Angeles, so all of the suggestions to move out are appreciated but not possible during 1) a pandemic and 2) a historical housing shortage in CA that has driven already expensive housing prices up. Just for some more context.",raisedbynarcissists,2151

So let’s start with the Stuff Investors should be looking for.

Now why does this stuff matter to the young savvy stock investor like you? The AMC Earnings Report will show everyone including the Institutional Investors what has gone on with all the debt and real estate restructuring, and how they plan to move forward coming out of a Global Pandemic. This is where you will see more Institutional Investor buy into the market. The Re-Opening of Movie Theatres will bring in profit, and paired with the Google Trends information (AMC Theatres Trending Higher then Regal and Cinemark) AMC will likely see more retail action then others in the industry. Especially since one of AMC’s Larger Markets is about to re-open (California). Plus, let’s not forget the Movie Blockbusters like Spider Man: No Way Home, Black Widow, Fast &amp; Furious 9, Ghostbusters, James Bond and Many More[\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/submit#_ftn1) are all scheduled for Theatrical Releases. Paramount will stream there release 45 days after the theatrical release date on Paramount +, with a deal struck with the theatre industry. Now after the entire world has been locked up at home the theatre business will see heavy action out of the gate, as we saw in the Asian market. [\[2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/submit#_ftn2)

Marketing:

· AMC Theatres partnered with Movio to create a more personalized advertising campaigns using Social Media platforms like Twitter.

o [https://www.marketingdive.com/ex/mobilemarketer/cms/news/advertising/20372.html](https://www.marketingdive.com/ex/mobilemarketer/cms/news/advertising/20372.html)

· AMC Theatres using social media to show concessions, and refillable popcorn buckets.

o [https://www.amctheatres.com/annual-bucket](https://www.amctheatres.com/annual-bucket)

Marketing is always a big part of any business and partnering with Movio to create a personalized advertising campaign makes the message more effective, instead of receiving the same info over and over again. Concessions is a profit business and AMC saw a 9% rise in there concessions sales in 2019.

Employee &amp; Management Polls Look Pretty Good: Retention, Flexible Work Hours, and a Transparent Management Team.

· [https://www.niche.com/places-to-work/amc-entertainment-leawood-ks/](https://www.niche.com/places-to-work/amc-entertainment-leawood-ks/)

Now let’s get to some of the stuff that is a little more interesting to you apes.

Institutional Buyers:

Now there is currently 374 Institutional buyers holding 21.83% or 62,719,736 not including Mirage Investment Groups Buzzer Beater on Friday February 26th of 6 Million dollars, out of the 8 Million dollars in stock purchased in the last two minutes. [\[3\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/submit#_ftn3) This is a good thing to see for a retail investor. A lot of Institutional buyers love the stock.

Mysterious SI: Our as I like to say #Findshorty

· Ihor Duranski has recently tweeted that there was a rise in the amount of SI in the numbers for AMC + 12.99 Million Shares Worth $104 Million. You can search Ihor on Twitter or get a free ShortSight Account from S3 I will not be posting a link for his twitter account to reveal any personal information about myself but I will post a excel spreadsheet.

· AMC Stock now divided into 35 EFT’s with IWM being the biggest and Shorted at 34%, EFT’s holding AMC up 1 from this morning, and 30 over one week. Makes an Ape wonder what the others look like

o [https://www.etf.com/stock/AMC](https://www.etf.com/stock/AMC)

So IMO again My Opinion things are looking pretty good for AMC. Now ADD your Rockets, and ALL the Emojis you want. Don’t fall for the noise, drown it out, and stay the course. Institutional Investors are counting on you to HOLD. Just wish they would add a Vintage Movie Date Night to the mix.

TLDR: Good News Events coming in including the Financial Earnings Report Release Date, with sign up for webcast for investors. New Marketing Partnership with Movio with better targeting towards the consumer. Institutional Investors are buying positions. Employee &amp; Management Polls are encouraging. SI Increasing and EFT Containing AMC are increasing and being shorted.

Edit #1: Graphs and Charts in Tonight’s DD…. HOLD and Buy People Don’t fall for the Obvious Shiny new Bull Trap Pump and Dump Hedgies are hanging out there.

Edit #2 Zacks Rating is a 2, still a buy. Drown out the Noise. Not Financial Advice I am not a Financial Advisor.. ITS My Opinion.. [https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC](https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/AMC)  

Edit#3 if you got an S3 Shortsight account today you would see the SI went up. Maybe someone should ask IHOR D. For the numbers

By Myriam Gurba	

February 23, 2021

As a kid, one of my favorite films involved Mexicans who counted. That movie, Stand and Deliver, was inspired by the real-life story of Jaime Escalante, a Bolivian immigrant who became a celebrated calculus teacher in East Los Angeles. The film rightly brought out the fangirl in me. Many of Escalante’s students were stubborn Chicanos and I related; I was a Chicana and I hated algebra; history was my jam. The movie also featured Latine nerds, an archetype that was familiar but that I hadn’t seen on the big screen. Lastly, Escalante reminded me of my mom, Beatriz, a Mexican immigrant who taught public school in California.

As an adult, I now recognize the movie’s pernicious flaws.

Stereotypes are central to the plot of Stand and Deliver and while its ethnic caricatures are hard to miss – the cholo who feels pressured to hide his book smarts versus the cholo who refuses to learn – I didn’t understand how one of the movie’s primary stereotypes distorted my understanding of the teaching profession until I set foot in a classroom to instruct. Films like Stand and Deliver hurt educators by representing us as engaged in a morbidly transactional profession. In exchange for sacrificing our mental and physical health, we achieve hero status. 

Martyrdom underwrites our goodness.

As the coronavirus continues to take lives, the lives of teachers and school staff included, the good-educator-as-unflinching-martyr trope is being used to shame those of us who express concerns about IRL instruction. Last month, New York Times’ columnist David Brooks penned a screed that all but accused educators critical of their working conditions of laziness, stupidity, and cowardice.

Brooks seems to prefer stoic teachers ready to become ill and die and I imagine the columnist watching Stand and Deliver, nodding in approval at a scene set during a night school session. Escalante, who has taken on a second job as an English instructor, shuffles about a classroom, clutching at his chest while he leads adult students through a set of language drills. The students seem unaware of their teacher’s distress and Escalante excuses himself. Once he’s out of their sight, he loses his composure. He sweats and pants, wheezing as he struggles to make his way down a desolate flight of stairs. Crumpling to the floor, Escalante presses his face against the seemingly cold cement as he experiences a heart attack.

(I imagine Brooks leaping to his feet to give a standing ovation! “That’s the spirit!” he screams.)

Several scenes later, Escalante convalesce in a hospital bed. His teenage son tells him, “Dad, the doctor says no stress. No job-related activity for at least a month.”

Escalante quips, “I want another doctor.”

The teacher urges his family to go home, and after they leave, he produces a pamphlet and a pen. He scribbles calculus notes and gives them to a nurse who smuggles the mathematical contraband to his students. 

This plot point begs a question: If a heart attack is an unacceptable reason for a teacher to rest, what constitutes a justifiable reason?

Decapitation?

Not if the instructor who’s lost her head teaches home economics: Let her thread a needle!

Too many Americans hold teachers to the grotesque standards set by films that portray us as modern saints. I once evaluated myself according to such moral benchmarks and the first week that I taught ninth grade, I held myself to them. I developed a sore throat that I hoped could be cured by ignoring it. The pain overwhelmed me and speaking became torture. A student stared at me as I struggled to remain upright.

“Ms. Gurba,” she said, “you don’t look…good.”

“I’m fine,” I coughed. I taught the rest of the day while seated.

After school, I went to a clinic where I discovered I had strep throat and while I understood that I was infectious, I also understood that if I used sick days to recuperate, it was likely that parents, fellow faculty, administrators and even students might think me selfish. It’s not only the perfect attendance of students that’s celebrated. Teachers who come to work in spite of illness are often celebrated as well. They’re lauded for their selflessness. That’s what people have been conditioned to expect of teachers. No selfhood. Just selfless vibes.

I permitted myself one day off and agonized about it the entire time that I watched Jerry Springer.

In November of last year, CNN reported on a teacher who conducted elementary school lessons from her hospital bed following surgery. I found CNN’s fetishization of her convalescence cringeworthy but the news outlet, desperate to canonize her, placed her story in a section of its website titled “the Good Stuff.” The Good Stuff offers “headlines that make you smile” and its report on Stephany Hume characterized her as “inspiring,” “the type of teacher we all wished we’d had in elementary school.” Apparently, an ideal teacher is one whose identity is defined by unrelenting sacrifice: “…when the English language arts teacher of 20 years went to the hospital for an unexpected hernia surgery, she still made sure to read to her students at Sewell Elementary from her hospital bed — gown and all.”

Teachers are never not supposed to be giving. 

We are supposed to give ourselves away until nothing remains.

Celebrating cases like Hume’s sets an absurd standard for teacher behavior, one that requires saintliness. This standard exists because, like nursing, teaching is a feminized profession with moral expectations dictated by fucked up gender norms. Since the beginning of the twentieth century, the education of children has been treated as an “inherently ‘feminine’ pursuit” and data shows that the profession has grown increasingly gender segregated. 77 percent of public school teachers in the United States are women, with the “the average teacher [being] a 43-year-old white woman.”

The logic of misogyny drives the urgency with which assholes like Brooks call for teachers to return to IRL instruction. Because teachers are feminized, we’re expected to be unconcerned with our own well-being and wholly consumed with the well-being of strangers’ kids. This conceptualization falls within a framework theorized by philosopher Kate Manne, one that she terms the “human being/giver distinction.” According to this distinction, women function as givers and must conform to a set of obligations that are fundamentally economic. We must offer love, attention, affection and admiration as well as caregiving labor without the expectation of any of these moral goods or services in return. Here I will stress that the allocation of these moral goods and services is synonymous with the teaching profession.

I enjoy teaching but it’s not a religious vocation. It’s a job, one that has become increasingly difficult to perform during the pandemic, with 77 percent of teachers reporting an increased work load compared with last year. Thanking us for our labor isn’t just unnecessary: it’s condescending. We work because we must, because under racial capitalism, we have been disciplined to the wage and racial capitalism that will punish us if we dare to critique the prevailing set of economic relations. The highest expression of gratitude to educators isn’t a litany of platitudes. Most of us would prefer to work in safe environments where our health is prioritized. In order to give that to teachers, Americans will have to relinquish their fetishization of us as selfless givers.",Teachers,1306

theinternetistrash,2021-02-27 04:58:10+00:00,please don’t bring your laptops and work at small businesses in LA right now," I work at a small biz here in Los Angeles that has suffered greatly through this mess. we love our customers, the staff is lovely, and the owners have been nothing but kind to us. we have all really worked our asses off to stay in business and preserve our community. 
 we offer WiFi, like a lot of small businesses. It’s always been kind of awful and rude when people buy a small drink or a bottle of water and then take up an entire table for six hours charging all their devices. It might not hurt a mega Corp like Starbucks but when you do that at a small biz you are FOR SURE cutting into their razor thin profits. And that was pre COVID. 
 ALL  restaurants/ cafes have had to reduce their seating a by large percentage because of COVID. They are all barely hanging on. Please don’t do this now. I see it not just at my workplace but everywhere and the selfishness blows my mind.  
 So please, until we get back to some semblance of normalcy try to limit the amount of time you take up table space. Better yet, read a book, meet up with friends and loved ones (safely masked &amp; outdoors), draw, or just enjoy our beautiful weather. You’ve no doubt been sitting on your laptop for most of the year, try something new &amp; LEAVE THE LAPTOP AT HOME.

EDIT: I’m speaking about popular places which are doing takeaway only (lots are) with (covid related) very limited outdoor seating. and also people who camp out for HOURS and order very little, not every person with a laptop.

Edit 2: thanks for the awards and thoughtful comments kind strangers! ❤️
 I also frequently see people ask how to make friends in Los Angeles. The very best way is to be a good regular at your local small businesses. I’ve seen people fall in love, get jobs, and make lifelong friendships. The people who come in on their laptops with headphones on are much less likely to meet people and make friends and connections.",LosAngeles,1067

lionhearted318,2021-02-23 16:17:39+00:00,RS Update,"Thought I'd give you guys an update on what RS is saying so you don't have to read it yourselves.

Matt &amp; Rachael:

* They definitely never got engaged, Matt gave her a promise ring instead of an engagement ring.
* They officially broke up within the last week.
* RS has no intel on what's currently going on with Matt, or whether he will stay single or attempt to rekindle a relationship with Michelle, Bri, or any other girl from his season.

Bachelorette:

* Filming was delayed for one week, and now will likely start in the third week of March.
* The season will film in the US, not Canada and not the Cayman Islands (don't know how that rumor started?). He knows the state they will film in, but not the specific resort.
* Katie was originally picked, but was dropped by production when shit hit the fan with CH. Discussions are still ongoing as to who it will be.
* It's possible Matt could try to start a relationship with one of the girls he didn't pick at ATFR, so Bachelorette casting will possibly be at a stand-still until after ATFR films.

ATFR:

* ATFR will film this weekend in Los Angeles.
* RS has no idea who will host, and whether that person will become the official new BN host or not. Rachel Lindsay is in consideration but he does not know if she really wants to host.
* This will be the first totally pre-recorded ATFR in possibly ten years.

Edit --- Since people keep asking what CH has to do with Katie as Bachelorette here is my explanation for it:

CH unearthed the major problem of race within the franchise. We had the most diverse top eight in BN history with only two white girls making it that far. Production ignoring all the WOC frontrunners to pick a white girl who didn't even make top ten was a very bad look and was proving people's points that they didn't care about POC.",thebachelor,1329

Me - your storyteller of the moment.

Chad - Hiring CTO.

Richard - CEO, brother of Chad.

Big Bro - Engineer coworker

Eddie - IT and Desktop support guy.

This takes place near the very beginning of my software engineering career, back in '05 or '06.  I'd just been let go from my previous place of employment due to be being compliant with directives I'd been given (although not maliciously, so that story wouldn't be appropriate here, sadly), and thus working myself out of a job.  I was a young college dropout from a technical college that hadn't been federally accredited yet, and thus all my student loans were from banks and loan companies instead of from Uncle Sam, and debts were due.  I was also making payments on my very first car, even though it was a beater that the prior owners had already nearly driven into the ground (4 years old and nearly 200k miles on it when I bought it), and of course, rent and utitlities.  The job I'd just been let go from already had me working paycheck to paycheck as they paid far under average rate, but I was still new professional so I couldn't be very choosy.  I was living in Los Angeles county, so the cost of living was so bad, I was having to choose which bills were going to be late on a monthly basis.  Specifically, I was living in a town called San Pedro, a small town tucked fairly out of the way.

After blasting my resume to all the job boards, I get a call from a startup who seems interested in my resume and wants me to come in for a face-to-face interview (skipping the call-screen entirely).  In my desperation, I agree.  I'm given an address, which is all the way up in Woodland Hills.  I check the internet...  55 minute drive so long as there's no traffic.  With traffic it looks like the commute will be more like an hour and forty-five minutes... each way.  I'm desperate though, and literally nobody else has reached out to me about my resume or responded to my applications, so I go to the interview.  I arrive to an mostly empty office complex.  Maybe 6 or 7 other cars in a parking lot capable of holding at least 50.  I go into the building mentioned in the address, and call the phone number I was given to let them know I've arrived.  Enter Chad.  Chad comes to meet me, and seems excited that I've come!  He escorts me through the building to an office.  Mind you, as far as I can see, we're the only two humans in the building.  He gives me the pitch for the company, tells me he built the software being sold, but it's not scalable, and needs someone who can rewrite it.  After we go through the whole interview song and dance, he offers me the job on the spot.  The pay is marginally higher than the last gig, so I figure gas would be covered for the commute.  I agree, and we shake hands, as I'm going to be starting the next Monday.

Red flags start appearing from the very first minute I arrive on monday.  First, I'm given a tour, which consists of the 14x14 foot office I'm going to be sharing with Chad, as well as another engineer who's going to be starting the following monday.  I'm not a fan of having someone able to look over my shoulder, it makes me nervous.  I ask why each engineer's desk has two computers.  ""Because the one you will be writing code on doesn't have internet access, for security purposes.""  (Note:  this was pure paranoia.  There was nothing about this software that required such tight security, we weren't doing any gov't contracts or anything of the sort.)  Then, I'm escorted clear across the building, to meet with the CEO (Richard), the IT guy (Eddie), and the sales/support team.  I'm told that half of the team is supporting the existing version of the application, 2 people are selling the existing version to new clients (or trying to), and one person is explicitly tasked with selling the new version.  The one I haven't even started on yet.  I'm still young and dumb at this point, but even I know this means the salesperson is probably giving out a date when the customer should expect their purchase to be filled.  ""It's a good thing you started when we did, we've been telling customers it'll be ready in June.""  Did I mention all this was happening in February?  Apparently I've agreed to rewrite, test, and package an entire application I've never seen before in approximately four months.  So, tour being done, I sit down and get to work.  After jumping through a bunch of hoops of getting the software I prefer downloaded onto the actual work machine, as well as the code, I set about reviewing code so horrific I've not seen its like since, and there isn't a single comment in the entire thing.  Before I can ask a single question of the CTO however, he tells me he's headed to downtown LA to scalp his tickets to the Lakers game, and that he'll see me tomorrow.  So... now I'm alone in the office with this abomination, a machine that's been hamstrung to heck and back, and the only thing I've got to console me is the fact that at least I'm employed again.

Fast-forward a week, I've documented the bulk of the code (because there wasn't any), and the boss and I do not get along.  He's mad because I've not written any substantial code, and I'm frustrated because I'm trying to understand a lot of what specific code is trying to do and he's routinely leaving around noon to go sell his tickets for Laker's games, or just not in the office because he's chatting with someone else.   When he is in the office, I show him my documentation, and try to get him to verify it or describe the purpose of code where all I can say is ""Wat?""  By the end of the week, I've covered about 30% of the project in a wiki-like document, and I've taken to leaving after sunset so I can a) get more done, b) have a shorter commute, and c) drive when my car isn't an oven (the ac didn't work).  I've barely managed to convince the CTO that what I'm doing is necessary so the engineer starting the next monday doesn't have to do anywhere near the same crap I've got, which would make us a more efficient team.

Monday arrives, and in comes Big Bro.  I call him this because he was a much more experienced engineer than I was.  We spend the first day with him getting set up, then us reviewing what I've documented.  He manages to answer some questions the CTO never did, just because he is that much better, and I start to feel more confident.   Over the next weeks, Big Bro took me under his wing as an engineer teaching me best practices, standards, and where my plans were good and where they could be better.  If it hadn't been for him, I'd have gone insane!  I end up joining him outside for smoke breaks even though I don't smoke, just so I can get a breath of non-office air.  He and I discuss the project, and we also make friends with Eddie, who makes us laugh by telling us horror stories about the CTO and CEO (apparently he was a school \*friend\* of theirs and basically worked with them because they paid him to do something he felt was super easy).

April rolls around.  I've got a special occasion I need the day off for, which happens to be a Wednesday that year.  I'd advised him when I first started and he'd been cool with it.  I remind him on April 2nd (since I had an irrational fear of policy decisions being made on April Fool's Day), and he loses it.  He goes off on a rant, and straight up informs me that he regrets hiring me, claiming I didn't have the skills I told him I did, and wasn't worth what I was being paid. We're definitely not half-way done (more like one third), and it's already been decided that June is a lost cause and that we're shooting for August now.  That habit I started before, of leaving after the sun went down?  Yeah, that never stopped.  I was arriving at 9am every day, and leaving around 10pm every night, trying my best.  Big bro was the same, and Eddie would stay late with us just because we liked hanging out together.  So, it should be understandable that I was very close to losing it right back at him.  In a strained, yet diplomatic voice, I told him that if he put in the same amount of work to help us as we put in to rewrite \*his\* code, we'd probably be a lot closer to done than we were, especially given the twelve hour days.  He was not a fan of that, and switched to straight up yelling, blaming us for the lost sales and refunds due to the delays, and that the only way he'd get off our backs was by getting the project done.  This entire time Big Bro is just sitting there, and says nothing to back me up.  Chad then left the office for a bit, and I just declared I was taking my lunch and would be back in an hour.  I felt frustrated by Chad and betrayed by Big Bro, who I felt (rightly or not) should have had my back since we were in the same boat.

When we were both back in the office, he apologized for yelling and told me that since he agreed when I was hired I could have my day off.  Cool.  I apologized too, although not for anything specific.  I just didn't want to talk to him anymore and figured that was the fastest way to end the conversation.

Fast forward to June, and the opportunity for Malicious Compliance.  Over the last two months, Chad has been getting worse and worse.  He's yelling nearly every day (and still leaving early too).  Big Bro and Eddie are also feeling the pain, nobody is safe from his ego.  The smoke breaks and afternoon/evening portion of our day are when we're most productive, as nobody can focus until Chad leaves.  The first monday in June rolls around and Chad invites me to go on a walk outside for a 1-on-1 meeting.  I figured I'm being fired (at this point we've had to refactor the rewrite almost entirely due to missing a critical chunk of functionality, and we're still only 60% done. August release is looking less and less sure).  Chad informs me that he's hired a 3rd engineer, but in order to stay in the budget to pay him, he's cutting my salary in half.  I stop on the spot and just give him a blank look.

""Are you serious?""  I ask.  ""I'm barely able to pay for my bills and the gas required to commute here as it is. If you cut my salary at all, I won't be able to afford to live.""  At this point the idea of cutting my productivity to help ramp up a new engineer so he can help us meet the deadline doesn't even occur to me, although in hindsight that would have also been a pretty major issue.

Chad brushes me off.  ""That's not my problem.  The fact that you missed one deadline and look like you're gonna miss another is.  If you've got a problem with that, you're more than welcome to go find another job.  The new guy starts in two weeks.""  And with that he walks inside.  I'd just been told that I had two weeks left of job at my current salary.  Cool.  So that day I do something I hadn't done since I first started.  I left while the sun was still up.  (Specifically, I left at 5pm).  I drive my oven-car (no working Air Conditioning in a car that had been left in the sun all day in Woodland Hills had me feeling like a baked potato) through traffic (hour and a half-commute home through LA heat), and updated my resume before reactivating my accounts on all the job sites.  I'm contacted the next day by a potential new employer, and I get an interview scheduled.  I decide to tell Big Bro about the new opportunity, and he hits me with news that lets me know just how small a world we live in.

Me: ""Hey, Big Bro, just fyi I've started looking for a new job.  I've already got an interview lined up.""

Big Bro: ""Really?  Where?""

Me: ""Over at &lt;company&gt;""

Big Bro:  ""Wow!  That's where I worked before I came here!   That place is pretty awesome, and I left there on pretty good terms.  I know the CTO there, go ahead and use me as a reference!""

Me, skeptical: ""Really?  Okay....""

Turns out Big Bro was true to his word, and the CTO and I even talked about Big Bro during the interview.  Apparently they'd already talked about me, and Big Bro had been the ultimate hype man, confirming everything I said about why I was looking for a new job and everything.  All goes well, and I'm electronically signing an offer-letter that Friday afternoon (Chad had already left for the day, so there was nobody to look over my shoulder as I used the work computer that \*had\* internet access to get this done).  At the new Job, the commute is cut by more than half, and comes with a pretty significant raise.  I tell Big Bro and Eddie on the last smoke break (I still don't smoke) that I'm done, and I've found something new.  Oddly enough, they both smile and just wish me luck.  ""No hard feelings, hope we stay in touch!""  Odd, but I'd stopped really caring about anything related to that job, so I paid it no mind.  I went back inside, packed up my stuff into my backpack, and walked to the CEO's office.

Me: ""Hey Richard, got a minute?""

Richard: ""Hey OP, what's up?""

Me: ""Just wanted to let you know I found a new job, so I'm moving on.""

Richard: ""Really, why? We need you!""

Me: ""You guys decided it was cool to cut my salary to a point where I couldn't afford to live.  Chad said if I didn't like it, I should look for something new, so I did.""

Richard, looking defeated: ""Well, when's your last day?""

Me: ""Today.""

Richard, now pissed: ""We need you here to train the new guy who starts soon!""

Me: ""Hey, I had to train myself and to an extent, Big Bro when he first started.  The new guy should be able to as well.""

And with that, I left for greener pastures.

The unexpectedly \*huge\* fallout:

Four months later, Big Bro texts me to ask me how things are going.  I tell him things  are great, and we schedule a lunchtime call because apparently things have gone sideways in a huge way.

Part 1)  Apparently Chad came in on Monday almost violently angry, and demands Eddie re-image my work machine first thing in the morning, which erases everything I'd left on there.Big Bro comes in an hour later, and he and Chad discuss the new timeline for the project.  Somewhere in there apparently Big Bro asks Chad to log into the admin account on my old work machine so he can pull the documents I'd accumulated about the planned architecture, the existing code, meeting notes, etc.  Chad answers by apparently punching a hole in the wall, and leaving for the day (probably to go to the hospital to deal with his hand), at 10:30 in the morning.  Big Bro then spends the rest of that week ostensibly working on recreating the documentation from scratch.

Part 2) When I asked how the new guy handled the new documentation, Big Bro laughed and told me there never was any documentation. Apparently he and Eddie had become really good friends in the months we worked there, to the point where they'd become roommates about a month before I left.  More than that though, they'd decided to start a freelance/consulting business together and only had to decide on when to make that their full time jobs.  Neither of them liked Chad much, and wanted to make their departure hurt as much as possible.  So, they decide to make Big Bro's last day the day before the new guy starts, and Eddie would quit shortly afterward, sticking around just long enough to watch the bomb go off.  Did I mention Big Bro never told Chad he was quitting?  Yeah.  He just didn't show up that Monday.  He had, however, emailed that 'documentation' he'd spent a week writing to Chad.  Turns out he wasn't documenting the code at all.  He'd spent a week writing a letter explaining in excruciating detail why Chad was such a bad boss, and he'd emailed it to everyone in the company.  I asked if he still had it so I could read it, and he sent it to me after the call.

Thankfully, like the big helper he was, Eddie had ensured that the new guy's email was set up and in the proper groups before the email was sent, so the guys first email in the company was a novella about the kind of person he' agreed to work for.  Apparently Chad thought it was appropriate to take his frustration out on the new guy, who'd already read a significant portion of the email before Chad shoved him away from his desk and deleted it.  Apparently new guy promptly decided (and rightfully so) that agreeing to work for Chad had been a mistake, packed up his things, and quit on the spot.

Part 3) With the new guy quitting, the August deadline was now little more than a dream within a dream, which according to Eddie doesn't stop Chad and Richard from trying to find that miracle rock star engineer who can save them from their own situation (which, given what they were offering as pay, didn't exist).  So time advances in its unstoppable way, August arrives, and customers find that they've paid for something that hasn't been delivered yet, and pretty much unanimously demand refunds, with a few customers bringing legal action against them.  With the amount they have to refund, and the money they now need for legal fees (because of they way they'd incorporated, they were personally liable), they could no longer afford to pay anyone, and were forced to shutter the business.

Final Note:   For my fellow software engineers out there who were wondering just how bad this application was, this ""program"" was a single php file with over 40k lines of code, running inside a \`while\` loop.  Any and all logic consisted of if/else trees, which then led to either more if/else trees or more loops.  No function calls, no external libraries included, just....  spaghetti of the worst kind.  Given the nature of the application, most critical logic had to be implemented in no less than seven places, depending on where the execution was when the logic was needed.  At worst the tab-depth was something like nineteen or twenty tabs deep.

All contestants are billionaires that must live off $2000/month ($15/hr), and must work 40-hour weeks in a simulated minimum wage job.

Basically I went and found every state’s least populated city and renamed the team based on what I think it would be called if It would be relocated there. For states with multiple teams I just went to the 2nd least populated, then 3rd, etc.

gynoceros,2020-12-05 02:37:37+00:00,My 12 year old is pissed at me because he accidentally proved that Die Hard is indeed a Christmas movie. [SPOILERS],"Last year, I introduced him to Die Hard and I said it was one of my favorite Christmas movies. All year long, he has been trying to argue that it's not a Christmas movie per se, it's just a movie that happens at Christmastime. 

My argument was that the whole reason John McClane was even in Los Angeles was to see his family for Christmas and the only reason he was at Nakatomi Plaza was for the Xmas party. He wasn't having it. 

So tonight I introduced Lethal Weapon, which honestly, I had forgotten was also set around Christmas. But there we are, watching the opening credits and they're playing jingle bell rock, everything is decorated for Xmas, everyone's saying ""Merry Christmas"" to each other. So I start saying ""look, another Christmas movie like Die Hard!"" because I know he's going to argue that it's not. 

He impressed me this time: he said that if you take Christmas out, it doesn't change the story. And he's 100% right; Lethal Weapon can stand on its own without the story changing even if it happens in the third week of August. Christmas is not at all integral to any part of that movie. 

So I pointed out that Gruber's gang in Die Hard needed the reduced security and number of employees in the building for a nighttime Christmas party for them to get into the building easier, but they also needed enough employees at the party to create a hostage situation that would get the FBI out so they could turn off the power, letting them drill into the vault. 

You take Xmas out and they don't have their opportunity to make their heist. 

And again, McClane is in that building specifically because it's Christmas. 

No Christmas, no Die Hard. 

He's not happy about it. 

So tomorrow we're going to have to watch Love Actually and see what he thinks.",movies,3625

Later details emerge of his sexual escapades being recorded on videotape. Is it connected, and who is the culprit?","**Background**

Bob Crane (1928 - 1978) was an American actor best known for the starring role as the American Colonel Robert E Hogan, in *Hogan's Heroes*. a sitcom set in a German POW camp during WW2. It ran from 1965 to 1971 for 168 episodes, the longest broadcast run for an American television series inspired by WW2.

Bob Crane frequently videotaped and photographed his own sexual escapades. During the run of Hogan's Heroes, fellow *Hogan's Heroes* actor Richard Dawson introduced Crane to John Henry Carpenter, a regional sales manager for Sony Electronics, who often helped famous clients with their video equipment.

The two men struck up a friendship and began going to bars together. Crane attracted many women due to his celebrity status and introduced Carpenter to them as his manager. Later, Crane and Carpenter would videotape their joint sexual encounters.

While Crane's son, Robert, later insisted that all of the women were aware of the videotaping and consented to it, some, according to one source, had no idea that they had been recorded until informed by Scottsdale police after Crane's murder. 

Carpenter later became national sales manager at Akai, and arranged his business trips to coincide with Crane's dinner-theater touring schedule so that the two could continue videotaping women after Hogan's Heroes had run its course.

In June 1978, Crane was living in the Winfield Place Apartments in Scottsdale, Arizona, during a run of Beginner's Luck at the Windmill Dinner Theatre. On the afternoon of June 29, Crane's co-star Victoria Ann Berry entered his apartment after he failed to show up for a lunch meeting and discovered his body. Crane had been bludgeoned with a weapon that was never identified, though investigators at the time believed it to be a camera tripod. An electrical cord had been tied around his neck.

**The Investigation**

The Scottsdale Police Department, small in size at the time, had no homicide division, and was ill-equipped to handle such a high-profile murder investigation. 

The crime scene yielded few clues; no evidence of forced entry was found, and nothing of financial value was missing. Detectives examined Crane's extensive videotape collection, which led them to John Henry Carpenter, who had flown to Phoenix on June 25 to spend a few days with Crane. Carpenter's rental car was impounded and searched. Several blood smears were found that matched Crane's blood type; no one else known to have been in the car, including Carpenter, tested for that type. (DNA testing was not yet available.) With no other significant material evidence, the Maricopa County Attorney declined to file charges.

In 1990, Scottsdale Police Detective Barry Vassall and Maricopa County Attorney's Office Investigator Jim Raines, a former Phoenix homicide investigator, re-examined the evidence from 1978 and persuaded the county attorney to reopen the case. Although DNA testing of the blood found in Carpenter's rental car was inconclusive, Raines discovered an evidence photograph of the car's interior that appeared to show a piece of brain tissue. The actual tissue samples recovered from the car had been lost, but an Arizona judge ruled that the new evidence was admissible. In June 1992, Carpenter was arrested and charged with Crane's murder.

**EDIT: More crime scene info**

Found some more details of the crime scene, so I’m adding it in here. Found on John Hook’s website (The last link at the bottom)

To sum up. The medical examiner was pretty shoddy and contaminated the scene on site by shaving part of his head with a razor right on the bed he was found in to see the bludgeon sites and estimate what could have been used, instead of waiting for the next day to do a proper autopsy.

Crane died from two blows to the head. And then possibly had the electric cable tied around to quieten him as he died. He was asleep during the attack and likely died within two minutes of it.

A white flaky substance (thought to be semen) was noted to be on his pubic hair, right lower abdomen and right anterior thigh. Police theorised his killer might have have masturbated over him as a final insult, or it could’ve been Crane’s own. Regardless it was never collected and thus never tested.

**The Trial**

At the 1994 trial, Bob Crane's son, Robert, testified that in the weeks before his father's death, Crane had repeatedly expressed a desire to sever his friendship with Carpenter. He said Carpenter had become ""a hanger-on"" and ""a nuisance to the point of being obnoxious"". ""My dad expressed that he just didn't need Carpenter kind of hanging around him anymore,"" he said. He testified that Crane had called Carpenter the night before the murder and ended their friendship.

Carpenter's attorneys attacked the prosecution's case as circumstantial and inconclusive. They presented evidence, including witnesses from the restaurant where the two men had dined the evening before the murder, that Carpenter and Crane were still the best of friends. They noted that the murder weapon had never been identified or found; the prosecution's camera tripod theory was sheer speculation, based solely on Carpenter's occupation. They disputed the claim that the newly discovered evidence photo showed brain tissue, and presented many examples of ""sloppy work"" by police, such as the mishandling and misplacing of evidence—including the crucial tissue sample itself. 

They also pointed out that Crane had been videotaped and photographed in compromising sexual positions with numerous women, implying that any one of them, fearing blackmail, might have been the killer. Other potential suspects proposed by defense attorneys included angry husbands and boyfriends of the women, and an actor who had sworn vengeance after a violent argument with Crane in Texas several months earlier.

Carpenter was acquitted of the charge, and walked free. He continued to maintain his innocence until his death four years later, in 1998. 

After the trial, Crane's son, Robert, speculated publicly that his father's widow, Patricia Olson, might have had a role in instigating the crime. ""Nobody got a dime out of [the murder],"" he said, ""except for one person,"" alluding to Crane's will, which excluded him, his siblings, and his mother, with the entire estate left to Olson. Crane's son repeated his suspicions in a 2015 book, Crane: Sex, Celebrity, and My Father's Unsolved Murder. The case's prosecutor, Maricopa County District Attorney Rick Romley, responded, ""We never characterized Patty as a suspect,"" adding, ""I am convinced John Carpenter murdered Bob Crane."" Officially, Crane's murder remains unsolved.

**2016 DNA test**

In November 2016, the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office permitted Phoenix television reporter John Hook to submit the 1978 blood samples from Carpenter's rental car for retesting, using a more advanced DNA technique than the one used in 1990.

In a live television event, Hook announced that “the DNA found on the door of John Carpenter’s rental car is not… from Bob Crane,”

“The tests actually picked up two DNA profiles,” Hook said. “A major contributor is from a man, his identity is unknown. [The] second DNA profile is a partial profile too degraded to reach any conclusions.”

Crane, Jr., was surprised by the news — which further cleared Carpenter and added more mystery to the case. “I’m shocked right now,” he said during the live reveal.

“This is wonderful news for his family,” Carpenter’s attorney Steve Avilla said on the show of the DNA results. “This is wonderful news for John who has passed away to know that he has finally been vindicated, not only in a court of law but in a court of public opinion.”

**So, who did it?**

In total, the suspects seem to be

John Carpenter, the Police's main suspect. First acquitted in trial, and later the main evidence being dismissed via a DNA test. However, simply not having Crane's blood in his car certainly doesn't prove he definitely didn't do it. However it seems far less likely than previously believed, with the sum total of evidence against him amounting to the allegation that he and Crane had broken off their friendship, something others who saw them at the time dispute is even true.

The other suspects sadly have far less information or investigations into them. If they even have names to know.

Crane Jr has suspicions of Patricia Olson, stage name of Sigrid Valdis. Bob Crane's Widow who got everything in his will. Olson too was a star on *Hogan's Heroes*. She moved from the Los Angeles area soon after Crane was murdered. She passed away in 2007 at the age of 72. Crane Jr seems to believe she may have instigated the murder in some way to gain said inheritance.

The unnamed actor who supposedly swore vengeance against Crane... thats literally all we know. Who was he? Vengeance for what? Good questions. No answers that I can find.

Finally, either one of the many women he videotaped during his sexual escapades, or one of their husbands/boyfriends. Either from finding out about a covert taping session and being angry enough to kill, or from finding out their spouse had been cheating on them with Crane.

As further time passes. It doesn't seem likely we will ever get a real answer as to who murdered Bob Crane.

lisagreenhouse,2020-04-16 20:04:38+00:00,"He’s been a suspect in the disappearances of at least five girls, inserted himself into missing-persons investigations, and played mind games with victims’ families and police. Is Timothy Bindner a serial killer, or is he just a creep?"," **Who Is Timothy Bindner?**

Timothy Bindner was 43, married, and a working at a sewage treatment plant in 1991 when he first became known to law enforcement in California’s San Francisco Bay Area. While investigating the cases of several missing girls along the I-80 corridor, his name came up multiple times in conjunction with disturbing behaviors toward and regarding young girls.

Parents in the East Bay began reporting that Bindner was sending birthday cards, small gifts, and money to their young daughters, trying to strike up friendships with them. One mother gave police letters that Bindner had sent to her daughter; one was written backward so it could only be read when held up to a mirror, one contained small trinket gifts, and another contained a love poem and Bible verses with certain words underlined: “I have chosen you… be with me where I am.” When asked why he was contacting the girls, Bindner told investigators that he was being kind and that the girls were “lonely.”

During their research into Bindner, investigators discovered that in 1985 he was fired from his job as a Social Security claims processor after his boss caught him collecting the names, addresses, and birth dates of young girls in Colorado. He’d sent approximately 40 girls $50 on their 14th birthdays. When questioned, Bindner said he was mimicking a TV show in which a man surprised strangers with money, saying he thought it was “a touch of magic for the kids.” Parents complained and Bindner was fired. However, he was rehired 16 months later after an arbitrator found that he hadn’t used the records for personal gain and therefore there was no just cause in his firing.

Bindner drove a light-blue Dodge van with a vanity license plate reading “Lov You.” He’d wallpapered the inside of the van with pictures of children, Bible verse quotes, and crayon drawings. He was one arrested for trying to lure two young girls into his van, but the charges were ultimately dropped. His only other arrest and conviction was on a public drunkenness charge.

Bindner had a reputation for spending time in cemeteries and volunteering to repair gravestones, and he once had a job working in a crematorium.

Parents of missing girls reported that Bindner called or visited them to offer help in locating their children. The mothers of Amber Swartz-Garcia and Michaela Garecht (both still missing) have specifically mentioned his interference in their daughters’ cases, including searching on his own, visiting the families, and calling them repeatedly to offer his help. Bindner has downplayed the involvement, describing himself as a good Samaritan. However, families and law enforcement said that Bindner appeared to be playing mind games with them and that he seemed to enjoy taunting families into believing he was involved in their daughters’ abductions.

Angela Bugay was five years old in 1983 when she was abducted from Antioch, California. She was later found, sexually assaulted and strangled to death. Bindner repeatedly visited her grave, often late at night. He was said to have gone there more than 80 times to spend time and talk with her, and he was known to clean and decorate the grave. In an interview with a forensic psychologist, Bindner said that he liked that Angela’s photo was on her gravestone. “I fell in love with her,” he said. “You’re not supposed to be in love with a dead girl.” Investigators never considered Bindner a suspect in her murder; Angela’s mother’s ex-boyfriend was found guilty using DNA evidence. However, some investigators believe that Angela’s abduction and murder could have triggered Bindner. Days after Amber Swartz-Garcia disappeared, Bindner visited Angela’s gravesite, “kissed the gravestone and simulated a sex act,” according to FBI surveillance. Sources also say that search dogs either traced the scents of Amber Swartz-Garcia (disappeared June 1988) and Amanda “Nikki” Cambell (disappeared December 1991), to or indicated their scents at Angela’s grave. Bindner is considered a suspect in both of their disappearances.

At one point, Bindner invited Linda Golston, a reporter for the San Jose Mercury News, to interview him. He set the time and place for the interview—at 4:30 a.m. at the Oakmont Cemetery, where Angela Bugay was buried. During the interview, Golston said Bindner asked to play his favorite song for her—“Jesus, Here’s Another Child to Hold.” He said he thought of the missing girls as his children. He also offered specifics about how he thought the girls reacted when abducted, outlining that one was submissive while the other fought back, but he claimed that he was just guessing about their reactions. Golston also said that “He had convinced himself that he was rescuing these girls and he was delivering them to Jesus.”

In 1988 Bindner wrote a letter to police saying that he thought the next girl who disappeared would be nine years old. Nine-year-old Michaela Garecht disappeared shortly after the letter arrived. He also sent an FBI profiler a Christmas card with an image of a little girl holding up four fingers. Four-year-old Amanda “Nikki” Campbell disappeared soon after, on December 27, 1991.

He also gave police tips and offered them what he considered his special expertise in crimes against children. This included theorizing who may have taken them, why and how they were taken, and what happened to them. At least once he suggested that the killer may have disposed of the girls’ bodies in open graves at Oakmont Cemetery (the cemetery Angela Bugay is buried). His home was searched by police in late 1992, but nothing of interest was reported to have been found.

After the 1989 San Francisco earthquake, the California State Patrol gave Bindner a heroism award for assisting earthquake victims. Defenders say that this is proof that Bindner is simply a helpful guy.

In 1998, Bindner was featured in the book *Stalemate* by John Philpin, a forensic psychologist, which detailed Bindner’s strange behavior and the ways he inserted himself into the searches for missing girls and their families’ lives. Philpin says that Bindner willingly spoke with him for “hundreds of hours.”

In a strange twist, a man who was convicted of killing his teenage son in 2009 asked for a new trial because Timothy Bindner was a juror on his case and, according to the man’s lawyers, misrepresented himself in order to be on the jury. Prosecutors argued the guilty verdict should stand because Bindner was required to reveal that he was a person of interest in multiple crimes. One disturbing item from his time on the jury is a statement that while discussing the crime the man on trial for, Bindner gave a long explanation of choking someone and how long it would take to choke a person to death; he said that he knew the information because he’d been choked himself.

A news article covering the request for a new trial stated that Bindner was at the time 61 and living in San Pablo. It also mentioned that he’d previously been removed from a jury in the murder trial of a 17-year-old accused of killing a woman. The article also noted that he was never arrested or charged but had been nationally recognized as a suspect even though he had always maintained his innocence in the cases. In fact, he’d repeatedly said that he’d never harmed or even met any of the missing girls; he was simply “deeply affected when he heard of their disappearances and wanted to do anything he could to help.”

&amp;#x200B;

**Potential Victims**

**Amber Swartz-Garcia**, 7, disappeared from her front yard around 4:30 p.m. on June 3, 1988. She had been playing unattended for about 15 minutes; when her mother checked on her, she was gone. She was playing with an adult-sized leather jump rope with wooden handles that has never been located. The day after her disappearance, investigators found a pair of pink socks near a baseball diamond by the creek behind her home. The socks were found in an area that had already been searched, so investigators believe they were left there after the initial search.

The day after she was last seen, a witness claimed to have seen a white man throwing a girl that matched Amber’s description into a tan four-door car. Investigators have never been able to verify that the girl was Amber. In 1991, three years after Amber’s disappearance, a man claimed to have witnessed a bearded man force a girl into a vehicle on the day Amber disappeared. He believed the girl matched Amber’s description. Investigators said Bindner did not have a beard at the time, and they traced the reported vehicle’s license plate to an impound lot in Los Angeles. They have never said whether the child seen that day was Amber or if the vehicle is related to her case.

Bindner has been accused of being “obsessed” with Amber’s disappearance. Three days after Amber disappeared, he approached her mother, Kim, and told her that he’d been searching for her daughter. In one interview, Kim quoted Bindner as saying, “I wanted to be the one to save her. I wanted to be the one to bring her home to you.” Kim reported the contact, and investigators believed that Bindner looked like the man reported to have been seen throwing a girl into a vehicle on the day Amber went missing. Investigators asked Kim to befriend with Bindner in hopes of discovering whether he was involved in Amber’s disappearance or those of other missing children. Nothing definitive was discovered, but Bindner reportedly continued to contact Kim for years, offering his help searching for Amber.

Scent dogs traced or found Amber’s scent to/at the grave of Angela Bugay, a place Bindner was known to frequent. Investigators have never had enough information to prove Bindner was involved in Amber’s disappearance, but it is believed that he remains a suspect. The FBI extensively questioned Bindner after Amber’s abduction, including polygraph testing that was inconclusive (disclaimer that polygraph testing is not considered reliable).

In 2009, investigators said Curtis Dean Anderson, a convicted pedophile, was responsible for Amber’s kidnapping and murder. Anderson confessed in 2007 while already in prison and a month before his death. He claimed to have taken her to Arizona, murdered her, and left her body beside a highway. However, her remains have never been located, and Anderson was known to have confessed to many other crimes. He signed a statement in Amber’s case and police say they were unable to refute it, but many people, including Amber’s mother, are skeptical of Anderson’s confession.

**Michaela Garecht**, 9, was abducted from a parking lot in Hayward, California, on November 19, 1988. She and a friend had ridden scooters to the store to buy candy. Upon leaving, Michaela noticed that her friend’s scooter had been moved. When she went to get the scooter, an unknown white male forced her into a vehicle and drove away. Her friend reported the kidnapping right away, but the vehicle, the perpetrator, and Michaela were never located. Investigators have said that Bindner had a possible connection to her case, but no further information was ever given.

**Ilene Misheloff**, 13, disappeared while walking home from school in Dublin, California, on January 30, 1989. Classmates saw her taking a shortcut through John Mape Park along a dry creek bed. She was carrying a dark blue backpack and a black plastic flute case. After her disappearance, the backpack was found in the creek bed in an area that had already been searched. Investigators believe it was placed there after the search.

**Tara Cossey**, 12, walked to the store to buy a bag of sugar for her mother in San Pablo, California, on June 6, 1979. She was last seen inside the shopping center and never returned home. Investigators have said that Bindner had a possible connection to her case, but no further information was ever given.

**Amanda “Nikki” Campbell**, 4, was last seen near her home in Fairfield, California, on December 27, 1991 between 4:30 and 5 p.m. She had been playing at a friend’s house four doors down from her own home and left to ride her bike around the corner to a different friend’s house. Her brother and a friend were outside and saw her bike away. Her bike was found that evening, abandoned a few blocks from her home. Authorities searched the area but were unable to find anything other than a pair of blue children’s socks; however, they could not be confirmed to be Nikki’s. 

Scent dogs traced Nikki down the street where she was last seen, through a drive-through at a local fast food restaurant, and then to the westbound I-80 onramp. Investigators believed she was pulled into a vehicle and taken. Search dogs also either traced Nikki’s scent to or indicated upon her scent at the grave of Angela Bugay, a place Bindner was known to visit. However, investigators have never had enough information to prove Bindner was involved, but it is believed that he remains a suspect. Investigators publicly named Bindner as a suspect. In 1997, Bindner won a $90,000 defamation suit against the city of Fairfield, claiming that they’d harassed him and ruined his reputation.

&amp;#x200B;

\*It is important to note that Bindner is not the only suspect in these and other local disappearances of young girls. Several others are also suspects in many of these cases, including convicted rapists and murderers and child predators like James Daveggio and Michelle Michaud, Phillip and Nancy Garrido, Wesley Shermantine an Loren Herzog (the “Speed Freak Killers”).

&amp;#x200B;

**Theories and Discussion**

While there was never enough evidence against Bindner for his arrest, there are a lot of creepy details and actions that make him look guilty. It seems that police were never able to conclusively rule him in or out with the actual evidence available despite seriously investigating him for years and in connection to several crimes. In one article, John Philpin, the criminal psychologist who interviewed and researched Bindner for his book *Stalemate*, said, “This kind of accumulation of coincidence is not anything that I've ever encountered in 25 years of investigative work.”

There’s a lot about Bindner that is unsettling at best. The description of his van is disturbing, as is his obsession with Angela Bugay and her death. Writing letters to children he didn’t know and sending them money is strange behavior, and the way he inserted himself into investigations and sought out interactions with missing girls’ families is something other known killers have done. His jobs, including working at a crematorium and sewage treatment plant, also could have given him access to locations that would have easily allowed him dispose of remains.

It’s clear that someone or someones were kidnapping little girls in the area where Bindner lived in the late 1970s through early 1990s. While multiple other individuals have been arrested and found guilty of similar crimes and some disappearances have been solved, there are also many unsolved cases and girls who remain missing.

It’s possible Bindner is responsible for the disappearances of these girls and potentially others. Then again, it’s also possible that he’s psychologically off and simply has too much of a fascination with missing children. Those of us on this sub share an interest in unsolved crimes, missing people, and similar happenings, and there are individuals here and on other true crime subs that get over-involved and too passionate about certain cases (I’m specifically thinking of people who get overly passionate about learning personal details about recently identified individuals like Buckskin Girl/Marcia King or Lyle Stevik, demanding information and harassing their families and investigators). Is it possible that Bindner is simply too fixated on missing children and really does just want to help find them? Or is there a darker truth?

Let’s discuss.

Worchester_St,2019-10-22 16:05:14+00:00,I’ve Been Flying for almost Thirty Hours and The Flight Attendants Won’t Stop Crying,"Thirty hours ago I hopped on a late-night flight from New York heading to Los Angeles. After boarding I saw that I had an entire row to myself. Take off passed without incident, and soon I was stretched out for a nap across the row. 

I slept for a few hours, I don’t know how long, but I woke up to some severe turbulence. It’s possible that the lights in the cabin went out for a moment, but I was so disoriented that it’s hard to say.

I checked my phone to see that it was 4:03 AM, which I figured gave me about an hour until we landed. When I looked out my window, I was shocked to see nothing but wide open ocean. My jaw dropped; there’s obviously no ocean between New York and Los Angeles. 

I hit the button to call the flight attendant and spent the next few minutes wracking my brain for a lake that could’ve been possibly been big enough to explain what I was seeing. I jumped when the attendant flipped off the light. She was grinning from ear to ear, and tears were pouring down her cheeks.

“How can I help you sir?” she asked. 

“I froze for a moment at her reaction before deciding to just ask my question. “Where are we? Why does it look like we’re flying over an ocean?”

She wiped her cheeks to clear the tears, still grinning wildly. “Sir, we’ll be landing in about an hour.”

“I, uh, OK, thank you,” I said.

After she left I checked the clock on my phone again. 4:03 AM blinked back at me.

It hadn’t changed. 

I had to have been waiting with my call light on for at least five minutes. How was it possible that it hadn’t changed at all?  

I opened up my laptop and saw it too displayed 4:03 AM. I pulled out my phone, started a stopwatch in the app, and spent the next two hours looking back and forth between the clocks, waiting for them to change.

They never did.

I tapped the shoulder of an older woman sitting in the row ahead of me. She looked back, an annoyed expression across her face. “Yes?” she asked. 

“Do you know how long until we land?” I asked.

She narrowed her eyes. “That flight attendant said it would be about another hour.”

I shook my head in confusion. “That flight attendant? We talked almost two hours ago! We should’ve landed already.”

She stared at me as if I was crazy. I was going to continue trying to convince her, but I felt a hand on my shoulder. I spun to see a male flight attendant grinning down at me, tears pinging off his cheeks onto my shoulder. 

“Sir, I’m going to ask you to calm down, or I’ll be calling the Captain.”

I told him that wouldn’t be necessary and sat back. He removed his hand and stepped away. 

The flight attendants continued to stop by every few hours offering meals. My stopwatch continued to tick up and is now telling me that I’ve been on this plane for more than thirty hours. 

I’ve explored all of coach and tried talking to some of the other passengers, but they’ve all told me that they’re expecting to land in an hour or so. 

Around three hours ago I tried getting into first class. I made it past the curtain but was escorted back by two grinning flight attendants. Their grip on my arms were like iron. 

“Sir, the seatbelt sign is on,” one said. “Please remain in your seat with your buckle fastened. We’ll be landing in about an hour.”

I’d just about given up hope when a woman came down the aisle dressed in a business suit. She didn’t look at me or slow down, but she dropped a piece of paper onto my tray as she made her way to the bathrooms at the back of the plane. 

I shot a look around before unrolling it. 

It said, “Are you stuck too?”

I pulled out a pen and wrote “Yes. It’s been thirty hours.”

I folded the scrap of paper up and set it on the tray closest to the aisle. She left the bathroom and picked it up as she passed. 

It’s been twenty minutes since then. I don’t know why, but I don’t think the flight attendants would like it if they knew we were talking. It doesn’t matter. I have to do *something*. I’ll update you all with whatever happens next.

lackadaisicalAuthor,2019-10-18 22:14:55+00:00,I know why 95% of the ocean remains unexplored,"For as long as I can remember my father would take me out on his sailboat. No matter how much my Mom would object to the idea my father always prevailed and had me out on the boat with him practically every evening. It was the most peaceful way to spend my days after school as I grew older. I would sit on the deck completing my mundane homework as the blood orange sun set miles off in the westward coast. I will miss those evenings spent with my father, but after what happened, nothing can get me back into the ocean for all the money in the world.

What happened went against everything I had been taught in school and even by my own Father, the master of the seas in my eyes. My father had taught me to respect the ocean and all of its inhabitants. So, if we ever chose to fish out on his boat we would only catch enough to eat for the day, and would always respect the governing laws. Needless to say we were both advocates to end the whaling epidemic that was occurring in the Pacific Ocean. Whales are a crucial aspect to the oceans ecosystem and without them many species would go extinct as a result. I remember when my father brought me up close to a pack of blue whales one day during their great migration.  He lent me his scuba gear and I felt an extreme rush as I entered the cool blue water. Their elegant calls could be heard thousands of feet away, like a siren in the night. I was mesmerized by the blue whales as they came into my sight. The three calves swam in front of what I assumed to be the mother. The calves passed by me first with speed I did not expect. Then the mother, calmly swam below me. It seemed as if she was completely conscious of my presence in the water and although she could have swam right through, she chose to move out of her way. Hell, people in the streets of Los Angeles aren’t even that graceful. People will run into me countless times without even a slight glance up from their cell phones. I resurfaced from the water after witnessing the more graceful mammal and shared my adoration with my Dad.

Over the next few years my love for not only the whales but the ocean in general grew immensely. My dad and I would happily sacrifice our Saturdays for beach clean-up days, and even occasionally attend the nearest anti-whaling protest in the area. Even when school got more time consuming as I entered into high school, my father and I would still find time to go out every Sunday evening and watch the sunset on his boat. The bonding spent is something I don’t regret, however, I do wish we could have gotten involved in a different hobby.

It was a typical Sunday evening, the sun had just reached the horizon, and God had painted the 6 O’clock sky with a variety of orange and red pastels. I finished up writing down a few answers to my math assignment in my notebook when my father called me over. His fishing line was tight and his pole was nearly bent in a complete u-shape.

“Give me a hand will you boy. Grab onto my waist.” He said. I eagerly closed my notebook and ran behind his body, and placed my hands onto his hips.

“You think you can pull this up without throwing out your back?” I said. He breathed heavily as his hands pulled him forward causing his back to arch.

“That’s what I got you here for jackass.” He said back to me. This was the tongue and cheek way we had recently started talking to each other once I had entered into the manhood that was high school. 

“I see it coming up, that’s a huge catch Dad, let me get the knife!” as I let go of his hips he shuffled forward a few steps before catching his balance. I eagerly opened the tackle box and grabbed out the first knife I could find to cut the line.

“Oh Jesus Christ!” He exclaimed. He reluctantly turned inward to show me what he had caught. His hook was in the center of a Dolphins blow hole. A chunk of flesh about the size of my own chest surrounded the hook. I dropped the knife in horror.

“You think a shark did that?” I questioned rhetorically. We both knew that sharks aren’t fast enough to catch dolphins and the bite marks weren’t jagged like it would be from a sharks bite. Instead the flesh was cut off by pure blunt force. 

“This has to be the work of some poachers.” My father said with a disappointed tone. “Get my camera, let’s take pictures for evidence.” He continued. I walked around the fallen knife and returned to the tackle box. I opened the top and grabbed his waterproof camera.

“Why would they cut the blow hole off though? That doesn’t make sense.” I said as the camera flashed a picture of the decaying meat. The putrid stench polluted the air as my Dad ran his hands through his hair in bewilderment. “Maybe I should dive down quick and see if there’s anything else?”

“It’s getting dark and that water is likely chummed up. Which means that sharks will be in the area.” He objected to my notion, however did not stop me from strapping the scuba gear to my back. I assumed he did want me to go look down there, but felt as if he had to be a responsible parent.

“Well if it was poachers it means they most likely kept a majority of the meat and probably left on a load motor boat. That would scare off any shark, especially for such little meat.” I said to him and walked closer to the edge of the boat, half expecting him to try and stop me.

“That’s a good point, just make sure to be quick and don’t tell your mom about this” he said. I fell back from the side of the boat and went into the cold water. The little light from the sunlight could barely penetrate a few feet below the ocean surface and I was soon surrounded in darkness. It was early quiet as bubbles flowed to the surface from my respirator. I span in a circle to look for any reminisce of that dolphin but could not see anything through the black water. I decided to take a picture to use the flash as a light. The camera went off lighting up the water for a moment. I was still alone. Then, the siren call I heard years ago returned from behind me. I span around and flashed the camera again. This time I saw the side of a grey shark. I began to swim up quickly, attempting to not make too much noise as I heard the whale call out again. The call was significantly louder, indicating to me that the whale was coming up fast.

I entered the sparse light as I reached near the surface. I glanced down in horror to see the shark swimming up towards me. I kicked up like a helpless seal knowing that I would not be able to escape the apex predator when suddenly an extreme force of water pushed me to the side. I looked back down to see a blue whale carrying the great white off into the depths of the ocean. Blood flowed from the whale’s mouth and up to the surface as it descended into darkness. I resurfaced and saw my dad leaning over the boat screaming in a panic.

“Son, get the hell out of the water! There’s a shark in there!” He shouted out. I swam to the side of the boat and grabbed onto the ladder that hang down. He pulled me over the side and hugged me tighter than a bear climbing a tree for honey. 

“I’m fine Dad” I chuckled out.

“Jesus I saw that shark fin then blood starting coming up to the surface. I got so worried, what the hell happened.” He cried out while letting me out of his grasp.

“Well that shark you saw was headed right for me, but then it was eaten by a whale.” I said while taking the oxygen tank off my back.

“Are you sure? Whales don’t eat sharks.” He stood back allowing me to take off the remaining gear I had. Then his face turned a ghostly white. Within a matter of seconds I smelled the putrid odor of fish guts as bits and pieces of shark skin and blood rained down from the sky. I turned in horror to see the whale at the surface excreting parts of chopped up shark from its bloodied blow hole. “We got to get the fuck out of here.” My father said.

I stood in fear as my dad kicked on the engine to the sailboat so we could get out quickly. Unfortunately the motor wasn’t fast enough. The wale breached from the water and crashed down onto our sailboat. Half of its body in the water, and the other half laying on the deck of our small boat. The front end of our now immensely small boat shot into the air as I held onto the mast. I saw my father fall backwards down onto the whale’s bloodied teeth. My dad laid between the whales tooth and lip. His body hanging out as the whale’s tongue left its mouth, tasting my Dad’s flesh. I looked up in a panic and saw the tackle box sliding down toward me. In a moment I grabbed onto the tackle box and pulled out the small revolver my dad had. I had never fired a gun before, but had seen my dad do it a few times for practice. I thought he was crazy for keeping a gun on board to protect against “pirates” but I was glad he did. I pulled the hammer back and aimed it at the whale as it began to curl its tongue around my dad. I saw the oxygen tank had slid down conveniently to rest right by the whale’s red pupil eye. I gripped the gun so hard I thought the handle would turn to dust in my palms. I aimed carefully at the yellow tank and pulled the trigger. The tank exploded ripping off large chunks of the whales face, but not before it took a bite out of my Dad’s legs. He flew away from the whale’s stained red tongue and the beast retreated back into the ocean allowing our boat to return back to the surface.

The boat was critically damaged, needless to say, but luckily my Dad made it out alive. The whale took his legs, and the blast has left his face permanently scarred, but he thanks me every day for my bravery. Over the past few months I have tried to figure out what this whale was. I’ve written to marine biologists at my local college who either ignore my emails or think I’m an immature kid in the search of cheap thrills. Regardless if anyone believes me or not, I know what I saw. I also know that over 95% of the ocean has yet to be discovered which means there must be more creatures like this lurking in the depths, waiting to be found.",nosleep,1659

TD:LR at bottom. (But this shit is a rollercoaster so buckle the fuck up)



Little bit of pre information. 

I’m 17 and I’ve had to work my ass off for everything I have. I’ve had to prove to myself and my father and step mother that I want the things I’m striving for in life. (Lost forty pounds and going strong). So I know what trials and difficult parts of life are. I also know that the determination to be better than your parents is a thing. 

Now. Information on my father. 
He’s never been physically abusive or anything else. He spanked me as a child when I fucked up horribly but never took it too far and took things away etc. But that’s just normal parenting. It taught me not to do things. (And I STILL ended up doing stupid shit sometimes. Because I’m a dumbass). Anyways I love my father and he is not the reason for this post. 

Step mother- she’s overprotective and hardheaded but she cares and she tries her best for my sister and I. She’s called me names before but stopped a while ago after I had a long and serious fucking talk with my father and her about how it’s fucking with head. And she has stopped since then. 

Now. The real insane parent

My mother- Everything started when my father and mother got married. She was verbally and mentally abusive to him but he didn’t see it. Then my parents had me. My father then went on a long deployment right after my mother had my sister. (Ten months after I was born.) when my sister was born she falsely and purposely faked a medical problem with my sister and stuck her fingers down her throat. Choking her and making the doctors resuscitate my sister because she was going into some kind of medical breakdown and might have died. She was NEVER CHARGED even though there’s PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE. when my father came back he had already found out about all of this because of letters from the hospital. (He was oversees at the time) when he finally came back, the house was a disgusting disaster. She bought several animals and didn’t take care of them. Had forged my father’s name on a car document and purchased it without him knowing. 

He divorced her. 

Should have been easy to get custody of my sister and I because she was so unhinged right? 

Wrong. 

My father and mother took it to court like usual. But we got the worst judge in the state of California. Her nickname was the devil judge because she always sided with the mother. No matter how bad the mother was. My mother did not get full custody of us. HOWEVER. she was allowed a phone call every evening to us at 7 pm  and visitation on the weekends with a monitor. (My grandmother was required to stay with us at all times to make sure we were safe)  she took him to court about two times a month, (sometimes more) and attempted to rob him of every penny he had. She played mental games with my sister and I. Telling us what a bad person my father was and how he was trying to keep us from her. (Let me clarify, he didn’t want us to see her that’s true. But he never prevented us from calling her. Or going to see her. It was our choice. And I’ve never heard him talk bad about her once in front of us until my sister and I made the decision to tell her to fuck off. He showed us the court hearings and all the evidence of her wrongdoings. But he never told us to stop talking or seeing our mother) 

About five years ago my father moved us all across the country because he found a new job. (His commute every day was 90 miles one way from Yucaipa CA to Los Angeles CA. ) so we moved to the Midwest. About three years ago my mother attempted one last time to get at my sister and I and claimed to the California court system that my sister and I were “kidnapped by our father” (no this is not a fucking joke) but luckily the judge who ruled over our hearings had finally retired and she (fortunately for my sister and I) was told by the California court system that 

A) the rightful guardian and parent of the children cannot kidnap their children. It’s their choice where they want to go and
B) the California court system no longer has jurisdiction over this case because we lived in Ohio. But she could move the case to Ohio and try there. 

Naturally she didn’t even try. There was no point because Ohio courts would see her bullshit for what it was. 

Bullshit. 

Now my sister and I love in Ohio peacefully and happily with our (step)mother, though I consider her my actual mother because she in all senses raised my sister and I, and my father. My life is starting to kick off (now that I’ve graduated) and my sister is almost done with school. I’ve bought my own gaming systems and my phone and I’m able to drive. Life couldn’t be better. 

TD:LR My mother was abusive and had  munchausen by proxy and tried to hurt my sister as a baby to get her medical attention (even though she didn’t need it) and proceeded to mentally abuse my sister and I, forged my fathers name on car and loan documents,and take my father to court every two weeks just so she could keep him drained. We moved away and now we are happy.

baldricshyer,2019-10-13 18:19:59+00:00,"People on r/progresspics wanted to know how I lost 112 pounds, so here’s a detailed post about how I did it.","I’m this guy https://m.imgur.com/a/ziss17e from r/progresspics. You can’t make text posts there, so I came here.

[This is my original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics/comments/dflrui/m33510_275_163_112_lbs_told_me_i_have_to_start/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

People were awesome and wanted to know in detail what I did to lose all the weight. So here, in way too many words, is what I did. I hope you can find something to help you with your goals.

**A year ago, things were bad.** I was in an unhealthy relationship with my ex and more importantly, a toxic relationship with myself.

I knew I needed a change from everything. So what did I do?

I moved to Vietnam.

The first couple months there were rough. I was still trying to clear a lot of mental clutter. It also didn’t help that I got into a motorbike accident and shattered my kneecap. It seemed my big weight loss goals would once again be put on hold. I’m sure you know how that is. You’re eating healthy leading up to your vacation so you can eat all the bad food you want when you’re there. And then when you come back home you’re still eating all the bad food. Or you’re trying to lose weight and then something happens like an injury and you wonder why you’re even trying in the first place.

So I decided to take a look at that. Why was I trying to lose weight? Three other times I had lost over 100 pounds, only to gain it all back every time. Maybe I WAS the overweight guy. Was it time to embrace that?

***(Yes — I’ve gained and lost over 100 pounds four times in the last ten years. This post only details the 112 pounds I lost in the last ten months, hopefully the last time I’ll do that to myself.)***

Since Vietnam had all the snacks and delicious food, it was sure looking like I was embracing being the overweight guy. And in a very accepting country like Vietnam, I didn’t feel bad about that. People liked me. Yes, I know it was mostly because I’m a white American male, but it made me feel good. It gave me the smallest boost of confidence, which was entirely depleted at that time. I only highlight this because you never know the impact of your kindness on strangers.

So after I started realizing, *“Hey, you know what? I’m not that bad!”* and after I had tried every new snack at least once, the only thing left to do was eat healthy.

Or at least healthier. Which for such an overweight guy wasn’t that hard. In Los Angeles, part of my weight gain could be entirely contributed to eating a gallon of cookie dough ice cream EVERY night. In Vietnam, ice cream like that is super expensive. So when I’d want ice cream in Vietnam I’d have to go get a chocolate-dipped cone from KFC. Also delicious, but MUCH smaller and WAY LESS calories than a whole gallon of ice cream. Even when I’d go to KFC three times a day for these treats, I was still consuming less calories that I was in LA.

And when that happens — even small changes like that — you WILL lose weight. I did.

**At first, what worked for me was the thought of just eating like a regular person.**

Who was a regular person to me? Just a typical 200 pound dude. (I’m not trying to fat-shame or debate what it means to be a “regular” person. But I was clearly eating for three or four people, not one.)

Egg baguettes (banh mi trung op las) and tuna sandwiches with extra mayo and white bread and no tuna don’t seem like the healthiest food. But they were “real” food and they were a start. Because I was so heavy, you’re damn right I started losing weight like that.

For at least the first three months, my diet was relatively the same every day. Although, I’d experiment and try new Vietnamese food any chance I got. But even then, I don’t think anything was loaded with calories like it would be here in the US. Also, it’s what I considered “real” food. Not junk food like ice cream or chocolate. So at the end of the day even if I was making a choice between real food and junk food, I was winning. And I’d still be losing weight. 

So right of the bat I lost a significant amount of weight without even managing my diet. I just started easy, eating a little better than I had before.

Somewhere along the way I got into nature’s energy bar, bananas. I’d pop a few of these a day when I wanted a snack. They even lost me my phone.

Saigon had a great banana shortage during their new year holiday called Tet and on my journey to find just one single banana somewhere in the city and going to well over fifty stores, I got my phone snatched by motorbike thieves.

I still love you bananas.

Then one day I heard white rice is good for you on a podcast. So I switched from bread to white rice and would have Tuna Onigiris. And I stopped eating egg baguettes, cutting out bready carbs. I just felt like my body didn’t need those anymore.

I still allowed myself to try whatever I wanted. But without realizing it, I was slowly changing my relationship with food entirely.

I also realized that I was, in fact, **emotionally eating.**

I’d known that I’d eat when I was happy (*I deserve this snack!*) or sad (*this donut will make me feel better*) — but I had an epiphany:

Boredom is an emotion.

How many times are you eating just because you’re bored? Before making the connection that boredom was an emotion, I didn’t think I was an emotional eater. But wow. Most every time I’m eating is connected to an emotion, and not because my body actually needed food.

So anytime I felt the urge to eat something, I questioned myself. **Why do I want to eat right now?**

Was it because I was actually hungry and my body needed fuel? Or was it because I was bored? Or sad? Or happy?

And if it was emotionally based, I wouldn’t let myself eat. I’d start chugging a soda water instead. The bubbles give me life. I would pretty much only drink soda water and Vietnamese iced coffees, with extra condensed milk.

But as you’re beginning to see, a lot of my gains came from inside my own mind.

**What were my workouts like?**

I started with walks and podcasts. Exercising while feeding my mind, not my stomach.

When the weight melted off I automatically felt strong and FELT like I wanted to lift some weights. It wasn’t a thing that I was being forced to do. It was something that naturally became something my body wanted to do.

Even for lifting at the gym, I tried to be as easy as possible. 5x5. Strong guy. Whatever that’s called. That was pretty easy to do, so I’d feel good about doing it. And then since I was already at the gym, I’d be more likely to do more. But usually my routine consisted of only thirty minute workouts.

Then around 215 I started playing basketball again. Which was something.

Here’s another wrinkle in my story — 

I was coming off tearing my plantar fascia.

And then when I moved to Vietnam I got into a motorbike accident and broke my kneecap.
So me being 215 and playing basketball filled me with so much gratitude. A year earlier I could barely walk and was overweight. And now I could run up and down the court, albeit slowly. And I sucked at basketball. I could only focus on offense or defense. One at a time per game. And usually defense, because nobody wants to play defense.

But it was fun.

And that kept me going.

If a tree falls in the woods and no one’s around to hear it, does it fall? If an intense workout is fun, is it still an intense workout?

Lightly lifting weights and playing basketball, combined with eating decently dropped me to 200.

I thought I was done. I felt great. I thought I looked great.

But I just kept going living this newly acquired healthy lifestyle.

**I started intermittent fasting around 200 pounds.**

I listen to podcasts voraciously, so I’ve been well-aware of fasting for quite some time. It seems all the most successful people on the planet participate in some sort of fast. But it wasn’t until I befriended a French traveler in Bangkok for Songkran that I decided to really give it a try. He was the first person I met in the wild who was actually fasting. Weight loss benefits aside, I asked him how it made him FEEL. He said great and that answer convinced me to give it a try.

Fasting had also been on my mind because I thought it’d be easy for me. I never had an appetite when I woke up in the morning, so waiting four hours to eat something was not a big deal. And something I often did anyway. Hell, sometimes I wouldn’t eat all day and then after my serving shift gorge on all the food. So basically I had been an OMAD faster without realizing it. And without realizing that 5000 calories was not the proper way to eat one meal a day.
It took another month to really convince myself. I was afraid of getting headaches, mostly. So I decided to take it slow. I’d eat anything I’d want, during certain 4-8 windows. I was also going to be in Singapore. Have you ever had Indian paratha and chicken curry? The most delicious meal on the planet. But since I knew I was having  bread, I decided to go one meal a day as I walked around Singapore. Around 6, I would feast on two parathas and a heaping bowl of chicken curry. By the time I got back to Vietnam I was a fasting pro.

I had started playing basketball at this time two or three times a week. We’d play from 8-10 at night so I had to plan my fasts around that. Playing basketball in Vietnam is like playing on a professional NBA length court if it were also in a sauna. After those two hours, you’d probably had guessed I jumped in a pool with all my clothes on, not just finished playing pickup basketball.

(They were very organized about their basketball games. Games up to 15 by 1s and 2s, or 12 minutes per game. In those two hours, we’d play 5 games. So exactly an hour of basketball workout. Combined with the sauna aspect, I’m sure I was burning loads of calories.)

There were some nights after basketball that I’d get Vietnamese McDonalds at midnight because it was open and I knew my body needed the calories. What a switch from knowing my body definitely did NOT need calories from another midnight McDonald’s run, but doing it anyway.

When I knew I’d be getting late-night McDonalds, I’d still be fasting. I wouldn’t have eaten until 4pm that day. And if I ended eating around midnight, that means I couldn’t eat until 4 the next day. But that next day would only be a 4 hour window so the NEXT day I could be back in a 12-8 fast. (In a span of three days: 16:8 - 20:4 - 16:8.)

So the beginning of May 2019 is when I started fasting. I was hovering around 200 pounds. Plateaued. Fasting helped me pretty quickly get down to 182.

Which I thought was great.

And from there I just kept on doing it because I felt great. Fasting had truly become a lifestyle.

Now? I’m 163 pounds and more importantly — maintaining.

**What do my days look like now?**

I’m back in Los Angeles.

I still walk at least thirty minutes a day. I don’t even force myself to do it. I enjoy it, and I genuinely look forward to it every day as a treat. And that’s a complete mindset shift.

I play basketball and boulder three times a week. These are high intensity workouts and guess what? I never feel like I’m working out, because they’re fun.

I lift weights once or twice a week, usually after a basketball or bouldering session. And the exercises I do are geared towards become a better climber.

I write a lot. Usually my walks are to Starbucks, where I indulge in a Trenta Berry Hibiscus, followed by a Trenta Cold Brew in which I put french vanilla creamer. And yes, I carry around vanilla creamer.

I go through ten cans of soda water a day. I LOVE soda water. The bubbles are so refreshing. I used to love Coke. And Sprite when I quit that. And then I discovered I got the same satisfaction from soda water because it was always about the bubbles. The more carbonation the better. Kroger brand Lemon-Lime for the win. (And I’ve tried them all.)

My lifestyle is about getting everything I really want and cutting everything else out. To get to this point I had to be really honest with what I really wanted. And I’m still figuring that out.

I still fast. Usually I eat from 12pm to 8pm.

I eat too many ThinkThin bars. Brownie crunch, to be exact. These taste like candy bars and have a low GI, so they help cravings. Although, I’m in the process of cutting these out for real food. I like the convenience of bars. I’m trying to substitute hard boiled eggs for these bars.
I eat one or two bananas a day.

And then the rest of my diet is largely based around what’s on sale at Ralph’s. I’m a big sale guy. And a big convenience guy. So I often find snack packs of cheese, fruit, and nuts 50% off. I also find salad bags or sautéed veggie bags for 75% off. I get a lot of those and then add in some sort of meat, like tuna, chicken, or salmon depending on — you guessed it! — what’s on sale.

I don’t eat many processed carbs at all right now. But if I was given some bread I’d eat it. I just don’t crave it anymore.

More importantly, **I promise you I eat whatever I want.** But since my relationship with food has changed, so has my appetite and cravings. I got hummus the other week because it was on sale. But then I needed something to dip in the hummus. I was thinking I should go with a veggie because I love veggies now, and green beans happened to be on sale. So, for the next week my snack was dipping raw green beans in hummus and it was delicious. I’d actually crave it. Also, when your body is using food properly as fuel, a little bit of food goes a long way.
I’ve never been into nuts, but now I love almonds and even a few of those give me such energy. It’s amazing.

I had free Pizza Hut last week because the Chargers made an interception. And you better believe I tried the new Cheese-It thing. But I also shared and didn’t eat the whole thing. I try to have an abundance mentality now. I don’t need to eat all of something right now. It’s not now or never. If I want more, I can always get it again.

**This is what I ate for lunch today:**

https://m.imgur.com/gallery/51CGUPo

Told you I eat what’s on sale haha.

**Key takeaways and general thoughts:**

**80-20 principle.** 

Apply this to your life to figure out what you really want. And then to figure out what is holding you back. If you’re like me — and I bet a lot of you are — it’s our weight that holds us down. Literally. So if we dedicate complete focus to that and make it a priority, EVERYTHING else in our lives will get better. Our weight produces the most pain to our relationships with ourselves and others. I want to be a successful screenwriter. I think I’m a very good writer because I know I work at it and I write movies I’d love to see in theaters. But people wouldn’t know because I don’t put my work out there. I don’t put myself out there because I was ashamed of my weight. 

**Perfectionism.**

Things are never going to be perfect. How many times have you said you were going to start dieting today and have the perfect plan in your head but one little thing goes off and then you tell yourself you’ll start tomorrow?

Me. Too.

But you know what? That doesn’t help. All your ducks don’t have to be in a row. Just start. And I GUARANTEE one day you’ll end up looking back and realizing holy quackamole, all my ducks are in a row!

**Podcasts and walks!**

Two of my favorite things right now. Walks are scientifically proven to do all sorts of things for your mind and depression. And podcasts help you learn and grow and just generally a good voice to have in your head, instead of the one you currently have that keeps you eating when you’re bored or happy or sad.

**Patience is key.** 

Time is going to pass anyways. If you’re so lucky, you’ll be alive in six months anyway. Would you rather be right where you are or somewhere new, wether physically or mentally?

Somewhere along the way **I learned to stop discouraging myself.** I realized it was no longer helpful. For instance, when I returned from Vietnam I went back home to Boston. I made a list in my Notes app of everything I couldn’t wait to eat. And I was ok with it. I accepted it. So I ate it all. But I kept fasting while doing it. And when I got something like a pizza, instead of eating the whole thing like I wanted to, I shared it. Still tasted just as good and half a pizza makes you feel just as full as a whole pizza, without the added calories and sickness that accompanies it. By the time I got to Maine I was eating Whoopie Pies. Even those, I’d have half and share the rest with my sister. I genuinely just wanted to savor them. By practicing such a healthy lifestyle for so many months I had finally got rid of that pesky pest Gluttony. And it felt good.

Did I gain some weight? Of course I did. About ten pounds.

More importantly did it set me back? No. I got right back on the horse. And it felt great. Traditionally, this is where I messed up. Vacations were always about food. What delicious things could I overeat? Even if I had lost significant amounts of weight before a vacation, the act of eating such bad food on my trip would send the seesaw back the other way and when I got back from vacation I’d keep up my vacation eating habits. There was no balance. I was all in, whether it was eating well or eating poorly.

This time was different.
I accepted that I chose to eat a bit poorly during my trip. And with that acceptance I knew I could get right back on the saddle.

And how did I know this?

Because I faced my fears. Which fear? **The scale.**

Before, anytime something like this would happen I’d never actually weight myself to see the damage. What I didn’t know couldn’t hurt me. This time, I wanted to know.

I gained ten pounds.

*Wow. Not bad over three weeks. Could’ve been way worse.*

But I also knew that wasn’t the direction I wanted to be heading, so immediately started eating right again. And since then and without much thought, I lost everything I had gained including an additional seven pounds.

I realized that before I was **sabotaging myself,** so now it’s something I am mindful of. Is this really something I want, or is this an act of self-sabotage?

And even now, I still sabotage myself. Remember my love of soda waters? I drink them right before bed. So instead of falling asleep peacefully, my bladder keeps me awake the next two hours. As someone who’s struggled with insomnia, that’s a bit of self-sabotage. But I don’t beat myself up about it, and that helps. All things considered, I’m doing pretty well.

**I’m most proud** of going back home for three weeks — and eating all my hometown food that I’ve craved for years — and not letting that pull me back the other way. Traditionally, vacations have been the death of my diets. I’m always good about losing twenty to forty pounds before a vacation. But then starting on vacation I gain 40-60 pounds. One step forward, two steps back.

But **deal with one problem at a time.** The biggest problem. Which was and still is my weight.

**Make things easy for yourself to get started.** If you want to be a 200 pound individual, eat like a 200 pound individual. It’s simple math. Calories in, calories out. I kept that in my head. If I eat like a 200 pound man, I will eventually BE a 200 pound man. I didn’t put a time limit on it. I just started being.

**Get rid of distractions/Keep stuff out of your house.** 

I never made food in Vietnam because it was so cheap to eat out every meal. But not having snacks and food in my apartment really helped me.

I know I can’t keep a box of cookies in the house because if I do, I’ll eat the whole box. In like twenty minutes. So it’s best to not even have it in your house.

There have been times when I’ve craved something — I’m a sucker for Keebler Rainbow Chip Cookies — and even then, had a six or so cookies and threw the rest out. I know it’s extreme, but sometimes that’s what it takes to quit.

**I can’t blame it on the alcohol.**

If you’ve noticed, I haven’t talked about alcohol. That’s because I don’t drink. I never have. My vices have largely been Ben and Jerry’s. I suggest teetotalism for losing weight. I live a teetotal lifestyle and I share my stories over at my blog. Feel free to check it out. I won’t link here because I don’t want to promote anything, but it’s called Teetotally Awesome. It’s relative to weight loss because over there I show how you can still have fun and live an interesting life without drinking. And if drinking is holding up your weight and you couldn’t imagine giving it up, maybe my blog can show you another way. I don’t care if people drink or not. I think everyone should do them. But, if you’re thinking quitting drinking will help your weight loss goals and need some tips how to live a teetotal lifestyle, feel free to check out my blog.

**More thoughts on fasting:**

I wouldn’t have fasted if it wasn’t **easy for me.** I never have an appetite in the morning so not eating meant nothing to me.

Fasting was a great tool, but also only part of the solution to my weightless. I also started it at such an invaluable time. Probably the perfect time. I had tried Keto before during other weight loss attempts, but it felt really restrictive and would never stick.

Also, soda water deserves a special place in the IF hall of fame.

**Find exercises that work for you:**

My favorite exercises? Ones that aren’t exercises. Because they’re FUN.

When I play basketball, I work up the biggest of sweats. In Vietnam, it looked like I jumped in a pool with all my clothes on. But nope — I was just playing basketball.

The thing is — I love playing basketball so while I’m playing, I don’t ever THINK about how hard it is. I just do it. I’m present.

I’ve also discovered I love walks and podcasts. But I hate running. Is it a good exercise? Sure. Is it for me? Nope. The second I start running, I start asking myself “Why the hell am I doing this?!” And then I stop after a block. And since it’s not easy, and it’s not fun, I’m not going to do it the next night.

Maybe dancing is fun for you. Or swimming. You might have to give lots of things a try.

One thing’s certain — you will like exercise the more weight you lose. When I first started losing massive amounts of weight, I didn’t do much exercise. I started as low impact as possible, listening to podcasts while taking walks.

Then when I felt like I could start playing basketball, I did. Then when my body naturally wanted to get stronger, I started lifting weights. Now, most of my strength gains come from climbing. And any weightlifting exercises I do are targeted towards muscles that will help me become a better climber.

**Don’t be afraid to try different things.** It’s all about finding out what works for you, and it never hurts to try.

**Make your weight loss a priority.**

I didn’t have to worry about anything in Vietnam. The people there are amazing and everything is so cheap. I didn’t have to worry about anything, especially money. I could just be present in doing whatever it was I was doing. And the biggest thing I wanted to do was lose weight. Even if all I did in a day was eat healthy and a bit active, I knew I was making forward progress.

If you have a significant other, explain this to them. I know it’s tough, but it has to be a priority. You have to love yourself before you can love somebody else.

**You can do it.**

If I could do it this last time, then so can you. I had gained back over a hundred pounds three times, and here I was tasked with having to lose over 100 pounds AGAIN.

Maybe I had been wrong about myself. I kept telling myself I was supposed to weigh less, but I never stopped to ask if maybe I was SUPPOSED to be the big guy. If this was really me. Should I just embrace myself?

Now my story is I’m a guy who feels good about himself. And wants to spread love and help others.

If I could lose over one hundred pounds four times, you bet your ass you can do it once. We’re all capable of such remarkable things and lots of times you don’t even know it until you do it. 

**Just do it.**

I almost wrote do it for you here. But in truth, that’s not necessary.

I’m doing it for me now, which is important. But when I started losing weight I’m not sure it was for me. And that’s ok. The important thing was I started.

Maybe you want to lose weight for a boy or for a girl. Let whatever motivates you to start to get you started.

**You can be anyone and be overweight.**

Weight doesn’t discriminate. Doesn’t matter if you’re tall or short or smart or slow. You can feel like you’re brimming with potential but no one will ever see it because you’re ashamed of your weight. **You can be anyone.**

**How do I feel now?**

I feel like myself again.

I feel in control and autonomous again.

I feel like I can do anything. Posting so vulnerable like this makes me super uncomfortable and is one of my worst fears, but I’m doing it. Losing such massive amounts of weight is one of the hardest struggles, as I’m sure you know. And instead of discouraging myself up for gaining all that weight in the first place, I’m changing my mindset and looking at the VICTORY of losing it all. Beating yourself up isn’t helpful. Loving yourself and others is.

**What now?**

I’d like to keep it off, and I’d like to help people in any way I can. Like I said, there’s much more to my story. This is the 4th time I’ve lost over 100 pounds, but I’m adamant it’ll be my last. It’s time to start learning from my mistakes. And the shame and guilt with being overweight can be paralyzing and painful. I don’t want to live in crippling fear anymore. We live once and we should all live the lives we want to live. I truly believe we’re all capable of change and being extraordinary.

Good luck and good eating, everybody!",loseit,1458

Some claim the wrong person was convicted.","[https://youtu.be/IiyPs2Q\_P1o](https://youtu.be/IiyPs2Q_P1o) \-- link to a newly released video on the case. 

&amp;#x200B;

Transcript of video:

Eight-year-old Alma Kellner of Louisville, Kentucky was a good Catholic girl who said her prayers and went to chapel often. At 9:45 on Wednesday, December 8, 1909, she left her house and walked the short distance to St. John’s Church for mass, wearing a tan, brown, and rose-colored plaid jumper. She wore a red cap in the “mushroom” style that was popular at the time. It was cold outside, so she donned a black and white checked pea coat on top of everything, with warm black stockings and button-up shoes. On her way, she was spotted by several witnesses, including Mr. Yont, the druggist, and Mr. Augustus, the postman. Nobody, however, saw her arrive at St. John’s. In fact, no one saw her alive again. This week on Out of the Past: the disappearance of Alma Kellner. 

Alma’s family ordinarily went to St. Boniface’s Church, a few blocks farther away from their house than St. John’s. In fact, that’s where her mother and aunt had gone that morning for the early service while she stayed home with her baby brother. When they arrived home, they helped her get ready to go to church on her own. She had attended mass at St. John’s the previous Sunday with a friend, so she wasn’t a completely unfamiliar face to the congregation there. And the church was so close that the Kellners could see the cross on top from their house.

Alma was a curious little girl who could get distracted sometimes, so her mother didn’t worry too much when she didn’t arrive home promptly that morning. Mrs. Kellner waited and waited, sure Alma would come through the door at any moment, but as time passed she began to feel very uneasy. When hours had gone by with no sign of her daughter, her uneasiness turned into all-out worry. She called all the local churches to see if Alma had changed her mind about her destination. When she called St. John’s, Father Schumann, the priest there, said he hadn’t seen Alma at mass. He also corrected her—the mass had actually been at 9, not at 10. So even if she had shown up, she would have missed the mass altogether. 

The Kellner family began to panic after learning this. Catholic personnel around the neighborhood tried to help. Nuns and neighbors that knew her prayed for her at the chapel. Alma’s mother called friends and neighbors, but it led her nowhere. Nobody knew where her little girl was. 

It took a little longer for Alma’s father, Fred Kellner, to start worrying. He remained certain she’d be home at any moment, and in fact, when police began to get involved, they found him oddly uncooperative and in denial. 

Some wondered if Alma had strayed in the wrong direction, gotten lost, and was wandering in an unfamiliar area. But she was a smart girl, her parents insisted. It was basically impossible for her to become lost. She knew how to get everywhere in the neighborhood on foot, and if she ever did get lost, she had been trained to find an authority figure and give her name and address. Mrs. Kellner felt certain Alma had been taken, and she thought pursuing other theories was a waste of time. 

The police were vigilant, as were volunteers. They retraced every step Alma could have made. They questioned every person at every location, all the residents of the homes along her route, and every child they could find, just in case she had run away and had only told her intentions to other children. But there was no trace of her anywhere. It was like she had simply vanished.

When the story broke in the media the next morning, it created a frenzy. Alma’s disappearance shook the community to its core. Nothing like this had ever happened before. Parental kidnapping wasn’t unheard of, but a stranger just grabbing a child? That didn’t happen in Louisville.

Every paper printed a small photograph of Alma, along with a written description of her appearance and the clothing she was last seen wearing. Police started receiving tips from everyone, from the confused-but-concerned to all-out nutcases. Some people claimed she was as far away as the other side of Kentucky. Most of the information received was of no use to investigators. 

The Sewer and Drain Department even dragged the sewers with volunteers on their tail. They observed that all the sewers emptied into the Ohio River, and many feared Alma had been washed away by the fast-moving current. Fred Kellner asked that they drag every body of water they could, even after being told that her body would likely float in a place like the town’s main creek. 

It came to light that Alma was the granddaughter of J.F. Kellner, the very wealthy president of the Central Consumer’s Company, and many began to wonder if this could be a kidnapping for ransom. Fred himself felt this theory was the most likely, even though his own immediate family wasn’t that well off. But at any rate, no ransom note or request for money of any kind ever came.  

Now, this is where the story starts to get really strange. Out of nowhere, the Kellner’s former servant, Katie Martin, told Alma’s mother that she had had a meeting with two men, one dressed as a woman, and that they had discussed the kidnapping with her. They were supposedly ready to meet with Mrs. Kellner to discuss terms for Alma’s return. But once this information came out, Martin retracted her entire story, denying that she had even ever said these things in the first place, though reporters insisted the words had come from her mouth. This suggests three possibilities: 1) the reporters made it all up; 2) Martin herself made it up for some reason, then denied the story to cover her lie; or 3) it had really happened, but when it leaked to the press, it scuttled the plan. Martin had earlier claimed that the men had threatened the Kellners with death if they got the cops involved, and if there was any truth to the story, the threat of being caught could have scared the men away. Anyway, nothing came of this strange interlude, and the police changed directions. 

Originally, no reward had been offered, and even when the case went to the governor, he dragged his feet, as he thought the child would return in time. But when things started to look bleak he decided to offer the highest possible reward in Kentucky law at the time: $500. This amount of money brought in people from all over, intent on solving the case. Unfortunately, most of the amateur sleuths canvassing the area did more harm than good. Solving the crime became a competition for wealth, not a community effort. It wasn’t just volunteers who proved unhelpful. For example, the police consulted ten-year-old psychic Freda Rinke, who was something of a national celebrity at the time, but—big surprise—she couldn’t provide any information.

A month passed. In January of 1910, Joseph Wendling, the janitor at St. John’s church, fled the area, leaving his wife. No one found it strange at first, as he had a long history of unreliability. We’ll get back to that in a moment, but first I want to talk about the media. 

The press stood in the investigation’s way more than it helped. Headlines were sensational. They would print anything anyone from the area would say, whether they had anything to do with the Kellner family or not. Unbelievably, on April 15, the *Courier* *Journal* deduced that Alma had probably been taken by a “band of gypsies” who were presently camping out near Los Angeles, as a “fair skinned girl” had been seen traveling with them, and they had recently been traveling through Ohio and Kentucky. Despite this being a crazy, racist, ethnocentric theory, they still followed up on it. Alma—again, big surprise—was not with the traveling group. 

On May 30, 1910, the nightmare of uncertainty ended for the Kellners, only to be taken over by the pain of mourning a murdered child. Her body was found just a hundred yards from where she was last seen—on the property of the very church to which she was headed for mass. She was found by a plumber who noticed a “fearful odor” while he was pumping out the cellar.

The press latched onto the story of the poor little rich girl who had lost her life. The day after her body was found, the lead headline above the fold in the *Courier* read, “Arrest Follows Discovery of Alma Kellner’s Mutilated Body.” The press didn’t keep the details about her remains private. The coroner concluded, based on the state of the remains, that she had been “murdered in the most brutal and inhuman manner.” Almost all her bones were broken, and some were missing. Her body appeared partially burnt.

The death was officially ruled a homicide. Nuns familiar with Alma said she would slip away, sometimes even during school, for little moments of prayer. The rumor soon spread, again thanks to the press, that Alma was snatched as she knelt at an altar to pray and taken to the cellar where she met her grim and tragic fate. This was a very popular notion, and you’ll even see it mentioned if you Google the case today, though the events are so old that that’s almost *all* you can find on the internet. 

Joseph Wendling, the janitor at St. John’s who had skipped town a few months earlier, was immediately accused of the crime. Since he couldn’t be found, the police brought his wife, Lena Wendling, down to the station for interrogation. She had been living in the rectory without her husband since January, and she insisted that she didn’t know where he’d gone. Though items thought to belong to Alma were found in her living space, she still claimed to have no knowledge about the crime. They arrested her for obstructing the investigation when she claimed to have no photos of her husband, yet one was found in the home. 

While all this was happening, Alma was laid to rest in a tiny white casket. A silver plate was affixed to the top that read, “Our Darling.” No religious services were held. 

The next step for authorities, obviously, was to find Wendling. The manhunt was somewhat disorganized. The authorities knew Wendling was a Frenchman, so they went looking for a man with an accent. Several European gentlemen were wrongfully arrested, including an Austrian. I’m not sure how you would mix up Austrian and French accents. Different sources began to offer extravagant rewards for his capture. A grand jury convened and they secured Joseph’s indictment, ensuring that they could move forward with the legal process when he was found. 

Authorities finally found Wendling when a tip came in from a police officer in Texas—he thought he’d found him, and he was right. He was working on a ranch outside of Houston. Police weren’t discreet enough and Wendling fled the country—he went all the way down to Panama. Throughout this manhunt, so many men were mistakenly arrested that the Houston *Post* started calling the arrestees members of the “Wendling Suspect Club.” The search went on worldwide until July 31, 1910, when a tip came in from Wendling’s lover and he was finally arrested in San Francisco. 

Wendling denied killing Alma. He tried pinning it on others at the church. They pointed out that he was the only one with access to the cellar. He then argued that it must have been his predecessor, but he couldn’t remember the man’s name. 

He and his wife struggled with the expenses of effective legal counsel, and even wrote a letter to the public at one point begging for financial assistance. Big surprise number three: people were not eager to help an accused child murderer with his bills.

Wendling pled not guilty, and on November 28, the prosecution presented their case: heartfelt testimony about that day from Alma’s family members, a woman who saw Wendling near Alma that morning, a woman who stayed to pray after mass and saw no other man in the church but Wendling, and Father Schumann, who testified about the cellar hole to which only Wendling had access. The jury then heard the testimony of Dr. Ellis Duncan, who described the heartbreaking state of her body, which no doubt made the jury emotional. Other witnesses were called to establish that the shoes found were indeed Alma’s, or to describe the location where the body was found. This kind of testimony does not help the prosecution meet the burden of proof. 

The defense made the questionable choice of having Wendling take the stand. He adamantly denied having raped or murdered Alma Kellner. They also called witnesses who tried to explain why some items might have been in his possession, as he was responsible for the lost-and-found and the laundry chutes. The final witness was Alma’s father, who testified where he had chosen to have his daughter buried. I’m not sure why this was relevant. 

The jury deliberated for three hours before convicting. They did not recommend the death penalty. But why? If there were ever a justified use of capital punishment, wouldn’t it be in a case like this, where an innocent child has been assaulted and murdered? But the fact is that they didn’t have a great deal of evidence on Joseph Wendling. The prosecution’s entire case was based on speculation and circumstantial evidence. The jury couldn’t bring themselves to put a man to death without the proper evidence. They had no problem locking him up, though. 

Behind bars, Wendling set his mind to creative endeavors, like writing poetry. In 1919, after nine years in prison and problems in the appeals process, he escaped, but they caught him a few counties away within a few days. They locked him back up, and after a while he became eligible for parole. Alma’s father and grandfather sat at every one of those parole hearings, doing everything they could to keep this man behind bars. 

Weirdly, and this is part of the mystery of the case, Alma’s father and Frank Fehr, her grandfather, eventually relented and gave their consent for Wendling to be released after receiving a twenty-page letter from him. Nobody knows what that letter contained. Wendling served twenty-five years in prison: 1910 to 1935. He was deported to France afterward, and he maintained his innocence to the grave. 

It gets weirder yet. While Wendling was behind bars, Father Hans Schmidt, a Catholic priest, had secretly married his mistress Anna Aumuller, whom he had impregnated. In 1913, he was arrested for the murder of that same woman. Her body was mutilated. Schmidt was given the death penalty.

When Schmidt’s past was explored a little further, it was discovered that he worked very near Alma’s house when she was murdered. When he was interrogated about Anna’s murder, he spoke in detail about her mutilation having specific religious significance. This led many people to believe that he was Alma’s real killer, but he insisted he’d confessed to all his crimes and he would have confessed to Alma’s murder had he been the assailant, but he was not.

I don’t know what really happened. I think it’s likely that Wendling was indeed Alma’s murderer. What happened with Father Schmidt is shocking, but it doesn’t necessarily make him any more likely to be Alma’s murderer. Schmidt didn’t have access to the location where Alma’s body was found. They only person who did was Wendling.

One can only wonder what might have been if Alma wasn’t killed. Who would she have been? What would her life have been like? What talents and gifts would she have shared with the world had she gotten the chance? Nobody will ever know.",UnresolvedMysteries,1380
crispysilicon,2019-09-19 21:27:43+00:00,The Day of the Cactus,"From my nightmares and the mid 2000s. I give you, The Day of the Cactus.

It's a nice quiet morning in the call center in L2 support at a major US telecom. It's a Saturday.

It's around 11:00AM . I clocked on almost 3 hours ago and I've taken a whopping 2 calls. Only one of those needed troubleshooting, the other was simple. It's so slow our team is gathered around in a ground yakking and playing games rather than at our respective stations.

The room is pretty small, only about 25 people in the room fully staffed. About half that are in the room.

Up on the wall is a gigantic map of the United States, made up of LEDs. Most of the map is green, this indicates everything is normal. A few parts are yellow, this means trouble has been reported but the system is still responding. A few red spots and dots here and there, indicating outages.

I've got my shoes off with my feet up on my desk reading a book. 

All in all, it's a wonderfully relaxing day.

Then it all went wrong. Terribly wrong.

First was the beeping alarms, which none of us knew existed. What the hell is that god-awful racket coming out of EVERY terminal?!

Then I see the wall. And my heart has stopped for a moment.

California, from the middle to Los Angeles, has gone red. 

Millions of people are out of service.

In the room we are staring at the map, the computers and each other. Then headsets start beeping as people start receiving calls. I get a call. Within a minute there are HUNDREDS of calls in my queue, the general queue is in the HIGH THOUSANDS and climbing rapidly.

My system has populated an account from the Los Angeles area. Customer is pissed, has no service whatsoever. I try and cannot get a response from his phone. Actually, NOTHING will respond, it's like a meteor has destroyed Southern California, except I'm on a landline with someone right now.

The entire call center is slammed, I have to tell my customer I'll give a call back then put myself into ""Not Ready"" to start investigating what the hell is going on. Nobody in the room knows anything yet.

The problem is in the GSM network, everything else is working. I can reach all the equipment, but all GSM traffic falls into a black hole of unresponsiveness. 

Someone shouts! There it is! There is a station not responding along Interstate 5! It's COMPLETELY unresponsive, like I can't even talk to the internet equipment and that is very not good. It's *the* link between the halves of the state. The rest of the network does NOT appreciate this link being down either, problems are widespread as the system tries, but cannot handle the load. Other systems are now being affected.

Emergency dispatch technicians to the area to determine what the hell is going on. My Nortel has the call queue in the 10's of thousands. The previously laid back atmosphere in the room is now grim as death.

Agonizing, useless incoming escalation after escalation where I can't tell them ANYTHING useful grinds on. People are very unwilling to hang up the damn phone without any kind of answers. It's grueling and repetitive. 

Finally word (and pictures) come back from the dispatched technicians.... There *is* no relay station. It's gone the way of Alderaan. 

A truck driver with a fully loaded trailer fell asleep at the wheel and drove off the highway. He made it way off the road and plowed straight through our gigantic fake cactus and associated hardware of a relay station. Obliterated, nothing to fix and the site isn't even usable. Sweet Jesus.

The whole time, I'm fielding calls that I obviously can't do anything about and people are *pissed*. (I actually did get ONE call from someone NOT in the affected area who waited through that queue, only one out of hundreds, but it was a welcome relief.)

So this is how we got to learn to build and deploy a mobile relay station. It took a crazy effort between teams to build out the equipment, then figure out how to deploy. By the end of my nightmare shift, the link was functioning and was literally a van-network parked around the brutalized remains of a giant fake cactus and outbuilding. Things were finally coming under control around the time I left and the queue was emptying. 

By the time I walked out the doors, about a hundred two-minute long calls later, I felt like I'd run a marathon. Physically and mentally exhausted. I don't even remember the drive home. My head hit the pillow before the sun had set. The Day of the Cactus, was finally over.",talesfromtechsupport,1074

deeznuts80081,2019-09-10 21:13:53+00:00,California is the most Overrated state,"California is the most overrated state of the union if there was any. I was born and raised in Greater Los Angeles suburbia and the people that makeup California all think that they're smarter and better than everyone else. Not only that but in Los Angeles and the Bay area they're all about one upping everyone. In Southern California, they one up each other with fancy sports cars and McMansion's but in the Bay area they one up each other by showing how much more eco-friendly they are than their neighbors.

We do have beaches and mountains in California, that is true. However, we also have the highest cost of living, highest homeless population, worst commutes in the US if not the world, and young people fleeing the state like crazy as well as low literacy rates especially since common core was implemented (which did more harm than good), because it essentially just lowered the standards to graduate from high school to let more people pass without trying.

People in San Francisco think they're all that and a bag of chips. Everyone and their cousin is a vegan now and the hatred from both southern and northern Californians is not only unreal but it makes the entire state population look like petulant little children.

How can you enjoy the weather, beaches and mountains when you're living paycheck to paycheck and can barely afford rent and have to worry about two hour commutes? Not to mention if you have kids, daycare is expensive as fuck and so are gas prices. Not to mention our government nickel and dime's us on everything from pay to park to plastic bags to whether or not we can have plastic straws at coffee shops or not.

- **""2001 will never be looked back upon as being a great year for wrestling,""** so writes Dave Meltzer. And with that, we have come to the end of the Observer Rewinds.

- **The issue opens with a long recap of the major stories of the past year**. Throughout the world, every single professional wrestling organization did worse than the year before it. In 2000, Time Warner attempted to sell WCW for $600 million. A year later, they sold it for $2.5 million. And realistically, WCW was actually sold for a loss, because Time Warner was still on the hook for $15 million in wrestling contracts that WWF didn't pick up. And of course, ECW folded as well. A bunch of struggling start-ups began in their place and Dave doesn't seem hopeful for the long-term prospects of WWA or XWF. All in all, 2001 was the year that changed the wrestling industry forever. Anyway, Dave recaps the entire year, going month-by-month in great detail on all the top stories throughout. It's pretty much just rehashing old news, so let's keep it moving...

- **Dave gives a long recap of the latest PRIDE show** and man, this is shaping up to be a kinda slow issue to end the Rewinds on. The only notable wrestling related news out of the show was Antonio Inoki hyping up his New Year's Eve show, which Dave says is on the verge of falling apart because people keep pulling out and of course, IWGP champion Kazuyuji Fujita had to back out due to injury.

- **Speaking of MMA, Dos Caras Jr. (Alberto Del Rio) had to pull out of a scheduled fight after suffering a shoulder injury days before**. He was replaced by Mexican wrestling legend Canek, fighting at 49 years old. Canek fought with his mask on and defeated another pro wrestler in the shoot. Canek was said to look impressive, especially considering his age (eh, I dunno about all that. Judge for yourself:)

---

- **Keiji Muto vs. Toshiaki Kawada for the AJPW Triple Crown title has been announced for February**. Dave expects Kawada to win the title. The original plan, when Muto won the belt back in June, was for him to be a short-term transitional champion and drop the belt to Kawada a month later. But then Muto started having amazing MOTY quality matches and got super over. So AJPW decided to delay the Muto/Kawada match for as long as they could and now Muto's planned short transitional reign is currently going on 6 months and counting. But Dave thinks they've put off the Kawada match as long as they could (indeed, Kawada wins the title from Muto in February).

- **The main event of NJPW's upcoming Jan. 4th Tokyo Dome show has been changed to Jun Akiyama vs. Yuji Nagata for the NOAH world title**. Needless to say, having NJPW's biggest show of the year headlined by a title match for another promotion is pretty strange, but Fujita's injury left them with few options. As for the IWGP title, Fujita is expected to vacate it and the fate of the belt will be decided in February. There will likely be a tournament, but they aren't making any plans yet because they're waiting to see how Yuji Nagata does in his shoot fight at the New Year's Eve Inoki show (in other words, if he gets his ass beat, chances are they aren't going to put the IWGP title on him a month later).

- **Inoki is hinting about coming out of retirement**. Reportedly, he wants somewhere between $500K-$1 million to do a match and no word if anyone is going to pay it (apparently not, because he never did).

- **Superstar Billy Graham was hospitalized all of last week** due to cirrhosis of the liver due to Hepatitis C. Dave notes that Graham needs a liver transplant (he gets one in 2002).

- **Hulk Hogan appeared on an episode of ESPN's Unscripted and what a mess that was**. The show was hyped as Hogan revealing his true feelings about Vince McMahon and WWF and host Chris Connelly hyped up all the dirt Hogan was going to spill. Instead, Hogan showed up and pretty much kissed Vince's ass in an attempt to get himself rehired by WWF, all while Connelly looked as though he had been bamboozled. Hogan was his typical self, portraying himself as the biggest star in the business today (maybe in the past, but it's 2001 now). He also pretty much buried all of today's generation of wrestlers in general, but when specific names were brought up (Rock, Austin, Triple H, etc.) Hogan was quick to praise each of them individually. Of course, it wouldn't be a Hogan interview without some big dumb lies. He claimed his recent XWF match with Curt Hennig was only supposed to go 10 minutes but once he got in the ring, he felt so good that they ended up going for 30 minutes instead (in case you're wondering, the full unedited match was actually less than 6 minutes). He claimed that at Wrestlemania 3, Andre The Giant was 700 pounds (no) and that he ""pressed Andre over his head"" and slammed him in front of 94,000 people. Hogan heaped praise on Triple H, which Dave says is smart for a guy trying to get rehired because Triple H has a lot of political power backstage these days. The host tried to get Hogan to say anything negative about Vince McMahon, but Hogan wasn't biting. Talked about how steroids were legal back when he used them (they weren't) and on and on and on. 

- **After Randy Savage tried to challenge Hogan to a match for a children's hospital charity without consulting Hogan**, Savage went ahead and donated $10,000 to the hospital anyway. WWA promoter Andrew McManus held a press conference with Savage and also donated an additional $10,000 to the hospital and then announced Savage was joining WWA and that he will appear on their February PPV (Savage was scheduled to face Jeff Jarrett at that show in the main event but he no-shows and is replaced by Brian Christopher). Dave is glad they donated money to the hospital, but they pretty much just did it to promote their event. But that's a time honored tradition in wrestling. In the 90s, every time Vince McMahon got into trouble with the media about something, there would always be some highly publicized charity donation soon after. Anyway, aside from one appearance in a WCW battle royal back in early 2000, Savage hasn't made an appearance in wrestling in almost 3 years. Dave thinks it'll be interesting to see if Savage's name still means anything when it comes to drawing on PPV for a promotion without TV.

- **Vader was supposed to work a match against Samoa Joe for UPW but had to pull out due to knee surgery**. He's promised to work a make-up date for them when he's healed. Instead, Konnan was brought in to face Joe in the main event. Shinya Hashimoto was there as well and cut a promo issuing an open challenge for the NWA title. A bunch of UPW guys came out and Hashimoto basically laid all of them out by himself. Yuji Nagata and Don Frye were also backstage (Dave notes Nagata has been training in Los Angeles for the Inoki show). UPW is also planning to do a worked-shoot type of show in conjunction with UFC fighter Tito Ortiz.

- **More on Comedy Central reportedly buying the AWA tape library**. I guess there's something to this. Comedy Central is working on a pilot for a show called The Huge World of Wrestling which is basically expected to be old wrestling footage with studio commentary to make fun of it or something (this obviously never happened and WWE later bought the footage from Gagne, which leads me to believe Comedy Central didn't actually buy the library, they probably just leased rights to some footage that they never ended up using).

- **Former WWF star Ahmed Johnson made his acting debut in a VH-1 television movie about the life of MC Hammer**. Johnson played the role of Suge Knight, the head of Death Row Records. Dave hasn't seen it but hears Ahmed's acting ability was somehow even worse than his wrestling ability.

- **Jake Roberts was booked for an indie show in England but when he showed up, there were only 32 fans in the audience**. Roberts reportedly told the promoter that he has a hard enough time getting motivated to work in front of 400 people, much less 32, and walked out of the building, never to return.

- **Kevin Nash is still trying to play WWF and WWA against each other**. Reportedly, WWF has very little interest in Scott Hall and originally, Nash refused to go to WWF if they wouldn't bring in Hall. But he's said to have softened his stance on that and may be willing to come in alone and may also be willing to work more dates, since that's the big hurdle between he and WWF. But Dave suspects he might just be telling the WWA side this in order to get them to up their offer for him.

- **In the XWF wrestling section, Dave slips in a brief story about the XFL**. Nothing newsworthy or anything, just recapping some article about the XFL that was written in a sports journal magazine. But I just find it funny that Dave can't even be bothered to throw this into the WWF section and puts it under the XWF section instead because, fuck it, 2 out of 3 letters is close enough right?

- **Eddie Guerrero has had talks with XWF about coming in soon**, but nothing has been finalized as of press time (never happens).

- **The autopsy of Russ Haas** has revealed that his cause of death was a heart attack, which was suspected after the previous one he had suffered a couple months prior.

- **The planned WWF brand split has once again been delayed**. It was tentatively scheduled to take place on next week's Raw from Madison Square Garden, but no longer. It will likely be sometime after the Royal Rumble but no word when. As a matter of fact, Dave heard an idea for how to split the brands and he actually thinks it's a pretty decent idea. You put the entire roster in the Rumble, (which would probably be around 50 wrestlers rather than the usual 30 but whatever) and all the even numbered wrestlers end up on one side while the odd numbers end up on the other. That would add excitement to the entire Rumble match (rather than the usual long, dull spots that the match often has) and would make every entrant matter. Doing it this way would also mean they could avoid doing a draft, because if they do a draft, that means all the lower draft picks are automatically seen as jobbers. This way, it seems random and nobody is made to look like the last kid picked for a team. None of this will happen of course, but it's an idea someone mentioned to Dave and he thinks it could work (I still like this idea).

- **The Hardyz and Lita have been taken off TV**, which is why they were pretty much beaten like jobbers and buried by Undertaker on TV last week. In particular, there's been issues with Jeff Hardy lately, which came to a head when he no-showed a house show in San Jose a couple weeks ago. Jeff has also been late for a few shows lately and his in-ring work has been below par (Dave says, given all the insane, career-shortening bumps he's taken over the years, it's surprising it took this long). After the Jeff vs. Matt angle flopped, Vince McMahon called all 3 of them into a meeting and said he was taking them off TV for awhile to give them a chance to breathe and go away for awhile so fans will miss them a little bit. They're still expected to work house shows for now, but no TV. Dave says there's always a shelf-life to certain acts and the Hardyz have been floundering for awhile, particularly after Triple H cut Jeff's momentum off at the knees and Lita got treated like a jobber by Chyna before she left. If this was still the territory days, it would be time for them to move on and go to a new territory but alas, that's no longer an option (they're only off TV for a few weeks. They work the Rumble at the end of January and then disappear from TV for another month before returning to TV full-time in February. Together as a tag team again, with no mention of the fact that they were supposedly split up the last time we saw them. Anyway, yeah from all reports, this is around the time Jeff's personal issues first really started to show. He eventually gets fired from WWE in 2003 for refusing to go to rehab).

- **Notes from Raw**: the show was pre-taped since it was on Christmas Eve. Billy Gunn and Chuck Palumbo are basically doing a ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" gimmick with a slightly gay twist. Dave thinks Palumbo looks ridiculous with bleached blonde hair and says Billy Gunn looked like Stan Lane ""in need of charisma bypass surgery."" Arn Anderson made an on-screen return in a backstage skit. Tough Enough winner Maven worked a match with Booker T and got a big pop and actually showed more in-ring skill than half the people on the show, but that's a pretty low bar because this was a bad episode for wrestling. The show was in Miami and Rock came out wearing a Miami Hurricanes jersey (he played football for them in college) and he got a monstrous reaction for that. Otherwise, not much to this show.

- **Earthquake/John Tenta got a try-out match at the latest Smackdown tapings**. He's 38 and word is he looked really slow (he has a couple of tryout matches during this period, but he doesn't get hired).

---

[**WATCH: Earthquake 2001 dark match tryout**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZhBydjoVBw)

---

- **On the Sunday Night Heat tapings, they had Billy Gunn beat Albert**. As mentioned, Gunn and Palumbo are doing a gay gimmick now and during the match, Albert actually called Palumbo a ""little f*ggot"" which Dave seems pretty disgusted by. Yikes.

- **WWF has booked a few shows in Asia for March, including one in Japan for the first time in 7 years**. Dave notes that WWF does have a television deal in Japan, but it only does about half the ratings that NOAH does and maybe 1/3 of what NJPW does, and all three shows are in similar time slots. So WWF is just really not that popular there. Regardless, if they bring both Rock and Austin, Dave suspects they'll still do pretty well.

- **There was another incident with Perry Saturn beating up a jobber, but this time it may have been deserved**. It was a match with Saturn against a guy named Brian Gamble. During the match, Gamble stopped selling and started telling Saturn that this was his hometown and he had to win the match and couldn't look weak. So he started refusing to go off his feet and on two different occasions, he double crossed Saturn on planned spots and kicked him in the head instead of doing what they were planning. At this point, Saturn kicked Gamble's face in, forced him onto the mat, and put his submission on him. Gamble refused to tap and wouldn't cooperate, so Saturn had to *really* cinch the move in and twist his arm and finally, Gamble tapped. Backstage, people could tell something was wrong and when Gamble came back and they asked what happened, he said he didn't want to look weak and lose in front of all his friends and family who were there. Naturally, Vince McMahon was furious. Afterwards, both men were being checked by the trainer and they almost got into another altercation. Saturn mentioned the incident a couple years ago with jobber Mike Bell (look it up if you're not familiar) and told Gamble that he's lucky he didn't beat the shit out of him the same way he did Bell. Saturn was almost fired over the Bell incident and that's why he was hesitant to beat the shit out of Gamble, even though this time, the jobber actually deserved it. Gamble responded that Saturn was the lucky one because he would have beaten the shit out of him instead. Some people got between them and Gamble was then thrown out of the building and Dave doesn't expect we'll ever be seeing him again (nope).

---

[**WATCH: Perry Saturn vs. Brian Gamble**](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x15y1q4) 

---

-  **There have been talks between WWF and Rey Mysterio but nothing really agreed to yet**. Obviously, Mysterio's size works against him in WWF and as far as his career prospects, it's probably not the best place for him to be, unless WWF decides to start seriously pushing smaller guys. And Dave doesn't see that happening. But money-wise, WWF is pretty much the only game in town and he'll make a lot more money there than he would in Mexico or working indies.

- **And with that.......the Observer Rewind is in the books**. I have a lot more to say though, so if you'll indulge me one last time, please follow me to [**THIS LINK**]().

re-assemblyrequired,2019-08-29 23:46:41+00:00,Victim of fake check. Bank of America refusing to honor my claim for over $2400.,"06/13/2019 I looked at my mobile banking app from BofA and there was a ""return item charge back"" for the amount of $2455.09 and a fee of $12 made on 06/10/2019. I called customer support right away and the representative told me that it was a fake check that was cashed at a branch in Los Angeles, whom ever did this also had my PIN. Got transferred to the fraud claim department and replace my current card and froze my account.  About a week goes by and I call to get an update. They briefly told me that it is still being worked on and it can take 60 business days. I understand these things take time. Okay time to set my calendar to 09/09/2019.

06/14/2019 a letter comes in the mail to notify me of this returned item charge back. There is a picture of the check at the bottom and I noticed that my name was not even spelled correctly. So it's safe to say they didn't even check ID before handing money over.

06/27/2019 made a complaint to BBB in hopes to speed up the process. Got a couple calls from BofA but was not able to converse about it, I tell them to give it to me in writing. At this point about 80 days have passed and no word from them. 

08/16/2019 made a complaint to CFPB explaining this situation. Again to speed it up.

08/28/2019 got an email from CFPB that the company is still working on it.

08/29/2019 got a response from BofA and they are NOT honoring this claim because the signature matches with their samples. This troubles me because from the time I opened this account (~2015) I have never cashed a check or written personal checks. I don't withdraw that much cash. Ever. 

I know this is somewhat of a cop out to just keep complaining on the internet. But I cant really make calls at work and when it's time to clock out I can no longer speak to a human on the phone. 

What's your advice? What more can I do? Tia",personalfinance,4409

[WorkLizard Link](https://worklizard.com/interview-catatonic-schizophrenic/)

I stumbled across this video the other day while scrolling through Facebook. It’s 10 minutes of an interview with a young man in a mental facility. The interview focuses on why he is in the hospital in the first place. Patient 19 says he’s supposed to be mentally unwell, but no one has told him how or why he has been placed there. He says he feels it’s because he is “not like other people”, and because people dislike the way he sits differently at the piano and stands differently when away from the piano.

The only “information” available online comes from the few sites that share the video, and they all say the same thing. There are 2 narratives that have been given, which are completely different from each other (pasted below). I’ll save my opinion until the end.

**Story #1:**

*“His name is ‘Stephen E.’. He is 79 now and lives with his wife of 43 years in a peaceful setting. Here is what Stephen said:*

*I had multiple arrests (2 felonies) and hospitalizations on my road from crisis to regaining my independence and dignity.*

*If I hadn’t had a social worker;if I hadn’t had a doctor;if I hadn’t had medications, …*

*I would be homeless;I’d be in jail;or I’d be dead.But I’m well!*

*This is what happens when you:have the services;have a solution (and medication does help me.);have someone to lead you to the place you need to be in order to move forward with your life; for me it was my dad.*

*Around 1969 or ’70 (don’t remember), I had a psychotic ‘break’ and my dad got tired of fighting with me;I ended up walking down the street naked at night.A police officer who was ‘Crisis-Intervention trained’ picked me up.He treated me with respect.I said, ‘Don’t handcuff me; I haven’t broken the law.’He says ‘Okay.’He says ‘What kind of music do you like?’,and I said, ‘Rock and Roll!’, and he turns the radio dial until he picks up the Beatles’ ‘Let It Be’. I’ll never forget that.I remember saying ‘This is better than a taxi ride!’*

*…*

*And then I got a social worker, who led me to a good psychiatrist, who prescribed meds.*

*…*

*Then I became well;*

*…*

*I have a lovely wife, kids, and grandkids, and 1 great-grandkid!I pay taxes!;I have friends;I graduated with a Masters in Social Working;I served as a member of the ‘Intergovernmental Serious Mentally Ill and Serious Emotional Disorder Committee (ISMICC) which consists of 14 non-federal employees who are tasked with reporting annually to Congress about the state of mental health care in the nation.*

*I’m well!”*

**Story #2:**

*“This man was my uncle. I’m not going to give any names, but for those of you who are concerned with how things turned out for him, not well. There’s so much to address here.*

*First let me say that he was being treated in this video with meds. Without the medication his mood ranged from complete delusion to catatonic.*

*As for being gay, I don’t think he had much of a sex drive at all. With or without meds.*

*As for the idea that he was put here because he was gay by some unloving family, that’s ridiculous. I don’t have time to say all the things my family tried just to make his existence somewhat peaceful just for his own sake.*

*My family had a couple of openly homosexual and lesbians in it even back in the sixties and with the exception of my mother’s father no one gave a shit. My uncle suffered with meds and even more without.*

*After forty some odd years, most of which he spent in institutions, he took his own life by way of drug overdose.*

*By the way, the comment about the plot twist, he never had a piano was funny because he didn’t. His seeming obsession with piano came and went as did obsessions with religion, especially the Catholic Church and government.*

*As far as I know he couldn’t play a lick. He was very ill at his best and a living shell at his worst. I hope that answers some questions because that’s all I have to say on the matter.*

*He’s been gone since the late eighties and I really hope that other members of my family don’t see this video, mostly because of the comments from people that somehow think they understand him better than the people who suffered with him.*

*One last thing, I think people thought that he was talking about sitting or standing effeminately or something. No, he was talking about sitting or standing motionless for hours.*

*Usually not even his facial expression would change but when it did it was usually related to something in his mind only.*

*I really can’t begin to tell you all how heartbreaking the whole thing was. He did seem intelligent and with meds he did remind me of a high functioning guy with autism I once “*

Commenters on the YouTube video have given theories including:

* that he was committed due to being homosexual and is highly sedated in the video
* that he’s autistic
* that he really is schizophrenic and his delayed responses/eye movements are signs that he is listening to the voices in his head to find the best response to the questions he’s being asked

**My opinion:**

Unfortunately, I tend to feel that the latter story is more likely. The first story almost feels like it was written by someone who is using this video to support the need for better or more available mental health resources. I completely agree that mental health resources should be accessible to anyone that needs it, but it just doesn’t sound like the person in the video.

That being said, a 10-minute interview is hardly enough to diagnose someone, especially since we don’t know what medications he is on or how he acts normally.

One more thing that I hadn’t seen mentioned anywhere is that the video starts with a copyright frame that says “Produced for the Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, by the Motion Picture Division, Theatre Arts Department, University of California, Los Angeles”. I think most people watching the video dismiss this as this department using their equipment to film these interviews, but is it possible that this is an actor from the Theatre Arts Department and the video is being made for School of Medicine students to use in learning how to diagnose cases? I’m not very confident in that theory, since there are a few videos in this “series”, but thought it was worth mentioning.

**The author of this article is Laura Hollis from NWI Times!**
 
 
Scott Presler is an amazing person that just wants Americans to be safe and happy in there communities. We can be more like Scott and help out clean our parks, streets, city ordinances, gas stations, etc. We can help Americans.
 
 
 
 
 
 
&gt;*This week saw another example of the ""can-do"" attitude of private citizens. Scott Presler, a young conservative activist from northern Virginia, used his substantial social media following (he has over 300,000 followers on Twitter) to organize a one-day trash cleanup in Baltimore -- a city whose problems have recaptured the nation's attention since President Trump tweeted about it being ""rat and rodent infested"" two weeks ago.*
 
 
 
 
 
&gt;*One hundred and seventy people from Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey and Ohio signed up, but Presler estimates that perhaps 100 more showed up on Aug. 5 to help in the west Baltimore neighborhood at the intersection of North Fulton and Westwood Avenues. Working in two-hour shifts, volunteers -- including local residents -- cleared out 12 tons of trash in 12 hours.*
 
 
 
 
&gt;*Presler and his team of volunteers remind me of the Cajun Navy -- dozens of Americans from Louisiana who took their boats to Houston for rescue operations when state and federal government agencies were overwhelmed after Hurricane Harvey's deluge. Unofficial branches of the Cajun Navy have popped up all over the country.*
 
 
 
 
&gt;*One would think that such efforts would be uniformly praised. But an NPR article raised questions about the Cajun Navy after the fact, asking whether the members were ""heroes or hindrances"" to government relief efforts. It sounds a little like sour grapes -- private citizens make the government look bad. But participants in those volunteer efforts said that government responses to crises are, as the article said, ""broken, or, at best, inadequate."" And even the most effective government cannot do everything.*
 
 
 
 
 
&gt;*Is that not a failure of government? Presler's own experience with Baltimore city government was no better. Despite multiple inquiries and efforts, he was unable to get permits to have dumpsters at the cleanup site. The permit applications weren't denied, Presler explained; nothing was done at all. Private donations paid for the dumpsters that were brought to the site (lack of a permit notwithstanding), filled and carried away one at a time, as well as the portable toilets, food and water needed for the volunteers. (Presler says he finally heard from the city of Baltimore two days after the cleanup; his permit request was denied.*
 
 
 
 
&gt;*Presler is an unabashed conservative, but he is adamant that this effort is apolitical. ""It's an act of love,"" he said. ""Just Americans helping Americans."" Residents of the neighborhood who are the beneficiaries of the help certainly seem to get it. And local business owners offered to help with this cleanup, and future cleanups. ""The response warmed my heart,"" Presler says.*
 
 
 
&gt;*Positive responses aren't limited to Baltimore. Presler told me that he has been overwhelmed by the reaction. ""We've already gotten inquiries from Atlanta, Houston, Detroit and Los Angeles,"" he said. No doubt more will inquire. But that is precisely what should happen -- one small act inspires dozens more.*
 
 
 
&gt;*Presler's main message is philosophical, not political. He is unfailingly optimistic -- a sentiment that is refreshing in a political climate fraught with rancor and vitriolic accusations. He points to the helpful and grateful attitudes of the cleanup participants and west Baltimore residents alike as proof of what Americans are truly capable of. ""Don't look at the color of our skin; look at our actions,"" he said. ""One person (SET ITAL) can (END ITAL) make a difference. One tweet from me started a movement that's taking the country by storm.""*

&gt;*LEWISBURG - Republican conferees in Pennsylvania's 85th legislative district on Thursday evening chose David Rowe to be their nominee in the Aug. 20 special election to fill the seat vacated by Fred Keller, who is now representing Congressional District 12 in the U.S. House.Rowe defeated Ben Ranck 9-8 in a roll call vote, that was later changed to unanimous by party regulars.*
 
 
&gt;*The 17 Union and Snyder County Republicans, chosen as voting conferees, placed only Rowe and Ranck into nomination.
""The 17 conferees,"" explained Carolyn Conner, chair, Union County Republican Committee, ""Were comprised of nine from Union and eight from Snyder counties. That number was based upon the votes for President Trump in the parts of the county that lie in the 85th district.""Rowe stressed his business acumen, his experience as a no-tax-hike EBT supervisor, a small business owner, and a strong commitment to conservative principles, such as the Second Amendment and Right to Life.*
 
 
&gt;*Rowe thanked the conferees ""For the confidence they have placed in me as the Republican nominee. Let me acknowledge Congressman Fred Keller, who admirably served the people of Snyder and Union County for eight years in the state legislature. I am proud to call Fred a friend and I can only hope to live up to the standards he has set. Now it is time to turn our attention to the Aug. 20 special election. We must come together as a Republican party and keep the district in Republican hands, and we cannot take anything for granted.""Schumacher believes Rowe will represent the district ""Just as good as Fred did.""*

LighthouseHorror,2019-08-11 19:41:15+00:00,"My Best Friend Died When We Were Children. It's Ten Years Later, And She's Clawing At My Window.","At first I was confused.

And then I was terrified.

""Grace?""

It was twenty after midnight, and for the first time since I was a child, I saw my best friend.

The problem is, she died a long time ago.

*""Let me in Jessica.""*

Nearly jumping out of bed, I stared through the thin red curtains and stained glass. Her face was muddled in the darkness, but I knew it was her.

*I knew.*

Something told me not to look further, that if I were to stare into her eyes I might never come back. Still, I had to be sure. I had changed locations recently, moving to the fourteenth floor of an apartment building in a forgotten part of Los Angeles. There had been complaints of rats and other vermin, and though the place wasn't yet condemned, it was most likely on its way.

*""Jessica... it's me.""*

Torn sections of wallpaper fluttered in the wind along with my old friend, a reminder that I had left the window open just a crack.

I prayed it wouldn't be enough for her to—

*""Jessica,""* the raspy voice repeated, seeming to float gently just outside the glass.

I summoned all of my courage, and asked her the only question I could think of.

""How are you here?""

The soft breeze from the window suddenly became violent, and one strip of wallpaper tore clean off of the wall.

""You know how... NOW LET ME IN.""

And with that I fell to my knees and began to cry. Ten years later. Ten years of therapy and ten years of prayer and ten years of them saying I had imagined it all—that I had imagined the thing in the forest. It hadn't been there when the police returned.

""Oh sweetie, you made all that up. Everyone has a different way to cope,"" my mother had said.

Maybe I did need to cope, but I hadn't imagined anything. Ten years ago Grace and I had gone together into the woods to try and make a fire. We weren't ones to be outdone by the boys, and earlier that week my brother had made a very stupid comment (even by his standards).

""Girls are too dumb to make fires,"" the boy-scout of three weeks had stated with a grin.

That was more ammunition than we needed, and later that day Grace and I had researched different fire-building techniques before finally going with the old newspaper and matches routine. Our town sat at the edge of a national forest, and we knew of various campsites we could sneak into that would give us a hidden place to practice in silence.

We lied to our parents (as they never would have let us venture out so far), and as it just so happened we did become lost  on our way. Even worse—almost as if planned—the rain began to pour down heavily and soak what little clothes we had brought on our journey. Not having had the foresight to bring a jacket, we did the best we could and sought shelter under a rocky overhang we hadn't seen before.

The rain fell in clumps now, and if I had been with anyone else I might've felt afraid. But not Grace. Though she wasn't my actual sister, she may as well have been. I loved Grace, and I trusted her.

*I trusted her with my life.*

Within a minute or two, I felt something soft and warm around my ankle before being pulled violently away from my friend and through an unseen hole in the rocks. I managed to stay conscious as I screamed out to my friend to help.

""Grace!""

Suddenly I was in a vast cavern that shone brightly, lit with some powerful force that I still can't explain. The luminescence was almost blinding, yet in my state of confusion I managed to stand. Once I had been pulled inside completely, the warm thing that had grabbed me relented its hold on my leg. Maybe it figured there was no escaping now anyway.

What I saw next is so frightening that I doubt you'll believe me. Nearly crying, I spun around rapidly to examine the cave and found that I wasn't alone. Many of my neighbors were there, and even some of my friends.

""How did—""

My voice stammered and fell short as I realized something was very wrong.

*They weren't moving... and they looked different.*

*Almost Shiny.*

Though to anyone else the figures might have passed for human, I knew these people—*and I could tell. Their eyes*— though the correct color—were blank and frightening. They were alive yet dead.

I began to back up slowly when I felt a hand grasp my shoulder tightly. I screamed and fell backwards onto the far too warm floor of the cave.

""Jessica,"" Grace whispered, ""we have to get out of here."" Not even thinking twice, she had crawled through the rocky hole after me.

*I wonder to this day if I would have done the same for her.*

We held hands as the two of us walked backwards towards the opening, never letting our eyes off the creatures that lined the walls all around us.

*And then they moved.*

Our neighbors and our friends began to walk towards us. Some shuffled awkwardly, while others began to do something far worse.

Their bodies split open, revealing a sharp, elaborate group of tentacles where their heart and organs should have been. The figures circled around us, and I knew that there could be no escape.

Her words cut through the darkness.

""Light the match Jessica,"" she called up to me, having already torn the newspaper we had planned on using for a fire into a small pile on the floor.

""What?"" I asked shakily.

But there was no fear in her voice.

""Do it. They're gonna kill us anyway... and I don't want to be one of *those things*.""

Neither did I.

What else could I do but light the match?

And with it, the entire cavern began to erupt in flames. The monsters watched in shock, and then rage. Their anger made them fast as they shuffled towards us... but we were fast too. *Young and fast*, and we crawled through the rocks with a speed we didn't know we had, the intense heat of the fire burning our ankles and shoes.

I emerged out from the small hole first with Grace right behind me.

But when I knelt down to offer her my hand... I was a split second too late. I could feel her fingers scrape along my palm as she screamed and was pulled back into the inferno.

That was ten years ago, almost to the day.

*""Let me in,""* Grace whispered from the outside of the fourteenth floor window. I realized then that she wasn't floating, but clinging, the tentacles from her chest dug deeply into the stone and concrete of the old apartment building. 

Maybe *I will* let her in.

*I think I owe her that much.*

ssmith2452,2019-08-10 18:20:32+00:00,I sold Josh Hart a Nintendo Switch in 2017. And he has paid me back,"A few months ago I posted about my situation with now former Los Angeles Lakers Guard, Josh Hart. If your not familiar with the story, [here it is](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/brvala/i_sold_josh_hart_a_switch_in_2017_and_he_still/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).

I never expected it to get the kind of attention it did. My plan was to share a pretty unique story with people, hopefully get Josh's attention and just get some tickets. Comments were hilarious and people's opinions are always good to read. I was pretty taken back with the kind of support people where willing to give me, one person going as far as to wanting to start a GoFundMe to get some tickets. So just a quick shout out to the people of Reddit, you guys are amazing.

July 6th, the Lakers acquired Anthony Davis. The Woj Bomb hit my phone and when I came across Josh Hart's name in the trade, I couldn't help but laugh. My friends hitting me up about it and even some Redditors taking some jabs at me. [Sacrifices had to be made I suppose.](https://np.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/c134ht/some_sacrifices_had_to_be_made_for_anthony_davis/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) Josh and I actually contacted each other a few times over Twitter after the trade. He assured me that he was still going to take care of me, and I wasn't in any kind of rush. The kid just got traded, and I imagine for a young player that can be pretty hectic.

[He sent me a box in the mail.](https://imgur.com/a/gvtdKou) A pair of Nike Lakers Shorts, a Lakers warm up shirt, a Lakers long sleeve shirt, 2 hats and a bag. But the cherry on top...a pair of signed game worn Kobe's, and a signed game worn number 5 rookie Josh Hart jersey. I have never owned anything game worn before, so I was floored. The smile this put on my face made me realize, I am completely happy with what I got.

Being a life long Lakers fan, I jumped at the opportunity to sell a Laker something just to have a cool story out of it. At the end of the day, I have a better story than I could have imagined. Am I going to get tickets? I don't know, and I'm not expecting them. I can always buy tickets, (as expensive as they may be) but this story and what I got in the end is worth more to me than tickets.

If there is anything more that I could ask for I guess, would be to meet Josh in person and have a laugh about all of this. That, and maybe a few rounds of Smash Bros. 4 stock, no items, Final Destination. I play a pretty mean Snake.",nba,20012

&gt; LOS ANGELES—Feeling a lingering sense of guilt over the sudden betrayal of all his values, Clippers forward Kawhi Leonard worried Friday that he had succumbed to the glitzy L.A. lifestyle after purchasing a flashy 2016 Subaru Forester. “I’ve only been in Hollywood a few weeks and I’m already living the high life. Look at this thing—lightly scratched blue paint job, one of those cords to plug in my iPod, and even a responsive set of power windows. What have I become?” said the two-time Finals MVP, who vowed not to let his new surroundings change him only to find himself cruising down the Pacific Coast Highway at 52 miles per hour with two whole cupholders holding fancy Evian water. “This just isn’t me. I can’t believe I let the dealer talk me into buying a car where you can fold both side mirrors. I told myself I wouldn’t let this town change me, but here I am, breathing in one of those vanilla air-fresheners and parking with the help of a backup camera. I can’t forget where I came from just because I’m sitting in faux leather seats.” At press time, Leonard called a childhood friend to ask if he “seems different” after purchasing a condo with central air-conditioning.",nba,16412

**Of note**

* Duncan won more regular season games

* Kobe has the edge in points, assists and steals

* Duncan blocked and rebounded more, turned it over less and had a better FG%

* The top 10 games in terms of scoring all belong to Kobe - he scored between 31-44 points 10 times

* Duncan only cracked 30 once, scoring exactly 30

* Duncan also has [the only 20-20 game](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200302140LAL.html), going for 28 points and 20 rebounds (10 offensive)

All in all, I think this looks as we expected.

**Of note**

* Kobe won more playoff games

* Kobe still leads in points, assists and steals, and they now have the exact same FG% at .473. Very impressive for a guard who took many tough shots

* Duncan still edges him in rebounds and blocks, with more than twice as many in either category

* Duncan added 1 whole assist, while Kobe added 0.2

* Duncan now has more turnovers, adding 1.5 TOV, while Kobe added only 0.1 TOV

* The top 10 games in terms of scoring are more even: Duncan has 4 of them, while Kobe has 6

* Duncan has 4 20-20 games


They both elevated their games come playoff time and it shows in their stats.

**In summation**

Kobe and Duncan are two all-time greats. They dominated the West, and the NBA, for more than a decade.

Duncan has the edge in their regular season match-ups, in part because the Spurs have been so stable for the last 20 years while the Lakers had ups and downs.

Kobe has the edge in their playoff match-ups, but they won the same amount of rings (5)

In total, Kobe won 39 games and Duncan won 43 games. Two evenly matched giants of the game, whose presences are sorely missed.

chief_sitass,2019-07-25 15:59:17+00:00,Jeremy Lin's 89 points in his first three starts are the most by any NBA player since the NBA and ABA merged in 1976.,"Over his first two years, Jeremy Lin  was a hero, a goat, a savior, an icon, a punching bag, and also a point guard. That's a lot of hats for a kid who had only wore two jerseys at the beginning of the 2011-12 campaign. Since then he has played for a total of eight different teams and has most recently won a championship with Toronto.

It's common to refer to Lin's journey as a roller coaster ride. But that's not entirely accurate, mostly because roller coasters don't feature belligerent fans and detractors screaming at one another across the tracks. ""Divisive"" is a good word to use to describe Lin's career.

**Feb. 4, 2012**

After playing just 55 minutes all season, Lin came out of nowhere to log 36 minutes against the New Jersey Nets on Feb. 4, 2012. The Knicks had lost 11 of their previous 13 games, so perhaps coach Mike D'Antoni was desperate for some kind of spark. Lin pumped in 25 points, dished out seven dimes and grabbed five rebounds in a 99-92 Knicks win. As would so often be the case in the coming weeks, he found himself in front of a microphone trying to explain what had just happened.

**Feb. 10, 2012**

It's hard to pinpoint the moment when Linsanity really started, but I like to use his 38 points against Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers in Madison Square Garden as the unofficial genesis.

**Feb. 14, 2012**

There's not a lot to say here, other than that Linsanity had already reached a fever pitch at this point. A game-winning triple against the Toronto Raptors wasn't necessary to grow the already outsized legend, but Lin hit one anyway.

**March 14, 2012**

In what could be considered the beginning of the end of Linsanity, D'Antoni resigned on March 14, 2012 after the Knicks finished a 2-6 stretch with Anthony back in the lineup.

Now, eight years removed from that historic 26-game run in orange and blue, we still don't really know *how* to have a conversation about the game's most influential Asian American player. From a basketball perspective, he was a good player on the NBA's most hopeless franchise. Beyond that? Lin's quick and relentless ascent into symbolism has stripped most of the nuance from conversations about him and his cultural impact. He's either up on a pedestal or he fell off it a long time ago.",nba,3446

chief_sitass,2019-07-23 16:14:02+00:00,Steven Adams is the youngest of 18 children. The boys in his family have an average height of 6 feet 9 inches and the girls average at 6 feet. One of his sisters is an Olympic Gold Medalist in shot put.,"Steven Funaki Adams was born on July 20, 1993 to an English father, Sid Adams, and a Tongan mother, Lilika Nguamo. Sid Adams was a member of the English Royal Navy and fathered his 18 children with five different women, although some say it’s actually 21 with six different women.

Adams’ siblings include older sister Valerie Adams, a three-time Olympian in the shot put for New Zealand. She was a two-time Olympic gold medalist in 2008 and 2012, then followed that with a silver medal in 2016. The four-time World Champion has earned 15 gold medals at major international competitions during her career. Also, Warren and Sid Jr., as well as four other brothers, all played professional basketball in New Zealand.

Adams remembered being severely bullied by his older brothers growing up and his only defense was to cry. That would ultimately bring his Dad into the picture to help save him. Over time though, Adams’ bond with his 17 siblings grew even tighter.

Steven Adams was born when his father was in his 60s, and Sid died after a battle with stomach cancer in 2006 when his youngest son was only 13 years old. After his father’s death, Adams began getting into trouble and skipping school. He later became involved with the Mongrel Mob, an organized street gang in New Zealand with more than thirty chapters across the country. Before he officially joined, his older brother Warren stepped in to right the ship.

“When I lost my dad, that was a big hit for me,’’ Adams told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “I didn’t have that parental guidance, and I kind of took advantage of it because I was a stupid idiot.”

Eventually Warren — who had played on the New Zealand National Team — took him to live with him in Wellington. He got him into an academy run by former teammate Kenny McFadden, and the latter arranged for a scholarship to posh Scots College.

Standing 6-foot-5 at 14 years old, Adams would begin to learn the game of basketball in a stable environment despite it being almost six hours away from his family life.

Adams impressed enough people to earn an invite to the Adidas Nations Tournament, a basketball camp in Los Angeles for international prospects. There, he would lead all players by averaging 22.0 points and 16.8 rebounds. After one postgraduate season at Notre Dame Preparatory School in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, he began to draw attention from college basketball teams, but only Pitt ended up being the right fit.

Adams left Pitt after a successful season for his next hurdle in the NBA. There, the Oklahoma City Thunder selected Adams with the 12th-overall pick in the first round of the 2013 NBA Draft.",nba,1614

Lance getting nods from Nicki for the infamous incident where Lance blew into LeBron’s ear. Chris Brown’s hook is repetitive, but alright for pop standards. Drake’s verse is kind of funny but like really awkward in the sense that 75% of his verse is “Yo I know you gotta man, but yo I really want to have sex with you. Now I won’t though because you gotta man, but like for real baby, we should have sex. For clarity listeners we’ve not engaged in sexual relations. In fact I have sex with other hot women, and people in positions of power also enjoy my company.” Drake really cleared up the rumors that Drake and Nicki never were together. Wayne’s verse started off phoning in, but finished pretty well. The production was fine.

Kanye brags about his relevance and how Adidas doesn’t resort to the use of sweatshops. This track changed a lot, and when TLOP got released before the Patches (aka the 1.04 Charlie Heat addition), this song sounded horrible. Charlie Heat really improved this track, making it sound less dark and more positive. Kanye is the GOAT, but this is in my opinion my least favorite Kanye song.

-Kanye came in with The College Dropout and Late Registration as one of the most loved faces in music, and came into with LeBron esque dominance. Kanye gradually became more hated by the media and wine moms everywhere after him criticizing FEMA and the whole Taylor Swift Incident. LeBron when he made his decision to go to Miami became one of the best villains in NBA history. Kanye responded to the hatred by the media by releasing the greatest album of all time in MBDTF, while LeBron won two champions with Miami.

This is my close second favorite song of all time. Pusha T has never sounded hungrier in his life on a track, he made every bar count. This is Kanye’s best verse he’s ever written, and I’ve never seen such great technical display while telling an in depth experience of how it feels to go from rags to riches. Ghostface Killah really does a great job wrapping up this track, and even though he has nothing to prove as he is on Hip Hop’s Mt Rushmore, he dished out another gem.

Kanye is really is the LeBron of rap, both came from struggle and Kanye, both entered the game in 2003 and LeBron have been the best player/rapper every year since LeBron’s rookie year.

This song is the greatest song of all time. You think I’m using hyperbole but this song will never cease to give me chills. Kanye portrayed being in a toxic relationship in an introspective and beautiful way. This instrumental made with the help of Bink and Mike Dean I am not smart enough to explain, but if you take the lyrics out of this song, it would still portray strong emotions. Rick Ross’s verse is the one of the best features in hip-hop history, with so many memorables and hunger, and having it played in harmony with Mike Dean’s Electric Guitar...god man. I dare you to find a better guitar solo than Mike Dean’s.

-This is not the most viewed lyric, but this whole track is just a huge wave of escalating energy. He has tons of NBA references, such as “Keep a 30 like Curry” and “Clip long like DeAndre Jordan”. This escalation of how hard this track goes is unmatched. Also this is the [dunk heMs referencing](https://youtu.be/WNemKXW6YcM)

I freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik

Jam like a TEC with correct techniques.”*

-This was a tough decision to make, between Nas and Biggie, but Nas made the most influential rap album of all time in the Illmatic. It’s as essential to hip hop has the three pointer is to basketball. Honestly, It Ain’t Hard to Tell has one of the best Jazz beats I’ve ever listened to, and Nas lyricism  is matched by very fee rappers.

-Kanye makes an amazing song about him dealing with the loss of his Grandmother, and it really moved me listening to this when my Grandfather died. It’s a good message saying that our society has the tools to give help to people, but choose to only give them to rich people with an incentive of profit. His use of a choir is really what stands out in his production of this masterpiece.

naforever,2019-07-17 13:15:43+00:00,Some pics from my sixth year of daily-driving the NSX,"I have been daily-driving my 1995 NSX for about six years, starting in the Washington DC area, then in Honolulu, and now in southern California. Like my previous posts ([Year 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8zkwf2/some_pics_from_my_fifth_year_of_dailydriving_the/) | [Year 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/6nstoy/some_pics_from_my_fourth_year_of_dailydriving_the/) | [Year 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/3yrg71/some_pics_from_my_third_year_of_dailydriving_the/) | [Year 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/2s3hiq/some_pics_from_my_second_year_of_dailydriving_the/) | [Year 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1tkvgj/some_pics_from_my_first_year_of_dailydriving_the/)) here are some highlights.

Looking back, it was a pretty chill year and I didn’t do nearly as many long drives or epic road trips. Mostly [day-to-day stuff](https://i.imgur.com/OGwLBdF.jpg).

There is some pretty awesome stuff in our area though.

* Got to go see the Mars InSight landing at [NASA JPL](https://imgur.com/V5YvPJe) although there was no way I could get my personal spaceship close enough for a picture with anything that could actually go to space.
* Lots of local drives. It is pretty fucking cool that [Angeles Crest](https://imgur.com/Tc9fh7T) is just another local drive, and I enjoy showing friends from out of town some of the side routes.
* Kinda the birthplace of the NSX design. Ken Okuyama, who designed the Pininfarina HP-X concept which would become the NSX graduated from the [ArtCenter College of Design](https://imgur.com/ZSeyg28) (although that design would be finished up in-house by Masahito Nakano). Incidentally, the designer for the second-gen NSX, Michelle Christensen, is also an ACCD alum
* Oh yeah and of course the city of [Los Angeles](https://imgur.com/c59sfDb) itself has quite a lot to offer, like the [Petersen Automotive Museum](https://imgur.com/5YTCkuv) which I think is proof positive that this is probably the best car city in the world.

The year started pretty cold and wet, which is pretty rare in SoCal. 

* It really makes for the [best pics](https://imgur.com/eLUwzkr) though, as long as you can stay dry.
* Because it rains so infrequently, I really appreciate [shots like this](https://imgur.com/stjSXOe). 
* And [cozy moments](https://imgur.com/iJjutg1).
* Although muddy roads ruin your drive on the way to [photo shoots](https://imgur.com/ffgdSkr). 
* The best thing about the geography though is that we still have [seasons](https://imgur.com/hDGsoNr), but we can just [go visit them](https://imgur.com/c59sfDb) instead of having to live in it.

When things dried out a bit:

* Took the NSX out to the track [Chuckwalla Raceway](https://imgur.com/5wBCnh1), actually.
* Did some maintenance and clean-up [still no garage of my own](https://imgur.com/YDiXjup)
* More regular maintenance, just [throwing money at the car](https://imgur.com/DPRGhUN)
* Some detailing/clean-up at IKEA (which has [great lighting in the parking structure](https://imgur.com/ljfOVJE)  if you don’t have a garage)
* Installed some [parts](https://imgur.com/3P21pcu), finally (these taillights were sitting since Hawai’i).

All that work just for [Costco](https://imgur.com/NVHiz99) hahaha 

I did some car meets and events as usual, but also not as many as last year. The main ones for me were:

* the Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach (first year of Acura taking over from Toyota as title sponsor. This was my first [Indycar](https://imgur.com/LCgeGIk) race also and it was a good complement to my usual F1 trips.
* and of course NSXPO, which was in [San Francisco](https://imgur.com/mFAQPGa) this year. 
* Because this [NSXPO](https://imgur.com/tlQ25ME) was a lot closer than most of the other ones I’ve gone to, I consider this the primary culprit for my relatively short drives this year haha
* Here is my own NSX with [the very first NSX I sat in](https://imgur.com/Z8QJzCp). I had just started college at the time, driving an Acura Legend sedan, and there wasn’t anyone local to me who I could join for drives. This guy invited me to join on his runs up the area’s mountains and canyons and it made a huge impression on me as a car enthusiast.

Speaking of that car, here it is: [KA7 Acura Legend](https://imgur.com/rcBtEX1). I’ve mentioned it in other posts but this year was ‘official’: we gave up the car and it is no longer in my family’s possession so I did that ceremonial last drive. It was a good long journey.

Some stats from the year:

* 23.2 average MPG (0.5 MPG worse than last year)
* 35.2  highest MPG (7.0 MPG better than last year)
* 19.5 lowest MPG (0.7 MPG worse than last year)
* 49.73 miles per day

Hope you enjoyed the pics; I took most of them myself using a phone and I try to be fairly active on Instagram (@nsxlife) as well.

I love Bethesda fallout games, and I actually started with 3/NV(can’t remember which I played first).But my god did fallout 1 have the perfect soundtrack and atmosphere. I had an unexpected joyride wandering the remnants of Los Angeles. I’m still not sure it’s my favourite yet. Currently it would have to be fallout NV or 4.

TakpakMagoo,2019-07-13 18:38:39+00:00,What players are closest to becoming their franchise's all-time leading scorer?,"Pending no other big off-season moves, no team will have its franchise's all-time leading scorer at the start of next season ([https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cchb1n/with\_russell\_westbrook\_being\_traded\_6\_teams\_have/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cchb1n/with_russell_westbrook_being_traded_6_teams_have/)). So, which players are closest to reaching that mark? And how close are they? 

The players in bold are each franchise's all-time leading scorer. The first two players for each team are that team's current leading scorers. Teams are sorted by how many points their all-time leading scorer has scored, from least to most. 

Next to each player is a potential scenario for them to become the new all-time leading scorer. In most cases, I tried to keep the 'PPG' number close to their PPG last season. The exceptions to that rule should be evident...I hope.

chief_sitass,2019-07-13 04:56:26+00:00,Former NBA Player is now worth nearly $400 Million despite being a bench player his entire career.,"Ulysses Lee “Junior” Bridgeman was born on September 17, 1953 in East Chicago, Indiana. His father was a blue collar steel mill worker – a very common job in East Chicago during the era in which Junior Bridgeman grew up. He was a member of the undefeated (29-0) 1971 East Chicago Washington High School Senators basketball team that won the Indiana state high school basketball championship. 

At 6’5″ Bridgeman played guard and forward during college at the University of Louisville. After obtaining his bachelor’s degree, Junior Bridgeman was drafted with the 8th overall pick in the first round of the 1975 NBA Draft by the Los Angeles Lakers and was then immediately traded to the Milwaukee Bucks forKareem Abdul-Jabbar.

In his 12-year NBA career Bridgeman was mostly a sixth man. For nine consecutive seasons he averaged double figures in scoring. He holds the Milwaukee franchise record for number of games played at 711, though he only started in 105 of those games.

Bridgeman was a good basketball player, solid and steady. His professional career lasted from 1975 to 1987, in the era just before players were paid crazy amounts of money. Players like Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson made the bulk of their money from endorsement deals, but still made a lot of money in the NBA – close to $100 million for Jordan. Bridgeman never saw anywhere close to that kind of money during his NBA days. His peak salary was $350,000 from the Clippers in 1985.

Unlike most athletes, Junior was quick to realize that his window of time in the NBA would be relatively short. At some point the paychecks would stop coming in and he would need to find a new source of steady income. So, on a whim, Junior decided to purchase a franchise of his favorite fast food restaurant: Wendy’s. While other NBA players hung out during the off season doing God knows what, Bridgeman was working in local Wendy’s—learning his burgeoning business from every angle and building a foundation for the rest of his and his family’s lives.

By the time his playing days were over, Junior owned three Wendy’s. Junior is the second largest owner of Wendy’s franchises in America.",nba,2809
Hey_Im_Probably_Okay,2019-07-11 20:19:28+00:00,Nicklas Backstrom is on track to be the first player to sign a 10+ year contract and play the entire length of the deal with one team (excluding Wayne Gretzky's contract that he signed in the WHA),"https://www.capfriendly.com/signings/all/all/all/10-15

Only 19 players in the era recorded by CapFriendly have ever signed a contract with a length of 10 years or over. Here's what happened to all of them:

*Italics denote a player who can still theoretically play the entire thing for one team (e.g. hasn't been traded and can still actually play)*.

**Buffalo Sabres**

- Christian Ehrhoff: 10-year deal from 2011-2021. Bought out in 2014.

**Chicago Blackhawks**

- Marian Hossa: 13-year deal from 2010-2022. Traded to Arizona in the 2018 offseason.

- *Duncan Keith: 13-year deal until 2023. Still with Blackhawks.*

**Detroit Red Wings**

- Henrik Zetterberg: 12-year deal from 2009-2021. Contract still with Red Wings, but did not play last season.

- Johan Franzen: 11-year deal from 2009-2020. Contract still with Red Wings, but has not played since 2015-16 season.

**Los Angeles Kings**

- *Jonathan Quick: 10-year deal until 2023. Still with Kings.*

**Minnesota Wild**

- *Zach Parise: 13-year deal until 2025. Still with Wild.*

- *Ryan Suter: 13-year deal until 2025. Still with Wild.*

**Nashville Predators**

- Shea Weber: 14-year deal until 2026. Traded to the Montreal Canadiens in 2016.

**New Jersey Devils**

- Ilya Kovalchuk: 15-year deal until 2025. Retired in 2013.

**New York Islanders**

- Alexei Yashin: 10-year deal from 2001-2011. Bought out in 2007. This is the only one of the 10-year-or-more deals that is not on any team's payroll.

- Rick DiPietro: 15-year deal from 2006-2021. Bought out in 2013.

**Philadelphia Flyers**

- Mike Richards: 12-year deal from 2008-2020. Traded to the Los Angeles Kings in 2011.

- Jeff Carter: 11-year deal from 2011-2022. Traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets before the extension actually kicked in.

**Pittsburgh Penguins**

- *Sidney Crosby: 12-year deal until 2025. Still with Penguins.*

**Tampa Bay Lightning**

- Vincent Lecavalier: 11-year deal from 2009-2020. Bought out in 2013.

**Vancouver Canucks**

- Roberto Luongo: 12-year deal from 2010-2022. Retired in 2019.

**Washington Capitals**

- *Nicklas Backstrom: 10-year deal from 2010-2020. Still with 
Capitals.*

- *Alexander Ovechkin: 13-year deal from 2008-2021. Still with Capitals.*


Basically, there are currently seven of the 19 players to sign 10+ year contracts who could still finish out the entire thing playing for the same team that signed them to the contract. The first one will probably be Backstrom, who will be likely joined by Ovechkin the summer afterwards.",hockey,1057

camly75,2019-07-11 11:45:56+00:00,Phil Coke and the Quest for 512 Wins: An OOTP Experiment,"Happy All Star Break, everyone

In professional baseball’s 150-year history, the game has changed quite a bit. Long gone are the days when a team’s ace would pitch 350 innings per season over the course of 40 starts. That’s why Cy Young’s all-time record of 511 wins is impossible to break, at least the way pitchers are currently used. Young won 25 or more games 12 times in his career, which spanned from 1890 to 1911. But it’s been nearly 30 years since a pitcher reached that mark. The last to do so was Bob Welch, who went 27-6 with the 1990 A’s despite being the third best pitcher on his team. (One game Welch could not win, however, was Game 2 of the World Series, in which he allowed 2 doubles and a triple to Billy Hatcher in a 5-4 loss.) It’s safe to say that no pitcher will ever come close to winning 511 games ever again. Unless, that is, we push the boundaries of what it means to win a game.

I’m sure you don’t need me to tell you that the win statistic is pretty dumb. It largely rewards a pitcher for having a good offense around him. One interesting wrinkle is that starting pitchers are required to pitch at least 5 innings to be eligible for the victory. If the starter is pulled with the lead before the end of the fifth inning, then his replacement is in line for the victory instead. This rule is a major reason why Tampa Bay “bulk guy” Ryan Yarbrough was able to win 16 games in 2018 despite making just 6 starts. I decided to take this rule to the absolute extreme. With the singular goal of maximizing his win total, I believe that even a mediocre relief pitcher could blow past Cy Young’s record of 511 wins.

The easy choice for my guinea pig is Phil Coke, former middle reliever for the Tigers and Yankees, among other teams. Choosing Coke was a no-brainer not just because I’ve written about him in the past, but because he is statistically a very average pitcher, with a 101 ERA+ for his career.

So now that we’ve decided on the player, let’s figure out how this simulation will work. I placed a 20-year-old Coke on the Red Sox, the team that scored the most runs in the league in 2018. I will then manually play each game. If his team has the lead with two outs in the 5th inning, I will pull the starting pitcher and insert Coke for the third out. And that’s it! As long as the bullpen doesn’t blow the game, Phil Coke gets the win. It’s that simple. Additionally, Coke may come into a tie game if I have reason to believe his team will take the lead by the time he comes out. The AI will decide when to pull Coke and what pitchers to insert for the rest of the game. Coke will do this from age 20 until he burns out. And we will be with him every step of the way. I will control the Red Sox and whatever other teams bring Coke in for his services. In my role as GM, I will acquire bullpen arms to preserve the lead (so long as they do not displace Coke), and I will insert our hero into the game at the proper time. Other than that, I will be completely hands off. The computer assistant GM can make any additional transactions that it sees fit, including cutting ties with Phil or immediately reversing any of my moves.

It probably isn’t a good baseball strategy: the bullpen will be absolutely gassed by the middle of the season. But I don’t care. Even if the Red Sox win 60 games, it’ll be a successful year if Coke wins 50 of them. One of the most interesting things to see will be how Coke is regarded. Will his absurdly high wins total be enough for him to receive awards at the end of each year? Will it be enough for voters to give him a Hall of Fame nod? And will he be able to stick around long enough to break Cy Young’s unbreakable record?

Let’s begin.

**2018: 50-2, 3.09 ERA**

Determined to create a super-bullpen behind Coke, I acquired Aroldis Chapman and his contract as my first move in exchange for Eduardo Núñez. Then, I traded prospects Tanner Houck and Bobby Dalbec for Josh Hader. As a result, the bullpen seemed to get a little too good. After a 5-0 start and 0.96 ERA, Coke was placed on waivers just 15 days into the season. After being claimed by the Kansas City Royals, his time in Boston came to a quick end.  Winning became significantly more difficult. After I traded for Joakim Soria and Sergio Romo, Coke won AL Pitcher of the Month for his 9-0 record. But from May 1st to May 17th, Coke failed to win a single game. With the Royals in the midst of a 12-game losing streak, I decided I had seen enough. On May 26th, after just over a month with the Royals, I made the executive decision to trade Coke back to the Red Sox. His 7 wins in Kansas City were still the second most by any Royals pitcher.

For the rest of the season, it was smooth sailing. Coke was named pitcher of the month every month except for May. Yet for some reason, he didn’t receive a single Cy Young vote. In August, he received the award thanks to a 10-0 record, despite his 6.97 ERA, 2.42 WHIP, and -0.4 WAR. The game simply didn’t know what to make of him. The AI made a series of strange moves for the team as well, trading Craig Kimbrel for Evan Gattis, and even more surprisingly trading Chris Sale for Paul Goldschmidt in a 1-1 deal. But despite Coke’s 50 wins, the Red Sox were bumped by Cleveland in the ALCS. Now with a season under his belt, Coke looks forward to getting back out there and winning games.

**2019: 41-4, 2.56 ERA**

Despite a 50-victory campaign for the Sox in 2018, it didn’t take long for Coke to be on the move again. After a 3-0 start in 5 games, Coke was waived and claimed by the Milwaukee Brewers on April 13th. To assist Coke at the back end of the bullpen, I acquired Raisel Iglesias and Adam Warren. The season was mostly a slog. The Brewers won just 68 games, but Coke was the winning pitcher in over half of them. I have also noticed that Coke will pick up a hold any time his bullpen blows a game in which he would have gotten the win. He had 13 holds in 2019.  In exactly 100 appearances, Coke pitched just 84.2 innings, enough to pick up 41 wins. Though he missed the All Star Game and did not place in Cy Young voting, Coke was named NL Pitcher of the Month four times. It also was not enough to give him NL reliever of the year, as Reds closer Austin Brice (?!) saved 43 games with a 1.77 ERA. Regardless, Coke improves to 91-6 for his career, despite relatively pedestrian numbers in every other way. After signing a 1-year extension, Coke hopes to have some job security in 2020.

**2020: 51-4, 3.66 ERA**

The Brewers got out to a hot start, and so did Phil Coke. Through the first two months, his team was in first place, and Coke was a league-best 17-1 with a 2.90 ERA. However, things fell apart a bit in June. Though he went 7-0 and won pitcher of the month, Coke posted a 5.54 ERA and 1.69 WHIP for the month. Though his actual performance doesn’t matter in Coke’s quest to beat Cy Young’s record, it clearly bugged the Brewers. On July 6th, Phil Coke was waived once again. This time he was claimed by the Toronto Blue Jays, who slotted him right into the bullpen. It was Coke’s 4th team in just 2.5 seasons. Though the Jays somehow had Paul Goldschmidt and Bryce Harper in the lineup, along with Guerrero and Bo Bichette, they were just 41-45 when Coke joined the team. But things turned around quickly north of the border after this acquisition, as they rallied to take the Wild Card. Coke had a terrific August, going 7-0 with a 0.55 ERA. But his team won despite him in September, as Coke went 11-1 but had a 7.62 ERA and 1.69 WHIP. He won Pitcher of the Month both months. Ultimately, they ended up losing to the Angels in the Wild Card game. Overall, Coke set a new career high in the victory column, but had his worst season in many ways. His 3.66 ERA and 1.31 WHIP were pedestrian. The game seems to be eager to give a high-win, low-everything else pitcher certain awards, while shying away from giving him others. Coke was named Pitcher of the Month in all six months this year, yet he was not an All Star. He now has received 15 Pitcher of the Month awards, yet he did not receive a single vote in either Cy Young or Reliever of the Year voting. Phil Coke is an enigma. An enigma who has won 142 games in 3 seasons.

**2021: 44-1, 2.80 ERA**

After a rough end to the 2020 season, Coke came into 2021 with his Toronto future in jeopardy. He immediately silenced his doubters with one of the most remarkable months anyone has ever seen. In April, Coke was a perfect 10-0 with a 0.44 ERA and 0.74 WHIP, as the Jays jumped out to a 17-8 start despite the fact that 5 different starting pitchers were on the DL by the end of the month. But Coke’s brilliance wasn’t meant to last. He blew a 15-appearance scoreless streak on May 11th by allowing a home run to Cristian Pache, though he did end up winning that game. By the end of the month, his ERA was over 4 after a 7-run disaster against the Orioles on May 29th. The team fell apart shortly thereafter, going 6-21 in June. With all the injuries to the staff, the Jays targeted pitching at the deadline. Unfortunately, that means Coke was once again crowded out of the bullpen. I’m not sure why this keeps happening, but Coke was on the move once again at the All Star Break, this time heading back to the Kansas City Royals, with whom he pitched 18 games in 2018. His new team struggled, largely due to the rotation’s 5.87 ERA, but Coke went 17-0 with a 2.25 ERA down the stretch. He continues to be used more and more frequently, as his 109 appearances led the league. There were 19 games this season in which he left the game with the lead, only to see it frittered away by the bullpen. In four seasons, Coke now has 186 wins. His 63 wins in Milwaukee are 11th in team history, and his 53 wins in Toronto are 12th. Coke seems to be on pace to break Cy Young’s record, so long as he has his health and his playing time.

**2022: 36-4, 4.15 ERA**

The Royals got out to a hot start in 2022, going 16-11 in April and taking a 7-game lead in the AL Central by June. But as you could have guessed, this meant that they unfortunately had no use for Coke. He was waived on June 10th, despite his 17-0 record and 2.25 ERA. Three days earlier, he had won his 200th career game. Luckily, the 24-year-old Coke was able to quickly latch onto another team, as he was claimed by the Los Angeles Angels. The Angels became Coke’s fifth team. Coming into this project, I expected Coke to just pitch 20 seasons with the Red Sox and rack up a whole bunch of Ws. Somewhere down the line, the game decided to make it a lot more complicated. After just four games in Anaheim, Coke suffered the first injury of his career: a back injury that cost him two weeks. He came back to a team in the midst of a huge losing streak, and as a result went nearly a full month between wins. The Angels went 7-18 in July, and Coke was just 3-1, the fewest games he’s ever won in a month. The AI opted to sell at the deadline, sending Shohei Ohtani to Baltimore. The Angels still somehow managed to finish just one game out of the playoffs despite going 80-82. Coke had the worst season of his young career, and with the Angels he had a 5.95 ERA and 1.82 WHIP in 44 appearances. A free agent after the season, Coke’s future is in jeopardy. His 222 career wins are tied with Tim Hudson for 61st most all-time. His 5.2 WAR equals Kyle Davies.

**2023: 45-3, 2.48 ERA**

This offseason, free agent Phil Coke decided to sign with the Boston Red Sox again, going back to where it all began. The Sox gave him a 3-year, $11 million deal, which was a little lower than I was hoping for. These were not the Red Sox of a few years ago. Their starting first baseman was Daniel Vogelbach, and their best starting pitcher was someone named [Tyler Blomster](https://minesathletics.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=6763). But as the team struggled, Coke was able to pick up wins at a record pace. At one point, he had 17 of the team’s 21 wins. In May, he won 11 games despite a 2.05 WHIP. But despite some hiccups, it was a banner year for Coke. For the first time in his career, he played an entire season with the same team. He was named to his second All Star team and was the runner-up for AL Reliever of the Year. Though he missed three weeks with back tightness again, Coke pitched in 100 games and won 45. His 267 career wins rank him 35th all-time, just behind Jim Palmer.

**2024: 49-7, 4.60 ERA**

If you thought Coke’s successful 2023 would give him job security going forward, you’d be mistaken. After a rough start that saw the Sox begin 6-12 and Coke post a 10.38 ERA in his first 10 appearances, Boston DFA’d their star reliever. This time, he was claimed by the Houston Astros, fresh off an 81-81 season and their first playoff miss since 2016. Coke picked up the W in his first game in Houston, and he won 46 more by the end of the season. On August 17th, he won his 300th career game. Clearly thanks to this marquee acquisition, the Astros excelled down the stretch. After a 17-10 September, they went back to the playoffs before falling to the Angels in the ALDS in 4 games. But despite all the winning, Coke had easily his worst statistical season. He saw his rating fall to just 2 stars, and his 4.60 ERA, 1.41 WHIP, and 6.1 K/9 were all career worsts. Coke has one more year with the Astros (or whomever he ends up with) before he becomes a free agent again. His 316 career wins now rank him 16th of all time, just behind Phil Niekro. His 6.6 WAR ties him with Tommy Milone.

**2025: 53-2, 3.12 ERA**

Coke had a bounceback season in 2025, setting a career high with 53 victories and posting a solid ERA. His 112 appearances were not just a career high, but an all-time record. Here is what that [leaderboard](https://imgur.com/NPvWhz4) now looks like in the Coke era. Brett Cecil won 4 games and posted a 4.44 ERA in his historic 2020 campaign. Coke began the season the wrong way, taking the loss after giving up two runs to the Indianapolis Rattlers (formerly the Oakland Athletics). He bounced back quickly, but when closer Jandel Gustave came off the Injured List in mid-May, the Astros had no room in their bullpen for Coke. Once again, he was forced to be on the move, this time being claimed off waivers by the Chicago White Sox. Coke immediately thrived in his seventh organization, picking up the win in 7 of his first 8 appearances as his team surged. The Sox were 23-25 before picking him up, but they quickly fought their way into wild card contention before struggling down the stretch and finishing at 82-80. Coke was named AL Pitcher of the Month all 6 months but finished a distant 5th in Reliever of the Year voting. It’s clear that Player of the Month voters value different statistics than season-end award voters, but what will Hall of Fame voters think of Phil when the time comes? After 8 seasons, Coke is 5th all-time in wins with 369. But as he hits free agency again this offseason, his future is up for grabs.

**2026: 54-4, 2.16 ERA**

For much of the offseason, Coke remained unsigned. But finally, on the first day of Spring Training, Coke signed with the Detroit Tigers. Continuing his tour around the AL Central, he signed a 1-year, $1.2 million deal with the team he’s perhaps most closely associated with in real life. Joining Coke in the Tigers’ bullpen is 38-year-old Aroldis Chapman, who will be making upwards of $16 million despite his lowly ratings. Coke began the season hot, going 6-0 without surrendering a single run in his first 12 appearances. But it wasn’t meant to last. On April 16th Coke sprained his ankle, the first major injury of his career. After 5 weeks on the sidelines and two games in Toledo, Coke came back at the end of May. And when he came back, he seemed devoted to making up for lost time. In the month of June, Coke went an absurd 16-1, pitching in 23 of his team’s 27 games. The success of his team helped quite a bit, too. From June 2nd to the 14th, the Tigers won 11 straight games, and Coke picked up the W in 9 of those games. He was named an All Star for just the third time, pitching a scoreless 2nd inning for the American League. Despite the injury, 2026 may have been the apex of Coke’s career. His 54 wins, 2.16 ERA, and 1.06 WHIP are career bests to this point, and he still led the league with 96 appearances despite missing a full month. He finally won his first Reliever of the Year Award, and he finished third in Cy Young voting. This was also the season that saw Coke surpass Walter “The Big Train” Johnson for second place on the win leaderboard, finishing the year at 423. The only pitcher he has left to beat is Cy Young himself, and at his pace, Coke could pass him in just two seasons.

**2027: 0-0, 0.00 ERA**

After posting the best season of his career, the 29-year-old Coke signed a 3-year deal with the Toronto Blue Jays worth $20.7 million. He had previously pitched with the Jays in parts of the 2020 and 2021 seasons. Unfortunately, he underwent elbow surgery at the end of March, forcing him to miss the entire season. Hopefully this setback doesn’t hurt his quest too much.

**2028: 22-2, 2.58 ERA**

The injury bug strikes again. On March 19th, Coke injured his hamstring, sidelining him until late May. After three rehab appearances with Buffalo, Coke finally returned to the majors on May 28th with the Jays in the middle of a 6 game losing streak. Following an 8-17 June for the team, Coke had just three victories to his name. With such a dreadful team surrounding him, Coke had very few opportunities to pad his stats. His Jays finished the season 5th in the AL East, ahead of only the expansion Columbus Flight. Though he didn’t reach his usual standard, Coke did lead the league still with 22 wins. His other statistics were in line with his career averages, and he is still just 30 years old. Coke has another year in Toronto before becoming a free agent yet again. His 445 wins are second in MLB history, and the 75 games he won in a Jays uniform places them 8th on their all-time list. The 2029 season will be very important for Coke if he wants to get back on pace to beat Cy Young’s record. 

**2029: 51-2, 2.48 ERA**

Finally healthy, Coke put together one of the best seasons of his career. He pitched in an even hundred games, his third time hitting that milestone on the nose. He was able to put together his first 50-win season in three years while setting personal bests with 1.5 WAR and a 1.00 WHIP. Coke very nearly won his second Reliever of the Year award, finishing second only to Bikichi Kobayashi, a Yankees rookie who won the award unanimously. The 31-year-old Coke is a free agent yet again. His three year deal with the Jays was more like 1.5 years thanks to injuries. But he was able to see it through without being DFA’d, a rarity in his career. Coke is now 4th in Blue Jays history with 126 wins, and he is second in MLB history with 496 of them. Assuming he signs on with a team this offseason, Phil Coke should become the all-time leader early next year.

**2030: 42-5, 3.79 ERA**

Up to this point, Phil Coke has spent his entire career in the American League, save for 153 appearances with the Brewers in the early ‘20s. That changed this offseason, when Coke signed a 1 year, $2.04 million deal with the San Francisco Giants, his ninth major league team. Just 16 wins away from the record, Coke got out to a hot start. His first 8 appearances with the Giants, he went 5-0, giving up just 2 hits and 0 runs. On April 8th, he won his 500th game, pitching a perfect 1.1 innings against the Padres. Though his ERA was above 5.00 just 10 days later, the wins kept coming. On May 27th, he beat the Padres again for his record-tying 511th career win. For reference, Cy Young’s final victory came in a complete game shutout of the Pirates. 119 years later, Coke tied him with a slightly less gutsy performance; the only batter he had to face was opposing pitcher Erick Perez, and he struck him out on 5 pitches. All eyes were now on the Giants and Phil Coke, who was just one win away from glory. 

Three days later, he entered the game against the El Paso Steelhounds, who joined the NL East in 2028 as an expansion team. With a 4-3 lead, the Giants inserted Coke into the game with two outs in the 5th inning. He allowed a Ronny Mauricio single and walked Dane Courson, but he got Kellum Clark to pop out to end the inning. Phil Coke was in line to make history, so long as the bullpen could hold El Paso off for the rest of the game.
They couldn’t. Luis Soriano immediately gave up a base hit, which was followed by two wild pitches and a sac fly. El Paso walked the Giants off in the 9th, and Coke picked up a hold, but not the elusive No. 512.

It only took one more day for Coke to get another shot. With a 5-4 lead, Coke entered the game once again with two outs in the 5th inning. It took him only one pitch to force a Bobby Zmarzlak groundout. He had done everything he needed to do. In the top of the 6th, the Giants scored 3 runs. With Coke’s record all but guaranteed, manager John Shelby decided to bring Coke back out for a victory lap. His second inning didn’t go according to plan. After a leadoff walk, he allowed a Seth Halvorsen single and hit Jacob Campbell with a pitch. With the bases loaded, Coke was pulled from the game for Luis Soriano. Soriano allowed two of Coke’s baserunners to score, but the score was still 8-6. After another run scored in the 7th, it was just a one run game. As it turns out, that was all Coke needed. When closer Humberto Aguilar struck out the side in the 9th, history was made. It wasn’t a good outing by any means, but it was good enough for Phil Coke to win his 512th career game. It took 13 years and collaboration from 9 different teams, but Coke was able to break baseball’s most unbreakable record without making a single start. He was worth just 11.6 WAR to this point. If you include his 6-79 line at the plate, that number drops to 10.1. It’s been a remarkably unique career. But his journey was not over yet. Phil Coke was just 32 years old. Could he make it to 600, 700, even 1000 wins? He knew he had to find out.

**2031: 35-1, 2.51 ERA**

Coke decided to stay in the National League for the 2031 season, signing a 1-year, $2.8 million deal with the St. Louis Cardinals, his 10th team. Many thought Coke’s career was in its twilight prior to the season, but he was able to prove them wrong with a little help from Cardinals’ Devil Magic. At the All Star Break, Coke was having his best season yet with a pristine 23-0 record and 1.01 ERA. Remarkably, he didn’t allow a single run in the months of May and June. (He did give up a solo home run to the only batter he faced in his 4th All Star Game, though.) But the underlying numbers showed that his hot start wasn’t meant to last. His K/9 was a career low 5.7, and he allowed 15 inherited runners to score, none of which counted to his ERA. Still, he was able to lower it to 0.89 before allowing 2 runs to the San Antonio Archers (formerly the Miami Marlins) on July 7th. Three days later, he suffered a shoulder strain that sidelined him for a month and a half. After coming back, he just wasn’t the same. As the Cardinals blew a 3-game division lead on the Reds, Coke posted a 6.28 ERA in September. He looked solid in the postseason, as the Cardinals took the Dodgers to 7 games in the NLCS, but it wasn’t enough to overcome his weak September. Coke failed to receive a single vote for reliever of the year. His rating has dropped to 1.5 stars, and he will be 34 on Opening Day. It may be difficult for him to find work next year. With 573 wins, he has won twice as many games as Bob Feller.

**2032: 4-0, 3.45 ERA**

Despite his diminished skills, there’s still a place in the Majors for Phil Coke. The Cleveland Indians signed him to a 1 year, $2.9 million deal to join their bullpen, becoming his 11th franchise. Wins were hard to come by; Coke was just 4-0 through his team’s first 24 games. But he had a reliable spot in the bullpen. Until, that is, closer Andy Murray came off the DL and Coke was designated for assignment. He passed unclaimed through waivers, and after refusing a demotion to AAA, he was released on May 4th. Phil Coke was without a home.

It didn’t take long for Coke to get snatched back up, though. Three weeks later, the St. Louis Cardinals gave him a minor league deal. It was just a year ago that he was putting up the best numbers of his career with the major league squad. He was assigned to High-A Palm Beach, where he pitched in a traditional role for the first time in his career. He thrived. Though he only won three games, he posted a 2.51 ERA with 16 “saves,” a novel concept to him. Unfortunately, he never got the call back up. The minor league season ended, and there was no room for him on the Major League roster. Phil was used to being crowded out despite his accomplishments, but this time no one was there to scoop him up. This time was different. Coke mulled retirement at the end of the season, but he ultimately decided to dedicate himself to making it back to the majors.

**2033: 1-3, 3.89 ERA (MiLB)**

Unfortunately, there is no happy ending to this chapter of Phil Coke’s career. But that certainly doesn’t mean it wasn’t interesting. On February 19th, the Rockies gave him a major league deal, presumably with the intention to bring him into their bullpen. However, for some unknown reason they decided to release him six days later. A few days passed, and that signing felt like a fluke. Until the Dodgers, Yankees, and Cubs all decided to do the exact same thing. Phil Coke received 4 identical $1,080,000 contracts, only to pitch in a couple preseason games and be released in two or fewer weeks each time. It was absolutely bizarre. Teams must have signed Coke for his reputation only to quickly realize that he’s terrible now. Finally, the Pittsburgh Pirates gave him a minor league deal in early April and assigned him to AA Altoona. There, he posted a 3.89 ERA and struck out just 14 batters in 39 innings. The writing was on the wall, and everyone except for Coke could see it clearly. But he was so used to being the best that he simply couldn’t let it end this way.

**2034: 2-11, 4.96 ERA (MiLB)**

Coke latched on with the Rangers on a minor league deal immediately after the free agent signing period began. Unfortunately, they too released him prior to the start of the season. Luckily, San Antonio swooped right in, becoming the 17th team to own the rights to Phil Coke. They assigned him to High-A Jupiter, where he looked like his old self again. He pitched 7 shutout innings without walking a single batter, earning a call-up to AA Jacksonville as the team’s closer. The hitters there weren’t nearly as kind to him. Though he saved 21 games, Coke posted a 5.64 ERA and 1.75 WHIP. Despite all this, the organization decided to give him a chance to prove himself in AAA in early September. He was just one step away from returning to the majors as long as he impressed enough people. He didn’t. Coke made just two appearances with AAA New Orleans and allowed a run in each of them. And then that was it. There was no retirement tour, no walk into the sunset. The winningest pitcher baseball has ever seen went out with a whimper. He announced his retirement on September 18th, 2034. He had pitched 15 seasons in the majors and accomplished everything he set out to do. Though he couldn’t quite get back to the big leagues at the end, Phil Coke could retire happy knowing that he truly had left his impact on the game of baseball.

**Epilogue:**

It didn’t happen quite the way I envisioned, but I was able to make Phil Coke the all-time wins leader in baseball history. He led the MLB in wins every season except his last, and in 2020 he was the leader in both the AL and the NL with 25 and 26 in each league respectively. He won 50 or more games 5 times, although he never topped Old Hoss Radbourn’s record of 59. It’s undeniable that this experiment was a success. But how would the Hall of Fame voters view him? His JAWS is pretty terrible as are just about all of his non-counting stats. But his Black Ink and HOF Monitor are off the charts. Pundits argued both sides of his case ad nauseum in the five years after his retirement. Traditional voters loved the wins, but they hated the fact that he won just one major award and never pitched in the World Series. In 2037, it was finally time for judgment. Was he a first ballot shoo-in, or would he fall off the ballot unceremoniously? 

It turns out the answer is somewhere in the middle. Coke received 65.3% of the vote his first year on the ballot, the first man out of a class that included Manny Machado, Carlos Correa, and Alex Claudio. The next year he was a little closer with 67.1%. Then finally, in his third year on the ballot, Phil Coke got the call. Receiving 83.4% of the vote, he was the one and only member of the Hall of Fame class of 2040. On that stage in Cooperstown, Phil Coke will stand alone, much like he had for his entire career. In typical OOTP fashion, the announcement [made no sense.](https://imgur.com/s5F8TaM)

That quote from Coke is just too perfect. “All the starters loved having me come in after one of their good performances because they knew they’d get a win that day.” Whoever generated that quote couldn’t be more wrong if they tried. And that raises the question as to what type of clubhouse presence Phil Coke actually was. No teammate of his ever won more than 8 games in a season, so I could see many starters being angered by his presence on the team. He was constantly pitching on short or no rest, so I imagine he was constantly grumpy. In the early part of his career he was constantly on the move, so he may have been less willing to make friends. And finally, his teams were generally unsuccessful. He never once reached the World Series, and he only played in the LCS twice. His teammates could criticize him and the manager for sacrificing on-field results for novelty, and they would be 100% right. But their opinions don’t matter. Phil Coke is the all-time wins leader and a Hall of Famer. And all it took was dramatically pushing the envelope and forever changing the game of baseball.

Phil Coke was never named the league’s greatest pitcher at the end of a season, but after his induction, he had a far greater honor bestowed upon him. On January 4th, 2040, the Cy Young Award was officially renamed the Phil Coke Award. After all, he was the new Cy Young now.

readthinkfight,2019-06-27 14:03:14+00:00,"In 1982, two women disappear together in South Lake Tahoe, CA. Five and six months later, their bodies are discovered—but it seems they died only weeks ago. What happened to Julie Schossow and Marilyn Putt?","I searched Reddit and was surprised not to see a writeup of this case, particularly when it has been mentioned with serial killers including Leonard Lake and Zodiac (although, IMO, both seem unlikely suspects). Much of the accessible coverage (e.g., from the El Dorado DA) lacks details about the circumstances of their disappearance. I apologize in advance that this isn’t the smoothest writeup, but I’m trying to weave together details from a couple of different sources into a cohesive and accurate account.

**The Disappearance**

Julie Schossow, 25, and Marilyn Putt, 27, were close friends. They had both worked as blackjack dealers at the Harrah's Casino in South Lake Tahoe, on the border of Nevada and California, since May 1980. Marilyn had a 5-year-old son, Jason, and they had lived in a rented house at 725 Los Angeles Avenue since October 1981. The Putts shared the house with a roommate, Colleen Gore, who often helped take care of Jason. Schossow was in between apartments and temporarily living in the home as well. Neighbors recalled there were often many cars at the house, although there weren’t wild or noisy parties there. Jason was often seen playing in the snow with other neighborhood children. 

On January 12, 1982, Schossow and Putt had both worked at Harrah’s and then returned home after their shift. What is known about the intervening hours seems to come largely from their roommate, Colleen Gore. Schossow and Putt told Gore they were going “to party,” and at approximately 1 AM, a car horn sounded outside of the house and the women left. 

Both victims were seen drinking together at the Rendezvous Bar inside Harrah’s and leaving a bar with some men that evening, however I do not know if this happened before they returned home or after they went out again to party. Colleen told police that sometime during the night, Schossow came back to pick up her car. Putt called 11 hours later (unclear if this is at noon on January 13, or 11 hours after Schossow returned for the car) and said they had “met a couple of rich guys” and were headed to Sacramento or San Francisco. Putt asked Gore to babysit her son. 

Gore did not report the women missing for four days. This would have been approximately January 17. 

On February 2, police found Schossow’s brown Honda in the Harrah’s parking lot, covered in snow and with flat tires. Police said this indicated the car had been there since the day the women went missing, January 13. (What is mystifying is why the police knew the women were missing since January 17, knew Schossow’s car was missing, and knew both women worked at Harrah’s—yet apparently didn’t check that parking lot until February 2.)

Note this interesting passage in an article from February 18, 1982, in the Reno Gazette-Journal: “The neighbors and some of the women’s co-workers from Harrah’s are reluctant to talk about Putt and Schossow. One Los Angeles Avenue woman said she was worried about retribution from the ‘two men the girls were with that night,’ and the Harrah’s workers have been ordered by casino officials not to talk about the missing dealers.”

**Discovery of the Bodies**

On June 6, 1982, almost six months later, the body of Marilyn Putt was discovered in the South Fork of the American River, one mile west of an area known as Chili Bar off of Highway 193. Her body was nude and had been weighted down with chains and binding material and the cause of death appears to be ligature strangulation, with the time of death being estimated at 6-8 weeks prior to her body being found.

One month later, on July 9, 1982, the body of Julie Schossow was discovered also in the South Fork of the American River, approximately 150 yards from where Marilyn Putt's body had been discovered. She had a cord tightly wrapped around her neck two times and the coroner could not rule out the fact that she may have been bound together with Marilyn Putt. The cause of death appears to be ligature strangulation, with the time of death being estimated at 6-8 weeks prior to her body being found.

Given the discrepancy between the time the women went missing and the estimated time of death, it is believed that the women were held captive for approximately three months, believed to be somewhere in between South Lake Tahoe and Placerville. 

**Other events or potential leads**

\*Notably, another woman, Debney Lynn Lobanoff, 28, went missing not long before these women in December 1981. Her nude body was found floating in the Slab Creek Reservoir on July 3, 1982, in between the discoveries of Putt’s and Schossow’s bodies and approximately 7.5 miles upstream. According to her husband, Debney left with two “biker-type” men. This case also remains unsolved. 

\*In 2016, the El Dorado District Attorney’s Office launched a campaign to revive this cold case and made a specific request: “If there’s anyone out there that’s directly involved with or associated with the Church of Scientology in South Lake Tahoe, you may or may not know you have information that could be helpful, so please contact us.” The DA’s website further notes, “Although not a member herself, Marilyn Putt was closely associated with several leading members of the Church of Scientology.” 

\*In February this year, the El Dorado DA’s office announced they had used genetic genealogy databases to identify Joseph Holt, a local real estate worker, as the man who kidnapped and killed a woman, Brynn Rainey, in 1977 and a teenaged girl, Carol Andersen, in 1979. Rainey was last seen at a bar just before her 2 AM shift at a South Lake Tahoe Casino; her body was found in a shallow grave and her cause of death was believed to be strangulation or suffocation. Andersen disappeared on her way home from a party near a South Lake Tahoe ski resort. Her body was found dumped by the side of the road a few miles away; she had been bound and strangled. Unfortunately, justice evaded Holt as he died in 2014. 

**Questions**

\--How is it that the women weren’t reported missing for so many days? January 13, 1982, was a Wednesday—it seems, especially during ski season, that it’s unlikely that both of them would have had multiple consecutive days off of work and over a weekend, but it appears that no one (Harrah’s or the roommate) reported the women missing until Saturday or Sunday. 

\--The quotation from the anonymous neighbor is also odd—why would they be worried about retribution? Were these two men known to locals, but perhaps not to the women? Although they had both been there for some time, they were both transplants.

\--Were they held captive for months, or is there another explanation for the discrepancy in between their date of disappearance and apparent times of death?

\--Why is the DA currently inquiring about the Church of Scientology?

\--Holt’s MO doesn’t sound dissimilar from the circumstances of Putt and Schossow’s case except that evidence is pointing towards two men. Could Holt have had or later taken on a partner? It’s interesting to note that he worked in real estate given it appears the women were held captive. 

What do you think happened to Julie and Marilyn?

yantraman,2019-06-27 04:24:56+00:00,Why it is fair to think that Adrian Wojnarowski shows favoritism for the Clippers,"Woj is one of the most influential journalists in the NBA. However, it is not new to think that ***Woj has symbiotic relationships with front office executives who feed him information about the daily activity of the league in return for writing positive articles even when the said team is not doing well.*** 

A prime example of this was back in 2008-12, Wojnarowski wrote positively about the Pistons organization. Later on, it is discovered that Woj had almost unfettered access to the Pistons'  President of Basketball Operations, Joe Dumars. This is detailed in [an article](https://newrepublic.com/article/120572/adrian-wojnarowski-how-basketballs-reporting-machine-gets-his-scoops) about Woj by Kevin Draper in the New Republic

The access to Joe Dumars was discovered by the NBA in a sting operation detailed in a snippet from Draper's article

&gt;In 2010, the **NBA fined Dumars  $500,000** for leaking multiple confidential league memos to Wojnarowski,  according to multiple sources. **This matches the third largest publicly  known fine the league has ever handed down**. The NBA decided that too  many memos were making it into the media, so **they conducted a sting  operation** over several months. They would change a few words or numbers  in different team’s copies of otherwise identical memos, so that when  the memos leaked they could spot the small differences and trace them  back to the leaker. This approach **caught Dumars red-handed**, as well as  an executive from another team who was fined $12,500 for leaking to a  draft-focused website. Joe Dumars, the Detroit Pistons, and the NBA all  declined to comment on the fine. 

Between 2008 and 2012, every article about the Detroit Pistons by Adrian Wojrarowski was absolutely positive

&gt;With Detroit sliding down the standings, Wojnarowski broke nearly every  significant—and insignificant—Pistons story for a half-decade: the Allen  Iverson [trade](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/source-iverson-traded-detroit-165700385--nba.html), the Amir Johnson [trade](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/pistons-trade-johnson-bucks-oberto-233000053--nba.html), [drafting](https://twitter.com/WojYahooNBA/status/2336468947) Austin Daye, [signing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/pistons-reach-deals-gordon-villanueva-225800382--nba.html) Ben Gordon and Charlie Villanueva, [hiring](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/pistons-kuester-three-contract-200600140--nba.html) John Kuester, [trading](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/pistons-trade-afflalo-nuggets-170300086--nba.html) Aaron Afflalo, [signing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/pistons-reach-deals-gordon-villanueva-225800382--nba.html) Chris Wilcox, [signing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/pistons-bring-back-wallace-181100989--nba.html) Ben Wallace, [drafting](https://twitter.com/WojYahooNBA/status/16971908289) Greg Monroe, [signing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/sources-mcgrady-joining-pistons-135900483--nba.html) Tracy McGrady, Rip Hamilton [arguing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/hamilton-center-pistons-turmoil-152200263--nba.html) with John Kuester, [drafting](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/sources-mcgrady-joining-pistons-135900483--nba.html) Brandon Knight, [hiring](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/frank-gets-4-deal-pistons-184100753--nba.html) Lawrence Frank, [re-signing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/pistons-sign-prince-4-deal-185300023--nba.html) Tayshuan Prince, [re-signing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/sources-stuckey-signs-pistons-three-174500338--nba.html) Rodney Stuckey, [trading](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba--sources--pistons-deal-ben-gordon-to-bobcats-for-corey-maggette.html) Ben Gordon, [signing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba--josh-smith-agrees-to--56-million-deal-with-pistons-190432543.html) Josh Smith, [signing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba--chauncey-billups-returns-to-pistons-on-two-year-deal-121942513.html) Chauncey Billups, [signing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba--pistons-to-acquire-brandon-jennings-in-sign-and-trade-deal-211830240.html) Brandon Jennings, [signing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba--source--josh-harrellson-signs-two-year-deal-with-pistons-021539639.html) Josh Harrellson, and [firing](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/pistons-fire-coach-maurice-cheeks-165831433.html) Mo  Cheeks. While Wojnarowski was busy breaking news about the team, he  wasn’t busy analyzing it: Between 2008 and 2012, **Wojnarowski didn’t  write a negative piece about Dumars or the Pistons, despite the fact  that they had transformed from a perennial contender to an also-ran**.  Instead, Wojnarowski penned several sympathetic profiles of Dumars,  including ones that covered his completion of his college degree and  another wholly about his defensive skills as a player in the 1980s.   

His coverage of the Clippers was so positive, he even wrote a [fluff piece](https://sports.yahoo.com/news/pistons-iverson-now-lebron-later-230300850--nba.html) on how Dumars trading for Iverson could attract Lebron to Detroit

&gt;The Pistons president doesn’t just have the salary cap space for the Cleveland Cavaliers star. He also has the connections and  the championship credibility. Make no mistake: **Detroit and Dumars are  officially in hot pursuit of James – maybe even the favorite now –** and  it promises to be a long, agonizing two years for the Cavaliers.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Detroit  doesn’t deliver the bright lights and global metropolis destination  that James wants when he opts out of his contract in 2010, but two more  years of watching Kobe Bryant win titles could transform his priorities.  James wants badly to be considered the best player on the planet and  that won’t happen until he’s a champion.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
James wants a front  office with a vision that honors his greatness, and make no mistake:  **This makes Detroit and Dumars so dangerous, makes them Cleveland’s worst  nightmare.** The city could justify losing its prodigal son to New York  or Los Angeles, but nearby Detroit?

Who the fuck though the Pistons were favorite in the Lebron James sweepstakes? Woj did. 

During his string of fluff pieces, it was evident that Joe Dumars gave him unrestricted access to Pistons organization. This is probably the time where Woj cultivated a lot of relationships. This includes the **head coach of the Pistons, Lawrence Frank.** 

Yes, the current President of Basketball Operations of the Los Angeles Clippers. While you may think that it may be a stretch to connect the dots like that, here is some contrary evidence. 

Last year, the Clippers made one of the most bizarre front office hires: they [hired Lee Jenkins, a sports journalist](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24717311/sports-illustrated-writer-lee-jenkins-join-la-clippers-front-office) as the  Executive Director of Research and Indentity. As you can see in the byline, Woj broke the story. He also dropped [Woj bomb](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1041871164501442561?lang=en) (duh!) and even hosted Jenkins on his podcast. The article itself allows Lee Jenkins to plug in for the Clippers

&gt;""I grew up pulling for the Clippers on KTLA -- [Gary Grant](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/277/gary-grant)  was my guy -- but it would be disingenuous to say that's why I'm doing  this,"" Jenkins said. ""I just think they're a great bet. So much about  sports comes down to market and owner. **They have the most attractive  market in the league, and if they don't have the most committed owner, I  don't know who does. I mean, who else but Steve Ballmer would do  something like this?** I'm constantly writing stories about teams that  win, and when you trace their course back to the beginning, the end  seems almost inevitable.  
&gt;  
&gt;**""The Clippers are in L.A. with Steve Ballmer and** [**Jerry West**](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4151/jerry-west)**,  Doc Rivers and Lawrence Frank. They might have the best negotiator in  the league in Michael Winger and two of the best evaluators in Trent  Redden and Mark Hughes.** They have a plan to create the ultimate  environment for their players. I think it's inevitable.""

In his podcast, Woj has hosted Doc Rivers, Michael Winger, Lawrence Frank, Lee Jenkins and Jerry West over the past couple years. During this time, the Clippers coverage in the news media in general has grown increasingly positive. This can be largely attributed to a string of Woj articles, plugs and a splashy tweet here and there on various ESPN platforms. This is despite the fact that LA is still Lakers town (even though Lakers did not make the playoffs for 6 years). This is despite the fact that Blake Griffin, a player with injury history, was traded unceremoniously 6 months after signing a free agent deal with them. This is despite the fact that Lebron, who wanted to come to LA went to Jeanie Buss's mom-and-pop shop over the supposedly world class organization like Clippers. And somehow, the Clippers are a free agent destination for a superstars like KD, Klay and Kawhi, all with injury history, all with some big-market ambitions. **Woj pulls for the Clippers so blatantly that when he** [**connected Klay Thompson**](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2834866-woj-on-klay-thompson-watch-clippers-not-lakers-if-warriors-dont-offer-max) **to the Clippers, his fellow journalist at the ESPN, Nick Friedell,** [**dismissed the rumours**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAjXtrx2Bg0) **on The Jump this afternoon.** 

While there is nothing wrong with breaking stories and building relationships for journalist, it is fair to say that Woj pulls for the Clippers because he get a lot of access to the front office, to the ownership and even to coaches and players. And he pays for the access by writing extremely positive articles and building up the Clippers as the state-of-the-art world class organization and a free agent destination. 

So yes, Woj is a Clippers shill.",nba,11930

I'd love to talk to you about all that and so much more.

&amp;#x200B;

**Proof:** [https://www.instagram.com/p/BzGb1nenywb/](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzGb1nenywb/) [https://www.instagram.com/p/BzGb1nenywb/](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzGb1nenywb/)  (Proof will be posted again at the bottom as well.)

[https://imgur.com/fgzkz1B](https://imgur.com/fgzkz1B) (me)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The username is from Joe Hill's novel The Fireman, she is the incredible heroine that I am not quite, but we both have a good dose of Poppins in us.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A week ago I gave my kidney to a stranger, it was the end to a long process that lasted a bit less than a year, and realistically began long before that. I first considered kidney donation as I watched posts come up on Reddit's front page for people asking for kidneys. It spoke to a part of me that said, ""I can do that"", but it took awhile to take root, and it was Dylan Matthews' video on youtube ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7EglP5A2Hg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7EglP5A2Hg)) in which he discussed his experiences donating a kidney to stranger through non-directed donation that spoke to me. It was like lightning striking, I felt it in my bones, that's what I wanted to do. So, I went through the National Kidney Registry ([https://www.kidneyregistry.org/?cookie=1](https://www.kidneyregistry.org/?cookie=1)), did tests for them, got approved and they asked me which hospital I wished to proceed forward with, it was an easy choice. From there I did the rest of my work-up, surgery and recovery with the UCLA Transplant Program ([https://www.uclahealth.org/transplants/kidney](https://www.uclahealth.org/transplants/kidney)). That is the short story. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am a week out of surgery and I look, act, and live a fairly normal life. I can't lift 10 pounds or over, or exercise. It is a good time to loaf, guilt free. In this time of goofing off I am watching horror movies, playing Fallout 4, reading novels, going on long walks, doing crosswords, and trying to perfect making onigiri. I am on a grand total of two medications, Tylenol and docusate sodium, and have been on only that since my second day out of the hospital. My grand total stay in the hospital recovery unit (TRU) was about 24 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

During my many, many trips to UCLA for work-ups, I started to kill time by heading to the closest public library, a suggestion of an old friend. It was an immediate crush, and as I learned about all the programs and services they offer to their communities I fell in absolute, overwhelming love with the LAPL system. As a way to get to know the library system and Los Angeles better I decided to start visiting every library branch they have. I have seen 18 of 74 of them, I have attended 3 events (and am set to visit another 2 very soon), and I have taken the tour of Central Library. Through them I have learned that a library is nothing is without its staff, and if you want to accomplish anything in the entire world, please start at the library. They can make absolutely anything happen, and know where to find the resources that will get you to where you need to be. They are one of the last, greatest institutions that exist solely for the benefit of humankind, I hope we get to keep them forever.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Beyond that, I am a platelet donor, blood donor, library supporter (they need that sweet funding), food bank supporter, a good friend and kind to service workers. I have doubts about this dubious world we live in and I think the only way it will get better is if we put in the work, the time, and the money. Together this can get better, but we can't do it alone. The more we bring attention to these causes, the more we can get done. Let's do this, together. I need you.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Ask me anything.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Love,

Brody Black

ItCertainlyChecksOut,2019-06-24 00:29:49+00:00,"[NBA Draft History] Best players from every draft slot, from 60th to 1st.","Counting down Took all the feedback/ criticism into account and made some revisions. Some people requested a list from 60 through 1, so I did my best. It also took a long fucking time.

60) Isaiah Thomas, I just straight up love this dude, RIP to his sister Chyna who passed away tragically. At 5'9, the guy was an absolute machine and made Boston fans rejoice untio, well... let's leave it there. One love to IT.

59) Pat Cummings, ""Ron Rothstein, his Heat coach, on the passing of Pat Cummings, “It’s a terribly sad thing to hear. Pat was a good guy. He gave us his all, he gave us whatever he had. He was a good guy. He was good with the younger players. He filled his role to the best of his capacity those first two years. We were lucky to have him."" 

58) Kurt Rambis, great player, better moustache, 4x NBA champion, honourable mention as Asst. Coach of Lakers (2016-18)

57) Manu Ginobili, 4x NBA champion, Spurs' legend, over a 23-season career, he was one of only two players to have win a EuroLeague title, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal. True legend.

56) Mickey Johnson/ Amir Johnson

55) Patty Mills, NBA champion and honorary former member of the Xinjiang Flying Tigers.

54) Sam Mitchell, known more for his Coach of the Year Award with Toronto and as an analyst for ESPN/ NBA TV. 4th in points, steals and assists in Timberwolves history. 

53) Anthony Mason, teammate of the great Patrick Ewing, Mason was an absolute brick shithouse.

52) Fred Hoiberg, not even gonna pretend I know much about him, this slot isn't exactly packed with mega stars. (Sorry to whoever takes offense)

51) Kyle Korver, 2009/10 season with Utah, Korver shot 53.6 percent from three-point range, which set an NBA single-season three-point field goal accuracy record. A true great in terms of shooting.

50) Steve Kerr, 5x champion as a player, 3x as coach, Kerr was prolific shooter and his three-point record stood uncontested until being broken by the aforementioned, Kyle Korver

49) ""Fast Eddie"" Johnson, 10 seasons in the league, remembered most by his time as a Hawk was both an offensive and defensive asset. However in 2008, ""Johnson was convicted of sexual battery of a minor under 12, lewd and lascivious molestation of a child under 12, and trespassing. The sex crimes carried a mandatory life sentence without parole. Johnson is currently incarcerated at Santa Rosa Correctional Institution"", so aside from his on court abilities, he's basically a monumental piece of shit as a human.

48) Marc Gasol, aka the 2019 champion, Marc Gasol, imo with his international career factored in, a strong HOF candidate.

47) Paul Millsap, the goat, jk, but 4x NBA All-Star selections is nothing to sneeze at.

46) Jeff ""Horny"" Hornacek, jersey number 14 retired by Utah Jazz, a dynamic player with (1077 GP) he's also been a well received coach in the league, most notably for the Phoenix Suns.

45) Bob Dandridge/ Antonio Davis

44) Malik Rose, NBA champion x2

43) Michael Redd, NBA record for most three-point field goals made in one quarter with 8 in the fourth quarter (February 20, 2002 vs. Houston Rockets); since broken by Klay Thompson on January 23, 2015.

42) Zaza Pachulia, 2x NBA champion, recorded 22 points and 21 rebounds in a 129–127 overtime loss to the Brooklyn Nets. His 21 rebounds included 18 offensive rebounds, which marked an NBA season high and a Bucks franchise record.

41) Cuttino Mobley, not a goat by any means, but he was a big impact during his 10 years in the league, stemming from being drafted to the Houston Rockets and ending his career as a Los Angeles Clipper.

40) George Gervin/ Clifford Ray/ Monta Ellis, respectively all strong candidates, though all are admittedly, before my time.

39) Anthony Johnson, not to be confused with the MMA fighter, Anthony Joshson, first D league player to make the Finals. (Conflicted opinion/placement)
Honourable mention to AL Attles.

38) Mehmet Okur, the only person to be associated with ""okur"" that I'm fine with (Sorry cardi b fans) (Not actually sorry cardi b fans)

37) Archie Clark, safe name to put in this slot because his crossover dribbling helped coin the phrase ""shake and bake"" (shout out to Ricky Bobby)
He was part of the trade that brought Wilt t the Lakers and was also a cofounder of the National Basketball Retired Players Association in '92, so props for that are in order.

36) Maurice Cheeks, name got me thinking of Kyle Lowry with the GOAT booty, but I digress.

35) DeAndre Jordan/ Draymond Green/ Carlos Boozer, this one is subjective, I'll let you all be the judge, jury and executioner.

34) Norm Van Lier, way before my time, but 'Stormin' Norman' was a big player in the 70's heat. C.J Miles is respectable company to this slot.

33) Happy Hairston, because what a fucking name if we're being honest

32) Rashad Lewis, 2013 championship with Miami Heat. Also a fellow SuperSonic alumnus.

31) Doc Rivers, 2nd round 31st pick, made this spot for his playing/coaching.

30) Spencer Haywood, only HOF member at the 30th slot, NBA champion, 4x All-star, his number 24 was retired as a Supersonic; shootout to the the Supersonics ✊.
Honourable mentions to David Lee and Jimmy Butlet.

29) Dennis Johnson (2nd round), hopefully I don't get butchered for honesty but I know very little about this man, never watched him play (before my time) but he was considered criminally underappreciated in the draft and even more so during his tenure in the league. 

28) Tony Parker, 6x All-star, 4x champion and his zodiac sign is Taurus.

27) Dennis Rodman, the guy was rebounding the ball while tapping Madonna. Shout out to the fellas: Kyle Kuzma, Pascal Siakam, Bogdan Bogdanovic and Rudy Gobert, respectively selected at 27th.

26) Vlade Divac, who I'll call, ""the Serbian fridge"" takes this spot, wasn't the most polarizing player but the guy was big enough to have his own area code
Charlie Ward, Jerome Williams, Gerald Wallace, and Jordan Farmar as honorable mentions.

25) Mark Price, hailed as ""Cleveland's best sports trade ever"" and don't fucking at me cause it was a fan vote that I wasn't a part of 

24) Arvydas Sabonis, this one is tough because he's one of the greater European players thats played in the league, but he spares the same slot selection as Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Sam Cassell, Terry Porter and Latrell Sprewell, so this one is a judgement call depending on the person.

23) Alex English, arguably best Denver player of all time, 21.5ppg 

22) Reggie Lewis, dude this one is hard to even type, after 6 seasons he dropped dead on the court, put him here out of respect.

21) Rajon Rando, ok this guy was a fucking gift at 21st pick, 4x defensive all team, 3x APG league leader, also ranks 11th in triple doubles and if you're gonna call him a stat padder then I mean, you wouldn't be the only one. Honourable mentions to Nate Robinson, Mo-Pete.

20) Larry Nance, guy was a unit. First slam dunk contest winner ever.

19) Nate Archibald, 1970 - Archibald is still the only player in NBA history to lead the league in both scoring and assists in a single season and that's pretty neat

18) Joe Dumars, 1989 Finals MVP and a 4x All-Defensive First Team selections and arguably one of the best defenders in league history.

17) Shawn Kemp- although Don Nelson (17th pick in '62) won five NBA championships so he could be interchanged depending on who's asking.

16) John Stockton, this one is not even close, 19 seasons with the Jazz, 19 playoff appearances, 14.5 APG in 1989/1990, a record in NBA history.

15) Steve Nash, the man could shoot a cannon through a crowded Walmart and hit his intended target in the women's clothing department. This one is tough because one look at Nash's whole career and you'll understand the placement, but imo Kawhi could pass him by the end of his career. (Arguably the most controversial, in terms of feedback on last post)

14) Clyde Drexler, don't really know a lot about him but his name is fire 

13) Kobe Bryant, the name we all call when shooting a piece of paper into a garbage bin, respectively joined by Karl Malone

12) Julius Erving, cooler than a tranquilized cucumber

11) Reggie Miller, an absolutely amazing shooter, which is fitting because he shares the same draft selection as Klay Thompson. Klay is a strong candidate to pass Reggie one day, but if you watched Reggie play, you'll respect the decision.

10) Paul Pierce, one of the most clutch ̶s̶h̶i̶t̶t̶e̶r̶s shooters ever perhaps.

9) Dirk Nowitzki, his name is harder to pronounce than most foreign countries but the man is an absolute beast and there's not a damn thing you can say to change my mind.

8) ̶J̶a̶m̶a̶l̶ ̶C̶r̶a̶w̶f̶o̶r̶d̶,̶ ̶N̶B̶A̶ ̶6̶t̶h̶ ̶m̶a̶n̶ ̶x̶3̶,̶ ̶c̶u̶r̶r̶e̶n̶t̶l̶y̶ ̶h̶o̶l̶d̶s̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶N̶B̶A̶ ̶c̶a̶r̶e̶e̶r̶ ̶r̶e̶c̶o̶r̶d̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶ ̶m̶o̶s̶t̶ ̶c̶a̶r̶e̶e̶r̶ ̶f̶o̶u̶r̶-̶p̶o̶i̶n̶t̶ ̶p̶l̶a̶y̶s̶ ̶m̶a̶d̶e̶ ̶w̶i̶t̶h̶ ̶5̶5̶ ̶(̶6̶0̶ ̶w̶h̶e̶n̶ ̶c̶o̶u̶n̶t̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶p̶l̶a̶y̶o̶f̶f̶s̶)̶.̶ ̶I̶ ̶a̶l̶s̶o̶ ̶d̶o̶n̶'̶t̶ ̶h̶a̶v̶e̶ ̶a̶ ̶c̶l̶u̶e̶ ̶w̶h̶o̶ ̶a̶n̶y̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶o̶t̶h̶e̶r̶ ̶p̶l̶a̶y̶e̶r̶s̶ ̶a̶r̶e̶ ̶s̶o̶ ̶l̶e̶t̶'̶s̶ ̶g̶r̶a̶z̶e̶ ̶o̶v̶e̶r̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶o̶n̶e̶.̶ Robert Parish, obviously.

7) Steph Curry, recent studies have shown that Steph is really good at shooting a basketball into the net, some call him an absolute warrior (sorry) 
Honourable mention to John Havlicek.

6) Larry Bird, the man, the myth, the legend

5) This one is tough, KG is an absolute unit, but Pippen, Charles Barkley and Dwayne Wade are all greats. *Paul Pierce has entered the chat* ""I would like everyone to know that I had a better career than all of them."" Ty Paul, moving on.

4) Chris Paul, 4x assist leader, 6x steals leader, great hairline 

3) MJ: he's like, kinda good at basketball 🐐

2) Bill Russell: 2nd overall pick, more rings than a pawn shop

1) LeBron James/ Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Incredible honourable mentions Oscar Robertson, Shaquille O'neal and our boy, Tim Duncan. Each of these players are among the greatest of all time, but not naming LeBron seems sacrilegious.

morbidology,2019-06-21 16:23:08+00:00,"Tammy Lynn Leppert, a beauty queen &amp; upcoming actress, vanished in Florida in 1983. While filming a bloody scene for Scarface shortly before her disappearance, she went into hysterics. She later claimed she saw something she shouldn't have.","Tammy Lynn Leppert was from Rocklegdge, Florida. From a young age, her mother entered her in beauty pageants. She competed in nearly 300 and won a majority. In her early-teens, she starred in ""Little Darlings"" and became the face of CoverGirl in 1978.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Tammy dreamed of becoming an actress in Los Angeles. At 18-years-old, she landed a small role as a participant in a boxing match in the movie, Spring Break. She also featured on the movie poster. Steve Walz predicted Tammy would become ""one of the big stars of the 80s.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After filing Spring Break, Tammy went to a weekend party to celebrate. However, when she returned, friends said she appeared to be ""a different person."" Tammy - who was always confident and outgoing - became sullen and shy. Those around her said she appeared to be exceptionally paranoid and irrational. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The next movie role Tammy had lined up was Scarface. She was playing the part of the girl who was a distraction to the lookout car during the chainsaw shower scene. However, during filming, Tammy came home. It was said that Tammy had become hysterical during a scene where somebody was to be shot.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

On her return, Tammy's mother said Tammy was on edge and afraid to eat out of fear somebody had poisoned her food. She locked herself in her bedroom and refused to come out. Her paranoia spun out of control. She told her mother that a friend bragged about a large-scale drug-money, laundering scheme. She claimed that a number of prominent figures were involved.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Tammy also told her mother she witnessed ""something so horrible I'm going to get killed for it."" She also confided in a friend she believed she was going to be murdered. The same friend said Tammy was involved in drugs or alcohol. Shortly before she disappeared, she took the same friend to a local church where she prayed and cried.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Tammy's mother was concerned enough that she checked her in to a mental health facility. However, after just 72 hours, she was released. The doctor said he found no evidence of a mental illness or drugs or alcohol.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Then on the 6th of July, 1983, Tammy got into the car of her friend, Keith Roberts. They planned on driving to Cocoa Beach. However, he later claimed they got into an argument and he dropped her off in a parking lot along State Road A1A near Cocoa Beach's Glass Bank Building. It was the last time she was ever seen.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It isn't known exactly what happened next but at some point between leaving home and disappearing, Tammy made a number of phone calls. She left three urgent messages for her aunt and called her friend who didn't pick up.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Since the disappearance, theories have been plentiful. Some speculate that Tammy simply had a mental breakdown. But if so, where did she go? Some friends speculated she ran away due to her controlling mother.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Tammy's mother, on the other hand, thinks that Keith was involved. Apparently Tammy was afraid of Keith. Cocoa Beach police said they looked into Keith as a suspect but found no evidence of him being involved. However, Lt. Jim Scraggs later said that he only had two phone calls with Keith and that Keith broke two appointments to come for a face-to-face interview.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Keith denies this, however, and said he was never called to the station for an interview.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Another theory is that Tammy was abducted and murdered. One plausible suspect is Christopher Wilder who killed 8 or 9 young women in Florida. He lured his victims by claiming he wanted to photograph them for magazines. However, Wilder's first reported murder was in 1984, half a year after Leppert vanished... Could she have been his first victim? At one point in the investigation, it seemed so.... Tammy's mother claimed Wilder met Tammy on the set of Spring Break. She filed a $1 million wrongful death lawsuit against him but later said she didn't even consider him a likely suspect but filed the lawsuit hoping he would talk.... Wilder died in a shoot out in spring of 1984.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Another suspect was John Crutchley who is suspected of killing around 30 women. He committed suicide in prison in 2002.

So as you can see, United can sign a player from nothing. It all happens pretty quickly, and it can all go slient for a few days such as Matic. So please do not fret. Our Tier 1s rarely break news, it's usually other teams/countries

Think of the littlest, most nothing-happens-here city extended layover in your flyover state nightmares, and my hometown is even more quiet than that. Think, half a mile or more between neighbors, a single main street downtown, one McDonalds, one department store, one movie theater with three screens, where everyone goes Friday and Saturday night. Church every Sunday, everyone knows everyone else, or at least knows their business, the whole city is invested in the fortunes of the high school football team, that sort of place. Graduating class of sixty. Not because the senior class was dumb. It was just a tiny high school.

I didn't really fit in at school, and kind of was a loner by choice. I cringe about it now that I'm almost twenty-six now, but I was a wannabe emo/goth rocker. I still got invited to party with the other kids, not because they liked me, necessarily, but because there just wasn't many people to invite. My mom baked cookies and cakes for church, and when she wasn't doing that, she cut hair in the town's one salon. My dad owned an internet cafe for a while when those were hot; once everyone even in our little nowhere town got WiFi, he turned it into a tax service. Business is always slow because most people did their own taxes, but he didn't really depend so much on his business. He served twenty years as a petty officer in the Navy, and so he and mom got by on his pension. In high school, I worked at the private burger place that competed mostly unsuccessfully against the town's single chain fastfood restaurant. My boss always told me I should ask my mom to cut my hair to ""stop looking like a dang girl.""

No thanks, old man.

So, with all this boredom everywhere, you can imagine the sensation ""Miss Amber Fontaine"" caused when the high school hired her to be the eleventh and twelfth grade English teacher. Miss Fontaine was of French extraction, and had moved to America in her later teens to go to college in New York. She was only twenty four, and very beautiful. She spoke perfect English, but did so with a very pleasant accent. Obviously, all the guys loved her, and lots of women hated her.

She appeared oblivious to all the attention, however, and just stuck to her job. Really, we didn't know too much about her. She mostly kept to herself and nobody ever saw her hanging out with any men in town, and it wasn't for lack of the men's trying. It soon became clear that she wasn't into dating any of the men our city had to offer. Much later on I found out that she had just taken the job in our small town to gain experience, with a future goal of being a college professor in a big city. A sort of two year plan. 

Obviously I had a crush on her. We all did.

It was and still is a small, church-going town, so nobody really acted out on his urges or tried to harass her or anything like that. As guys, we'd talk about how hot she was amongst ourselves, usual locker room stuff teenage boys do, but that was it. My one real out of school experience with Ms Fontaine was when she stopped by the burger joint I worked at and saw me working there. She told me I had a nice smile, and that she wished I smiled more because in school I was always frowning (because I was in my emo, ""everything sucks"" phase).

When the food preppers came up with her food and handed it to me to give to her, I was impressed and not at all surprised that she ordered a salad. She didn't strike me as someone who ate the greasier slop we sold there. In school the following Monday she smiled at me in the hall and I smiled back. Then she said, ""you're learning,"" but not in a condescending or patronizing way. Just a fun, kidding way and I exchanged a smile with her every time after that.

And that was the extent of my great, high school romance with Ms Fontaine. Exchanged a few hellos and smiles during my senior year, when I was seventeen.

Things changed the following year, though.

I was eighteen and still working at the burger joint, when Ms Fontaine comes by the restaurant. ""Oh hey, OP!"" she says, and asks with real seriousness, ""are you going to college?""

I tell her the truth. I'm working with my band (I cringe about this period in my life, too), playing guitar, and saving money for community college. Sort of truth about the last thing. Honestly, most of my money I spent on weed and ecstasy. I was the main vocalist in addition to being guitarist, and our band's only other member's were ""Jerry"" the bassist and ""Gabe"" the drummer. Both of them were just out of high school, like me. And, like me, they had no plans to go to college. Gabe worked at the same burger joint as me, and Jerry, who had been one of my best friends in high school, ironically worked at the chain fast-food restaurant down the street from my restaurant. In addition to playing in our punk band (we liked to think that we played an emo/punk/metal fusion, but looking back our sound hasn't aged well).

Ms Fontaine tells me that now that she's in her second year of teaching, she has a better sense of how to do things. She tells me that she wished that her current students were as well-behaved and put in as much effort as me. I earned mediocre grades throughout school but consistently earned an ""A"" in English because I liked to read. She says she'll see me around.

A few days later she comes in to the restaurant again, and we get to talking, and she asks me if I'd like to go to a movie.

I can tell she's bored because there's really no one her own age for her to hang out with in town, or if there are, they're all lame. I think we both get the feeling that it's natural we should hang out. And now that I was completely out of high school and she wasn't my teacher, and we were both adults (by this time I was newly eighteen and she had just turned twenty five).

So, that's how it started.

We'd meet up in the early evenings, totally innocent, and go to the movies, or to dinner at the one good restaurant in town. Ms Fontaine was cool about letting me slide when it came to paying for our dates because she knew I made minimum wage.

It was actually me, who started to push our relationship to the next level. After  a while I started to hold her hand when we walked places, and finally we started kissing. Never in front of anyone. She taught me a lot of French words and phrases over the next summer and fall while we were going out. My parents knew I was sort of dating my former teacher, but since it was key word ""former"" they didn't really raise any stink about it. Ms Fontaine would always try to convince me to go to college, but she did see our band play a few times when we got a rare gig at the roller rink, and she was nice enough to not tell us what she really thought of us LOL.

We didn't have sex until we had been dating casually for nearly two months. That was my idea, too, but she admitted that she really liked me and she wanted it to happen ever since we reconnected earlier that year, after I had graduated.

I'm not the kiss and tell type, but my bandmates sort of knew that the dynamic in my relationship with Ms Fontaine (she had been ""Amber"" ever since we first made out) had changed. They appeared cool with it. I stopped doing so much dope and really began putting money away to save for college. The JC near my house was super cheap. Amber would often tell me she thought about applying there, but said that she really wanted to move to the West Coast, or back to the East Coast to teach at a college. Eventually, she told me she'd like me to come with her.

After a few months, I was in love with Amber and she was in love with me, too, she said. We didn't throw our relationship in people's faces or show public affection, but it's not like we pretended not to know each other, either. Amber had come around the house and my parents really liked her, and thought she was a great influence on me. I didn't exactly cut my hair, but I was neater and more presentable, and eventually I really did begin enrolling in GE classes at the local two year.

But then, things went downhill fast.

Out of seemingly nowhere, Amber got called in for a meeting with the local school board. This is my secondary account of the situation, as Amber was the one there, not me. There had been reports that she was dating a former student romantically (they were talking about me).  And that she was having a sexual relationship with said student when he was still a minor and still attending high school. Of course, she denied everything. Of course, they believed nothing. She had sent me a desperate text, and since ours is a small town (I think I've mentioned that a couple of times already), and I was at that meeting in literally ten minutes.

I told them the truth, that I was in Ms Fontaine's class in twelfth grade, and that I was her student. That was all. I told the truth that we reconnected several months after graduation, and only then did we begin dating. And I was over eighteen. The opinion of the board was essentially, ""look son, we appreciate the noble effort you're making to defend your friend's honor, but we're looking for the truth here, not omissions."" I insisted that I was telling the truth and not trying to cover anything up.

After a lot of tears, Amber was simply warned that it wasn't  becoming of a teacher to be seen with students, even if they're former students.

And we assumed that was all. We were really wondering who complained about us, or who would make up tales about us having sex while I was still a minor and a student of Amber's.

I was staying at Amber's apartment by this time (I kicked in a portion of the rent of course). I had even met her parents, albeit only on webcam. They're good people. They don't speak a lot of English, but Amber filled them in on missing pieces. They knew my age and they were cool about it. We assumed it was just small town gossip and that it would blow over.

Boy, were we wrong.

Over the next several weeks after Amber's meeting with the school board, vicious rumors started to spread about her. I won't insult your imagination. You know what people were saying. One day my boss at the burger joint just told me he had to let me go. Some flim flam excuse about losing too much money, and my hairstyle was driving away customers. Whatever, dude. Amber told me it wasn't my fault, and promised to support me while I looked for another job.

But then one day, SHE got fired, too. She was working as a probationary teacher. It meant that during her first two years, she could be fired for any reason, and actually, no reason had to even be given. Explanations were for those who earned tenure. We both knew why she was getting fired, but the district strongly implied that it was simply because she was an ""ineffective"" teacher.

In her defense, I looked at the data on the district website, and the number of students from our school who did well on standardized tests in her subject area leaped by double-digit points during the time she was a teacher there. Her numbers were far above the state average, and to this day, since her departure, those same scores have nose-dived. Amber told me that students tended to respond well to her, and she was very popular among the students. It was true that she was immensely popular when I was a student, and I'll assume the same carried true the year after I graduated. Aside from the obvious fact that she was eye candy, she was simply a good teacher, and a good person, and that's why the kids liked her.

Lots of students threatened to riot when she was fired, but being the non-dramatic, non-attention-seeking person she is, Amber asked them to just focus on their students and doing well, and helping their new teacher adjust when he or she arrived to take her place. My dad told her she ought to sue the district, but Amber didn't want the drama. Besides, she said, the was ""allowed to resign"" so that it wouldn't show up on her record as her having been fired. Also, she said that the district promised not to try to revoke her teaching credential.

Her own parents suggested maybe she ought to come home to France, but she insisted on sticking it out in America. My parents were cool in that they offered to let her move in with us while she figured her life out. She's lucky that her parents are well off, because they gave her some money to relocate to California.  She asked me please to come with her, that she loved me, and we could start new there. I've always wanted to move to California, so I jumped at the chance. My parents were happy that I was in a relationship with a good person who obviously cared about me, and gave us some money, too. We got an apartment together in the Los Angeles area. Neither of us drove, so we both got bikes to get around. Our new area was a world apart from my old life, though I know Amber's own teenage years were in Paris so Los Angeles wouldn't be as much of a culture shock for her.

I immediately enrolled in a local community college and got a job as a waiter in a popular French restaurant. Our gimmick was that some of the servers actually spoke French. Over the last several months Amber had taught me a lot of French, so I was a popular server in that restaurant because I gave it ""authenticity."" Unfortunately for Amber, the school district misled her about her teaching license. When they promised not to have her license revoked, they spoke the truth, but they left out the part where they would attach an official reprimand to it that accused her of inappropriate relations with students under her charge. So, whenever Amber applied for teaching jobs, this would immediately come up as a red flag on her applications. Another surprise red flag was that schools that she applied to would notice that she was fired from her last job.

""No I wasn't,"" she'd say. ""I resigned.""

""Yeah, but it says here you were forced to resign to avoid termination for cause.""

Amber is eight years older than me, but I think in some ways I know a lot more about how nasty Americans can be than her.

Everywhere she went, doors would slam, career wise. She appealed to the state teaching license organization, and they said they'd look into it, but months later, nothing came up. Calls to her former school resulted in her getting the runaround. No one knew anything.

So, for the next several months I was paying our day to day bills and helping to support Amber, though I must acknowledge that the loans both our sets of parents gave us helped tremendously, and we couldn't survive without them. Finally, one day, Amber tells me, ""you know what? F\*CK trying to teach public school. Oh, and OP, I'm pregnant.""

So, TWO pieces of good news.

Many, many months later, Amber and I are happily married. Wedding was beautiful, in sunny Los Angeles. Amber's parents and mine and our families all attended. We had a pregnant honeymoon in France. We now have a son, Richelieu. I am closing in on earning my AA in Information Technology. I've been promoted to maitre d at the restaurant, and have health benefits for my wife and son. We live in a studio apartment, but at least it's a huge studio, and it's enough for now. Amber stays home with the baby, but she also teaches online English and French courses for a private school. So, even though she's blacklisted from teaching publicly, she can still teach, which is her passion.

More months pass, and I got my first job in IT, troubleshooting computers for a small company downtown. I make double what I used to at the restaurant, and my employer has a program where I can finish my BA while I work, and they will subsidize fifty percent for free, and the other fifty percent they will dock from my pay in small monthly installments. Sounds like an amazing deal, and I take it. We move to a bigger apartment. Amber is making her awesome contribution both as a mother and to our finances with her tutoring. We're planning for her to eventually go back to school for her graduate degrees so she can finally fulfill her dream of teaching college.

""Oh, more good news, OP. I'm pregnant again.""

Life is sweet, haha.

So, while everything is going awesome, one day I get a text from mom.

She was at a local school board meeting with her neighbors, regarding a local bill to hire more teachers. Apparently over the past couple of years, the population has grown, and the high school needs to expand. 

So now it's a two horse town, mom says.

While she was at the meeting, my mom ran into Jerry's mom. Jerry, the bassist from my old band that I quit once I got into a serious relationship with Amber. My mom never met Jerry, or his mom. The reason was, because I never brought Jerry around our house. Because, for a couple of years, Jerry was my drug-supplier. He had the hook up for anything you wanted. Well what does all this have to do with anything.

My mom doesn't know Jerry's mom, but she hears her and some other lady talking about me, and Amber. My mom heard them saying that her son Jerry had been the one to tell everyone about Amber and me supposedly having sex before I graduated, and his mom went straight to the school board. Their names as informers were protected under confidentiality. I had lost touch with Jerry over the years and had stopped playing music with him long ago. I knew he resented all the time I was spending with ""my chick.""

It's a shame because he used to be such a good friend of mine. It sucked that he was behind getting my now wife and mother of my child and soon to be childREN fired from her career. Jerry's mom was a teacher at Amber's former school of employment. It became a joke of ours—that his mom had such a huge stick up her @ss regarding prim and proper behavior, and her kid Jerry is basically the biggest drug dealer in school. Also, looking back, I know he had a crush on Amber, too, and probably always resented that I got to be in a relationship with her, while he didn't.

Maybe it's because she knows quality, you jerk.

I was interested to learn that Jerry's mom was now on the school board. I didn't tell Amber about all this right away. I just asked her to tell me what she remembered about Mrs. \[Jerry's mom\]. She told me that Jerry's mom was always really mean to her, and often one of the main instigators in getting everyone (the adults) on campus to exclude her from teacher social activities. It's one of the main reasons why Amber didn't make friends with the other teachers. Amber tells me that the male teachers tended to be nice to her at first, but female teachers overwhelmingly despised her before they even knew her. Jerry's mom, Amber told me, was also the teacher she knows who started a petition not to renew her contract for even a second year at the school. This was the first I heard about this.

Evidently only a few female teachers signed the petition, but the petition was placed in Amber's permanent file as ""evidence"" that the staff lacked confidence in her. They were basically setting her up to be fired even though she was doing a good job teaching, and the students liked her.

Well, I'm more Cali than Iowa these days, but I still keep in touch with a few kids (now grown up) I knew in school. From what I hear, Jerry manages the burger joint I used to work at, because the old guy who owns it retired. I have a social media account but only use it to contact people in emergencies. I never update anything. My profile is practically blank, online. I'm not one of those people who checks it daily or uploads pics of my lunch. Jerry was still my ""friend"" on social media even though we weren't officially enemies, so I clicked on his profile. Yep, he definitely managed my old place of employment. I clicked on his friends' and family's profiles and recognized his mom, my old history teacher. She was on the school board now. Sanctimonious as ever.

I think I mentioned before that I came from a small town. And in a small town, there often isn't anything for bored kids to do that do dumb stunts and do drugs. And record themselves partying and doing drugs.

That's exactly what my band used to do. Whenever we had a show, we'd go around taping ourselves using our cellphones. We'd take video of us rocking out, skating, drinking beer in the vacant lot, and take video of us getting high. We'd also talk to the camera.

I haven't thought about the old recordings in years, but I never erased them from my old phones. I'm the kind of guy who hoards his old cellphones, not because I think they'll increase in value or that I find them especially interesting, but I kind of think of them like file cabinets of my past, because I don't erase anything. My current boss knows I used to do drugs, and they don't care. In IT, I'm told, everyone used to get lit, and many still do.

I ask my wife, off hand, if her new job knows about what happened in our old town. She says yeah, but that they don't care about any of that. They only care that she teaches expert-level conversational French. That's what their clients—many of them traveling professionals—demand. Many of her coworkers, she tells me, had real felonies on their records, but her employer was a firm believer in rehabilitation.

Copacetic.

So I check some of my old videos, and find what I need. I have no trouble finding videos of Jerry getting high as a motherf\*cker. That's like practically every video. And in practically every video, he brags about how his parents know he's a druggie and want to ship him off to the army and make a man out of him. The video I really want is... Nope, it's not on this phone. Maybe the LG? Nope, just more of Jerry rolling on ecstasy at a rave we snuck out of state to attend when we were in eleventh grade. Maybe my old Galaxy?

Bingo.

Jerry talks about how his mom knows all about his drug use and sometimes even smokes weed herself, with his dad. And how they caught him with cocaine once and yelled at him and his dad kicked his @ss, but then Jerry came home the next day from school his mom was coked out on the kitchen table. And she had called in sick that day. The video was timestamped.

I think that'll do.

I still don't tell Amber.

It would only upset her, in her condition.

But I ask my mom for the contact info of all the people who are on the little town's school board. I already know the school's basic email address, and I graduated not that long ago and most of the administrators are still mid-career at my former high school. I still have their emails.

I make a throwaway email account and attach all the relevant videos to it, and send it to everyone that matters in town. All the teachers, the administrators, even from elementary and middle schools, the church, the pizza place, the burger joint owner, the roller rink boss, you name it, they got the files.

&amp;#x200B;

The files where Jerry exposes himself as a coked out drug dealer, with his mom having full knowledge of the fact, and her and her husband even indulging in the drugs themselves.

The next day Amber asks me, while she's feeding out son, ""Honey, why are you so happy?""

I tell her, and she starts crying.

""No, I'm not sad,"" she assures me. ""I'm just so happy you did this for me.""

Then me, Amber, Richelieu, and our bun in the oven go for a walk because it's such a nice day.

Do I even need to say what happened afterward?

Jerry got fired from his job. Police searched his house—that is to say, his mom's house—and found a lot of drugs. Jail for you, d\*uchebag.

His mom was summarily dismissed from her job, along with all the appropriate blacklisting that being a drug-abusing, child-endangering, fraud-committing public official entails. My mom wasn't clear on the details, but there's a possibility she had her husband might face jail time, too.

It came out that Jerry's dad had been cheating on his wife for years with a woman from the church.

Jerry's whole family are persona non grata.

They want to leave town, but can't pending court case.

Until then, they'll just be hated to their face. 

I'll hate them from across the country.

Small town.

Everyone knows everyone.

Or, at least their business.

Which means sooner or later word will slip, people will drop the ""it's confidential"" charade and know I was responsible for a family's downfall.

I DGAF.

Jerry, you listening?

Good.

Samuel Little, also known as Samuel McDowell, is a convicted serial killer. He was doing time in California after DNA led to his arrest and conviction in three Los Angeles-area murders between 1987 and 1989. Investigators began looking at him for other murders, a task that sped up considerably when he offered to confess to additional crimes in exchange for being moved to a different prison. They suspected he had killed as many as 40 women at that time.

Little has confessed to more than 90 murders. He was shaky on dates and didn't know many names, but was able to draw all of the victims he confessed to killing and give detailed descriptions of where he picked them up, what he knew about them, etc. 

The FBI has managed to match his confessions to 60 unsolved murders. At least 34 and possibly up to 50 of those been confirmed through forensic evidence or information only the killer would know. (Fifty cases have been closed; investigators have previously said 34 cases had evidence backing up his confessions.) He was convicted of a 1994 Texas murder after he pleaded guilty last year. He's been charged with five more murders in Ohio.

**The Unresolved Mystery Part**

The FBI is still seeking to identify his other confessed victims. Some have not been matched to a crime. Others have been matched to murdered women, but the victims have never been identified. The FBI has a list of the unmatched confessions and unidentified victims on their VICAP site: [https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/vicap-links-murders-to-prolific-serial-killer-112718](https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/vicap-links-murders-to-prolific-serial-killer-112718)

AngryLetterToElise,2019-06-08 00:27:33+00:00,"D-Bag step-aunt broke my uncle's heart and drove him to suicide years ago. So we hooked her with a little game called ""Catfish""","  
  Hi Reddit, you know how it goes. Throwaway account, longtime pro-revenge reader, never participated until now, don't want to use my real account, sorry for the lengthy tale, TL;DR at the end.     


  So, anyway.   
 

 I come from a stereotypical, close-knit, super-nice Canadian family. We have some raging, uppity Quebequois in our ranks, but other than thinking they rule the world and that they speak real French while French people speak a trash dialect, they're part of our family too, and we love them.       


  I'm twenty-nine now, but the first part of this story took place around fifteen years ago, when I was still a kid. I have two brothers, one younger by two years (Kevin), and one older by three years (Paul), and I'm my family's only daughter. My mom was and is a homemaker, and my dad is now a retired accountant, but before that he spent a decade in the Canadian army.   


  Our family's closest relatives were my uncle Gary and his wife Bernice, who lived in the next province over on the border and visited our family multiple times per year with their sons Howie and Frank, who were around the same age as me and my brothers. So, we kids were all good friends growing up. Being the only girl, I got to do all kinds of stereotypically male games like football, fast-pitch baseball, hockey, building treehouses, and things of that nature. We had other extended family to come over for Christmas and Easter, but Uncle Gary and Aunt Bernice were close enough to us that they'd come over just because Gary had a good day at work and wanted to make a celebration dinner out of it. Gary was an artisan who built furniture from scratch and sold it from his own store, first at his physical store but then later online too. His biggest triumph was when a hotshot attorney commissioned him to furnish his entire suite of five offices across Montreal.   


  So these fun times continue from the time I was a baby up until I was around thirteen, when Aunt Bernice developed inoperable breast cancer, and passed away at only forty-six. It hit Gary very hard and of course was a nightmare for his sons too, who lost their mom right around when they started high school.   


  Gary had a couple of depressed years, even though he tried to put up a brave front. Eventually, he met a woman online from Manhattan, NYC, who I'll call Linda. Linda was only twenty seven when Uncle Gary started dating her, or rather started a long-distance online relationship with her. This was back when chatrooms were a big thing. Linda was an ex-model and aspiring actress both on stage and on screen. She had actually been in bit parts in various commercials and minor, non-speaking roles in some Broadway shows, but no breakout parts. With the passage of time I can reflect and see that she really couldn't support her lifestyle based on the work she did. It's clear she manipulated men into paying her way through life. She was strikingly beautiful though so she had that going for her.     


  My parents thought Linda was far different from Bernice and they didn't like her at first, but since Gary seemed happy they were happy for him and went along with it, and didn't try to dissuade him from dating her. Howie and Frank told me and my brothers that they didn't really like her, especially as she was acting too familiar way too soon in calling them her ""boys"" as if she was already replacing their mom. But as long as their dad was getting over his depression, they were happy for him.   


  After less than six months, Linda moved to Gary's house and was playing house with him and his sons, taking on the role of mom. Gary would bring her to all family functions, and she looked really flashy and glamorous compared to the rest of us. She definitely screamed New York. Not literally but yeah. According to my cousins, she did cook and clean and play a positive role, at least at first.   
 

 Then they finally married. Most of our relatives weren't thrilled with the marriage, but again, as long as Gary was happy, then we were all happy for him. Especially since it had been two years since his wife passed away. I was about fifteen at this time.   


  Howie and Frank would always text me or chat with me online about how Linda changed almost overnight once she married their dad. While she had been helpful around the house before, once she was officially married to my uncle she became extremely domineering and ordered my cousins to do way more chores than they were used to. They had always done things like cut the grass take out the garbage, sweep up the patio. But Linda demanded they do absolutely all the chores now. So instead of everyone doing something so that the entire household was nice and clean, Linda would relax all day while Howie and Frank vacuumed and mopped and did laundry after school.   


  The only thing my cousins didn't have to do for Linda was cook for her. But that was because she ordered delivery almost every day. My cousins did admit she had good taste, in that she didn't order pizza or other relatively inexpensive delivery food, but instead full on gourmet meals. Uncle Gary, of course, footed the bill for all of these extravagances. When they didn't order in, Linda enjoyed dressing up and going out to dinner even more.   


  I think it helped Gary's self-esteem to be seen out and about with such an attractive woman, but now that I'm well into adulthood when I see pictures of them all from that era, Linda looks like a callgirl.   


  I'll hit fast forward and get to the point. Linda was obviously a fortune hunter, and although Gary wasn't a rich man, he was quite well off, very trusting, lived away from huge cities his whole life, lonely, and generous.   


  All of these things made him a perfect victim for someone like Linda.   


  Did I mention the insurance policies? Of course she wheadled Gary into taking out large policies on his life. Of course to allay any suspicion, she also had a hefty insurance policy on herself with Gary as the beneficiary. Through her feminine wiles, according to my cousins, Linda convinced their father to name her as at least 80% beneficiary to all his assets in the event of his death, assets which amounted to well over a million dollars for just her portion.     


  Linda enjoyed traveling, and the fact that her stepsons weren't eighteen and had to go to school, and the fact that her husband had a store to run didn't stop her from indulging in her passion for long journeys. Or her passion for chasing other men. She'd always deny it, but Gary was a non-stupid stupid guy, if that makes any sense. He was a fool in some ways, but he was smart in others. He was a fool for Linda. Linda had male friends all over New York, and even in town where my cousins lived. My cousins said that they inadvertantly walked by the living room where she had their back to them and was using her laptop, and chatting with guys much younger than Gary. Other theater people. Other times when they were out with their friends, they'd occasionally see her with another man, and it looked like they were on a date. This, while her husband was dutifully at work, running his shop.   


  My cousins were nearing adulthood by this time but they didn't want to get involved in their dad's personal relationship with his wife, so they never told him about it even if they told me. It didn't matter. Like I said, Uncle Gary wasn't all the way dumb and he figured it out on his own. And if he couldn't, he had hired a private investigator.   


  I was still a kid at the time and so no one shared all the tawdry details, but since that time I've pieced it together from multiple accounts that Linda basically had boyfriends all over New York, Los Angeles, Montreal, and she'd often use Gary's money to fly out to see them, or even worse, spend Gary's money to fly them out to Canada. We all thought that Gary was using the private investigator to gather evidence for a glorious divorce against Linda that would teach her a lesson, but sadly that was not to be.   


  Ever since Bernice died Gary had never really recovered, and now that Linda had clearly betrayed him he spiraled really quickly into deep depression. It's even worse because he maintained this stoic, happy vibe around his sons. Then one day out of nowhere he just blows his brains out with his old army automatic.   


  Everyone is devastated, especially Linda. But not for the reasons that everyone else is. She's distraught because her husband's insurance doesn't pay her diddly squat in the event of a suicide. Her consolation prize is that after all is said and done she not only has Gary's five bedroom house which is paid off, but also the vast majority of his retirement 401K and close to all of his savings. Howie and Frank did get a few thousand dollars each, but it would in no way see them through college, or even set them up to be independent in town with an apartment for any length of time.     


  Howie was over eighteen now and attending the local college to become a software developer. His dad had been helping him pay for it, but he also worked part time as a waiter in town. Frank was in his last year of high school. Linda did not offer to help Howie continue to pay for his college, and he couldn't afford it on his own so he dropped out and worked full time at a retail store. Neither he nor Frank wanted to live with Linda, so my own parents took them both in. It was a tight fit. I was lucky being the only girl because I still got to have a bedroom all to myself. Howie had to share a room with my brother Kevin, and my brother Paul stayed with Frank (""Paul Frank,"" like the clothing and accessory brand LOL).   


  My own parents weren't especially well off so it was clear all of us, sons, daughter, and cousins, would have to work at least part time through college. My dad's accounting job paid well, but he was the only full time worker in our household of now seven, so all of us got jobs as teenagers and young adults to pitch in. I went to cosmetology school and became a professional hair stylist. Eventually at age twenty three I met my husband (Logan, same age) at a photoshoot we were both working at. He's a professional photographer. We have a three year old daughter Natalie.   


  All four of the boys are married now. My brother Paul became an accountant like my dad and he and his wife have two daughters, my brother Kevin became a high school science teacher and he has a daughter (the girls in our family are finally catching up!), my cousins Howie and Frank both have wives and two kids each, though both of them have a son and a daughter. Howie played minor league professional hockey for several seasons and became a professional furntiture maker like his dad used to be. His brother Frank is his business partner.   
 

 It seems like Linda became a distant part of the past.   


  But I never forgot her.   


  It's a shame my cousins didn't get to continue with their dad's business, because almost before Gary's body was cold, Linda sold off the business and liquidated everything, yielding many thousands of dollars free and clear, but erasing what should have been a family business to last many generations. She also sold Gary's house and yielded many more thousands of dollars. So all of these fire sales in combination with Gary's retirement and savings money meant that Linda was a millionaire. She moved away, I assumed, into the ether, never to be seen again.   


  Yeah I never forgot her, but my husband Logan reminded me.   


  In showing him old family photos, Logan told me that Linda looked really familiar. ""She's younger here, but I took headshots for her not more than a year ago.""   


  Fascinated, I waited while Logan flipped through his digital camera archives and zeroed in on one of his clients. Sure enough, it was Linda, using what I know to be her maiden last name. A bit older, yes, but still flashy and I must admit she's still breathtaking. Credit where credit is due. Though, I must say she does look like she had at least a little bit of botox done on her forehead.   
 

 Digging around a bit more, and with both Logan and I using our connections in the theater, photography, and fashion industry (such as they are in our part of Canada), we come to discover that Linda is living in New York these days, and is still an aspiring actress.   


  My brothers and cousins are all married and living their lives, but when I call them up and tell them I've found Linda, all are down for a little fun at her expense.   


  We hatch a plan. Nothing too serious. We just want to take Linda down a peg.   


  All of us buy a couple of burner phones at random places, wearing dark glasses and hoodies, paying cash. We've all watched The Wire. We know how it goes.   


  So, I think of most of my clients, and realize most are women, and the men I know aren't straight. I ask my husband, ""baby, who do you know that's a guy and drop dead hot? I mean, other than you?""   


  Once I convince him I only have eyes for him, he suggests are Russian-Canadian friend of his. A professional model and actor who spends most of his time in Russia and only a few months of the year in North America. Six feet four, two hundred pounds of Slavic muscle. Ohhhhh, yummy. Calm down OP, I tell myself, I'm married LOL.   


  Seriously though, all kidding aside. Sergei is twenty three and looks like he came straight out of a male underwear photo shoot. We explain to him what we need from him, and once my cousins tell him what Linda had done to the family, he was totally down to play along. Especially when we offered to pay him a few thousand dollars for his help.   


  The two thousand dollars came about something like this. ""Daddy, can I have two thousand dollars?"" Dad says, ""What for? Are you and Logan in trouble? Business slow?"" ""No, it's just that I've tracked down Linda, you know, Gary's wife, and I am going to make her look like an idiot and need a little money to make it work."" ""Oh. Well I'll just spend less on us all at Christmas. Here's a check for THREE thousand dollars. Don't tell your mother. Let ME tell her. I need this. Keep me in the loop.""   


  So by calling on people who live in New York and are in the theater scene, we find out where Linda lives, and who she talks to for her theater union or whatever they have. By asking around on the phone, we discover that Linda still dates online. We read up her dating profile and it's totally nauseating. She talks about how she's an actress as if she's been in a lot of things, and she has all these photos regarding her travels, so we know she has a passport.   	

&amp;#x200B;

At our instruction, Sergei creates a dating profile just to contact Linda. He of course has to fill it with his photos as bait. Because he looks the way he does, right away his profile gets slammed by lots of messages from women, and even men. But he starts messaging Linda. 	

&amp;#x200B;

We all know that women get way more attention than guys on these things, and despite Linda being fifty something and older than average for online dating, she's still amazingly beautiful. Whether she'd even see Sergei's profile over what must be dozens or even hundred of other messages from guys looking for a rich cougar was a gamble. But after a couple of days, it pays off and Linda messages him back. 	

&amp;#x200B;

Sergei clearly knows what to do, and immediately charms Linda with his accent and his looks and the whole international muscle guy aura he's got going for him. He is of course using a burner. He tells her he's an international businessman who goes to Canada, the USA, all over Asia and Europe. Mainly selling textiles. The fortunate bonus that he speaks Russian, French, English, and even conversational Vietnamese (I know, right? It shocked me) help establish his bonifides. Linda spins a web of bullcrap about how she's a former ballet dancer and that's why she's still so slender and fit at her age (I think it's more due to lipo and anorexia, but wharever, I can be salty, especially after how she did Howie and Frank dirty). He implies that he has a second career working international security for high profile people, too, and has different work phones assigned to him by his employers. It gives him this air of mystery and danger which I guess is interesting to a basic betch like Linda. 	

&amp;#x200B;

Sergei basically gets Linda to really like him during the course of their online exchanges. He even gets her to send him nudes (ew). Sergei in turn forwards these spicy pics to everyone else's burner phone. Gentlemen, you haven't lived until you've gotten crotch pics and bathroom mirror ducklips from  a bleached blonde, fifty five year old woman.   	

&amp;#x200B;

Long story less long, Sergei ""admits"" that he's falling for Linda, despite having never even seen her in person, and wouldn't it be wonderful if they could meet? Sergei tells her he's in Russia now. This whole time, Linda is wary that someone as young and handsome as Sergei must be looking to steal her money. Sergei heads off that suspicion by having a friend of his in Dubai send her a bottle of expensive liquor, with a signed card pretending it's with his compliments. The friend made sure to send him a copy of his ""signature"" so he could replicate it himself, and have others replicate it if necessary. From Russia, another generous, good sport who is actually a friend of Logan's who works in a wholesale store, not Sergei's, sends a bottle of perfume to Linda, again signed by ""Sergei."" 	

&amp;#x200B;

Sergei actually even ""offers"" to buy Linda's ticket to meet him in Moscow. To get to the hotel he's staying at, one need only take an eleven hour plane flight, and then take a car, bus, or train another hour or so out to a lovely little village where he will f--k her brains out and they can travel Eastern Europe like Cyrillic Romeo and Geriatric Juliet. Convinced by now, Linda scoffs at the idea of Sergei paying her way. She insists on buying a first class ticket to Moscow with her own money.   
 

 ""Okay! But once you arrive, I'll pay for everything else!""   


  I wasn't there, but I'm assuming that by this time Linda's panties are so wet that they've evaporated into mist.   


  The big day comes, and Linda flies out for her Russian rendezvous. Sergei had a friend of his who manages a hotel in the outer Moscow suburbs help him out, which was why Sergei needed to use the particular hotel chosen. The fact that it was far out of the way and rarely even half-filled certainly helped.   


  Only Sergei speaks Russian in our conspiracy group in Canada, but he assures us he's followed our directions to a T.   


  The friend, who speaks no English, copies a photograph of a message.   


  Then we wait.   


  The friend in Russia eventually texts Sergei's burner that Linda is at his hotel, looking quite lovely he might add. She asks him where her room is, where is Sergei.   


  The man speaks no English but through translation apps her meaning becomes clear. ""Ah!"" Of course.   


  The man uses his own phone to compose a message that is then translated into English. ""I don't know Sergei, but you have a room and it's right this way. His hotel has a close circuit tape that he later showed us all. Linda walks to a third floor room. and is given a key. The whole floor is deserted, as it isn't a popular hotel even if it's beautiful, being as it's in a quiet neighborhood and is far from the city. Linda texts many messages to Sergei this whole period, who stopped answering once Linda got ten minutes out of the airport.   


  After Linda had been in the hotel a few minutes, a bellhop approaches and gives her an ice bucket with a bottle of champagne, along with an envelope.   


  I don't know if Linda drank the champagne or what she did after she closed the door. She definitely stayed the night, according to management. She left quickly the next day without saying anything.     
 

 It must have been something in the note that upset her so much.   


  What's so upsetting about champagne and a card?   


  I'd think anyone would be glad to get a chilled bottle of Crystal.   


  And if it comes with a mysterious note that says ""Hope you have a wonderful Trip, love, Gary,"" who cares?   


  While all this was happening, all of us with burner phones were texting Linda's naked selfies to all the contact numbers we still had from when we were part of her life. It had been nine years, but we're Canadian, and we don't update.   


  Then all the phones were smashed with hammers and thrown away without any replying.   


  But before we did that, I sent the photos to a mutual friend of mine and Logan's in New York, who with the help of her friends, printed a hundred copies at the local box and ship, and smooth as can be, left a few here, a few there, a couple dozen scattered all around various theater venues, in old phonebooths, on subway seats, in windows, you get the idea.   


  Sergei deleted his dating profile and all his pictures. He made sure never to be in real facetime with her. He knows how to ghost, and how to deny, deny, deny. He's now doing his little panty dropper studwalk in Kiev for the next several months.   


  The past many years, we'd all moved to different houses and apartments since Linda stole my uncle's life and drove him to death and robbed his children of their father and their inheritenace, so if anyone ever asks us if we know something about this, we'll play dumb.   


  Linda's had time enough to make all sorts of enemies. Could have been anyone, really.   


  My parents still live in the same house. Other than my mom making sure my dad deleted Linda's boob and beaver pics, they're playing dumb, too.   


  There's always MILF porn, Linda.   


Beside's, you're still rich off your dead husband's money, so why so sad?

My apartment doesn't have on-site parking, so I had to buy a permit to park on my street and surrounding streets. If you park in the area without a permit, you get a parking ticket that's \~$60.

&amp;#x200B;

The permit is large and hangs from your rearview mirror (like a handicap permit). I had gotten two parking tickets in the past few months even though I had a valid permit. One was because the parking officer thought my permit was expired (which it wasn't), and the other was because I had forgotten to put my permit on my mirror after a day at work.

&amp;#x200B;

I had an administrative hearing this morning to contest these two parking tickets. It is a nice day, so I decided to walk to the hearing. Plus, I had gotten a good spot in front of my building and didn't want to lose it. I took my permit with me so I could prove it was valid and walked to the hearing.

&amp;#x200B;

The hearing took about a half hour because of all types of paperwork. After the hearing, I decided to treat myself to a coffee for the walk home. The line at the coffee shop was long, but I wasn't in a rush. I finally got my coffee and took a leisurely stroll through the side streets to look at the beautiful blooming [Jacarandas](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/28/b8/a5/28b8a5d88a0fe6bb4d5092cd7b964b3c.jpg).

I'm about a half a mile from home when it hits me: if I have my permit with me, then that means my car is parked without a permit. I start to run home and look like a mad person sprinting through the streets of LA in my business casual outfit.

&amp;#x200B;

I finally get to my car when I see it: a brand new parking ticket for parking without a permit.

It’s understandable. Every team *does* have reason to be optimistic about this upcoming season. Anyone who comes flying in to talk down on those positive expectations is only raining on the parade of anticipatory fans.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I hate being negative. Nothing good comes of it.

# Arizona Cardinals

**David Johnson is 27 years old**

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to kick this off with something no one can argue me on. David Johnson is 27, that is until December 16th when he’ll be 28. But we’re living in the moment here.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I point this out is because it feels like we’re still waiting for him to fully unleash who he is as a player. He had a spectacular season in 2016 where he tallied over 2,000 yards from scrimmage and 20 total touchdowns. He followed that up with an unfortunate early season exit after carrying the ball just 11 times. Then, in 2018, Johnson got caught up in Mike McCoy’s web of ineptitude and didn’t look like himself.

&amp;#x200B;

Johnson has suffered two season-ending injuries in his short career: a sprained MCL and a dislocated wrist. In a league with only two starting running backs over age 29 (McCoy and Peterson) it’s looking like David Johnson’s career is closer to the end than the beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s a sobering thought for one of the most entertaining running backs in the NFL. But that’s just the cold, hard truth.

Most team’s are known for something. For the Cowboys it’s dominating offensive line. For the Ravens it’s a stifling secondary. For the Falcons, it’s their inability to create pressure on the quarterback.

&amp;#x200B;

Atlanta’s non-existent pass rush has been a known deficiency for a few years. Even in Vic Beasley’s deceptive break-out season with 15.5 sacks his overall impact wasn’t as dramatic as that number would suggest.

&amp;#x200B;

This season’s group is looking a lot like last season’s group. Vic Beasley and Takkarist McKinley at end. Grady Jarrett and a rotation of “J.A.G.’s” at the other DT spot. In free agency Atlanta brought back Adrian Clayborn. They did add a defensive end in the fourth round as well in John Cominsky. Conveniently enough, Cominsky’s biggest weakness is as a pass rusher. Perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

Without many changes on the defensive front, this unit isn’t looking improved heading into the new season. That doesn’t bode well for a top-10 offense that’s hoping to get some help from their counterpart.

&amp;#x200B;

# Baltimore Ravens

**Baltimore's old-school ground and pound attack will drive them right into the ground**

&amp;#x200B;

Lamar Jackson’s 147 rushing attempts as a rookie was 21 more than the next highest quarterback in 2018. Jackson only started seven games.

&amp;#x200B;

Granted, it was largely as a result of the Ravens acclimating him midseason and playing to his immediate skill-set. But, that aspect of Jackson’s game is not going anywhere. On top of that they added hard-hitting between the tackles runner Mark Ingram. Baltimore is gearing up for a “wear you down” type of offense in 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

That directly contradicts what literally every one of the other 31 teams are doing. Sure, the Seahawks and Cowboys will always be a run first team. However, no squad will be passing as little as the Ravens are preparing to.

&amp;#x200B;

This was an interesting attack for a few weeks when Jackson was making his first few starts. But that identity aged quickly. In Baltimore’s playoff game, Lamar completed less than 50% of his passes. The Chargers held their rushing attack to less than 100 total yards.

&amp;#x200B;

Baltimore got beat. Not terribly thanks to their elite defense. But, Los Angeles proved that this attack could be stopped if they do just one thing: Force Lamar Jackson to throw. Rushing the ball 50 times per game isn’t helping Jackson develop. That game plan could doom them this season.

&amp;#x200B;

# Buffalo Bills

**Josh Allen might be the answer, but we won’t know after this season**

&amp;#x200B;

Quarterbacks need at least two seasons in the NFL to even begin to be judged. Josh Allen is probably going to need three.

&amp;#x200B;

He looked promising at times but one thing held him back: A lack of talent around him. That issue has followed them into 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

LeSean McCoy is back at running back and they added another 30+ name for support in Frank Gore. Zay Jones leads a receiving corps followed by John Brown, Robert Foster and Cole Beasley. Tyler Kroft was set as the dynamic young tight end until his season ended early with a broken foot.

&amp;#x200B;

Buffalo’s offensive line received some solid reinforcements with center Mitch Morse and tackle Cody Ford among other players to fill the gaps.

&amp;#x200B;

Oddly enough, the Bills were one of the most active teams in the offseason on offense. You can’t say they didn’t try. Unfortunately, it’s the same core group in terms of skilled position players. Josh is going to need more than a washed up running back and a drop-prone receiver to help pull the Bills out of the depths.

&amp;#x200B;

# Carolina Panthers

**Carolina is in the toughest position to make the postseason of all playoff contenders**

&amp;#x200B;

It’s 2019, which means the Panthers are a threat again. The odd/even year theory has been pretty consistent in Charlotte.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, they find themselves in an uphill battle before the season has even begun. Out of division schedule aside, Carolina has more working against them than any other playoff contender.

&amp;#x200B;

The Saints are a favorite by many to reach the Super Bowl. The Falcons are a perennial playoff menace barring injury to key players. The Bucs are are feisty enough to be a factor. So where does that leave the Panthers?

&amp;#x200B;

They’re basically the unanimous third best team in this division. That puts them in play for a hotly contested Wild Card spot.

&amp;#x200B;

For a team that is absolutely in play for a postseason birth, they have an unusually hard journey ahead to just escape their division.

&amp;#x200B;

# Chicago Bears

**Chicago's receiving corps is not very good**

&amp;#x200B;

At a glance, Chicago’s arsenal of wide receivers is as solid as any in the league. But if you look a little closer, it could be what keeps Trubisky from taking that next step.

&amp;#x200B;

Let’s start with Allen Robinson. At this point in his career, it would be apt to label him a “one-year wonder”. He broke out as a sophomore for 1,400 yards and 14 touchdowns at a massive 17.5 yards per reception. Outside of 2015, though, Robinson has never topped 900 yards, six touchdowns or 14 yards per reception in a season. It’s a clear outlier that has led AR14 to being greatly overrated.

&amp;#x200B;

Next is the shifty duo of Taylor Gabriel and Anthony Miller. Gabriel is a niche player. He’s best as the third option in an attack and especially thrives in creating yards. Anthony Miller is entering just his second season. He’s a crafty receiver with great moves with the ball in his hands. Both are complimentary players.

&amp;#x200B;

Rounding out the receiver group is “Swiss Army Knife” Cordarelle Patterson and rookie Riley Ridley.

&amp;#x200B;

At tight end is Trey Burton. The expectations for him were sky-high after leaving Philly. But, he only averaged 10 yards per reception in 2018. His threat as a receiver appears limited on the field.

&amp;#x200B;

None of these players averaged more than 14 yards per reception in 2018. Matt Nagy’s system is certainly creative, but there seems to be a lack of blue-chip talent to carry the group.

&amp;#x200B;

# Cincinnati Bengals

**Cincinnati is wasting an elite skilled-position corps by keeping Andy Dalton**

&amp;#x200B;

Despite vastly outplaying his draft position, Andy Dalton cannot catch a break. That’s not about to change now.

&amp;#x200B;

The Bengals are the most home-grown team in the NFL. They rarely dip into free agency and prioritize their own above all. This strict draft and develop plan has netted them a fantastic core of offensive playmakers. A.J. Green and Tyler Boyd may be the best receiver duo in the NFL. Joe Mixon and Giovani Bernard are a dynamic duo in the backfield. Add in John Ross and a bevy of serviceable tight ends and this offensive attack is dangerous.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, their biggest weakness is at the most important position.

&amp;#x200B;

Andy Dalton’s skill-set will never be able to take full advantage of the wealth he has at his disposal. The Bengals just wasted an opportunity to move on from Dalton as a new coaching staff moved in.

&amp;#x200B;

This team has the pieces to be an intimidating force in the AFC North. But as long as Dalton is behind center, they’ll be a forgotten entity.

&amp;#x200B;

# Cleveland Browns

**It will be impossible to live up to the hype**

&amp;#x200B;

John Dorsey and Co. have been busy this offseason. They’ve watched big names leave like Kevin Zeitler, Jabrill Peppers and Jamie Collins. More importantly, Cleveland has ushered new players in like Odell Beckham, Olivier Vernon, Sheldon Richardson and Kareem Hunt.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s a reloaded roster that already had solid core talent. Especially after Baker Mayfield’s incredible rookie season, the hype surrounding this team has (understandably) reached nuclear levels.

&amp;#x200B;

With all of the conversation surrounding the Browns already this offseason with more to come, it’s going to take a lot for this team to satisfy expectations.

&amp;#x200B;

Usually the “winner of the offseason” isn’t a title that ages well into the season. But, last season the Rams reached the Super Bowl after adding huge names in free agency. That only adds fuel to the fire in Cleveland that this load up on talent could produce big result

&amp;#x200B;

It’s possible this team is dominant. But hype of a Super Bowl run could lead fans disappointed after a playoff appearance. Expectations are huge in sports. The expectations set in Cleveland are nearing unreachable levels.

&amp;#x200B;

# Dallas Cowboys

**Dallas isn't going anywhere with Jason Garrett as head coach**

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like Jason Garrett would have to go 0-16 and get caught snorting cocaine Chris Foerster-style for Jerry Jones to fire him. Even then, it wouldn’t be too surprising if Jones just put him on the proverbial “hot seat”. Suffice it to say Jason Garrett will probably be is Dallas for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

As long as he is, this team isn’t going all the way. He’s the head coach version of the Dalton-scale.

&amp;#x200B;

Garrett is by no means a bad coach. He’s brought the Cowboys two division championships in the past three years. But, his conservative style isn’t going to shock teams like the Patriots and Rams who are constantly evolving with their innovative attacks.

&amp;#x200B;

The Boys will compete every season. However, if Jerry Jones’ goal is to bring the Lombari to Jerry World, he’ll have to look elsewhere at head coach.

&amp;#x200B;

# Denver Broncos

**Joe Flacco will be Case Keenum 2.0**

&amp;#x200B;

This is definitely the least spicy take of the list. But, the Broncos brought Flacco in for a reason. They believe he’ll be an upgrade from Keenum. Upgrade? No. Downgrade? No. I’ll take the push.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point in his career, Joe Flacco is basically the name-brand Case Keenum. He has the flashy Super Bowl win. He had (not anymore) heated debates held around him being elite. He even (somehow) got the mega-contract from the Ravens. As a player, however, Flacco is Keenum and vice versa.

&amp;#x200B;

The Broncos learned from their mistake last year of not having a young stud waiting behind Keenum if all went south. This year, Drew Lock will be breathing down Joe Flacco’s neck similar to how Lamar Jackson was last season. It’s not an enviable position Flacco is in, but that’s what happens you’ve reached the point in your career when you’re only “kind of” wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

# Detroit Lions

**Matthew Stafford is the NFL’s most average quarterback**

&amp;#x200B;

Since the introduction of the “Dalton Scale” (thanks ""Around the NFL"") the debate of who is a franchise quarterback and who isn’t has been a compelling one. But, that’s not what this is about. This is more focused on the most average. The 16th best quarterback in the NFL to be exact.

&amp;#x200B;

That player is Matthew Stafford.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this isn’t to condemn Stafford. He’s a really talented player who is without a doubt a franchise quarterback. It more speaks to the insane wealth of quarterbacks in the NFL today.

&amp;#x200B;

I won’t go into depth about the 15 quarterbacks ahead of Stafford. But, instead explain why I think Stafford is ranked here.

&amp;#x200B;

Matt “Stat-Pad” Stafford has appeared in the playoffs three times and lost in the first round each time. Pretty average. He’s thrown for an average of 23 touchdowns per year. Very average. He’s won an average of seven games per season. Definition of average.

&amp;#x200B;

Average isn’t always bad. Also, before you come screaming in with how I’m underrating Stafford, take a second and assess the quarterbacks currently in the NFL. You might be surprised with how many great ones there are.

&amp;#x200B;

# Green Bay Packers

**Aaron Rodgers is 35 years old**

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn’t feel like Rodgers is the sixth oldest starter in the league but that’s where he stands. That’s saying something too because the crop of quarterbacks playing far past when most expected is a surprisingly large number.

&amp;#x200B;

He’s accomplished a lot in his time in the league. However, most of it has been individual awards. Apart from a Super Bowl appearance (and victory) Rodgers has two MVPs, two First-Team All-Pros and seven Pro Bowls.

&amp;#x200B;

For a quarterback who many consider the most talented of his time, his postseason resume isn’t as extensive as you’d expect. Eight playoff appearance in 11 years as a starter is really solid. But, he’s reached the Conference Championship just three times.

&amp;#x200B;

There aren’t many teams who have been carried more by a single player than the Packers. But team success is important for a quarterbacks legacy. At 35, it feels like Rodgers’ time is starting to run out.

&amp;#x200B;

# Houston Texans

**Deshaun Watson will be running for his life again**

&amp;#x200B;

The Texans’ offensive line gave up 13 more sacks than any defense combined for in 2018. Watson was taken to the ground 65 times. That’s also more than any quarterback since Texans’ passer David Carr in 2005. It is absolutely unbelievable Deshaun Watson made it through 2018 without major injury.

&amp;#x200B;

So, looking forward to 2019 does Watson have reason for hope? Tentatively. Houston added two rookie starters on the offensive line in the offseason, both at tackle. They settled for Tytus Howard in the first round after Andre Dillard was sniped a pick before them. In the second round they took Max Scharping out of Northern Illinois.

&amp;#x200B;

Howard started 34 games while attending Alabama State. 23 of those starts were at right tackle and only 11 were at left tackle. He’s projected as a left tackle in the NFL mostly due to his athleticism. But boy is he a raw prospect. Max Scharping also needs improvement in his technique as he mans the right side

&amp;#x200B;

The Texans invested valuable capital in the offensive line through the draft. But, two projects at tackle likely won’t cure their woes this season.

&amp;#x200B;

# Indianapolis Colts

**Indianapolis missed an opportunity to add a featured back in the offseason**

&amp;#x200B;

The Colts’ offensive line blossomed into a unit every NFL quarterback wish he had protecting him. Not only did they hold Andrew Luck to just 21 sacks, but they asserted their dominance in the run-game.

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of running... Marlon Mack is a good player. He’s an exciting, splashy back with good power and speed. But, the Colts line made Mack look good in 2018, not the other way around. This makes you wonder what a real, three-down featured back could do behind this line.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m not saying they should have signed Le’Veon Bell. They were right to pass on him. But, the draft offered a few low-cost backs that could have brought Indianapolis’ rushing attack to a new level. Miles Sanders in the second round. David Montgomery in the third round. Damien Harris in the third round.

&amp;#x200B;

The duo of Marlon Mack and Nyheim Hines is a solid one-two punch. But, it would have been fun to see a true potential star running behind the Colts’ line.

&amp;#x200B;

# Jacksonville Jaguars

**Jacksonville’s offensive core is among the weakest in the league**

&amp;#x200B;

The main attraction in Jacksonville is their star-studded defense. Not many are up to date on their offense. Allow me to refresh your memory. It stinks.

&amp;#x200B;

Leonard Fournette’s nagging injuries are well-documented. Even when he’s on the field, his 3.7 career YPC isn’t scaring anyone. At wide receiver is a group full of budding star... ters. Marqise Lee, Dede Westbrook, Keelan Cole, D.J. Chark and Chris Conley may illustrate the smallest difference between a team’s #1 WR and #5 WR. That’s not a good thing. Former Cowboy Geoff Swaim and rookie Josh Oliver tentatively hold down the tight end position.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s a stark contrast from the wealth of options new Jaguar quarterback Nick Foles had in Philly.

&amp;#x200B;

Foles will have to do a lot with very little if he hopes to be an upgrade from Blake Bortles.

&amp;#x200B;

# Kansas City Chiefs

**Kansas City will struggle to repeat as division champs**

&amp;#x200B;

Kansas City burst onto the scene in 2018 as Patrick Mahomes helped this offense reach its full potential. Their offense was firing on all cylinders. They won their division and a playoff game in the inaugural season of the Mahomes-era.

&amp;#x200B;

However, thanks to their porous defense, it took Mahomes throwing for 5,000 yards ad 50 touchdowns to win even 12 games. That’s not going to happen again. Only three quarterbacks in NFL history have thrown 50 touchdowns in a single season. Odds are it won’t happen again in Mahomes’ entire career.

&amp;#x200B;

Their defense made some additions, but most were just replacing losses they sustained. Dee Ford, Justin Houston and Eric Berry left. Frank Clark and Tyrann Mathieu arrived. The biggest difference, however, could be new defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo.

&amp;#x200B;

Even still, factoring in a Mahomes regression plus an improved defense, Kansas City could break even and win 12 games again next season. That may not be enough to beat out the Chargers who also won 12 in 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

# Los Angeles Chargers

**Joey Bosa’s health will deicide if this defense is elite or not**

&amp;#x200B;

It’s well known that quarterback is the most important position in the NFL. But what about the second most important? That honor goes to edge rushers.

&amp;#x200B;

Players like Khalil Mack, Von Miller, Cameron Jordan, Demarcus Lawrence and Myles Garrett are each the most important player on their team’s defense. That goes for Joey Bosa as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Bosa has recorded 28.5 sacks in 35 career games. Unfortunately, that’s out of a possible 48 games in three seasons. He missed nine in 2018 due to a foot injury. Having Bosa healthy for a full 16 games is huge for this defense.

&amp;#x200B;

He’s one of the NFL’s top defensive ends. His ability to pressure the quarterback and slow down the run game frees up other players. Los Angeles has a stacked roster, but being able to rush the passer is vital for an elite defense. All of the top defenses from 2018 had elite pass rushing presences.

&amp;#x200B;

Mack for Chicago, Suggs for Baltimore, Campbell for Jacksonville, Watt for Houston, Lawrence for Dallas, Flowers for New England, Hunter for Minnesota and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

With Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram, the Chargers have an elite pas rushing duo. The only thing that could derail that, and L.A.’s defense, is an absent Joey Bosa.

&amp;#x200B;

# Los Angeles Rams

**We’ve seen the best Jared Goff has to offer**

&amp;#x200B;

Jared Goff is a good quarterback. Beyond that assessment, it’s fairly difficult to say exactly how good of a player Goff really is. But, one thing is for certain: He has limitations.

&amp;#x200B;

Goff and the Rams came up significantly short in Super Bowl 53. While it certainly took a team effort to only score three points, Goff’s personal shortcomings were on full display. His inability to read defensive adjustments was exploited by the intelligent Patriots defense. It magnified a bigger issue that’s been known for a while: Sean McVay is a big reason why Goff has been so successful.

&amp;#x200B;

A head coach can only do so much from the sideline on game day. It’s up to Goff to progress in the mental aspect of the game. This isn’t to say he can’t. Goff is still only 24 years old. But, it’s legitimate to ask if we’ve already seen the best from Jared Goff.

&amp;#x200B;

Players who are highly dependent on a system can only go so far. The Rams’ system may outgrow Jared Goff sooner rather than later.

&amp;#x200B;

# Miami Dolphins

**Josh Rosen is in no better position to succeed in Miami than he was in Arizona**

&amp;#x200B;

You can never judge a quarterback after just one season in the NFL. That is especially true for new Dolphin Josh Rosen. To put it simply: Rosen was set up to fail in Arizona as a rookie.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s difficult enough to acclimate to the NFL when the situation is right. The situation in Arizona could not have been more wrong. He played behind a horrendous offensive line that gave him about two seconds to get rid of the ball. His offense was orchestrated by Mike McCoy who didn’t have an inkling of how to use their playmakers. His head coach was defensive minded and wound up getting fired after 16 games. It was a certified disaster.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, Josh Rosen is in Miami with hopes of a new start. Unfortunately for him, the location is new, but the situation isn’t.

&amp;#x200B;

Miami’s offense has a lot of the same issues as Arizona’s. A lack of reliable playmakers on offense, a depleted offensive line (outside of Laremy Tunsil) and another rookie defensive head coach. His offensive coordinator, Chad O’Shea, is also in the first coordinator gig of his career.

&amp;#x200B;

As well as Rosen has handled the ridiculous situation he’s been put in, it might not be getting better anytime soon.

&amp;#x200B;

# Minnesota Vikings

**Minnesota isn't going anywhere with Kirk Cousins at quarterback**

&amp;#x200B;

In 2018, Minnesota had a top-5 defense in yards allowed. They had a top-10 defense in points allow. They had a quarterback who threw for 30 touchdowns. They had two 1,000 yard receivers. Yet, they missed the playoffs after winning just eight games. What’s missing?

&amp;#x200B;

To put it simply: Being competitive against competitive teams.

&amp;#x200B;

When matching up against average to below-average defenses, Kirk Cousins doesn’t have a problem. In eight games against bottom-half defenses, Cousins threw 18 TDs to 4 INT. However, in eight games against top-half defenses, Cousins threw 12 TDs to 6 INTs.

&amp;#x200B;

The Vikings only won three games out of their eight matchups against defenses that rank in the top-half of the league.

&amp;#x200B;

Losing is a team result. But, there’s a pattern here of Kirk Cousins not playing well when tested. It’s a trait that makes it difficult to get a team past the first 17 weeks of the NFL season.

&amp;#x200B;

# New England Patriots

**New England’s lack of offensive weapons for Brady will begin to show through**

&amp;#x200B;

People have been ridiculing the Patriots’ lack of on-paper offensive talent for years. Belicheck and Brady haven’t had a problem operating without big-name stars for a long time. Mainly because they’ve had one big name making it all work: Rob Gronkowski.

&amp;#x200B;

With the Hall of Fame tight end now permanently out of the picture, the post-Gronk era begins in Foxborough.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s now the indestructible Julian Edelman, rookie N’Keal Harry, broken Demaryius Thomas and journey-man Dontrelle Inman as the top pass-catchers for Tom.

&amp;#x200B;

If Brady is able to sustain the Patriots’ level of success it might be some of his greatest work ever. If not, we can’t say we’ll be surprised given the surrounding talent.

&amp;#x200B;

# New Orleans Saints

**The pressure is on to reach the Super Bowl**

&amp;#x200B;

Stop me if you’ve heard this before: Drew Brees is nearing the end of his career. Well, he's 40 now and it only gets more true every year.

&amp;#x200B;

This team is more loaded than it’s been in a long time. There are virtually no holes on New Orleans’ roster. If you want to get picky you could say Ted Ginn Jr. isn’t a great #2 wideout. Or that Eli Apple doesn’t stack up against other team’s #2 cornerbacks. But, reality is, even at the weakest points of this depth chart, the Saints are a step above a vast majority of the league.

&amp;#x200B;

The Super Bowl window couldn’t be more wide open. But, it’s only open as long as Drew Brees is playing at an elite level.

&amp;#x200B;

He showed signs of slowing down at the end of 2018. But nothing drastic enough to worry about their 2019 prospects. The pressure is on to make a deep playoff run and take advantage of the “Super-Team” New Orleans finds in front of them.

&amp;#x200B;

# New York Giants

**The coaching staff will play Eli for way longer than they should**

&amp;#x200B;

Despite picking Daniel Jones 6th overall, it doesn’t feel like the Giants will be handing him the reins anytime soon. It usually takes an injury or poor play for a rookie to supplant a veteran mid-season. If there’s two things Eli Manning is, it’s durable and consistent.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s going to take the Giants understanding that they’re not going anywhere significant with Eli Manning under center. NFL teams don’t make drastic quarterback changes when things are fine and that’s exactly what Big Blue has been the past couple seasons.

&amp;#x200B;

It wouldn’t make sense for New York to play Eli all season just because he’s under contract. But, as of now, it feels like that’s inevitable.

&amp;#x200B;

# New York Jets

**Le’Veon Bell’s days of being an elite running back are over**

&amp;#x200B;

Le’Veon Bell just cannot stay away from controversy. After executing the most dramatic hold-out in recent memory, he’s again the subject of an intra-team squabble. This time it wasn’t his fault. Adam Gase reportedly didn’t want to spend big money on a running back in free agency.

&amp;#x200B;

While trying not to be too over-reactionary, this little story can’t make Bell happy. He’s secured the bag, but hasn’t secured respect in New York yet.

&amp;#x200B;

This isn’t to say Bell will suddenly become a bad player with with Gang Green. It’s more a “compare and contrast” situation between the Steelers and Jets. The comparisons are very few and far between.

&amp;#x200B;

In Pittsburgh, Bell ran behind a loaded offensive line. He had a Hall of Fame receiver keeping teams from stacking the box. He also had a Hall of Fame quarterback opening up the offense. The circumstance in New York couldn’t be any different.

&amp;#x200B;

The Steelers have had long-standing success with running backs in their system. Now, Bell will have to prove himself outside of that environment.

&amp;#x200B;

# Oakland Raiders

**The Raiders defense is in store for another last place finish in sacks**

&amp;#x200B;

One of the favorite statistics to emerge from the 2018 season is the Raiders’ entire defense combining for less sacks than seven players managed individually. 13 sacks over 16 games is good enough for 17 less than the 31st team. Pretty mind-blowing.

&amp;#x200B;

The question is: Did they do enough to not repeat at 32nd in the league in 2019. My answer: I’m skeptical.

&amp;#x200B;

Oakland’s only big addition along the defensive line was with the fourth overall pick Clelin Ferrell. As far as I know, Ferrell could be the new Khalil Mack. But, if he’s literally anything less, this team will be back in the cellar for sack production.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s fun to crap on Gruden’s Raiders. However, this seems more realistic than just hate.

&amp;#x200B;

# Philadelphia Eagles

**Losing Nick Foles will prove to be disastrous**

&amp;#x200B;

I’ll start off by saying it was never feasible to keep Foles long-term. He was headed out sooner or later and it ended up happening for $50 million guaranteed. That’s a number even Howie Roseman could have never made magically appear.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s no secret that Nick Foles has been the NFL’s most valuable backup over the past couple seasons. He’s given Philadelphia postseason relevancy and, most of all, the team’s first Super Bowl title. Carson Wentz’s injury history is extensive enough to doubt he can make it through a season. Without Foles waiting in the wings, the Eagles' season could be kaput after an injury to Wentz.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s as simple as this: The Eagles lost their second most valuable player. That’s a significant concern.

&amp;#x200B;

# Pittsburgh Steelers

**Antonio Brown’s absence will be a big blow to this offense**

&amp;#x200B;

The feeling among NFL fans seems to be one of “good riddance” about Antonio Brown leaving Pittsburgh. But, we need to pump the breaks on this being just another receiver walking out of the door for the Steelers.

&amp;#x200B;

Pittsburgh has lost it’s fair share of star wideouts in their prime. Most recently it was Mike Wallace and Emmanuel Sanders. While Brown is no longer in his prime, his 30’s will be far better than most other wideout’s 20s.

&amp;#x200B;

Ben Roethlisberger and Co. are losing an elite player who opened up every level of the offense. This team looks a lot different without Brown on the field. It’s too early to label Pittsburgh’s new #1, Smith-Schuster, a star or “in over his head”. But, one thing is for certain: It will be a group effort to replace the NFL's biggest diva this season.

&amp;#x200B;

# San Francisco 49ers

**San Francisco’s poor secondary could neutralize all the work done on the front four**

&amp;#x200B;

The 49ers’ defensive front looks awesome. DeForest Buckner, Dee Ford and Nick Bosa star as Arik Armstead and Solomon Thomas provide support. That’s five first round picks.

&amp;#x200B;

However, as dominating as that unit may be, the secondary is looking like the opposite. It may not matter if there is pressure on the quarterback in three seconds if the ball is already gone after two. Very little was done to improve this poor group in the offseason. Jason Verrett was added but with his extensive injury history, he can’t be counted on as a reliable member.

&amp;#x200B;

Elsewhere at defensive back, Richard Sherman finally began to show signs of age. Ahkello Witherspoon didn’t take the step many hoped he would and was a liability most of the season. Jimmie Ward and Jaquiski Tartt have injury history and have plateaued as below-average safeties.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s an uninspiring group. Wideouts should be looking forward to facing San Francisco’s defense in 2019.

# Seattle Seahawks

**Selecting Rashaad Penny in the first round was a massive mistake**

&amp;#x200B;

It’s no secret that when Seattle took running back Rashaad Penny in the first round of 2018 many were perplexed. Then, after the season, that feeling of confusion turned into frustration.

&amp;#x200B;

Penny not only failed to win the job, but he only had the third most rushing attempts on the team (behind Chris Carson and Mike Davis). Penny already seems like the odd man out after Carson’s breakout season and with receiving specialists C.J. Prosise and J.D. McKissic on the roster. He’s definitely the most highly invested-in backup RB in the NFL.

&amp;#x200B;

By taking Penny 27th overall, Seattle missed on the chance to add players like Darius Leonard, Braden Smith, Will Hernandez, Donte Jackson and Jessie Bates. It was an odd move at the time and looks no better now.

&amp;#x200B;

# Tampa Bay Buccaneers

**Tampa Bay's secondary will doom this team like it did in 2018**

&amp;#x200B;

It’s tough to win games when your defense gives up 29 points, which is exactly how many Tampa Bay yielded per game in 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

Frankly, their entire defense was a mess and on pace for record setting futility by a defensive unit in NFL history. But, the secondary was the most obvious weakness.

&amp;#x200B;

They enter 2019 with the same group plus a couple rookies. Day three picks Sean Bunting and Jamel Dean will join Vernon Hargreaves and Carlton Davis to form the most no-name corner group in the NFL. At safety, it’s up-and-comer Justin Evans and sophomore Jordan Whitehead. Tampa Bay’s four starters last year had a combined three years of starting experience between them entering the season. It’s an aggressively young corps without a player to hang their hat on.

&amp;#x200B;

That unproven youth doesn’t bode well for hopes of an improved group in 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

# Tennessee Titans

**Marcus Mariota is not the answer at quarterback**

&amp;#x200B;

The Tennessee Titans have been in purgatory for what seems like decades. They’ve won three playoff games this century. The most recent victory required Mariota to miraculously complete a pass to himself for a touchdown. None of the three playoff wins have been by more than three points.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, Mariota can only answer for the past four seasons in Tennessee. But even in that small sample size, he’s never completed a 16-game season and has forced his backup to start meaningful games. In the games Mariota has participated in, he’s failed to pop off the screen the way you’d expect a former second overall pick to.

&amp;#x200B;

Mariota hasn’t thrown for more than two touchdowns in a game since 2016. You might think that’s a product of his supporting cast. But, Tennessee has drafted a top-5 receiver, 2nd round running back, had a top-10 tight end and a really solid offensive line.

&amp;#x200B;

What’s missing is a quarterback and the Titans might have one. But, his name isn’t Marcus Mariota.

&amp;#x200B;

# Washington Redskins

**There’s a silver lining to losing Reuben Foster for the season**

&amp;#x200B;

Any injury, especially a season-ending one in May, is heartbreaking. It can slow down a team’s season before it’s even begun and leave the player in the unfortunate position of not being able to contribute.

&amp;#x200B;

With all the negativity, I’ll try to end on a bright note. While the loss of Foster is a big one, it could lift a weight off the shoulders of players and coaches to not have to endure potential questions about Foster’s questionable past during the season.

&amp;#x200B;

An NFL season is as mental as it is physical and we’ve seen many times before teams collapse because of happenings off the field.

&amp;#x200B;

Without Reuben Foster on the field this season, Washington can hopefully skip some of the unnecessary commentary about Foster’s history. It will also allow another Foster (Mason) to step into a bigger role after a nice 2018 season. .",nfl,1304
Blacramento,2019-05-29 15:41:46+00:00,[OC] The 73-year NBA tradition that nobody knows (or cares) about - Every single NBA Finals featured a player was a New York Knick at some point in his career,"**Setting the Scene:**

As the Toronto Raptors triumphed over the Milwaukee ~~Talkies~~ Bucks in the 2019 Eastern Conference Finals, NBA history was made. No, not the Raptors making it to their first ever Finals. Or the first NBA Finals taking place outside of the United States. Or even the chances of Kawhi Leonard staying with the Raptors jumping up from 5% to 11%.
 
No, the Raptors victory over the Bucks was significant due to the fact that Jeremy Lin is on the Raptors roster, unbeknownst to Nick Nurse (damn, that joke would have landed much better before Fred Van Vleet had that baby and started going off).

With Lin being part of a team in the NBA Finals, this keeps alive a tradition that has gone on since the beginning of time. Or at least since the beginning of the NBA, which is really the only time in human history that matters to me. 

Everybody knows the Famous Shaq Streak, so I don't have to explain it to you. If you don't know the Famous Shaq Streak, let me explain it to you. Since 1984, every single NBA Finals has featured a player who was a teammate of Shaquille O'Neal at some point. Like many of you, I heard of this for the first time a few years ago and though ""Huh, that's pretty neat"". 

Around that time, former New York Knick Channing Frye won an NBA championship as a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers. This was coming off the heels of his former teammate, and fellow member of the 2005 Knicks draft class, David Lee's championship victory with the Golden State Warriors the previous year. A few years prior, the third and final member of the 2005 Knicks draft class, Nate Robinson, was a member of the Boston Celtics who made the NBA Finals. They lost to the Los Angeles Lakers who won their second NBA Finals in a row. The year before, who was the starting small forward on that Lakers championship roster? Trevor Ariza - the lone member of the 2004 New York Knicks draft class.

In those two years (2004 and 2005), the New York Knicks drafted four players who contributed to teams that made it to the NBA Finals. All four were teammates for the first half of the 2005-06 season with the Knicks. Three of those four players became NBA champions. None of those appearances were with the Knicks.

The divergence of fates between these four Knicks players and the Knicks as a franchise itself got me thinking back to the Famous Shaq Streak. In many NBA Finals, I look for former Knicks on the roster to help me decide who to root for. So how deep does this go? How many Finals rosters do I have to scour before I find one that didn't feature anybody who played for the Knicks?

The answer (as the title may tell you) is all of them. Every single NBA Finals featured a player who was a New York Knick at some point in his career.

**(Take This For) Data:**

Below is a list of all the teams that made the NBA Finals as well as a member of those teams who were on the Knicks at some point in their career. Many Finals have multiple players who were on the Knicks at some point. To make it easier, **I will only list one Knick per year, even though there may be multiple.**

1. *Dick Garrett is the unsung hero of this streak. By all accounts, the streak could and should have ended in 1974. However, because Dick Garrett is for the people, he allowed the Knicks to cut him after 25 games with the team just so he could sign with the Milwaukee Bucks, where he scored a grand total of 27 points in the green and...lighter shade of green. He did all this because he knew the Bucks would go on to eventually make the NBA Finals and he wanted to keep this streak alive. Dick Garrett, I appreciate you.*

2. *Jim Barnes was obviously the original Kevin Durant*

3. *Gene Conley has one of the most [hilarious Basketball-Reference pages of all time](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/conlege01.html). There are two major gaps in his NBA career: a 4-year one and a 1-year one. Normally, when you see these gaps, they say something like ""[Did Not Play (other pro league—Ukraine)](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/tuckepj01.html)"" or [""Did Not Play (suspended—overweight)""](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willijo02.html). But for Gene? ""Did Not Play (major league baseball—Milwaukee Braves)"" and ""Did Not Play (major league baseball—Boston Red Sox)"". This man switched from the NBA to MLB and back to the NBA...***twice***. Did I mention he's a 3-time NBA Champion, 4-time MLB All-Star, and a World Series Champion? Pat Connaughton has a lot of work to do.*

4. *Fun Fact: The 1951 Royals featured a 30-year old, 5'11"" backup point guard by the name of William ""Red"" Holzman. Holzman would later go on to be the greatest coach in New York Knicks history, coaching the team to its only two NBA Championship victories.*

**So what can we learn from this?**

I'm not sure. I don't know if it makes the tides of fate that much more cruel where the Knicks have had some form of representation in every NBA Finals, only to come away with two championships and being widely considered a joke (for good reason) the past decade plus. Or if I'm just over here manipulating criteria and historical information around to make it seem like the Knicks have some sort of mystique. 

Maybe in this ""Rings Ernie"" culture, when confronted with hurtful truthful statements about how bad my team is, I could throw it back at /r/nba and say ""Hey, in this very convoluted way, the Knicks have been in every NBA Finals!""

Yeah...that wouldn't really work.

Maybe it illustrates a greater problem that has plagued the Knicks for years. Perhaps when Ned Irish invented the Knicks back in 1946, he stumbled upon a monkey's paw and wished for his team to be have championship players throughout its existence. And as per the curse, the Knicks will always be doomed to have players who play in championships for other teams.

Yeah, that's pretty dumb too.

Maybe the point is to appreciate guys like Dick Garrett. And Rick Carlisle, who spent 26 games with the Knicks, ensuring the streak didn't die in 1987. Or Slater Martin, who's 13 games with the Knicks allowed the streak to be 4 seasons long. And now, 69 years later, the streak carries on thanks to Jeremy Lin. Maybe this is what Linsanity was truly all about.


Although, now Kevin Durant probably has no reason to sign with the Knicks because the streak has already lived on...

Dammit Jeremy.

**But what can we *really* learn from this?**

Within a few years, Terri successfully recruited hundreds of members. 10 known members either committed suicide, were murdered,have disappeared, or met with tragic accidents under mysterious circumstances.","Wi*PART ONE*\*

Terri Hoffman, born March 21, 1938, was the founder of the spiritual movement known as Conscious Development of Body, Mind, and Soul. Terri believed that she was someone special: when she was only 4-years-old, relaxing under a shade tree, three men in splendid robes appeared and told her that she could do or be anything she wanted. They told her that they could not be seen by many people. These people included the children that ridiculed her, and the adults that looked down on her and her impoverished family - especially her alcoholic father. They told her that when she was troubled, she should think about God. So, throughout her life, Terri thought about God. As a matter of fact, Terri devoted her life to God.

Terri’s upbringing is best described as unfortunate. Terri’s mother gave birth to Terri’s stillborn sister and then shortly after passed away from tuberculosis. When Terri was 9-years-old, her father, unable or unwilling to raise her, sent her to a Lutheran Orphanage in Round Rock, Texas. Terri’s religious visions became more vivid and prominent than ever. Terri was outcasted by her peers and was often subjected to bullying. Terri found solace in her religious visions and found that they made her stronger. It was during her time at the Orphanage that Terri learned about Eastern beliefs. Terri learned from one of the nuns of the spiritual concepts of Karma, reincarnation, and the Ashakic Records - “a compendium compendium of all human events, thoughts, words, emotions, and intent ever to have occurred in the past, present, or future.”

It was also during her time at the orphanage that Terri became convinced she was she was the reincarnation of St Teresa of Avila, a 16th Century Roman Catholic Saint. Ávila, as Terri believed of herself, also had visions of Jesus and Mary, had visited heaven, and was deeply involved in meditative prayer. When Terri was 11, she was adopted by a Dallas couple who renamed her Terri Lee Branson. Terri entered school and began what appeared to be a normal, stable life. However, Terri made just a few friends and often made poor choices. Shortly after Terri’s 15th birthday, she met 18-year-old John Wilder, who was said to have an infatuation for young, high school girls. In 1953, the young couple eloped in Durant, Oklahoma. The couple inflated their ages by three years, and were thus granted an official marriage certificate.

The newlyweds moved to a farm approximately 6 miles outside of Downtown Dallas. 18 months later, Terri gave birth to her first child, Cathy. In 1954, Terri wanted to experience life outside of being a housewife. Terri began to take local meditation and hypnosis classes which further sparked her interest in metaphysics, spirituality, and the occult. Terri had two more children: a son, Kenneth, born in 1958, and a second daughter, Virginia, born in 1963. Though they struggled financially, they lived a relatively comfortable, peaceful life. By the time they raised enough funds to move, the family relocated to Farmers Branch, a small suburb of Dallas, Texas.

In the mid to late 60s, Terri started off as a teacher of spirituality out of Southern Methodist University in Dallas. Terri’s class, which was free to attend, was known as Dallas’ foremost metaphysical study group. She taught hundreds of Dallas students face-to-face about spiritual Eastern values such as meditation, reincarnation, theory of karma, and astral travel. Terri’s teachings had an emphasis on balance, perspective, and freedom from drugs, though, unbeknownst to her students, “freedom from drugs” was hypocritical at best. Terri gained widespread fame within a matter of a few years, much to no one’s surprise. Terri was charismatic, kind, and had a welcoming, charming smile. According to Terri and the masses, Terri had abilities that made her completely unlike any other. Terri could see the past and future, levitate, travel outside her body, communicate with the deceased, heal the ill, and protect her students from harm.

In 1974, Terri founded and legally incorporated Conscious Development in Texas. Terri successfully sold tapes and booklets of her teachings. Conscious Development gained popularity, and attracted hundreds of people - mostly drug users, dropouts, and those seeking purpose in their lives. Terri was seen as a Christ-like figure to her devout students. Students would pray to Terri in their times of hardship, and often shadowed her, hoping to see Terri’s extraordinary abilities manifest before them. Students would give Terri their most treasured and valuable possessions as a token of their gratitude. Students would arrive unannounced at Terri’s home knowing that would be greeted with a warm welcome, and together they would meditate. Students excitedly told family members about Terri’s extraordinary abilities and spiritual deeds, often noting that after having met her, their lives were since better off.

However, the success of the Conscious Development was short lived. Eventually, the Conscious Development gained notoriety. Speculation began to circulate that Hoffman was responsible for the deaths and disappearances of her students. Ultimately, ten people associated with Conscious Development between 1977 and 1990 met an untimely demise. It was revealed that out of those ten, two confided with their relatives they suffered from a terminal illness, although their autopsy reports suggested none of the sort. Additionally, at least four of the associates bequeathed large sums of money and property, totaling over $500,000 directly to Hoffman. These people included,

    •	Glenn Cooley (Suicide) •	Deveraux Cleaver (Drowning) •	Sandy Cleaver (Car wreck) •	Louise Watson (Car wreck) •	Robin Otstott (Suicide) •	Mary Levinson (Suicide) •	Charles Southern Jr. (Disappearance) •	Don Hoffman (Suicide) •	Jill Bounds (Murder) •	David and Glenda Goodman (Double suicides) 

**Glenn Cooley**

Terri and John’s marriage began to fall apart during the late 60s. Terri often complained to John that his negativity was draining her of her full spiritual potential. Terri filed for divorce in December of 1970. John, and Terri’s mother, responded to the drastic move by having Terri committed to a psychiatric hospital. However, Terri’s time at the hospital didn’t last long. Soon enough, Terri was back to teaching. Terri’s divorce from John was finalized in 1971. Terri took custody of Cathy while John took custody of Kenneth and Virginia. Terri’s share of the divorce settlement included a 1968 Mustang, some stocks, a shotgun, rifle, and pistol. John’s share included the house and all the family’s bank accounts.

After her divorce, Terri wed 20-year-old Glenn Cooley, one of her students. By all accounts, Glenn was a troubled, but gentle young man. Glenn, was an avid substance abuser, though through Terri’s teachings, was set on battling his addictions. Glenn had a hard time getting along with others, including his own family. According to Wayne Cooley, Glenn’s brother, “Glenn was searching for something - acceptance as he was, not as someone else wanted him to be.” It appears that, like most cult leaders, Terri offered him that and more. Glenn’s family disapproved of his marriage to Terri. At 33-years-old, Terri was almost twice his age, and from his family’s perspective, an all around “strange” individual. Once the wedding was confirmed, Glenn dropped out of school. Glenn supported himself by working for Conscious Development Gems, Terri’s jewelry business. Terri’s followers were encouraged to buy the handmade jewelry in their inventory. The selection of jewelry, when properly “charged” by Terri, would process protective and healing properties. According to Terri, “the more expensive an item, the more power it contains.”

Glenn’s mother noticed that their relationship was strained by Terri’s overbearing nature. When Glenn visited his mother’s house without the supervision of Terri, Terri would phone him repeatedly in just under a half-hour asking him to come home. Other times, Terri would pull into the driveway and continuously honk her car horn until he came outside.

In late 1976, according to Glenn’s mother, Glenn said that he no longer wanted to be involved in Conscious Development, and also wanted to break off his marriage with Terri. On November 24, Terri filed for divorce. Five days later, Glenn filed a waiver allowing for speedy processing of the divorce, which was granted on January 27, 1977. Five days later, on February 1, Glenn was found deceased by Terri and two other members of Conscious Development in a cabin owned by his parents on Lake Grapevine. Police discovered two pills under Glenn’s body. When the autopsy was performed, traces of Valium and Librium, a hypnotic and sedative of the benzodiazepine family of drugs, were found in his blood. The cause of death was attributed to suicide by drug overdose.

The next day, Terri found a note in her safe, which was apparently left there by Glenn the day before. The note read,

&gt;“I, Glenn Cooley, give to Terri Cooley all of my property, both personal and real. This includes two boats, a 1972 Buick Limited, all jewelry and equipment for its making, all furnishings for the house on Dunhaven Road \[Glenn had given Terri clear title to the house two weeks earlier\], and all cash. I ask that this Last Will of mine not be contested by anyone in any way for any reason. Last, but not least, I give all my love to all my family and friends. As explanation for all this, I can’t really say what it is because of, but I can say what it is not because of: It is not because of divorce with Terri, past drug experiences, inability to cope, etc. What it is — I myself know, but don’t have the words for.”

Considering all factors, such as Glenn’s history of substance abuse, depression, and recent divorce, suicide seemed unquestionable to authorities. However, Glenn’s family raised suspicion. The final account of Glenn’s estate totaled less than $3,000 in assets, and his family was insistent that he had received the proceedings from the jewelry business, and had kept closer to $85,000 worth of jewelry making equipment, gems, and metals” at his residence. Glenn’s mother added that Terri’s behavior during the funeral was suspicious. She said, “She was crying and talking and then she would stop and look up at me to see my reaction. I didn’t understand it.”

However, Terri denied this and all claims that she was involved in Glenn’s death. Terri responded to the accusations by saying, “For them to blame me for Glenn’s death is just totally awful. I did nothing but love that man. I tried to help him as long as we were married; I tried to help him after we divorced.”

Terri told authorities that Glenn had seemed “despondent” and had disregarded her advice not to leave for the cabin alone. Terri claimed that once Glenn departed, she never saw him alive again. Terri’s story remained unchallenged. However, over a decade later, a former Conscious Development teacher notified authorities that she and Terri were present at the cabin during Glenn’s death. She said that, while en route to the cabin, Terri told her that, “Glenn was going to the next level.” She also admitted that once they arrived, Glenn told them that he had consumed “the fatal drugs.” However, this account was never proven.

**Deveraux Cleaver**

Terri used Glenn’s untimely death as verification that there were evil, powerful forces working against them, which she referred to as the “Black Lords.” Shortly after Glenn’s death, Terri conceived a practice that she referred to as “bloodletting.” Members of Conscious Development were led to believe that the “Black Lords” had the power to poison the blood. A former member described the practice, saying, “We needed to have our blood — bloodletting — taken out of ourselves to drain the poison out…  \[Another member\] got several syringes and just sterilized them and … took blood out of whoever felt they needed to have their blood let. A little vial, as much as if you went to a doctor to get your blood tested.”

Ultimately, the introduction of bloodletting was so extreme that many members decided that they, too, no longer wanted to be involved in Conscious Development. Even those who were considered to be loyal, devout members felt as if it was time to quit. However, those who chose to stay embraced the practice. As a result of the fear the conceived “Black Lords” that was instilled in her followers, members became increasingly devoted to Terri, seeking her otherworldly protection. One of Terri’s most loyal followers, and secretary-treasurer of Conscious Development, was a woman named Sandy Cleaver. Described as a “naive” and “sheltered” woman who “enjoyed the income from a ample family trust fund,” Sandy had long searched for a spiritual philosophy that she could apply to her life. When Sandy discovered Conscious Development, she felt as if she finally found the group that she was longing for.

Sandy became heavily involved with the cult within a short period of time. Sandy went as far as divorcing her husband Chuck, because she felt as if he was “blocking her spiritual development.” Chuck later claimed that he allowed sandy custody of their daughter, 7-year-old Deveraux, because he feared that, with Sandy’s belief he reincarnation, “she would sooner kill Deveraux than permit her to live with him.” By 1978, when Deveraux was 14-years-old, Deveraux was said to be “embarrassed” by her mother’s involvement in the cult. By all accounts, Deveraux was a mature, intelligent, and active teenager. Deveraux was much like her peers, and enjoyed poetry, sports, and had a large group of friends.

However, Sandy believed that Deveraux was possessed by the “Black Lords.” Terri fueled Sandy’s belief, saying that she was victim to spiritual attacks perpetrated by Deveraux, who she claimed was a “powerful negative being.” Deveraux was deeply disappointed by her mother’s claims, and often expressed frustration that they could not communicate as mother and daughter. Sandy began to distance herself from Deveraux. Though, in a turn of events, Sandy invited Devereaux to travel with her and her fiancé, another Conscious Development member, to Hawaii. Deveraux was delighted at the prospect of being able to rebuild her relationship with her with mother.

On February 25, 1979, sandy and Deveraux would wade out to a lagoon with an inflatable raft. Apparently, the lagoon was known as a better place for catching crabs than a place to recreationally swim. The lagoon is best described as “calm and shallow,” and does not have a beach area. Sandy and Deveraux waded our approximately 400 yards to an area where the waves broke viciously. According to Sandy, a large, intense wave “knocked them off the raft” before another wave “knocked them apart.” Sandy’s fiancé called the fire department, and Sandy was rescued. Sadly, Deveraux’s lifeless bodies would be recovered hours later.

When Chuck was informed of the incident (prior to the recovery of Deveraux’s body), he flew to Hawaii. During his travels, Chuck received a phone call from a member of Conscious Development. The phone call was intended to serve notice of a document that Chuck needed to see. The Conscious Development made Chuck aware that Deveraux had left a will stating “who was to get her rock collection and her basketball,” along with her “$125,000 trust fund.” The document, allegedly written by Deveraux, was witnessed by two members of the Conscious Development. The document read,

&gt;“I give, devise and bequeath all of my property, including all rights, titles and interests of whatever character I may own in and to any property, real, personal or mixed, wherever situated, to \[Terri\], who has been to me like a second mother…”

However, the Will was not legally binding, due to Deveraux’s age. Still, its existence caused Chuck to question the reality of his own suspicions. Did Sandy, he thought, murder their child?

This concludes **part one** of the Conscious Reality series.

JaguarGator9,2019-05-19 14:52:56+00:00,[OC] JaguarGator9's Weird Stat Thread- Eurovision 2019 Edition,"I’ve watched the Eurovision Song Contest closely in each of the last four years. It helped that the first song in the contest I ever watched (the opening song in 2016) was [this incredibly catchy song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D10ot8lOK7Q) that might un-ironically be one of my favorite songs of all-time. And since then, I’ve been fascinated by the contest, and love watching it every year (even if this year’s contest was a bit lackluster). There have been [amazing dance songs to win the contest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfo-8z86x80), [amazing slow songs to win the contest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymFVfzu-2mw), and [amazingly bizarre songs to win the contest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAh9NRGNhUU).

Oh yeah… and then there’s [this second place finisher from 2007 that I have to share](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfjHJneVonE), there’s [the song that brought us Epic Sax Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHXDMe6QV-U), there’s [the sequel to Epic Sax Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93FLcVGDacs), there’s [the time that a turkey sang on stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps3kxGo_gro), and there’s [quite possibly the worst voice crack of all-time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrtNGikEWcU). 2017 was a really fun and great year for the contest.

The Eurovision Song Contest is not only fun, but it can predict the upcoming season in the NFL. By analyzing and looking at trends from the contest, we can predict what will happen in the 2019 season. No, the thread was not perfect last year, but it got a lot of things surprisingly right. Last year, [I made this thread](https://en.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/8jemsy/oc_jaguargator9s_weird_stat_thread_eurovision/?st=jvtplcqc&amp;sh=154a122e) based on the results of 2018, and the following things happened that were correctly predicted:

- The Colts will not only make the playoffs, but will beat the Titans in week 17

- The Ravens will make the playoffs

- The Browns will win their final home game of the season, defeating the Cincinnati Bengals on 12/23

- Not only will the Cowboys win the NFC East, but they’ll make it to the divisional round

- The Vikings will defeat the Lions at home in week 9

- In perhaps the craziest prediction that was actually correct, the Green Bay Packers will tie a game. That’s right- I correctly predicted off of the Weird Stat Thread from Eurovision that Green Bay ties a game

- The Cardinals will finish in last place

- The Seahawks make the playoffs

- The Patriots represent the AFC in the Super Bowl (which is pretty much like a free space in Bingo at this point)

With all of that being said, it’s time to take a look at the 2019 competition and see what weird trends we can draw from that. How will this year’s Eurovision Song Contest impact the upcoming NFL season?

Albania has sent a song in the Albanian language five times to the competition (I’m excluding songs that were in both English and Albanian; they have to be strictly in Albanian). All five times, the Colts made the playoffs AND won in week 17.

Year | Albania Song | Language | Colts Placement | Colts Week 17
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2006 | Zjarr e ftohte | Albanian | Won Super Bowl XLI | Defeated Miami 27-22
2008 | Zemren e lame peng | Albanian | Lost wild card round | Defeated Tennessee 23-0
2012 | Suus | Albanian | Lost wild card round | Defeated Houston 28-16
2013 | Identitet | Albanian | Lost divisional round | Defeated Jacksonville 30-10
2018 | Mall | Albanian | Lost divisional round | Defeated Tennessee 33-17

This year, Albania sent the song “Ktheju tokes,” which is an Albanian song in their native language. Good news for the Colts- they’ll make the playoffs, and they’ll win their week 17 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Austria has sent a song with a one-word title five times to the competition. All five times, the Giants finished the season with a record below .500.

Year | Austria Song | Words in Title | Giants Record
--- | --- | --- | ---
1971 | Musik | 1 | 4-10
1982 | Sonntag | 1 | 4-5
1983 | Hurricane | 1 | 3-12-1
1999 | Reflection | 1 | 7-9
2013 | Shine | 1 | 7-9

This year, Austria sent the song “Limits” to the competition, which has one word in its title. That’s bad news for the Giants, as history shows that they’ll finish with a losing record because of that.

Additionally, when Austria sends a song with a one-word title to the competition, the Super Bowl champion is from a city that had never previously won a Super Bowl.

Year | Austria Song | Words in Title | Super Bowl | Super Bowl Champion | City’s Super Bowl Titles Before the Win
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1971 | Musik | 1 | VI | Dallas | 0
1982 | Sonntag | 1 | XVII | Washington | 0
1983 | Hurricane | 1 | XVIII | Los Angeles | 0
1999 | Reflection | 1 | XXXIV | St. Louis | 0
2013 | Shine | 1 | XLVIII | Seattle | 0

Note that it’s about the city’s first title, not the team’s. Even though the Raiders won Super Bowl XI and Super Bowl XV prior to winning Super Bowl XVIII, that was in Oakland, as only during Super Bowl XVIII did the city of Los Angeles experience its first title. This means that, since Austria sent a one-word song to the contest this year, the winner of the Super Bowl will be either the Bills, Jaguars, Titans, Texans, Bengals, Browns, Lions, Panthers, Falcons, Vikings, or Cardinals. Sorry, Chargers- because you’re in Los Angeles now, even though you’ve never won a Super Bowl, you’re not eligible for this list.

On top of that, let’s keep this stat going further. When Austria sends a song with one word to the competition, the Minnesota Vikings wind up winning their final regular season game of the season (which, this year, is in week 17).

Year | Austria Song | Words in Title | Week 17 Result
--- | --- | --- | ---
1971 | Musik | 1 | Win 27-10 vs. Chicago
1982 | Sonntag | 1 | Win 31-27 vs. Dallas
1983 | Hurricane | 1 | Win 20-14 vs. Cincinnati
1999 | Reflection | 1 | Win 24-17 vs. Detroit
2013 | Shine | 1 | Win 14-13 vs. Detroit

Because Austria sent “Limits” to Eurovision, the Vikings will win their week 17 game this season. This comes at home against the Bears.

Belarus has qualified for the finals of Eurovision five times. All five times, both the Miami Dolphins and Jacksonville Jaguars lost their final regular season game of the season.

Year | Belarus Song | Did They Qualify? | Dolphins Week 17 Result | Jaguars Week 17 Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2007 | Work Your Magic | Yes | Lost 38-25 vs. Cincinnati | Lost 42-28 vs. Houston
2010 | Butterflies | Yes | Lost 38-7 vs. New England | Lost 34-17 vs. Houston
2013 | Solayoh | Yes | Lost 20-7 vs. NY Jets | Lost 30-10 vs. Indianapolis
2014 | Cheesecake | Yes | Lost 37-24 vs. NY Jets | Lost 23-17 vs. Houston
2017 | Story of My Life | Yes | Lost 22-16 vs. Buffalo | Lost 15-10 vs. Tennessee

This year, Belarus qualified for the final with the song “Like It” by ZENA. This means that, if history repeats itself, the Jaguars will lose their week 17 game to the Colts, while the Dolphins will lose their week 17 game to the Patriots.

Note that also during all five of these years, the Patriots won the AFC East and made it to at least the divisional round of the playoffs. However, I feel like that’s cheating at this point if I did that, since Belarus has only competed since 2004, and since the Patriots win the AFC East and get out of the divisional round with regularity. So I’m not going to map out the full stats with that.

---

Belgium has sent a song starting with the letter “W” four times. All four times, the Lions lost their final regular season game, and the Giants won their final regular season game while finishing with a winning record (that part completely contradicts a previous stat).

Year | Belgium Song | First Letter of Song Title | Lions Week 17 Result | Giants Record | Giants Week 17 Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1963 | Warrom? | W | Lost 24-14 vs. Chicago | 11-3 | Win 33-17 vs. Pittsburgh
2011 | With Love Baby | W | Lost 45-41 vs. Green Bay | 9-7 | Win 31-14 vs. Dallas
2012 | Would You? | W | Lost 26-24 vs. Chicago | 9-7 | Win 42-7 vs. Philadelphia
2016 | What’s the Pressure | W | Lost 31-24 vs. Green Bay | 11-5 | Win 19-10 vs. Washington

This year, Belgium’s song that they sent to the competition was “Wake Up” by Eliot. The performance of this song was so bad that it didn’t qualify for the finals; Eliot sounded half asleep during the song. However, they still sent a song with the letter “W”, so expect the Lions to lose to the Packers in week 17, and expect the Giants to defeat the Eagles in week 17.

Sticking with that stat, all four times that Belgium has sent a song starting with the letter “W,” not only do the Patriots win their division, but they also manage to win a game in the postseason.

Year | Belgium Song | First Letter of Song Title | Patriots Placement in Division | Playoff Games Won
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1963 | Warrom? | W | 1st | Divisional Round vs. Buffalo
2011 | With Love Baby | W | 1st | Divisional Round vs. Denver, AFC Championship vs. Baltimore
2012 | Would You? | W | 1st | Divisional Round vs. Houston
2016 | What’s the Pressure | W | 1st | Divisional Round vs. Houston, AFC Championship vs. Pittsburgh, Super Bowl LII vs. Atlanta

Basically, don’t expect the Patriots run of dominance to end anytime soon if Belgium’s weird stat has to say anything about it.

Croatia has sent a dual-language song to the competition four times. All four times, not only did the #1 seed in the AFC wind up making it to the Super Bowl, but the AFC representative came out of the AFC East.

Year | Croatia Song | Languages of Song | #1 Seed | Division of #1 Seed | Super Bowl Made
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1993 | Don’t Ever Cry | Croatian &amp; English | Buffalo Bills | AFC East | XXVIII
2003 | Vise nisam tvjoa | Croatian &amp; English | New England Patriots | AFC East | XXXVIII
2007 | Vjerujem u ljubav | Croatian &amp; English | New England Patriots | AFC East | XLII
2017 | My Friend | English &amp; Italian | New England Patriots | AFC East | LII

This year, Croatia sent the song “The Dream” by Roko, which was sung in both English and Croatian. Because of this, expect an AFC East team to get the #1 seed and represent the conference in the Super Bowl. In all likelihood, that would be the New England Patriots.

---

Croatia has sent a dual-language song to the competition four times. All four times, the Tennessee Titans made the playoffs and won their final regular season game of the season.

Year | Croatia Song | Languages of Song | Titans Postseason Result | Titans Week 17 Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1993 | Don’t Ever Cry | Croatian &amp; English | Lost Divisional Round vs. Kansas City | Won 24-0 vs. NY Jets
2003 | Vise nisam tvjoa | Croatian &amp; English | Lost Divisional Round vs. New England | Won 33-13 vs. Tampa Bay
2007 | Vjerujem u ljubav | Croatian &amp; English | Lost Wild Card Round vs. San Diego | Won 16-10 vs. Indianapolis
2017 | My Friend | English &amp; Italian | Lost Divisional Round vs. New England | Won 15-10 vs. Jacksonville

Because “The Dream” was sung in both English and Croatian, the Titans will not only make the playoffs, but will win their week 17 game against the Houston Texans in the process.

---

Who wants another “Patriots will be good again” stat? Well, here we go. All four times that Croatia sends a dual-language song to the competition, the Patriots win their final road game AND their final three home games of the regular season.

Year | Croatia Song | Languages of Song | Final Road Game Result | Final 3 Home Games Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1993 | Don’t Ever Cry | Croatian &amp; English | Win 20-17 vs. Cleveland | Wins vs. Cincinnati, Indianapolis &amp; Miami
2003 | Vise nisam tvjoa | Croatian &amp; English | Win 21-16 vs. NY Jets | Wins vs. Miami, Jacksonville &amp; Buffalo
2007 | Vjerujem u ljubav | Croatian &amp; English | Win 38-35 vs. NY Giants | Wins vs. Pittsburgh, NY Jets &amp; Miami
2017 | My Friend | English &amp; Italian | Win 27-24 vs. Pittsburgh | Wins vs. Miami, Buffalo &amp; NY Jets

Since Croatia sent a dual-language song to the competition, expect the Patriots to win their final road game of the season (week 15 against Buffalo), and their final three home games of the season (week 14 against Kansas City, week 16 against Buffalo, week 17 against Miami).

---

Cyprus has sent an English song with one word in its title to the competition four times. All four times, it turns out to be a pretty good year for the state of Pennsylvania; the Steelers finish with a winning record, and the Eagles make the playoffs

Year | Cyprus Song | Language of Song | Words in Title | Steelers Record | Eagles Playoff Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2002 | Gimme | English | 1 | 10-5-1 | Lost in NFC Championship
2009 | Firefly | English | 1 | 9-7 | Lost in Wild Card Round
2017 | Gravity | English | 1 | 13-3 | Won Super Bowl LII
2018 | Fuego | English | 1 | 9-6-1 | Lost in Divisional Round

Yes, “Fuego” was an English-language song. This year, Cyprus sent the song “Replay,” which was a shameless carbon copy of “Fuego” but ten thousand times worse with awful vocals; this song was entirely in the English language. This means that Pittsburgh will have a winning record, and Philadelphia will, once again, make the playoffs.

---

Denmark has sent an artist starting with the letter “L” to the competition four times. All four times, both Kansas City and Washington finish the season with winning records, while the Cardinals finish the season with a losing record. Additionally, all four times, the Chiefs made the playoffs, but didn’t win a single playoff game.

Year | Denmark Artist | First Letter of First Name | Kansas City Record | Kansas City Playoff Result | Washington Record | Cardinals Record
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1986 | Lise Haavik | L | 10-6 | Lost Wild Card Round | 12-4 | 4-11-1
1990 | Lonnie Devantier | L | 11-5 | Lost Wild Card Round | 10-6 | 5-11
1992 | Lotte Feder | L | 10-6 | Lost Wild Card Round | 9-7 | 4-12
2016 | Lighthouse X | L | 12-4 | Lost Divisional Round (got a bye) | 8-7-1 | 7-8-1

I used the Cardinals instead of the city name for this one because in 1986, the Cardinals were in St. Louis, in 1990 and 1992, they were the Phoenix Cardinals, and in 2016, they were the Arizona Cardinals. This year, the artist that Denmark sent was Leonora with the song “Love Is Forever,” which is like every generic coffee shop song rolled up into one. This means that the Chiefs will make the playoffs but won’t win a game, Washington finishes with a winning record, and Arizona finishes with a losing record.

---

Finland has sent a song starting with the letter “L” to the competition five times. All five times, the Minnesota Vikings finished ahead of the Chicago Bears in the standings.

Year | Finland Song | First Letter of Title | Vikings Record | Bears Record
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1964 | Laiskotellen | L | 8-5-1 (third in conference) | 5-9 (sixth in conference)
1977 | Lapponia | L | 9-5 (won division) | 9-5 (second place)
1989 | La dolce vita | L | 10-6 (won division) | 6-10 (fourth place)
2007 | Leave Me Alone | L | 8-8 (second place) | 7-9 (fourth place)
2009 | Lose Control | L | 12-4 (won division) | 7-9 (third place)

This year, Finland sent the song “Look Away” by Darude, the same guy that made “Sandstorm.” The song didn’t qualify, and finished last in the semifinal it was in (it’s not a good song), but that’s good news for the Vikings, as if the weird stat holds up, they will finish ahead of the Bears in the standings.

---

France has sent a song in French and English to the competition five times. All five times, the Patriots won the AFC East and won a home playoff game; however, we’d be here all night if I did that for every single stat. All five times, the Seahawks finished the season with a winning record, and the Raiders lost their week 17 game.

Year | French Song | Languages of Song | Seahawks Record | Raiders Week 17 Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2001 | Je n’ai que mon ame | English &amp; French | 9-7 | Lost 24-22 vs. NY Jets
2007 | L’amour a la francaise | English &amp; French | 10-6 | Lost 30-17 vs. San Diego
2012 | Echo (You and I) | English &amp; French | 11-5 | Lost 24-21 vs. San Diego
2016 | J’ai cherche | English &amp; French | 10-5-1 | Lost 24-6 vs. Denver
2017 | Requiem | English &amp; French | 9-7 | Lost 30-10 vs. LA Chargers

This year, the French song was “Roi,” which was sung in both French and English. This means that the Seahawks will finish the season with a winning record, and the Raiders will lose their final regular season game of the year, which comes on the road against the Denver Broncos.

---

Greece has sent a solo artist whose first name starts with the letter “K” to the competition five times. All five times, the Miami Dolphins and Dallas Cowboys finished with a winning record, while the Cincinnati Bengals finished with a losing record.

Year | Greece Artist | First Letter of First Name | Dolphins Record | Cowboys Record | Bengals Record
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1983 | Kristi Stassinopoulou | K | 12-4 | 12-4 | 7-9
1992 | Kleopatra | K | 11-5 | 13-3 | 5-11
1993 | Katy Garbi | K | 9-7 | 12-4 | 3-13
1994 | Kostas Bigalis | K | 10-6 | 12-4 | 3-13
2008 | Kalomira | K | 11-5 | 9-7 | 4-11-1

This year, the artist representing Greece in the contest was Katerine Duska with the song “Better Love.” This is a good sign for the Dolphins and Cowboys, but a bad sign for the Bengals.

---

Ireland has sent an artist whose first name starts with the letter “S” to the competition four times. All four times, the Dallas Cowboys won exactly one playoff game, while the New York Jets finished second in their division.

Year | Ireland Artist | First Letter of First Name | Cowboys Playoff Games Won | Jets Placement in Division
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1967 | Sean Dunphy | S | Conference Championship vs. Cleveland | 2nd 
1972 | Sandie Jones | S | Divisional Round vs. San Francisco | 2nd 
1981 | Sheeba | S | Divisional Round vs. Tampa Bay | 2nd 
2009 | Sinead Mulvey | S | Wild Card Round vs. Minnesota | 2nd

This year, the Ireland artist was Sarah McTernan with the song “22.” Good news for the Cowboys, and I guess for the Jets as well. The Cowboys will make the playoffs and win a game (but lose in the round immediately after that), and the Jets will finish second in the AFC East. Based on all of these stats, the AFC East might be stacked this year.

---

Malta has sent an artist whose first name starts with the letter “M” to the competition four times. All four times, the Broncos finished ahead of the Raiders in the AFC West, the Bengals finished the season with a losing record, and the Pittsburgh Steelers won their division.

Year | Malta Artist | First Letter of First Name | Broncos Placement in AFC West | Raiders Placement in AFC West | Bengals Record | Steelers Placement in Division
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1992 | Mary Spiteri | M | 3rd place (8-8) | 4th place (7-9) | 1st place (11-5)
1995 | Mike Spiteri | M | 4th place (8-8) | 5th place (8-8) | 1st place (11-5)
1996 | Miriam Christine | M | 1st place (13-3) | 4th place (7-9) | 1st place (10-6)
2008 | Morena | M | 2nd place (8-8) | 3rd place (5-11) | 1st place (12-4)

Note that in 1990, Mary Rose Mallia was supposed to represent Malta with the song “Our Little World of Yesterday,” but they never entered the song, because Eurovision rules at the time only allowed 22 countries to compete. This year, Malta’s artist was Michela Pace with the song “Chameleon,” which was maybe one of five fun songs at the final (seriously- this was not a good year for the competition). This means that Pittsburgh will win the AFC North, and the Broncos will finish ahead of the Raiders in the division.

---

Netherlands has sent a song starting with the letter “A” four times. All four times, the Chiefs win their final regular season game of the year, while the Saints lose their final regular season game of the year

Year | Netherlands Song | First Letter of Title | Chiefs Week 17 Result | Saints Week 17 Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1972 | Als het om de liefde gaat | A | Win 17-14 vs. Atlanta | Lost 30-20 vs. Green Bay
1980 | Amsterdam | A | Win 38-28 vs. Baltimore Colts | Lost 38-27 vs. New England
1986 | Alles heft ritme | A | Win 24-19 vs. Pittsburgh | Lost 33-17 vs. Minnesota
2006 | Amambanda | A | Win 35-30 vs. Jacksonville | Lost 31-21 vs. Carolina

This year, the Netherlands sent the song “Arcade,” which ended up winning the competition (it’s a good song, but personally, it lacked some winner quality that I can’t quite put my finger on; however, this was a pretty weak year for the contest, so I don’t have too many complaints). This means that the Chiefs will win their week 17 game against the Chargers, and the Saints will lose their week 17 game against the Panthers.

---

Slovenia has sent a song starting with the letter “S” four times. All four times, the Colts have made it to the playoffs, while the Texans and Lions have finished with a losing record AND lost their week 17 games.

Year | Slovenia Song | First Letter of Title | Colts Postseason Result | Texans Record | Texans Week 17 Result | Lions Record | Lions Week 17 Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2002 | Samo ljubezen | S | Lost Wild Card Round | 4-12 | Lost 13-3 vs. Tennessee | 3-13 | Lost 38-36 vs. Minnesota
2004 | Stay Forever | S | Lost Divisional Round | 7-9 | Lost 22-14 vs. Cleveland | 6-10 | Lost 24-19 vs. Tennessee
2005 | Stop | S | Lost Divisional Round | 2-14 | Lost 20-17 vs. San Francisco | 5-11 | Lost 35-21 vs. Pittsburgh
2013 | Straight into Love | S | Lost Divisional Round | 2-14 | Lost 16-10 vs. Tennessee | 7-9 | Lost 14-13 vs. Minnesota

This year, Slovenia sent the song “Sebi”, which featured an incredibly creepy performance that still makes me uncomfortable even after sleeping on it for a day. Because of this, the Colts will make the playoffs, while the Texans will lose their week 17 game to the Titans, and the Lions will lose their week 17 game to the Packers.

---

Spain has sent an artist starting with the letter “M” five times. All five times, the Minnesota Vikings made it to the playoffs

Year | Spain Artist | First Letter of First Name | Vikings Playoff Result
--- | --- | --- | ---
1968 | Massiel | M | Lost Conference Championship
1977 | Micky | M | Lost NFC Championship
1997 | Marcos Llunas | M | Lost Divisional Round
1998 | Mikel Herzog | M | Lost NFC Championship
2017 | Manel Navarro | M | Lost NFC Championship

This year, Spain sent an artist named Miki to perform the song “La venda.” Spain’s been garbage at Eurovision lately, finishing outside the top 20 in each of the past five competitions. However, because the artist’s name is Miki, the advantage goes to the Vikings, as they will make the playoffs if history holds up.

---

And finally, the United Kingdom has sent one artist starting with the letter “M” four times. All four times, both the Jets and the Bears finished the season with a losing record, while the Bears also finish behind the Packers in the division standings.

Year | United Kingdom Artist | First Letter of First Name | Jets Record | Bears Record | Packers Placement | Bears Placement
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1964 | Matt Monro | M | 5-8-1 | 5-9 | 2nd place | 6th place
1970 | Mary Hopkin | M | 4-10 | 6-8 | 3rd place | 4th place

**What Does This Mean?**

It can be tough to keep track of all of that, so what do all of these stats mean when put together? Let’s go division by division. Note that if two stats contradict each other, I’m going to exclude them from the list.

**AFC East:** Patriots win the AFC East, win a playoff game, beat the Chiefs in week 14, the Bills in week 16, and the Dolphins in week 17. Dolphins finish the season with a winning record. 

**AFC North:** Steelers finish with a winning record and win the AFC North. Bengals finish with a losing record.

**AFC South:** Colts make the playoffs and beat the Jaguars in week 17. Titans make the playoffs and beat the Texans in week 17. Texans finish with a losing record

**AFC West:** Chiefs make the playoffs but fail to win a playoff game. Broncos beat the Raiders in week 17. Broncos finish ahead of the Raiders in the standings. Chiefs beat the Chargers in week 17

**NFC East:** NY Giants beat Philadelphia in week 17. Philadelphia makes the playoffs. Washington finishes with a winning record. Dallas makes the playoffs with a winning record and win exactly one game in the playoffs.

**NFC North:** Vikings make the playoffs, beat the Bears in week 17, and finish ahead of the Bears in the standings. Packers beat the Lions in week 17. Bears finish with a losing record. Lions finish with a losing record.

**NFC South:** Panthers beat the Saints in week 17

**NFC West:** Cardinals finish with a losing record. Seahawks finish with a winning record.

**General:** A city that has never won the Super Bowl before will win Super Bowl LIV (BUF, HOU, JAX, TEN, CIN, CLE, ATL, CAR, DET, MIN, or ARZ). The #1 seed in the AFC will come out of the AFC East and make the Super Bowl.

*- note that the Jets can’t finish second in the AFC East if the Patriots win the division and the Dolphins finish the season with a winning record due to the United Kingdom stat

Will these stats be right? I don’t know. I correctly predicted last year that the Packers would tie a game based off of this, so that has to count for something. However, regardless of what winds up happening with these stats when the 2019 season plays out, I’ll leave you with [my favorite song from the 2019 contest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5arNtTYK1s).

By 2049,

•India is expected to launch their first ever manned space mission




•The company SpaceX ostensibly has plans on launching their first rocket carrying cargo to Mars.



•The full autopsy report on Elvis Presley, which was agreed to be sealed for 50 years following his death, will finally be made public.







•The cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles will be connected by a high-speed rail line that can transport people from one to the other in just 2 hours and 20 minutes.







And that’s the beginning, sure all that’s exciting, but, we’ve arrived at 2037, just a few years from our time to rise 2049. In 2037 scientists predict we will spend our first summer without frozen arctics. 




In 2042, at current rates the earth will shatter 9 billion in population.



In 2048 it will be possible to mine and set up towns in Antarctica.



But most importantly the ENTIRE decade of the 2040s will host these events, just a reminder that this will ALL happen before Gen X is dead, meaning millennials will still be the second in Reign, followed by most of this sub then gen alpha. What I’m trying to say is most of us teens will not the dominant generation before these events happen, but anyway,



In the 2040s,




half of the Amazon rainforests will likely be deforested.







About half of the global population may not have access to clean water.








But by time we’ve all came close to death by age, the global temperature will rise by 9.8 F•



And in warmer parts of the world, it will be worst than this average 






The winds of tropical storms are expected to increase so drastically that they will not compare to anything imaginable by today’s standards.





The days in the US spent over 90F will out number the days spent below it. 






____________________________________________






We have to do something. This will all mostly if not completely happen before we are the dominant generation. And we’re not going to get anything done when are representatives, congressmen and woman, MEP’s and PM’s are 50 y.o + boomers. Now this doesn’t apply to all countries. I applaud countries like France for making changes. But from a U.S stand point, we’re not doing anything. We have to do something before it’s to late. 




The average millennial is 23. You have to be 30 to run for Congress, meaning we have 7 years to get out there and make a change. 7 years isn’t bad either considering 2012 was 7 years ago.
But we can make a change *now* **.**",teenagers,2291

So this all happened in 2015. I'm an argentinian videogame journalist that traveled for the first time to Los Angeles to attend E3. One of my most anticipated games, Batman Arkham Knight, was releasing only days after the expo was over and I was able to try it out. It was a blast, loved the game, and at the Warner Bros booth they gave me a super nice T-shirt that I still wear these days.  


Thing is, when the expo was over I traveled to New York just for vacations and decided to buy a PlayStation 4 (which I didn't have at that moment) and there was a special bundle featuring Batman Arkham Knight that I totally wanted to have. So the day that the game was released I went to the nearest GameStop wearing that  T-shirt I got from E3 and asked for the PS4 bundle (which I was very lucky because they only had one remaining) and a very nice guy went to look for it.  


The thing is, every single employee (five, maybe six) was wearing the exact same T-shirt that I was wearing and every other customer that walked in started asking me any kind of questions that I was glad to answer followed by ""I don't work here, sorry"" and many laughs. There was this other dude that started yelling at me because his pre-order didn't arrive on time. Even one of the GameStop employees asked me to move some boxes to the storage room and I was like ""man, you don't even know who you work with"".   


In the end, it was an awkward but very funny situation, and I walked away very happy with my new PS4.",IDontWorkHereLady,2908

EvenBreakfast,2019-04-29 02:20:19+00:00,"I'm an Uber driver, that drives Escorts around... [MF]","Like most jobs, I fell into this job accidentally.  I lost my full time job back in 2009,  during the financial crisis.  Like many other Americans, I was living the dream, thinking that real estate would always be there for me.  But I was greedy, borrowed too much.  And as you probably already figured out, it all came tumbling down when the dust settled.  So my house was just being foreclosed on, I had just lost my job, and just started working as a driver for my friend's car service.  It wasn't glamorous by any means, but hey it was a job and I was able to support myself. 

When Uber's popularity exploded, I became an Uber driver early on.  It was fortunate for me, as Uber basically killed my friend's business.  Anyways, I've been Ubering for some time now, and one night I pick up this passenger.  Young, smoking hot blonde, dressed to kill.  I'm professional and polite of course, but she was drop dead gorgeous.  As an Uber driver, I'll play it by ear.  Some passengers want to chat, some want the music on.  Whatever they want really, I'm really an easy going guy.  Anyways, the blonde is a chatty mood, and we're shooting the shit, in typical Los Angeles traffic.  We chat about whatever, music, concerts, what she does for a living.  She's a model, and she needs to get to a shoot.  Odd... it's Monday evening, and I'm dropping her off at a hotel.  Whatever, I didn't really care, we're just chatting.  Anyways, I do my thing, take some shortcuts, and finally get to the hotel.  We say our goodbyes, and off she went.

A couple of hours later, I'm still Ubering, and I get a pickup at that hotel.  It was the same blonde.  Now, I've never picked up the same passenger before, let alone in the same day.  What a crazy coincidence.  We recognize each other of course, and just starting chatting again.  I didn't bring up the fact that I picked her up only a couple hours after her ""shoot"", but whatever, it's not my business.  We're chatting again, it just so happens that her best friend went to the same high school that I did (many years later).  We developed this strange, weird rapport with each other, just laughing and chatting.  Eventually, I dropped her at her apartment, and she asked for my number.  Asked if I did any private driving on my own.  Sure, why not?  I needed to make money, mind as well cut out Uber as the middle man.  

A couple weeks passed, and I honestly forgot about the blonde.  Until one day, she texts me and asks if I'm available.  I'm not really, but I make it work, and I pick her up.  Again, she's dressed to kill, and asks me to drop her at that same hotel.  On the way over, she finally confesses what she's doing.  She's escorting, and meeting a client.  It was so matter of fact.  ""Hey, did you go to Coachella?  ""How about the Dodgers? ""Oh hey, I'm an escort and we're driving to meet a client, you cool?""  I didn't really give a fuck, so long as she paid and I didn't get in trouble.  So I dropped her off at the hotel, waited a couple of hours, and drove her back home.  On the ride back home, I asked how did her appointment go.  Fuck, this girl was kinky as shit.  Without any filter, she explained what happened, what the guy wanted, all the details.  Have to admit, I got rock hard as she was telling me what happened.  After I dropped her home, I went back to my place, pulled up her Instagram and just jerked off to her.  

Soon after, I fell into this role of being the blonde's personal driver.  At least when it came to escorting.  She'd text me the details, I pick her up, drive her, wait around, and drive her home.  She'd tell me about the date, and as I dropped her home, she paid me.  I don't know, there was this cuckold type of thing going on with me.  But having this model, who just got freshly fucked, and telling me all about it was such a turn on.  Like a taxicab confessions, for the older crowd reading this.  Pretty soon, the blonde refers me to her other models, who are also in the business.  Like the blonde, it's all professional on my end.  But picking up these women, knowing what was about to happen, was very erotic for me.

The craziest thing that happened.  This brunette was a regular for me.  Shy, quiet, but again really attractive.  It was my 4th or 5th driving her, and I always stayed in the car during the appointment.  But for some reason, she asked that I come up with her.  Maybe she didn't trust the guy or something, and thought I would be some protection.  (Used to play college football) Honestly, I didn't want to go up.  But I would have felt horrible if I didn't and something did happen to her.  So I went.  In the hotel, I was in the living room, just watching tv or playing on my phone.  But the bedroom door was left slightly open.  Enough where I saw everything.  I saw this cute shy brunette get absolutely fucked and railed.  Her fucking moans could fill an opera house.  After they were done, the guy got dressed and bolted out of the room.  The brunette was up, getting cleaned up, and called for me, since I had her purse.  Fuck, when I came into the bedroom, I almost came right there.  She had sexy lingerie on, heels, and nothing else.  Wasn't ashamed about showing off, that's for sure.  She asked for some help, which I gave, and we just walked out together.  Like all the other times, while I drove her home, she gave me some details.

Today, I'm still Ubering.  But I drive these women around very often.  When I'm with them, I'm professional, polite.  Not too forward, but just act as a sounding board (I'm a good listener).  Each time I drop them home, I'm so horny and hard, I basically pull up their instagram and jerk off to them.  Or if I'm just waiting in their car, I'll pull up their instagram and see if they made a story or post about it.  I just wish, that one day, after I drop one of these models back home, they would give me a special tip.",gonewildstories,1112

&gt;In a civil lawsuit filed Monday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, former Spectrum SportsNet host Kelli Tennant alleges that Walton assaulted her at the Casa del Mar Hotel in Santa Monica while he was an assistant coach with the Golden State Warriors.

&gt;No date was given for the alleged assault, but the suit says it happened after the publication of a book written by Tennant, for which Walton wrote a foreword. The book was published in 2014.


&gt;**“There has been no report made to the Santa Monica Police Department,” Lt. Candice Cobarrubias said in a statement. “No investigation is ongoing.”**

My name is Brent and with my friend Jon purchased the former mining town of “Cerro Gordo” this past July 13th (Friday the 13th). The town was originally established in 1865 and by 1869 they were pulling 340 tons of bullion out of the mountain for Los Angeles. 

The silver from Cerro Gordo was responsible for building Los Angeles. The prosperity of Cerro Gordo demanded a larger port city and pushed LA to develop quickly.  

The Los Angeles News once wrote:

“What Los Angeles is, is mainly due to it. It is the silver cord that binds our present existence. Should it be uncomfortably severed, we would inevitably collapse.”

In total, there has been over $17,000,000 of minerals pulled from Cerro Gordo. Adjusted for inflation, that number is close to $500,000,000.

It’s been a wild ride so far owning a ‘ghost town’ and we’re having a lot of fun figuring out what to do with it. 

Here are a couple links with more background:

&gt;One of the headaches and near-debacles of the final stretch of Johnson’s tenure came in late February. In what could have been a catastrophe, the Lakers needed to prevent point guard Lonzo Ball from undergoing a potential unauthorized surgery on his left ankle that was planned by estranged former business partner Alan Foster and with LaVar Ball’s knowledge, multiple team and league sources told The Athletic.

&gt;Lonzo Ball traveled to Ohio in late February to potentially go through with a procedure on his injured ankle, pushed by Foster, a source familiar with the situation told The Athletic. The family had experience with the doctor who would perform the procedure as he had also operated on LiAngelo Ball, the source said.

&gt;The Lakers found out about Ball’s situation when Lonzo Ball called General Manager Rob Pelinka, and the organization informed him that they would not allow it and could void his contract, sources said. The Lakers then arranged transportation to bring Ball home, sources said. This could have been a disastrous moment for the Lakers, with a core player potentially undergoing a procedure that could have blindsided the organization. But Johnson and Lakers General Manager Rob Pelinka communicated with those around Lonzo, working with his then-agent Harrison Gaines to squash the procedure and bring him back to Los Angeles, sources around the team with knowledge of the situation said. Gaines declined to comment when reached by phone.

NitroXYZ,2019-04-11 05:24:03+00:00,[OC] Every NBA Team Ranked By How Well They Have Performed To Preseason Expectations This Regular Season In 2018-19.,"

 ------  
  
With the regular season now done and dusted I decided it would be cool to take a look back at every NBA team this season and place them into tiers on the level that they have performed at this season.  
  
- Completely Exceeded Expectations  
- Exceeded Expectations    
- Slightly Exceeded Expectations   
- Met Expectations  
- Slightly Didn't Meet Expectations  
- Didn't Meet Expectations  
- Completely Didn't Meet Expectations  
  
  
I made a very similar post to this one last year and it was very positively received so I decided to try writing another post. Here is a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8bnnqc/oc_every_nba_team_ranked_by_how_well_they_have/) for anyone interested. Of course every situation is different and so I have factored in the teams overall win-loss record but also how they have responded to difficult situations this season such as injuries or the context of how they have performed.   
  
One thing that I am changing this season compared to this year is how I view situations with ‘disgruntled players.’ Last year this was an issue when trying to rank the Spurs season due to Kawhi’s absence. As a result I have decided that if a players lack of success is due to a disgruntled player and NOT one who is injured this will negatively effect them. (Sorry Pelican fans)  

**This is just my opinion and I am keen to shuffle the list around if people disagree with my results so feel free to leave your input and I will be very willing to take it into consideration. Please don’t be too harsh and I will try to make sure my rankings are as accurate as possible**  
   
------  
  
Just a couple other things to consider:  
  
-  When I state my predicted expectations It as an average of preseason rankings from ESPN, Bleacher Report, Sports Illustrated, CBS Sports, Action Network and 538. Sources: [ESPN](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24813839/projecting-best-worst-cases-toughest-stretches-all-30-teams), [BR](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2789744-2018-19-nba-schedule-win-loss-predictions-for-every-team#slide2), [CBS Sports](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/sportsline-2018-19-nba-projections-warriors-heavy-favorites-to-three-peat-celtics-raptors-very-close-in-east/), [Action Network]  (https://www.actionnetwork.com/nba/nba-win-totals-betting-odds-2018-2019-warriors-celtics), [538 CARMELO](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2019-nba-predictions/)  
  
- This is the [link] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9ogb2k/201819_season_predictions_from_the_rnba_power/) to the NBA preseason power ranking predictions that I make reference to in my post.  
  
-----    
  
###Completely Exceeded Expectations   
  
- **Milwaukee Bucks** WL Record: 60-22  
  
The Milwaukee Bucks were predicted to win 46 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as few as 43 games. They were viewed as a team that would be on the rise with lots of excitement about the prospect of new coach Mike Budenholzer. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 19/30 voters expected the Bucks to finish as a top 4 seed. However only 1/30 predicted them to finish with a top 2 seed. To finish the regular season with the NBA’s best win loss record is an incredible achievement that very few saw coming. The success of Milwaukee this season can be attributed to many people but the clear stand out is star forward Giannis Antetoukounmpo. In just his sixth season the Greek Freak had one of the greatest seasons in recent history and is expected to poll very highly in MVP voting. It’s going to come down to the wire between him and James Harden but I could see voters giving him the advantage due to his consistency throughout the year, elite defence and greater team success. The performance of the rest of the team also deserves tremendous credit with Middleton making his first all star appearance and Malcom Brogdon joining esteemed company in the 50-40-90 club. The Bucks will be a team to look out for in the playoffs and Giannis will be looking to make a huge statement to the rest of the sporting world.   
  
.  
  
    
- **Sacramento Kings** WL Record: 39-43        
  
The Sacramento Kings were predicted to win 25 games in the preseason with 538 expecting them to win as few as 23 games. They were viewed as a team that just didn’t have the right mix of players. In the preseason their power forward and centre rotation seemed too tall to be competitive with questions about the backcourt depth of the team.      
In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 0/30 voters expected the Kings to feature in the playoffs and while the Kings didn’t qualify for the top 8 in the western conference they were just outside finishing 9th. The Kings had their most successful season in over a decade this season and with the improvement of DeAaron Fox and Buddy Hield they look like a young team with a lot of upside. Sacramento have over $70 million in cap space this offseason so If they can make a splash in free agency they will be a team to look out for.  
  
.  
  
         
- **Brooklyn Nets** WL Record: 42-40          
    

The Brooklyn Nets were predicted to win 32 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as few as 29 games. They were viewed as a team that could start to turn their future around after many years asa  bottom 5 team in the league, however thats essentially all it was. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 0/30 voters expected the Nets to make the playoffs. Not a single voter. The Nets however would finish the season making their first playoff appearance since 2015 overcoming an 8-18 start to the year to qualify. D’Angelo Russell had a career season which culminated in his first all star appearance and emerging as one of the front runners for the most improved player award. The Nets have a lot of money available in free cap space going in to this offseason and with their developing young team they are going to be one to look out for.  
  
.  
  
         
- **Orlando Magic** WL Record: 42-40          
     
The Orlando Magic were predicted to win 30 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as few as 27 games. They were viewed as a team that was going absolutely nowhere in a hurry. Their roster wasn’t rated very highly by many in the league and they seemed to be destined for a bottom seeded finish. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 0/30 voters expected the Magic to make the playoffs. Not a single voter. The Magic however would finish the season making their first playoff appearance since 2012 overcoming a 20-31 start to the year to qualify. Nikola Vucevic had a career season which culminated in his first all star appearance, Fournier and Gordon played strong roles and Terrence Ross emerged as a genuine contender for the sixth man of the year award. The Magic shocked everyone this season with their improvement and I’m excited to see how the team builds on this year going forward.
  
.  
  
         
- **Los Angeles Clippers** WL Record: 47-34*        
     
The Los Angeles Clippers were predicted to win 34 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as few as 29 games. They were viewed as a deep team but ultimately not a team that would be good enough to go anywhere quickly. The departure of stars Blake Griffin and Chris Paul in recent years lead to many thinking that the Clippers would be more amongst the worst in the league and in competition for a high draft pick. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 0/30 voters expected the Clippers to make the playoffs but they defied the odds to not just make the playoffs but also almost win 50 games. The key stand out for the Clippers this season with all things considered would have to be Lou Williams who averaged 20 points per game and hit many clutch shots through out the season. The Clippers have their sights set on Kawhi Leonard this offseason and with an already deep roster could be a team to look out for.  
   
.

###Exceeded Expectations    
  
- **Denver Nuggets** WL Record: 54-28         
    
 
The Denver Nuggets were predicted to win 48 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as few as 47 games. They were viewed as a young and exciting team that was unlucky to miss the playoffs last season with 46 wins. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 25/30 voters expected the Nuggets to make the playoffs but just 2 of those voters expected them to hold home court advantage in the playoffs. The Nuggets encountered a lot of early season injuries but were able to maintain an elite record in large parts due to their outstanding depth. Nikola Jokic had a career season making his first all star appearance and could poll well in MVP voting. Despite all this many people still regard Denver as a bit of a ‘pretender’ that will fail in the playoffs. Time will tell but during the regular season the Denver Nuggets exceeded expectations.  
  
.  
  
  
- **Indiana Pacers** WL Record: 48-34        
   

The Indiana Pacers were predicted to win 47 games in the preseason with 538 expecting them to win as few as 43 games. They were viewed as a team that with a deep roster that was just outside the elite group of the Eastern Conference. After completely shattering expectations last season there was a lot of excitement about the potential of the group. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30/30 voters expected the Pacers to make the playoffs 24/30 voters expecting them to finish 4th or 5th, so you might say that they met expectations completely. However the Pacers started 32-15 this season (a 56 win pace) prior to a season ending injury to star guard Victor Oladipo. Despite the injury the team was able to maintain a strong win loss record. It is unlikely that they advance far in the playoffs but for an awesome start to the season when healthy and maintaining a great level of play despite a serious injury I have decided to say that Indiana exceeded expectations.  
  
.  
  
      
- **Portland Trailblazers** WL Record: 53-29      
   

The Portland Trailblazers were predicted to win 41 games in the preseason with 538 expecting them to win as few as 39 games. They were viewed as a team that would be vulnerable in the race for playoff spots in a competitive Western Conference. After barely improving their roster in the offseason and after being swept in the first round they were expected to fall back. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 18/30 voters expected the Blazers to make the playoffs with only one voter expecting them to maintain home court advantage. However as the Trailblazers regularly do they defy peoples expectations and continue to prove themselves as a great team. A late season injury to Jusuf Nurkic in addition to a knee issue from CJ McCollum has people questioning how far they can go in the playoffs but this regular season, Portland has exceeded expectations. 
  
.  
  
        
- **Atlanta Hawks** WL Record: 29-53          
     
   
The Atlanta Hawks were predicted to win 24 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as few as 20 games. They were viewed as a young team that would be amongst the worst in the league and ultimately end up tanking for a high draft pick. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30 voters expected the Hawks to miss the playoffs and they did. The goal for this year was never to make playoffs for Atlanta so that isn’t a concern. The Hawks played better than many had anticipated this season with Trae Young having a sensational rookie season and John Collins playing at an all star calibre level. The team is still young and inexperienced so it would not be realistic to expect them to make a jump to the playoffs very soon. However the Hawks appear to be building something and going in the right direction in their rebuild.

###Slightly Exceeded Expectations  
  
.  
  
          
- **Toronto Raptors** WL Record: 58-24           
    
    
   
The Toronto Raptors were predicted to win 56 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as few as 53 games. They were viewed as a clear cut top 5 team that would be even better with the addition of Kawhi Leonard to replace DeMar Derozan. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30/30 voters expected the Raptors to make the playoffs as a top 4 seed. A majority of these voters (24/30) also predicted Toronto to finish as a top 2 seed. The Raptors season was filled with little drama as they ultimately did what they were expected to. However the regular season to an extent didn’t really matter much for the Raptors as their main focus is on making a deep playoff push and as a result Kawhi Leonard was rested for over 20 games this season. As it currently stands the Raptors have met expectations but it all comes down to what happens in the following weeks. An underrated reason for the Raptors success this year has also been Pascal Siakams breakout season. By posting career highs in every stat including doubling his points total from last season he is the strong favourite for the most improved player award.
    
.  
  
          
- **San Antonio Spurs** WL Record: 48-34           
    
      
The San Antonio Spurs were predicted to win 42 games in the preseason with 538 expecting them to win as many as few as 37 games. They were viewed as a team that would be vulnerable in the race for playoff spots in a competitive Western Conference. Many experts thought that the Spurs run of over 20 consecutive playoff appearances was set to end. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 21/30 voters expected the Spurs to make the playoffs. The Spurs did look vulnerable at times and only had a one game gap for the 8th seed as late as March but they were able to win 9 consecutive matches and clinch their spot. The Spurs will be an interesting team to watch for in the playoffs due to their inconsistencies away from home this season but they could also create a big upset. Ultimately for making the playoffs when many expected a decline I’d say that the Spurs slightly exceeded expectations.

###Met Expectations  
  
.    
  
          
- **Detroit Pistons** WL Record: 41-41           
    
   
The Detroit Pistons were predicted to win 39 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win 38 games. They were viewed as a playoff team but almost by default with many expecting them to round out the playoff picture despite a losing record. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 18/30 voters expected the Pistons to make the playoffs. The Pistons were an inconsistent team throughout the regular season going long stretches with few wins but also having remarkable runs of form. Things got close towards the end of the season but Detroit was able to limp towards the playoffs. Blake Griffin had one of his best seasons before knee injuries limited his production in the back end of the season. Its still to be seen just how much of an impact Detroit can make in the playoffs but simply for making it into the top 8 they have met expectations.  
    
.   
  
        
- **Utah Jazz** WL Record: 50-31*             
    
 
The Utah Jazz were predicted to win 51 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win 51 games. They were viewed as a well rounded team that was be able to emerge as a Western Conference threat. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30/30 voters expected the Jazz to make the playoffs and despite starting the season just 14-17 the Jazz would eventually find their groove. Donovan Mitchell had a phenomenal second half of the season following a poor start and Rudy Gobert maintained his elite defence that could see him pick up his second consecutive DPOY award. A lot of Utah’s ranking could come down to how they do in the playoffs in the end but through out the regular season, despite a poor start, as a collective Utah were able to meet expectations and achieve a 50 win season. 
  
.   
  
    
        
- **Philadelphia 76ers** WL Record: 51-31               
    
   
    
The Philadelphia 76ers were predicted to win 53 games in the preseason with 538 expecting them to win 53 games. They were viewed as one of the top 5 teams in the league that with a dynamic young duo would be able to really challenge for a high playoff position. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30/30 voters expected the 76ers to make the playoffs with 16 of those voters predicting a 3rd placed finish for Philadelphia. The 76ers had the 3rd seed secure for a majority of the season and really didn’t encounter a lot of drama as they progressed throughout the year. Trades for Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris through out the season have put more pressure on the team to make a deep playoff push and reach all the way for the finals. However as things currently stand, for the regular season, Philadelphia were able to meet expectations with minimal fuss.  
  
.    
    
        
- **Memphis Grizzlies** WL Record: 33-49               
    
   
The Memphis Grizzlies were predicted to win 33 games in the preseason with 538 expecting them to win 33 games. They were viewed as a team that wasn’t quite bad enough to be tanking but not quite good enough to make a run for the playoffs. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions just 1/30 voters expected the Grizzlies to make the playoffs and that was an 8th seed. The Grizzlies had their moments through out the year and even started a promising 12-5 but quickly dropped off from there. The Grizzlies roster changed a lot through out the season a league record 28 players suited up in a Memphis jersey this season. Marc Gasol was traded mid season and the Grizzlies stuck with Mike Conley. It will be interesting to see how they approach the offseason with their current awkwardly constructed roster.  
  
.  
    
    
    
        
- **Golden State Warriors** WL Record: 57-25                
    
   
The Golden State Warriors were predicted to win 61 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win 60 games. They were viewed as the clear cut best team in the NBA who would be heavy favourites to win their 3rd consecutive championship. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 27/30 voters expected the Warriors to qualify as the Western Conference number one seed and the other 3 voters picked them as 2nd. The Warriors may not have won as many games as expected this season but for finishing 1st in the West ultimately I am ranking them as having met expectations. The reason is that we all know the Warriors are likely to win the championship and therefore their regular season win total isn’t really a concern. I would be interested to see how other people have seen the Warriors season this year and whether or not this was the right category to place them in.
  
.  
    
        
- **Houston Rockets** WL Record: 53-29               
     
 
The Houston Rockets were predicted to win 55 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win 55 games. They were viewed as one of the key contenders to compete with Golden State and challenge for the championship. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 24/30 voters expected the Rockets to qualify as the Western Conference number two seed and all voters predicted them to have home court advantage. The Rockets season was definitely a more difficult one to judge. They began the season 11-14 losing many games that they should not have lost, they then were dealt heavy injury blows to Chris Paul and Clint Capela. However from there became arguably the story of the season. James Harden. The superstar guard would go on an incredible scoring streak scoring at least 30 points in 32 consecutive games and absolutely carrying the team offensively and producing one of the greatest offensive seasons in NBA history. Harden could very well soon be the back to back MVP this season but time will tell how things transpire. Overall for the Rockets they did decrease their win total from 65 games last season but for ultimately finishing with home court in the West despite their injuries they met their expectations. 
  
.  
    
        
- **Charlotte Hornets** WL Record: 40-42                 
    
    
  
The Charlotte Hornets were predicted to win 36 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win 36 games. They were viewed as a fringe playoff team that didn’t really have a clear number 2 option after Kemba Walker. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions just 7/30 voters expected the Hornets to make the playoffs. It’s a little strange in a way because while the Hornets did essentially meet expectations they will have finished this season as a disappointment. Despite winning a lot more towards the final month of the season the Hornets really left their run till too late. Kemba Walker will enter free agency this off season and with the current state of the Hornets he has a big choice on his mind. Whether he stays or goes Charlotte have a lot to work on this offseason.

- **OKC Thunder** WL Record: 49-33                  
     
    
   
The OKC Thunder were predicted to win 50 games in the preseason with 538 expecting them to win as many as many as 53 games. They were viewed as a team that would with much improved bench depth would be able to solidify themselves as one of the clear cut top teams in the Western Conference. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30/30 voters expected the Thunder to make the playoffs with 20 of those voters predicting home court advantage for OKC. The Thunder began the season in extremely impressive fashion with Paul George looking like an MVP candidate and were 37-19 and within touching distance of the second seed before struggling post all star break. The Thunder failed to secure home court advantage but ultimately did have a great first half of the season so I feel inclined to say that they only slightly failed to meet expectations. 

.   
  
        
- **Dallas Mavericks** WL Record: 33-49                 
    
    
  
The Dallas Mavericks were predicted to win 35 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as few as 38 games. They were viewed as a young team that would be in the 10-12 range in the standings but finish the season tanking. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions just 1/30 voters expected the Mavericks to make the playoffs and that was an 8th seed. The Mavericks had their moments through out the year and even started a promising 15-11 but injuries and a drastic midseason roster change lead them in a different direction. Four starers in Jordan, Smith, Barnes and Matthews were all traded to different teams with the Mavericks set to rebuild their future around one key player. Luka Doncic. The biggest highlight of the year was rookie sensation Luka Doncic who averaged 21 points per game and show cased some terrific playmaking skills. Although he struggled a little towards the end of the season Doncic looks like a perennial all star for years to come and should be the favourite for the rookie of the year award.    
  
.  
    
        
- **Miami Heat** WL Record: 40-42                
     
    
  
The Miami Heat were predicted to win 43 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as many as 45 games. They were viewed as a veteran team that had achieved a lot of success in seasons past and as a result would be a playoff team due to their defined locker room and team culture. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 28/30 voters expected the Heat to make the playoffs but they fell short and were unable to give Dwyane Wade a final full farewell tour. With the retirement of Wade now allowing for a deeper look into the Heat without emotion it appears the future really doesn’t seem too promising for Miami. They are bound by some poor contracts and do not really have a younger star ready to take the reigns. The Heat had an underwhelming season and its hard to see them bouncing back too quickly.

- **Chicago Bulls** WL Record: 22-60                
     
    
The Chicago Bulls were predicted to win 28 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as many as 31 games. They were viewed as a young team that was still in the middle of a long term rebuild. They were expected to be a mostly competitive team but ultimately one that didn’t really have a chance to make playoffs. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions just 1/30 voters expected the Bulls to make the playoffs and that was an 8th seed. There was some promising development for the Bulls with Zach Lavine having a career season and Lauri Markannen building on a strong rookie season but the glimpses were few and far between. In the end though, the Bulls didn’t have a good season going backwards in wins from the year prior.

- **Washington Wizards** WL Record: 32-50                  
     
The Washington Wizards were predicted to win 44 games in the preseason with 538 expecting them to win as many as 48 games. They were viewed as a veteran team that with the addition of Dwight Howard would be a solidified playoff team. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions almost everyone, 29/30 voters expected the Wizards to feature in the playoffs. An early season injury limited John Wall to just 32 games and Dwight Howard only played 9 games as well which could be to blame for the Wizards lack of success but in reality they had been playing poorly prior to the injury either way. A few mid season trades saw them move Otto Porter and Kelly Oubre for Jabari Parker and Bobby Portis but they were barely anymore successful with them. With John Wall still sidelined all of next season there isn’t a lot of optimism regarding the Wizards and there is a lot of uncertainty about their direction.

- **Minnesota Timberwolves** WL Record: 36-45*                   
       
The Minnesota Timberwolves were predicted to win 44 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as many as 49 games. They were viewed as a fringe playoff team that would likely be one of the unlucky teams to only just miss out on the playoffs. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions only, 3/30 voters expected the Wolves to feature in the playoffs with all three voters putting them as an 8th seed. Early season drama with Jimmy Butler did little to help the team as they would eventually trade him following a 4-9 start. The Wolves had little runs of form but ultimately never really looked like a threat to make a playoff push. A point of optimism for Minnesota through out the year was the resurgence of Derrick Rose who had arguably his best season since his injury troubles. However going forward the Wolves seem to be rather directionless especially with the Andrew Wiggins contract.

- **Phoenix Suns** WL Record: 19-63                      
    
The Phoenix Suns were predicted to win 28 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as many as 30 games. They were viewed as a team, that with the addition of number one draft pick DeAndre Ayton, would finally start to show some improvement and Devin Booker was expected to lead the team back to some semblance of relevance. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 0/30 voters expected the Suns to feature in the playoffs. Expectations were already low for the Suns but they were expected to be competitive, they were anything but that as they started the season just 4-24 and failed to win even 20 games for the whole year. The Suns will be in the lottery this offseason for the tenth time in eleven years and with some recent draft failures Suns fans will be praying for some success their. Despite being a poor team Phoenix at least seem to have some sort of direction which should eventually bode well for them.

- **Boston Celtics** WL Record: 49-33      
      
The Boston Celtics were predicted to win 57 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as many as 59 games. After an incredible playoff run the season prior they were viewed as an exciting young super team that would not only be a solid playoff team but many expected the Celtics to be the second best team in the league. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 23/30 voters expected the Celtics to finish first in the Eastern conference with the other 7 voters expecting them to finish second. However what ultimately happened was the team would struggle to win 50 games in a season filled with drama. Tatum and Rozier didn’t play as expected, team chemistry issues arose, Hayward failed to recover and Brad Stevens’ coaching was sub par. The Celtics however are still an incredibly talented team and it would not be surprising to see them make the NBA finals. Although it wouldn’t be entirely surprising to see them lose in the first round either. With Kyrie Irvings impending free agency this will be a critical post season push by Boston.

- **New York Knicks** WL Record: 17-65      
          
   
The New York Knicks were predicted to win 27 games in the preseason with Action Network expecting them to win as many as 30 games. They were viewed as a young and inexperienced team that would struggle to win many games especially with a season ending injury to Kristaps Porzingis. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 0/30 voters expected to see New York in the playoffs so its amazing in a way that the  Knicks still underperformed. The Knicks had multiple losing streaks of over 10 games and where the worst team in the NBA for large parts of the season. The Knicks made a huge gamble at the trade deadline effectively trading Porzingis to the Mavericks to free up cap space. It is yet to be seen whether the gamble will pay dividends as the attempt to pursue big name free agents but for having one of the worst records in the NBA this season its fair to say the Knicks failed to meet expectations despite how low they really were. 
  

  
- **New Orleans Pelicans** WL Record: 33-49      
    
The New Orleans Pelicans were predicted to win 45 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as many as 48 games. They were viewed as a team that could really build on a strong playoff run and Anthony Davis was expected to take a step up and become a legitimate MVP candidate. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 23/30 voters expected the Pelicans to feature in the playoffs and instead the Pelicans essentially imploded. Davis requested a trade midseason after an underwhelming season and the Pelicans just fell from there. Davis was placed on a team imposed minutes restriction and the teams lack of depth was severely exposed. Its hard to see what the future holds for New Orleans and it is very much reliant on what unfolds with the Anthony Davis situation and whether they can build around Jrue Holiday going forward.  
  
.      
  

- **Cleveland Cavaliers** WL Record: 19-63        
    
The Cleveland Cavaliers were predicted to win 31 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as many as 32 games. They were viewed as a veteran team that would struggle following the departure of Lebron James in free agency but would be able to compete for playoffs in a weak Eastern conference. Kevin Love was expected to lead the team and return to his Minnesota form. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions only 7/30 voters expected the Cavaliers to feature in the playoffs but they somehow still underperformed on those expectations. Kevin Love was injured for a majority of the season, Kyle Korver and George Hill were traded, JR Smith disappeared somewhere and the team quickly changed its focus. A positive for Cavalier fans was the development of Colin Sexton in the back half of the season but ultimately to follow 4 straight finals appearances with a bottom 3 record makes the season a major disappointment for the Cavaliers.

- **Los Angeles Lakers** WL Record: 37-45    
  
The Los Angeles Lakers were predicted to win 47 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as many as 49 games. They were viewed as a team that would be on the rise with lots of excitement with the addition of Lebron James to complete and teams exciting young core of emerging talents. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 28/30 voters expected the Lakers to feature in the playoffs, 6/30 voters even predicted them to have home court. However what eventuated was a forgettable season for the Lakers as the underachieved tremendously. Lebron James missed 16 games through injury before infamously being ‘managed’ through the remainder of the year. The Lakers playoff chances weren’t completely ruled as late as February but a horrific stretch of losses against bottom seeded teams late in the season saw them miss the playoffs by quite a margin. Its going to be a long offseason for the Lakers.

Soon after, Nance Jr. was traded in a salary dump.","From [Bill Oram's recent feature in The Athletic about the Lakers](https://theathletic.com/912303/2019/04/09/how-the-lakers-won-the-lebron-sweepstakes-but-ended-up-back-in-the-lottery/):

A year earlier, Larry Nance Jr. approached Pelinka with a similar question.

Nance Jr. and his fiancée, his college girlfriend, were interested in buying a house. He wanted to get a sense of whether the Lakers planned on keeping him around, and Pelinka told him that the Lakers would only trade him if it meant landing one of the game’s three best players. He told him to buy the house, multiple sources confirmed.

Before Nance could get that far, however, he received a call on the morning of Feb. 8, 2018. He and Jordan Clarkson had been traded to Cleveland in a salary dump that cleared cap space for the Lakers to be able to offer two max slots in the summer.",nba,4082

katie-didnot,2019-04-09 19:38:53+00:00,I miss him,"I miss the 20-year-old boy I met online, the one with big goals and dreams for the future, who was going to be an opthalmologist like his father and volunteer in Guatemala every year and get a tattoo of a quetzal bird, the boy who was excited by just the idea of getting a topless photo and who could always make me feel good about myself because he was just so sweet and earnest.

I miss the 22-year-old art institute student who sent me pictures and videos of projects he was working on like an adorable anthropomorphic fox wearing a bowtie, the guy who would watch ""Castle"" every week just so that he kept having something new to talk to me about, who spent hours on video chat while I did my hair and makeup to go out for the night just because he liked to see me, who once downloaded an album by a band he didn't even like just because he knew I wanted it and he wanted to send it to me.

I miss the 24-year-old who listened to me after my breakup from the worst relationship I'd been in, who told me that I wasn't worthless and that he loved and cared about me, who was so excited by the prospect of actually getting to meet in person when I went to Los Angeles for vacation and who was so apologetic when our plans fell through.

I miss the 26-year-old who told me he'd been concerned about me after my life had almost fallen apartment six months earlier, who opened up to me about how he was feeling depressed and lost and didn't know what he wanted out of life, who was the first person I told when I was preapproved for a mortgage and who was so excited to hear about every step of my homebuying process, who said that he could talk to me on the phone all night because he loved the sound of my voice, and who told me every day that he loved me and thought I was amazing.

I miss the 28-year-old who confessed that he'd told his mom all about me and asked if he could meet my parents, who sent me flowers and books for my birthday even though he knew I didn't want to celebrate it, who brought me to my first ComicCon and went on a bar tour of New York with me, who told me he would marry me right then if he could, and who was trying so hard to prove that he was worthy of my love even though I was telling him that he had already earned it just by being him.

I miss the 30-year-old man who said he had made the biggest mistake of his life by walking away from me, who swore he was going to repair the damage he had caused, who said all of the right words and made an effort to hold my hand or put his arm around me or kiss me in public even though it made his uncomfortable, who was able to talk me out of the downward spiral of fear and anxiety whenever I felt like my future was crumbling, who talked about a future and children and showed me his ideas for engagement rings or subtly nerdy nurseries, and who would answer the phone with a burp on a particularly bad day because he knew it would make me laugh.

- - - - -

I do not miss the lying and hiding and avoidance, the moodiness if I made plans without consulting him even though he would do the same thing to me, the negative comments about red lipstick if I sent him a selfie while wearing it, the sense of unease I felt regarding his friends and the way he hid them from me. I do not miss becoming increasingly insecure and jealous, or the way that I felt like everything would come crashing down around me if our relationship failed. I do not miss broken promises. I do not miss feeling like I was putting in so much more than I was getting, or having the same conversations over and over again with more promises to change and more disappointment when change didn't come.

- - - - -

I miss my friend, and I miss our good times, and I miss the future we had planned together.

I miss being able to turn off my emotions, to go cold and icy so that I didn't have to feel the waves of sadness and grief threatening to drown me.",TrueOffMyChest,2360

I'd love to see a revival of the pre-2000s designs.,"If you'd just bear with my deplorable consumerism for a moment... Whenever I visit retail stores that I know will carry Harry Potter-related products (like Barnes &amp; Noble), I always take a lap around the HP table just to get a quick HP fix for the day. Nowadays, everything is either some rendering of the actors, or it's a trinket in the ocean of junk that has exploded with the loosening of HP licensing (think of the Spongebob-esque clutter that you'll find on the discount table in the back of a Target or Walmart or something). I also live near the Universal Studios in Los Angeles, and every time I go to the shops in the Wizarding World section, I'm sort of underwhelmed by the sort of half-decent movie tie-ins that comprise all the stuff they sell at the stores.

OK, maybe this is just a roundabout way for me to say that I'm nostalgic about the pre-2000s stuff and want it to come back. At least there are some nice puzzles and posters with the Mary GrandPré illustrations still available.",harrypotter,2707

Instead of a higher wage, they converted everyone from hourly to salary, but her overall salary reduced by 14k per year.","Wife works for a very small start up company with 4 people, 2 owners and 2 employees. She is in design. Past year she was working at $35/hr full time with health benefits but no paid vacation. $35/he is very fair for her skillset in design especially for los angeles. She was on wage, not salary. She worked some OT but not a whole lot. If you calculate the standard hourly to salary using 40 hours a week multiply 52, she would have earned $72,800. She is normally scheduled to work full time mon to fri 9-5. However last year we got married and had long vacations here and there and she was compensated $55,000 total because of the unpaid vacations. This worked out well for her small company because she didnt get paid while being away. 

Today during her evaluation, they low balled and offered  a salary of $54,000 with $3800 PTO/year. Health benefits are also included but it is the same as last year. The total compensation now is $57,800. They said this was calculated based on the number of hours worked last year (so they pretty much offered her 2018 W4). Employees are not going back to wage. 

I would assume an employer would calculate a salary offer based on potential full time hours, not how many hours one worked the year prior.  If she had PTO last year  or if she didnt go on the long honey moon then she would have received a higher salary offer. Now her starting salary is pretty much $27/hr so its a huge downgrade and now without OT. The owners said “well look we are now giving you PTO now!” which would offset the low ball. She is valuable at her company— 70% of products sold are her designs. The other employee got a raise cause he was getting significantly less paid last year (due to no degree and no experience) in case you were wondering. 

Is this practice normal for an employer to use previous year’s W4 to determine someones salary, especially if it works in there advantage. She will try to counter back with equity (since she started the company with them). Per employee,  salary now does not require 40hour work periods — just the projects need to get done. Because lf that she wants to request working a minimum of 32 hours a week to offset the 14k a year reduction. Any advice?",personalfinance,16902

borbafett1,2019-03-25 23:22:54+00:00,"As someone who works in the film industry, this sub and President Trump have restored my hope for this nation and beyond.","As a 41 year old male I've watched as the years have gone by, conservatives like us, be the whipping and laughing post for the rest of this country. We've been mocked, scorned, ridiculed, prosecuted, shunned and in some cases even killed, because of what we believe and stand up for.

I told myself (as someone who is a Christian and believes the Bible is the authority on things) that this ""is just the way the world is going. Jesus told us that we'd face trials and tribulations, and they would hate us because they first hated him."" I told myself over and over again that what progressives stand for and force into our workplaces, school systems and society as a whole was ""the sign of the end times."" Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not a doom and gloom guy, and I'm not one of those that think the world is ending soon. But there becomes a point where there is SO MUCH travesty and injustice to those that stand up for traditional and biblical values, people that support things like pro-life, the second amendment, raising boys to be boys and girls to be girls, etc etc etc, that it felt like we weren't even fighting the battle anymore. It felt like the war was over and we had gotten our asses handed to us.

Everything changed that November night in 2016. I will never forget how the day started, me ""knowing"" full-well that Donald Trump was going to lose in a landslide, and that we were in for at least 4 more years of tyranny and oppression. I just told myself this is how it was and was going to be, but that I had a lot of other positive things in my life to look to. (My wife, 5 children, career in film, etc.) I tried keeping off of the internet that day. But around 5pm, I decided to check Facebook to see how bad it was. I was very confused when the first thing in my feed was an ultra-liberal friend of mine from Los Angeles who had posted ""WTF OHIO?!"" Curious and confused, I checked Fox News and was completely shell-shocked. I couldn't believe it. Donald Trump was *winning the election*. I was even more shocked around 11pm California time when almost all major news outlets had declared him the winner.

As excited as I was, I still wasn't sure Geotus was going to be who he said he was going to be. Campaign promises and all of that. But as days turned into weeks turned into months, it became more and more clear that this man genuinely meant what he said on the campaign trail, and was doing **everything** possible to Make America Great Again.

It's now been two years and some change since election night. President Trump and this sub have shown me that even though things seemed down and frankly done for, that God is **still** in control and that we are to continue the fight for conservative values and efforts. I wake up every morning now, excited to see what our President did the day before or is planning on doing today. I've never met him, but I am so incredibly thankful for his efforts and unwillingness to let all the negativity, threats, lawsuits, etc, deter him from his course.

As someone who works in the film industry, someone that supports President Trump no less, I can't even mention his name on set, for fear of not only never working again, but what the left might say or do about my family. (see Brett Kavanaugh). But for now, I'm content enough knowing that I wasn't the only one out there who had had enough of the rhetoric of the left. I love coming on this sub to see and hear about all of the patriots who still give a damn about conservative values and this country. It excites me as a filmmaker because I am in this business to make positive and uplifting kick-ass films.

So take a bow, The\_Donald. As long as we are willing to fight and put ourselves out there, we will always be the majority, even if some of us have to remain hidden among crowds of liberals. They can shout and threaten all they want, but it's apparent to me that we've faced a turning point in this nation. And if all of us keep at it, as our President is keeping at it, this country could resemble something a lot more like Leave it to Beaver and a lot less like (insert any show on TV right now.)

And just so you all know, there are other conservative Trump supporters in the film industry besides James Woods. ;)

Thanks for letting me get this off my chest. In my head this post sounded a lot more profound than it came out. But hopefully this post will encourage some of you.",The_Donald,1253

onlypingal,2019-03-25 07:33:55+00:00,Nintendo to Launch Two New Switch Models,"Since the article is locked behind a paywall, here's the entire article. Cheers!

&amp;#x200B;

Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox One X, according to parts suppliers and software developers for Nintendo who have access to a prototype of the machine.

&amp;#x200B;

The other version is a cheaper option for casual gamers that Nintendo sees as a successor to its aging hand-held 3DS device, the suppliers and developers say.

&amp;#x200B;

The new models are likely to be unveiled at the E3 videogame Expo in Los Angeles in June and possibly released a few months later, one person familiar with Nintendo’s plans said. Kyoto-based Nintendo declined to comment.

&amp;#x200B;

The Switch, introduced in March 2017, has been central to Nintendo’s recent business success. The company earns more than 80% of its total revenue from Switch hardware and software sales. Investors are focused on how long the console can remain a profit driver.

&amp;#x200B;

Industry watchers expect sales for the Switch to begin declining soon. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha, a provider of market forecasts, anticipate on average that 17.9 million units of the Switch will be sold in the fiscal year ending this month, followed by 17.4 million in the following year.

&amp;#x200B;

Videogame-hardware makers generally come out with new consoles every five to six years, and it is common for them to update the devices in the middle of their life cycles to keep the momentum going. Sony introduced the PlayStation 4 in November 2013 and updated it with a less-expensive version in September 2016 and a high-end model two months later. Sales of the PlayStation 4 remain strong.

&amp;#x200B;

Nintendo’s suppliers and game developers have been talking with their investors about the new Switch machines for several months. People who have used the devices say they aren’t just similar-looking new versions with a higher or lower performance.

&amp;#x200B;

Prices for the new Switch models couldn’t be learned. To cut costs for the cheaper version, Nintendo plans to eliminate some of the functions used in the original Switch console, such as a vibration feature in its controllers, according to Nintendo suppliers.

&amp;#x200B;

“The company judged the new Switch models won’t need the vibration feature because there wouldn’t be many games released using the full benefit of it,” one official familiar with the plans said.

&amp;#x200B;

Nintendo is also adjusting its suppliers for the new models. Sharp Corp. , an Osaka-based company that had long supplied components to Nintendo videogame machines but failed to win a deal for the original Switch, is expected to provide liquid-crystal displays for the new Switch machines, people familiar with the new models said. Sharp declined to comment.

&amp;#x200B;

Suppliers and third-party game developers say Nintendo is preparing to release new game titles from well-known franchises, such as “Animal Crossing” and “Pokémon,” to bolster Switch hardware sales. Nintendo has said it plans to launch two new games from the Pokémon franchise in late 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

“Some people say sales of Nintendo’s devices usually weaken in the third year, while others say games to be released this year are stronger than ever before,” one executive at a Nintendo supplier said. “I honestly don’t know how things will turn out, but I have my fingers tightly crossed.”

morbidology,2019-03-18 19:40:06+00:00,"Tammy Lynn Leppert, a beauty queen &amp; actress, vanished from Cocoa Beach, Fl, 1983. In the run up, she had been acting strange &amp; claimed she saw something she shouldn't have.","Tammy Lynn Leppter was from Rockledge, Florida. She was entered into her first beauty pageant at just 4-years-old. She won a number of beauty pageants throughout the years. In her early teens, she starred in the film ""Little Darlings"" and became the face of cover girl.

&amp;#x200B;

Tammy dreamed of becoming a famous actress in Los Angeles. At 18, she had a small role in the film ""Spring Break."" While it was a non-speaking roll with Tammy wearing a bikini, she was happy to get her foot in the door and a number of producers were saying positive things about the starlet. Steven Waltz said she wasn't ""just another dumb blonde"" and expected her to be as big as Brook Shields.

&amp;#x200B;

After filming Spring Break, Tammy went to a party on her own to celebrate the release. However, when she returned, her friends said she was acting very strangely. She was ""a different person."" Tammy, who was known to be bubbly and extroverted, returned sullen and shy. She appeared to be acting very irrational and paranoid. The next role she had lined up was in ""Scarface."" While filming, Tammy was said to become hysterical during a bloody scene and had to return home.

&amp;#x200B;

On her return, her mother said she was exceptionally paranoid and was afraid that somebody was going to kill her. She refused to eat or drink anything out of an open container out of fear she would be poisoned.  One day, Tammy told her mother and later a friend that she had witnessed ""something so horrible I'm going to get killed for it."" On one occasion, a gust of wind slammed the front door behind her and locked. She threw into hysterics about being locked outside and smashed the window to gain entry. Days later, she asked a friend to come to church with her where she cried and prayed.

&amp;#x200B;

Her family were so concerned they asked the local sheriff to speak to her. When he did, Tammy denied she feared for her life. She was checked into a mental health facility but released after 72 hours when doctors found no traces of alcohol or drugs or anything else wrong with her.

&amp;#x200B;

Then on the 6th of July, 1983, Tammy climbed into her friend's car to drive to Cocoa Beach. Keith Roberts, the friend, would later say they got into an argument and he dropped Tammy off along State Road A1A near Cocoa Beach's Glass Bank building. This was the last time she was ever seen,

&amp;#x200B;

At some point during that day, Tammy made a number of phone calls. However, each person she called wasn't in and she asked to leave a message for them to call her back.

&amp;#x200B;

Theories have been plentiful. Two main theories are that Tammy had a mental breakdown or that she ran away. Those who know Tammy find the second one unlikely. It was said that Tammy was very close to her mother and wouldn't have ran away. There are a number of Tammy's friends, however, that say Tammy's mother was controlling her career. Tammy's mother, on the other hand, theorises that Tammy's friend, Keith Roberts, was involved. According to her, Tammy was afraid of him. She also claims Cocoa Beach police blew the investigation when they didn't look at him fully as a suspect. Allegedly, Roberts refused to come down for a face-to-face interview. Roberts denies this, however, and claims he was never asked to come down for an interview.

&amp;#x200B;

Another theory is that Tammy was abducted and murdered. One plausible suspect is Christopher Wilder, who killed 8 or 9 young women in Florida after promising to photograph them. Tammy's mother later filed a $1 million wrongful death lawsuit against him. He died in a police shootout and afterwards, her mother dropped the lawsuit and claimed she never believed he was involved in the first place. His first reported murder wasn't until 1984.

My psychiatrist was found murdered and stuffed in a car trunk in the lake mead recreation area last week. I just recieved the news and I have no idea how to cope. Dr Burchard wore red bow ties and white suits. He taught me how to cope with my mental trauma and depression. He performed a wonderful magic trick every single time I visited him, and upon turning 21 presented me with a VIP guest  membership card to the Magic Castle in Los Angeles, where I also used to visit with my less savory boss, and recieving it in that different light was life changing.

substantial_eternal,2019-03-13 19:46:09+00:00,Catfish,"I had this friend Heather in high school, and she was a little crazy. She loved to prank people. One time she texted me pretending to be this guy I had a crush on, and another time, she got up in the middle of the night, and turned all the furniture in her house upside down. 

At the end of our senior year, Heather hooked me up with a server job at the restaurant where she worked. She would swap the mashed potatoes with frosting, tell the customers their card was declined, or their cash was counterfeit. Usually the pranks ended with a laugh, and when it didn't, Heather would mollify the offended guests with dessert on the house, a chocolate mousse with rat turds for garnish.

On our breaks, Heather and I would go in the alley behind the restaurant and smoke. That was where Heather gathered the rat turds which she kept in a plastic bag. The rats were big as puppies and very friendly. Heather told me that her dad wanted to charge her rent and one third of the utilities to stay at the house since she was eighteen and had a job. Her mom said this was bullshit, and so they would fight. Her mom was very controlling, and wouldn't let Heather go out at night. The tension in the house was unbearable. 

Heather told me that she had to get out, and that she was probably going to leave town before the end of summer. She told me she had a plan. She told me that she was on her mom's facebook page when she noticed that her mom had added a new friend, Davy. Heather's mom's facebook didn't have a lot of personal stuff in it, just reposts of memes and games. Heather thought that Davy was cute and messaged him from a fake profile that she used as a catfish account. She'd send sexy pictures to guys and message them stuff like ""Cleaning my room in my thong underwear"" while we were smoking in the alley and feeding the rats. At any one time, she had at least four or five ""boyfriends,"" all of them competing to throw money at her. It sounds bad, but if you knew Heather, you'd know that this was just one more of her pranks. 

So she sent Davy some pictures, nothing too crazy, and there was no reply. She sent him a message that she was scrubbing the floor naked and thinking about him, and there was no reply. And in the mean time, he was liking stupid shit like her mom's meme reposts, among other things. She sent him more pictures of herself even though he didn't even seem interested, or maybe because he didn't seem interested. Finally, she sent him a picture of herself crying in the shower and self-harming. She said that she wanted to die, and that nobody would care if she did. He replied that he cared, and that he hoped she was getting counseling. He asked her if there was somebody irl she could talk to, and she said there wasn't.

Davy turned out to be a nice guy. He said that he was too old for her. He was thirty four. Heather told him she liked older men. Boys her own age, she told him, were immature twats who thought it was cool to call a girl a slam pig. Davy said he didn't even know what a slam pig was. Class, Heather thought. 

The best thing about Davy, she told me, was that he lived in Los Angeles, which is as faraway as you can get from upstate New York without falling into the ocean or leaving the country. And plus, she thought that she might be falling in love with him. She told him she was going to L.A. to see him whether he wanted it or not.  

This is what happened, as Heather told it to me more than a year later.

When she landed at LAX, Davy was waiting for her at the gate. He looked even better than his pictures, and it was love at first sight. She was pregnant within the month, and they got engaged. 

Heather had gone no contact with both her parents after she left Syracuse, but her grandmother was living in a nursing home near L.A. So Heather decided that she and Davy would go to the nursing home to tell her grandmother the good news. Heather at this point was visibly pregnant, about six months along. She introduced Davy, told her grandmother that they were engaged, and that she was going to have a baby. Davy smiled, bending down towards the old lady, as chivalrous as could be. Class, Heather thought. The old lady looked into Davy's face, and then seemed to choke. Her eyes rolled up horribly, bulging as if they would pop out. The nurses surrounded her, but it was too late. She was dead.

Heather was devastated. 

Her mom flew to L.A. to handle the funeral. Heather didn't go. She didn't want to see her mom or dad, or any of them ever again. She wondered if she should cancel the wedding and courthouse it instead. She wondered if she should even get married. She thought about an abortion, but couldn't bring herself to do it. She wanted Davy's baby, and she would have it if it killed her. It had killed her grandmother, hadn't it? 

She couldn't forget the look of terror and shock on her grandmother's face. Was that the look all people wore when they died? And yet, her grandmother had been fine until she saw Davy. She had looked at him as if he were something terrible, something not right. 

And at other times, the times when she seemed to see clearly, Heather would realize that it was all just a horrible accident, and nothing more than that. Her grandmother had been sick. She'd had a stroke six months before, the doctors had said, and it was only a matter of time. 

And so Heather went back and forth, round and round. A sign from God, or a horrible accident? Which?

Davy gave her space. He let her grief. And in spite of herself, Heather began to feel better. She began to plan the wedding, which was to take place six months after the baby came. It was not the best of timing, but she didn't want to elope like her parents had done without even a picture to show for it. David helped her. It was one of the things Heather loved about him. He was the most masculine of men, and yet he did not consider the selection of table linens, chair covers, and even the color of the napkins to be beneath him. They spent their weekends at craft stores and estate sales looking for the perfect centerpieces. She couldn't believe this perfect man was going to be her husband and she was going to be his wife.

Heather didn't invite her parents to the wedding. She invited me, and a few other of her friends from back home in upstate new York. Davy had a lot of family in upstate New York too. Heather was amazed to find this out until she remembered that Davy and her mom were facebook friends, and that her mother's facebook page was where she had first clicked on his profile picture out of boredom, and it had turned out to be the answer to her prayers.

The week before the wedding, Heather began to have second thoughts. She didn't care if her dad came, but she wanted her mother to see her get married. It had become an obsession that gnawed at her. She kept thinking of her parents' elopement, two of her father's work buddies for witnesses, not a single family member. Davy had never met her parents. He didn't even know their names. She didn't talk about them. Her parents didn't even know she had a child of her own now. The baby had been born healthy and a whopping eight pounds. The delivery had been quick, just one big push and it was over before she knew it. And it was a girl, just as Heather had always known. A magnificent little human, a miracle. 

But something was wrong, and Heather knew it as surely as she knew that she was going to die. She felt it especially when she looked at the baby, but she couldn't understand why. The baby was perfect, and resembled her and Davy so absolutely that it was as if the child was the purest distillation of their most essential and best selves. The nameless dread hung over her like the hangman's noose, the blade of the guillotine, a nightmare disguised as a happy dream. She would wake up in the middle of the night, sweating, not knowing who or where she was, gasping, the memory of her grandmother's dying face like a scream that had stuck in her throat. Why? she would wonder, the rest of the question lost to her dreams, a long tunnel of seeking that led nowhere. 

She called her mother. Heather told her about the baby, and asked her if she would like to come to the wedding. Her mom didn't seem thrilled to find out that she was a grandmother, but she said she'll try to get a flight out. She called back a couple of hours later, and said that she got a flight to LAX that would arrive at noon on the day of the wedding, and that was the best she could do. The ceremony was at five thirty in the afternoon, then cocktails, then the passed apps, cake cutting, Champagne toast... She didn't say anything about Heather's father, and Heather didn't ask. 

The morning of the wedding, Heather's mom called and said that her flight out of New York was delayed, and so she had missed the connecting flight. The earliest flight she could get to LAX would arrive at four, and traffic meant at least an hour to get from LAX to the church. She would miss the beginning of the ceremony. 

The officiant had just pronounced Heather and Davy man and wife when the church doors opened and her mom came in. She walked down the aisle, and about halfway down she suddenly stopped. We all turned to look at her as she covered her mouth as if she was going to be sick. And then she turned and ran out.

The story that Heather's mom Dina eventually told was this. She and Davy had gone steady in high school. They went together for two years and then they had a huge fight and broke up. Shortly afterwards Davy's family moved to another city. Dina was already pregnant when she started going steady with the man she would eventually marry, the man Heather would know as her father. When Davy and Dina reconnected on Facebook, Dina told him that he had a daughter, but he had never thought to make the connection between Dina's revelation and the girl that walked off the plane in LAX because he only knew Heather under her catfish account. Heather's grandmother was the only other person who knew who Heather's bio-Dad was. When Heather turned to Davy after her mom ran out of the church, she saw in him the same look that had been on her grandmother's face when she died. Unobscured by the ravages of age and illness, Heather saw clearly what that look signified on the face of her husband, not only terror and shock, but also the slow horror of recognition and understanding.

LundgrensFrontKick,2019-03-11 14:13:12+00:00,"Based on the 12-hour ticking clock, it took Batman three hours to set up the fiery bat symbol on the bridge in ‘The Dark Knight Rises’","**Spoilers abound.** 

 My naive original goal for this piece was to only focus on how long it took Batman to create the bat fire on the bridge in *The Dark Knight Rises.* I thought it wouldn’t be difficult due to the [**countless maps of Gotham**](https://www.slashfilm.com/cool-stuff-official-map-christopher-nolans-gotham-city/), and [**insane amount**](https://www.businessinsider.com/bridge-blow-up-dark-knight-rises-2012-6#by-the-way-19-million-people-have-watched-that-trailer-so-it-seems-safe-to-say-that-the-movie-is-going-to-be-a-blockbuster-15) of [**nit-picky articles**](https://www.businessinsider.com/bridge-blow-up-dark-knight-rises-2012-6) ([**here is another one**](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pgga3b/the-problem-with-christopher-nolan-hes-fundamentally-uninterested-in-cities)) to help me make an educated guess. However, unlike [It Follows, which makes sense geographically,](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7xzadn/im_a_big_fan_of_the_creature_in_it_follows_so_i/) Nolan’s Gotham is all over the place, and I learned I’d have to expand my scope to establish a timeline for the bridge fire because of the multiple filming locations (NYC, Chicago, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, London) and evolution of Gotham (two Wayne enterprises etc..) throughout the *Dark Knight* trilogy. So, I used [**Eliot R. Brown’s maps**](http://www.eliotrbrown.com/wp/gotham-city-map.html), and the [**one used in the movie**](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/cartographer-gotham-city-180951594/), then, I mostly relied on visual cues based on my repeat viewings of *Batman Begins*, *The Dark Knight* and *The Dark Knight Rises*. These visual cues helped me piece together the timeline for the 12 hours Batman needed to stop Bane’s bomb from destroying Gotham, which in turn, helped me figure out how long it took to create the massive bat signal on the bridge. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Bane can see the fire from City hall](https://i.redd.it/u6s8sxrauhl21.png)

 **Quicknote:** **There is no correct answer.** As always, I’ve made my best educated guess which is most likely wrong. Also, to answer your questions in advance:

1. I know it’s just a movie
2. I don’t have THAT much free time
3. Yes, *Deep Blue Sea* is underrated
4. No, I’m not Batman
5. Yes, If I had the chance I would be Batman
6. [Yes, I looked at the official map](https://www.slashfilm.com/cool-stuff-official-map-christopher-nolans-gotham-city/)
7. Jack Burton by a landslide
8. Who?

**Here are some assumptions before I get into the timeline:**

* The action at the end takes place in the Downtown area of Gotham. Why? Based on the location of the bridges, and proximity to City Hall (which is downtown) I feel safe saying it’s downtown Gotham. This is important because it helps narrow down the action.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;[***Map from Smithsonian.com***](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/cartographer-gotham-city-180951594/)  
&gt;  
&gt;*I’m 97.3% certain that I picked the correct bridge. It is the only one with another bridge nearby, and it leads into downtown. Also, the “strikezone” map infers that everything takes place downtown as well.*

&amp;#x200B;

* There are only 8 hours of actual night during winter in Gotham. Why? Due to the 12-hour ticking clock, I learned the events started unfolding around 7:00 PM.
* The 12 hour ticking clock is exact. I trust Fox, and there is a handy countdown clock which helps out later on.
* The random daylight patterns prove the fictional Gotham has some weird things going on. This helps explain why darkness happens so quickly in [***The Dark Knight*** ](https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/20/17583276/the-dark-knight-joker-chase-scene-editing)and *The Dark Knight Rises.* 
* I don’t think Batman used gasoline to create the bat fire. He most likely used a special flammable “yada yada yada” substance developed by Lucius Fox.
* The locations that the characters walk to aren’t far apart. If they were, the amount of walking would be insane.

**THE TIMELINE**

 **7:00 PM  – Wayne arrives at city hall – Downtown – (AKA Bane’s headquarters)** – Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle meet up with Lucius Fox and Miranda Tate around 7:00PM. We learn the bomb will be going off in exactly 12 hours. How do I know it’s Bane’s HQ? Later on at the bridge, Gordon says “Bane is holed up at city hall.” So, I’m assuming this is where they’re having the kangaroo court as well. It also makes sense that it is close to the water because they walk the unlucky exiled folks to their icy death from city hall. 

&amp;#x200B;

[ Unlucky Gotham citizens are walked up the stairs and into Scarecrow’s court. ](https://i.redd.it/qqwhu4y8whl21.png)

&amp;#x200B;

 **8:15 PM – Wayne arrives at the underground bunker located at the Gotham docks (introduced in** ***Dark Knight*****)** – Wayne grabs his batsuit and gear needed to battle Bane. I’m thinking it took 45 minutes because of the location to the docks.  It took them longer than usual, because they are wanted men, and they had to sneak around the city instead of brazenly walking around Gotham. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ncsj1547whl21.png

&amp;#x200B;

 **9:30 PM – Wayne arrives at the top of a random building in downtown Gotham** **(STILL NOT DARK)** – It probably took 30 minutes to bag all the gear and bat suit.  I feel safe saying The Bat location is close to the docks (it’s somewhat near the water). Also, it is walking distance to the tunnels which Bane inhabited under the downtown area. I’d love to see their journey to the top of the building (also the water in the background isn’t frozen, Gotham is a weird place). 

&amp;#x200B;

[ I’ve read online that this is Wayne Enterprises. The buildings don’t match. So I’m thinking it’s another building.  The picture below proves it isn’t Wayne Enterprises. ](https://i.redd.it/k2xbhlb1whl21.png)

 

https://i.redd.it/ch3i5dr4whl21.png

**10:30 PM – Wayne takes The Bat to the bridge** – Wayne and Fox are in no hurry (despite Gordon being found guilty hours earlier) while they are at The Bat, Fox grabs the gear for the micro-burst while Wayne says “there is no autopilot.” I’m guessing Fox goes immediately back to the docks, while Wayne waits for dark, gets into his suit and parks near the tunnel where the cops are trapped. He hides The Bat, this makes sense because Bane’s soldiers walk by and don’t see it. 

&amp;#x200B;

[He parks The Bat very close to this area. Bane's henchmen are not very observant. ](https://i.redd.it/bxzre6gwvhl21.png)

&amp;#x200B;

 **11:00 PM – Wayne Scouts the Bridge, and Gets to Work on the Bat Signal –** Before working on the bat fire, he had to make sure there were no guards around. I’m thinking Wayne also set up a camera so he’d know if Gordon was being brought to the ice while he was working on the bridge. This may sound crazy, but I’m 100% certain he set up some kind of automated weapon that expertly darts the henchmen (you’ll understand later). Then, he uses his incredibly accurate grappling hooks ([**think catching The Joker during his fall in** ***The Dark Knight***](https://youtu.be/-eroRVQJLjo)) to pull himself up to the top of the bridge. He doesn’t use gasoline because there is no spillover, and the liquid does not spill down the bridge. I’m thinking he uses multiple cans of some kind of flammable spray to cover the 85-feet ([**Width of the bridge**](http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/brooklyn/)). This makes the job difficult because he has to cover every inch of the symbol with the spray. Also, since it’s so cold, he most likely has to go heavy with the flammable substance. Then, he has to spray a perfectly straight line down the bridge and onto the ice below. 

[Dude knows how to make a fire bat.](https://i.redd.it/5xs764qlvhl21.png)

&amp;#x200B;

 **3:00 AM – Waits for Gordon to be brought out onto the ice, knocks out the bad guys, and has Gordon light the bat fire –** It’s worth noting that the villains waited over 10 hours to bring Gordon and crew out to the ice. Did they get a final meal? What I love the most about this scene is how Wayne placed a flare in a perfect spot on the ice for Gordon to see.  The biggest question mark for me during the research is how Wayne was able to knock out the henchmen from behind, then, magically appear in front of Gordon seconds later. That is why I think he set up the automated dart machine. It’s a controversial opinion but I don’t see another option.

After saving Gordon, Wayne explains the plan and gives him the piece of machinery that Fox pulled from The Bat.

&amp;#x200B;

[Perfectly placed flare.](https://i.redd.it/plszec2hvhl21.png)

&amp;#x200B;

 **4:30 AM – Wayne saves Blake at the nearby bridge** – In another weird occurrence, we learn the armed guards have been interrogating Blake for several hours. I believe Wayne had no clue that Blake would be there, and luckily appeared just before Blake was shot. Wayne knocks out the guards, then blows a hole in the blockage with The Bat. He waits until all the cops come out of the tunnel, which would take at least 25 minutes because there are several thousand of them. After they are all out of the tunnel, he informs them of the plan, and gets them going towards battle. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/c28gzaipvhl21.png

[He is about to make a great speech to these cops. ](https://i.redd.it/4fzzcxjevhl21.png)

 

**6:15 AM** – **Wayne arrives at the cargo container holding the Bat Pod.**

After all the cops head towards city hall, Batman moves The Bat to a location closer to the battle. After hiding The Bat, he meets up with Kyle and they walk towards the docks again towards a storage container.  While he gets her setup with the Bat pod, Wayne conveniently says “there are 45 minutes left,” to Kyle.

[Batman has some handy cargo containers all over town](https://i.redd.it/m9den5kavhl21.png)

&amp;#x200B;

 **7:00AM** – **Kablooey.** 

&amp;#x200B;

[Ticking clocks make my life easier](https://i.redd.it/ub4ibzk8vhl21.png)

There you have it! Batman needed around three hours to prepare the bat symbol on the bridge. I know the answer isn’t exact, but, due to the timeline and width of the bridge, I’m thinking the number is correct.

Hamblerger,2019-03-10 03:01:08+00:00,"Sent Home For Dress Code Violation, Cause Managers To Reassess Priorities","TL;DR: &gt;!I was sent home for a petty dress code violation in order to change, and my absence caused some minor chaos.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

Some years ago, in the early 2000s, I worked at  a call center for a major self-storage company. It was an excellent job in many ways: The pay was reasonable, the job came with opportunities for promotion, and if you showed specific skills or talents, you'd often get a chance to apply them. My talents run to customer service, problem-solving, diplomacy, and writing, so I was placed on what they called the Support Desk, where I would handle calls from property managers and customers all across the country when a reservation went awry for any reason whatsoever. Not to boast, but rather to make clear my value to the company in this role, I won an award at the annual company party for my performance after only six months on that job. Unfortunately, about a year after I took on the assignment, I found myself facing a major mental health crisis, and turned in my two weeks notice. A year later, I reapplied for my old job, but there was no opening on support staff, so they assigned me to sales until a slot opened up. Fine. I was grateful for the work, and they would still occasionally pull me off of the phone to help with administrative duties or to assist with tricky reservation issues, so I wasn't just maddeningly repeating the same script all day.

Problem was, the operations manager for the center had quit in disgust when his boss got in his face over some minor charges on an expense report for a business trip. This man had been a genius at his job, letting people go early on some days, and calling in those favors for overtime when there weren't enough people signing up for it. His replacement was nice, but in over her head, and our numbers of dropped calls had increased while she learned the ropes. Additionally, one of the supervisors in charge of compliance was going through something in his personal life, and had started taking it out on the workers in increasingly petty ways. My new supervisor would never stand up to him. It had become an unpleasant working environment, not quite toxic, but headed in that direction.

During the summer months, we experienced ""crunch time,"" when we received an enormously high volume of calls: The kids are out of school, so that's when most families move. This meant a certain number of perks to increase morale. Free lunches from local casual dining places, mildly annoying ""theme"" days, and a relaxing of the office's ""business casual"" dress code. 

One night, going home at the end of my shift, I saw notices being posted. I didn't bother reading them, as I was exhausted from being slammed with calls on top of the other duties I was given that day. I returned the following day wearing black jeans, and saw that crunch time was officially over, meaning that we were back to normal. We were, however, still getting an enormously high call volume, so I sat at my cubicle and put in my earpiece. After one hour, I'm tapped on the shoulder by my immediate supervisor, and told to get off of the phones. The compliance manager has noticed that I'm wearing jeans, and is insisting that I go home to change, then come back to work. 

""Can't I just get a verbal warning or something? We're getting a heavy call volume."" No luck. The compliance manager insists. Fine.

Thing is, I don't have a car. I ride a bus. I ride the bus in Los Angeles, where service is improving, but at the time was notoriously inconsistent and shoddy. I don't bother informing them of this. Instead, I wait for the bus for about forty-five minutes, then take a ride of slightly over an hour to get home. When I get there, I find a pair of pants on my floor that I've worn once, and would undoubtedly pass muster if I were to wear them back to work. However, the company dress code states that all items of apparel must be clean, so I decide to wash them. Unfortunately, it turns out that both our washer and our dryer are occupied by another roommate. I could explain to him that this is an emergency, but instead I let him do all of his laundry uninterrupted. It's my supervisor. I explain the situation.

""We need you back in here now. Our team is getting slammed, and we're dropping calls because we're not fully staffed."" 

I re-explain the situation, and also state that as I ride the bus, there's no way that I could realistically be back before two hours were up. He tells me to take a taxi. I ask him if the company will reimburse me. He says no. I tell him that a 12 mile cab ride isn't in my budget, and that I'll do my best. He tells me that this is unacceptable. I remind him that I was willing to take a warning in order to be able to stay at my desk, and that I'm not going into work in dirty pants, or I'm going to run the risk of being sent home again. 

My roommate finishes. I wash the pants along with the rest of my laundry. I then dry them, take each item out separately, fold them, take a shower, change into my business casual clothes, and make it back to work....with 30 minutes left on my shift. 

The next day, I'm called into the office of the sales supervisor. Both my immediate supervisor and the compliance manager are there. I'm handed a written warning (the second most serious disciplinary action) for missing work without permission. .I yet again explain the sequence of events, and stress that I initially asked to stay at work, and was willing to have a verbal warning on my record for the clothing issue. She asks my immediate supervisor if this was the case. He, to his credit, says yes, but that they were trying to make a point to other sales staff. She asks me to go back to my desk, and to close the door behind me. Shortly afterwards, I see the Vice-President in charge of the call center head towards her office. The four of them remain behind closed doors for some time.

The next day, I'm informed that my written warning has been downgraded to a verbal one, and am reminded to check all notices before leaving for the day. I agree to do so, as that was careless on my part. Word then goes out that minor first-time dress code violators will be subject to a verbal warning, but are expected to stay at work, especially during heavy call periods. 

I later found out that after I had been sent home, two other people on our team also had to leave (one for a medical emergency, the other for a family issue), and we'd had our worst call retention numbers since my immediate supervisor had been placed in charge of a team. 

A bit wordy, I know, and the comeuppance wasn't particularly dramatic, but that was fun.",MaliciousCompliance,10933

udidubbun,2019-03-09 04:11:44+00:00,"Car rental, but still a front desk DNR smackdown.","Many years ago (late 1990s), I worked in a reservation call center for one of the big rental companies, and our office was in the back of the building near our local airport (Large West Coast city, USA).  


Because we are in the same building as our busiest rental-counter location, we get all of the good pissed-off custy stories as they happened...  


Background info: The world headquarters of a large multi-national company had an EXCELLENT local corporate rate set up with us, because they had a LOT of folks coming in to town to meet at the mothership (corporate HQ) - including a fuckton of people coming in to interview, both new-to-be-hired, lateral promotions and the like. The client company had an in-house travel service, and we gave them their own dedicated line to call in reservations on. We had a great relationship with them, and because we talked so often, an agent could EASILY book 5-10 reservations in under 10 minutes - which was great for our talktimes AND commissions. The head honcho of the Client Company's travel team was a serious go-getter, and all-around cool guy who watched out for his people under him, AND us - we'll call him Tim. His physical office was less than a mile from mine, and Tim and my department head often had lunch together.

&amp;#x200B;

Their monthly rental tab ran to 40K+ USD per month, so they got really special rates, got bumped up whenever possible, and basically treated like they were made of gold (and everyone was always super cool - they knew they had it good and were chill).  


One day, my favorite front desk manager came back to talk story (he was a Samoan guy that grew up in Hawaii) about the latest a-hole customer...  


Apparently, this dude that came in was an employee of our favorite client company, and had been booked for a Lincoln town car. Big, plush, comfortable ride - and the nicest thing in the fleet at the time. He had been told what he was getting, but INSISTED that he was booked for a Porsche - which my company didn't even have in our market - Seattle, Los Angeles and the Bay Area only.  


This set this lovely customer OFF - my Hawaiian buddy said that he was missing the bright red mustache and cowboy hat, but was otherwise a perfect doppelganger of Yosemite Sam. Well, Yosemite Sam decided to have a full-on meltdown in the lobby - with the usual shouts of ""don't you know \*\*WHO\*\* I AM?"" and other things we all love to hear, and eventually making the incredibly nice Latina counter agent cry, and find my buddy for back-up.  


After hearing her side of the story, Hawaiian Buddy (HB) went out to deal with YS, and it went like this.  


HB: ""My counter agent tells me you're not happy - how can I help?""  


YS: ""You can fire the little disrespectful bitch!""  


HB:  ""Excuse me? WHAT?""

&amp;#x200B;

YS: ""I was PROMISED a Porsche! That little whore says you don't have one for me!""

&amp;#x200B;

HB: ""That's right - we don't have Porches for ANYONE, since we don't carry them in this market ::checks rez info:: let's see what you were booked for - looks like you were booked a Lincoln Town Car, and it was booked for you by Tim, at your company's travel department...""  


YS: ""Well, that dumb faggot musta fucked up my rental! I DEMAND you get me a Porsche - or else I am NEVER renting from your company again!""

&amp;#x200B;

Hawaiian Buddy said that, at this point, he was COMPLETELY done with this guy, and it was time to drop the hammer.

&amp;#x200B;

HB: ""You'll NEVER rent from us again? I can help you with that! ::types on keyboard:: Congratulations! You are now on Big Car Rental's GLOBAL 'DO NOT Rent' list - you won't be able to rent one of our cars anywhere on the planet. Oh, and by the way - due to the corporate rate your company has set up with us, you being added to the DNR list automatically sends reports to Client Company's HR office, and the local travel office.  


Have a GREAT day, dick!""

&amp;#x200B;

Hawaiian Buddy said that Yosemite Sam gaped at him like a goldfish for a few moments, and then went outside to grab a cab, with his shoulders slumped.  


Our supervisor had lunch with Tim a few days later, mostly to find out what happened... Dude came into town to get interviewed for a big corporate promotion, with lots of zeroes on his paycheck, relocation to my fair city, company car, huge housing allotment... the works.  


All taken off the table. Offer rescinded. Extensive notes added to his HR folder, and apparently got reviewed and then fired. I guess he had pissed off some other counter agents at a few hotels and car rentals on the company's time before.  

Play asshole games, win asshole prizes!

PMinisterOfMalaysia,2019-03-05 18:47:11+00:00,[Ramona Shelburne] LeBron's first season in Los Angeles has become a disaster,"&gt;While the failures can't be placed on any one person, James, Johnson and general manager Rob Pelinka will have to answer for a lot of it. Head coach Luke Walton could lose his job over it. Most of the roster wasn't going to be back next year anyway, given the team's insistence on signing players to only one-year contracts to preserve salary-cap space for a second star this summer. But you have to assume even larger-scale roster changes will be implemented given the disappointment of this season.



Pretty surprised to have the article read like this from Ramona. I'm probably looking into it too much, but it almost sounds like it's coming from Jeannie and it's her being apologetic towards Luke in advance. 


&gt;He talked with Johnson about finding playmakers and guys known for their toughness, which effectively resulted in a roster lacking in shooting and floor spacing. The Lakers went out and got players who fit that description -- who were willing to play on one-year deals.

Ramona also implies that trying to cater to what James expressed is the reason the roster is shaped the way it is. Kinda interesting write-up from our homegrown reporter.

Written Reviews: 

[Empire - Helen O'hara](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/captain-marvel/review/)

&gt;It’s the last act before this film truly lives up to its potential, but at crunch time it delivers in a more satisfying way than almost any other superhero film of recent years. Carol Danvers’ final battle offers a radical message and becomes a powerful metaphor for what could happen if we stop waiting to be told that we are enough; if we stop believing the people who tell us we’re too emotional or too weak. *Captain Marvel* says that, when we stop looking for approval, we can become literally godlike. This is not another cheap girl-power cliché; it’s an explicitly feminist apotheosis. Some people will find it disorientating to watch. *Captain Marvel* offers zero concessions to ease anyone in or win them over to Carol Danvers’ point of view. If that makes it hard for some viewers to relate to her, she’ll deal.

[The Hollywood Reporter - Todd McCarthy](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/captain-marvel-review-1192277)

&gt;Still, the focus and big selling point here is Captain Marvel herself and Larson's impersonation of her. So what does a best actress Oscar winner bring to a performance as a Marvel superhero? Larson makes Carol/Captain focused, solid, ever-alert to what's going on around her, a quick learner, a determined and unafraid warrior. In other words, she's everything you'd want and expect in a soldier, intergalactic or otherwise. But all of this is more or less prescribed by the role. What's lacking is humor, a hint that she might get off on the action and violence, or the indication of a deep desire or spark to ferret out evil and right the world's wrongs. The performance is fine, if not exciting or inspiring.

[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/05/captain-marvel-review-brie-larson-samuel-l-jackson)

&gt;Larson has the natural body language of a superhero: that mixture of innocence and insouciance, that continuous clear-eyed idealism and indignation combined with unreflective battle-readiness, all the things that give MCU films their addictive quality. I wanted a clearer, more central story for Captain Marvel’s emergence on to the stage, and in subsequent films – if she isn’t simply to get lost in the ensemble mix – there should more of Larson’s own wit and style and, indeed, plausible mastery of martial arts. In any case, Captain Marvel is an entertaining new part of the saga.

[Indiewire - David Ehrlich](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/03/captain-marvel-review-1202048795/)

&gt;As much as this movie can be seen as a step in the right direction, it’s so eager to get to the promised land that it trips over itself right out of the starting gate. The first and most fatal mistake of the script that Boden and Fleck co-wrote with Geneva Robertson-Dworet is that it reduces Vers — or Carol Danvers, as she’s later and better known — to an amnesiac for most of her adventure; in other words, Captain Marvel is far and away the least compelling thing about “Captain Marvel.”

[The Los Angeles Times - Kenneth Turan](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-captain-marvel-review-20190305-story.html)

&gt;But Marvel has come to recognize, as this film proves, that even effects-heavy behemoths can benefit from a directing touch that is human not programmatic, that understands character and nuance and can create scenes with an emotional heft we might not expect. As co-writers with Geneva Robertson-Dworet (with story credit to that trio and Nicole Perlman and Meg LeFauve), the directors also had a hand in the “Captain Marvel” narrative arc, which is far more complex than business-as-usual superhero origin stories.

[IGN - Meg Downey](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/05/captain-marvel-review)

&gt;Captain Marvel manages to take the best ideas of early MCU origin stories like Iron Man and Thor and use them to form something that feels both familiar and fresh. It can be a bit on-the-nose at times, and occasionally has to fast-track its exposition in ways that can feel slightly clunky, but what it lacks in grace it makes up for in charm. Brie Larson's stellar performance gives Carol Danvers a vibrant, joyful life that will fit right into the future of the MCU, whatever that future may hold.

[Screencrush - Matt Singer](https://screencrush.com/captain-marvel-review/)

&gt;It’s not at all what you would expect from Boden and Fleck, who are best known for character-driven indies like *Half Nelson* and *Sugar* that probe deep into the psyches of their heroes. In *Captain Marvel*, despite a scene where aliens *literally* probe into the psyche of their hero, they never quite licked the problem of a lead character who doesn’t know who she is until the film’s final act. And whether they had any input on the movie’s fight scenes or ceded them entirely to second-unit directors, those sequences are uniformly dark, murky, and disappointing. One takes place on a dusty planet at night. Another is set in a dimly lit spaceship. A third is in outer space. *Captain Marvel*makes *Solo: A Star Wars Story* look bright and cheerful in comparison.

[Uproxx - Mike Ryan](https://uproxx.com/hitfix/captain-marvel-review-brie-larson/)

&gt;Yes, *Captain Marvel* is an origin story, but it’s handled in such a unique way that it doesn’t always feel like an origin story. With rumors of movies based on The Eternals out there, *Captain Marvel* also feels like the first big step to an even more cosmic MCU...Without a doubt, Brie Larson’s *Captain Marvel* is going to be one of the anchors of whatever phase of movies we are about to enter. And, if *Captain Marvel* is any indication, these movies are about to get a little more weird.

[Vanity Fair - Richard Lawson](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/captain-marvel-movie-review)

&gt;The 90s aesthetic is used to charming effect, particularly in the music choices. We hear Garbage and Hole, two riot grrrl groups whose propulsive, gnarly charge gives the movie some pleasant bite. (The on-the-noseness of No Doubt’s “I’m Just a Girl” during a clunky fight scene doesn’t play quite as well.) The movie has a good time with itself, but is not a relentless gag factory like *Guardians* or *Thor: Ragnarok*—though quite like those movies, *Captain Marvel* is pretty spacey. If your tolerance for kooky galactic names and actors in latex masks is low, *Captain Marvel* may prove trying.

[Variety - Owen Gleiberman](https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/captain-marvel-review-brie-larson-samuel-l-jackson-1203154542/)

&gt;The movie was directed and co-written by the team of Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (“Half Nelson,” “Sugar,” “Mississippi Grind”), and I’m not sure if there has ever been a case of filmmakers *this* indie commandeering the pop-art canvas of a Marvel movie. Boden and Fleck are low-key American neorealists, and in “Captain Marvel” they barely retain a vestige of their signature style. Yet they have brought off something exciting, embracing the Marvel house style and, within that, crafting a tale with enough tricks and moods and sleight-of-hand layers to keep us honestly absorbed.

[The Wrap - April Wolfe](https://www.thewrap.com/captain-marvel-film-review-brie-larson-avengers-mcu/)

&gt;Larson’s energy, at first, is powered by a precocious kid-sister vibe, disobeying the rules but charming her way out of trouble. Carol’s arc is defined by shedding those bonds to that identity and to her mentor/father figure, speaking and acting with directness. Larson’s quite capable of selling that oscillation of maturity without losing the humor of her character; she may be confident, but she’s still crafty and calculatingly playful. And what really sells this film is that playfulness.

Waniou,2019-03-04 06:19:15+00:00,OWL team Elo Rankings,"So apparently I've spent too much time looking up how Elo rankings work and I thought it would be interesting to make an Elo ranking system for OWL teams.

Basically, the system works entirely off of map wins and losses, but favours teams that take maps off of teams that are stronger than them.

For an overly simplified version of the maths, every team starts off with a rating of 1500. A map win makes you go up 16, a map loss makes you go down 16 points and a draw is worth 0 points. However, those points scale up and down based on the relative rating between two teams. For example, Atlanta's 4-0 win over the, at the time equally ranked, Florida team in week 1 was worth 64 points. However, Vancouver's 4-0 win over the lower ranked Shanghai team in week 2 was only worth 58 points.

There's a few limitations of this system. I wanted it to be on a level playing field at the start of the season and that's mean that some early wins have kinda boosted some teams up higher than they perhaps should be.

But anyway, this is how the teams are looking under my Elo system after week 3. For the simplified list version where I discover that some team colours are impossible to read, see here: https://i.imgur.com/yic6LXj.png  


But for a more full one with explanations about why teams are placed where they are, I've written probably too much

&amp;#x200B;

|Rank (Change)|Team|ELO|Thoughts|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 (0)|New York Excelsior|1631|Of course New York are at the top. They're currently 6-0 and have the best map differential so they deserve this spot|
|2 (+1)|Atlanta Reign|1626|Atlanta are boosted up a bit by their early 4-0 win against Florida before the system could rank them as low as they probably deserve, and because of their 4-0 sweep of Paris this week (Which actually put them ahead of NYXL until NYXL beat Seoul)|
|3 (-1)|Vancouver Titans|1606|Just barely sneaking in behind Atlanta, the Titans dropping a map to the low ranked Valiant have kept them just behind them|
|4 (0)|San Francisco Shock|1574|The Shock remain relatively high due to the fact that their games they lost were against the higher ranked Vancouver, and their loss to Gladiators being a map 5 |
|5 (0)|Guangzhou Charge|1550|Perhaps fortunately for them, their loss to Chengdu was in week 1, and their loss to Titans was against a much better team so they stay relatively high|
|6 (+1)|Toronto Defiant|1525|Toronto's win against Boston was considered somewhat of an upset, and their loss to NYXL and Atlanta were both expected, so this has helped keep them ahead of other teams|
|7 (0)|London Spitfire|1517|London's two losses were fairly early in the season, which kinda tanked them but has meant that their wins against Justice and Spark were both considered upsets and gave them a good boost|
|8 (-2)|Philadelphia Fusion|1501|Fusion's week 2 really did them no favours in my system. Poor Elk :(|
|9 (+1)|Dallas Fuel|1498|As above, their upset win over Fusion, along with a win over Seoul that was also considered an upset, has helped raise them up.|
|10 (+4)|Shanghai Dragons|1496|Shanghai's loss to Titans was an expected loss so cost them slightly less than a 4-0 would have, but this led to them having less than favourable matchups for their win over Boston and Chengdu, and the fact that Chengdu was 4-0ed boosted them further|
|11 (+2)|Seoul Dynasty|1492|Seoul's loss to Dallas tanked them a bit in the rankings, and this meant the system boosted them up, possibly too high, with their 4-0 win overChengdu and their two recent losses haven't quite compensated for this. Taking a map off NYXL also helped stop them falling further|
|12 (+4)|Houston Outlaws|1488|Houston's rough schedule this stage has helped them not drop too far, especially because their losses to Boston and Toronto were in map 5.|
|13 (-4)|Paris Eternal|1480|Turns out, this system doesn't really like teams being 4-0ed by a lower ranked team and this has dropped Paris quite a bit.|
|14 (-3)|Hangzhou Spark|1474|Spark's win over Gladiators gained them a bit of a boost but their two losses to London and Houston were games the system thought they should have won so they were penalised for this|
|15 (0)|Boston Uprising|1468|Turns out Boston are in the right spot? Most of their games have been relatively even and against similarly ranked teams|
|16 (+4)|Los Angeles Valiant|1442|I think this really shows just how rough Valiant's schedule actually is this stage. Taking maps off of teams that are ranked much higher than them, such as NYXL and Vancouver did them a huge favour|
|17 (0)|Los Angeles Gladiators|1440|Gladiator's loss to Hangzhou has somewhat cost them, but their win over Shock was considered a pretty huge upset so that's stopped them being lower|
|18 (0)|Florida Mayhem|1422|Poor Florida. Their win against Fusion was a massive upset, but the rest of their disappointing season, especially being 4-0ed early in the season hasn't helped|
|19 (-7)|Chengdu Hunters|1402|Chengdu have been 4-0ed twice, including by a Seoul team that were ranked much lower than them at the time. This has really, really not helped them|
|20 (-1)|Washington Justice|1391|Poor Justice. :( This team just can't catch a break and the rest of their season doesn't look any better. Having 0 match wins and having been 4-0ed doesn't help at all|

And because everything is better with charts, how teams are looking for the last few weeks:   


https://i.imgur.com/w8S85Zx.png  


And lastly, because this nice Playoff Machine was made ([See Reddit post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/ax23h1/i_created_an_owl_playoff_machine_that_allows_you/)), I tried to estimate how the remaining matches would go, and apparently something like [this here](http://owplayoffmachine.com/?result=2dfqXne6vre2qt7dZ-56nXe9Z9pXq31929fr7dt7vX6963sA). My spreadsheet doesn't seem keen on predicting 4-0s (I guess there's just not a big enough difference between teams), but it results in the top 8 being, in order, Vancouver, NYXL, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Toronto, Shock, Guangzhou and Shanghai.

ThereWillBeSpuds,2019-02-27 18:46:05+00:00,"CMV: The electoral college is dumb, anti-democratic and doesn't even accomplish any of the outcomes its supporters claim are its purpose.","1. People claim the electoral college ""prevents California, Texas, and New York from determining the outcome of the presidential election""

But it is only under the electoral college that states vote as blocks. More people voted for Donald Trump in Los Angeles (620,285) than voted at all in Alaska (246,588) and Wyoming (248,742) combined. Their votes were switched and discounted. 

Even ignoring that states dont vote as a block, voters in those three states don't account for half of the voters in the country. Even if everyone who voted in those three states in 2016 decided to vote for the same person it would only have been 27,903,726 votes, 22.55% of the total voter turnout. Nowhere near enough to ""decide"" the outcome. 

If you want voters in small states to have a bigger voice than voters in large states, giving their votes a multiplier would be much fairer. If people in Wyoming just had their vote counted 3.73 (or whatever) times as much as Californian votes. At least under that system dissenting votes within a state would be counted how they are cast instead of being switched. You could apportion the voting power multiplier by an index of population per congressperson with whatever state was lowest set as 1 vote or you could apportion it by a simple formula based on population ranking like this:

&gt;Vote multiplier = (state population rank + 19) / 20

However, I do not advocate for this type of system either. One vote per person is fundamentally more fair.

2. People claim that under a popular vote system candidates would ignore everywhere but the most populous areas. Under the current system candidates only have an incentive to campaign in swing states, how is that any better than the imagined problem of candidates only campaigning in populous areas? For example if Hillary Clinton could have changed 73,515 minds in Florida and Arizona in 2016 she would have won the whole election. On the other hand convincing 100,000 Trump voters in Idaho to switch their vote would have gained her nothing. 375 out of 399 campaign events in 2016 took place in just 12 states. Half of all states had no candidate events during the Presidential election (not counting primaries which are a whole other unrelated issue).

Furthermore, Under a system with one person, one vote, candidates would campaign anywhere they felt they could persuade voters to vote for them. That calculus would be different for every candidate. Certainly some candidates would campaign primarily in populous centers, but that would not be a winning strategy for other candidates. Consider the state of Illinois. It has a gigantic liberal city in it that accounts for about 75 percent of the states population. Despite that in 2014 they elected a Republican governor who carried every county but one (Cook, 40 percent of population). Now, do you think that candidate campaigned solely in Chicago? Why then would a candidate who truly wanted to represent rural america campaign solely in cities?

As of the 2013 census only 28.2 percent of people in america live in cities over 100k population. Even winning all of the votes in those cities wouldnt come close to winning you the election. And again, it is only under the electoral college where cities vote as a block. 


3. People say the founding fathers never intended for people to directly elect the president and that the electors were meant to make the choice independently and prevent an uneducated populous from electing a demagogue.

That is clearly not how the system is working, so their intentions dont mean anything.

Robinwarder1,2019-02-27 12:15:02+00:00,The Cowden Family Murders: An Entire Family Vanishes While Camping Before They Are Found Murdered Seven Months later,"On August 30, 1974, 28-year old Richard Cowden, his 22-year old wife Belinda, and their two children, five-year old David and five-month old Melissa, left their home in White City, Oregon to go on a Labor Day weekend camping trip near Carberry Creek. At 9:00 AM on September 1, Richard and David and the family’s pet Basset Hound, Droopy, visited a general store in the town of Copper to purchase some milk before heading back to their campsite, which would turn out to be the last confirmed sighting of the family. That evening, the Cowdens were scheduled to have dinner at the home of Belinda’s mother, Ruth Grayson, but never arrived. When Ruth travelled to the campsite, she discovered that the entire family was missing and their truck and all of their possessions had been left behind. The only items which could not be accounted for were their bathing suits. Ruth reported the Cowdens missing to the police and the following morning, Droopy the family dog showed up at the Copper general store, unharmed.  

An extensive search effort failed to turn up any trace of the Cowdens, but on April 12, 1975, a pair of gold prospectors discovered what appeared to be a male skeleton tied to a tree on a rocky hillside located seven miles from the Cowdens’ campsite. Police soon found the skeletal remains of a woman and two children wedged inside a nearby cave, and the victims were all eventually identified as the Cowden family. The cause of Richard’s death could not be determined, but Belinda and David were both shot in the head with a .22-caliber rifle while Melissa died from severe head trauma. While investigators believed that Richard was killed where he was found, it was unclear if Belinda and the children were murdered at another location. One volunteer claimed that he already searched the cave in early September 1974, but their bodies were not there at that time. A couple from Los Angeles would later report having camped near Carberry Creek on the same afternoon the Cowdens went missing, where they saw a pick-up truck containing two men and a woman at around 5:00 PM. They said the people inside the truck appeared to be waiting for them to leave, which made them nervous, so they moved on.

The prime suspect in the murders would be a convicted murderer named Dwain Lee Little, who had been paroled in May 1974 and was living with his parents in the nearby community of Ruch, just over 20 miles from the Cowdens’ campsite. In November 1964, at age 15, Little murdered a 16-year old neighbour named Orla Fay Fipps and raped her body after she was already dead. He received a life sentence, but served less than ten years before his release. The Little family owned a pick-up which matched the description of the truck the campers from Los Angeles had seen. On the day the Cowdens went missing, Little claimed that he drove his pick-up from Crescent City, California to Ruch, but denied being in Copper that day even though his quickest route home would have involved driving through there. When investigators checked Little’s pick-up, they were struck by how clean and spotless it looked. Around Christmastime, Little’s girlfriend discovered he was cheating on her, so she decided to inform the authorities that Little owned a .22-caliber rifle, which was a violation of his parole. Even though the rifle could not be located, police told Little he would have his parole revoked unless he agreed to take a lie detector test about the Cowdens’ disappearance. Little refused and elected to go back to prison. He was paroled again in 1977, but would be arrested in June 1980 for abducting, raping and attempting to murder a pregnant woman, for which he received three consecutive 20-year sentences. Little is still incarcerated today at age 70, but even though investigators consider him to be the prime suspect in the Cowden family murders, they lack the evidence to charge him.

lifeisstrangemetoo,2019-02-24 14:12:12+00:00,The Hitchhiker who Asked me to take her to Hell,"*What the hell was she doing out here at a time like this?*

I eased my foot down onto the brake pedal, and the car slowed to a stop. I looked out the window at the woman. She cut a pitiful figure: shoulders slumped, head down, all while the rain came down on her in heavy sheets.

I rolled down the window.

“Looking for a ride?” I asked. 

She lifted her head, and nodded. I undid my seatbelt with a click, leaned over and opened the passenger's side door. She climbed inside and brushed her soaking wet hair out of her face. She was beautiful.

“Where you headed?” I asked.

“Oh,” she said quietly, “to hell I guess.”

I laughed at the perceived joke, but my laughter died when I saw the grave expression her face.

“Well,” I said. “I can get you as far as Los Angeles. I guess that’s about as close to hell as you can get without dying.”

Her face eased into a wry smile. 

“Okay,” she said. “Los Angeles it is.”

I smiled at her and hit the gas. Silence settled over us as we drove, and the rain came down heavier and heavier. Even with the wipers on full speed, it was impossible to see through the endless gray curtain of water.

“So what brings you out here in weather like this?” I finally said.

She looked a bit startled as she stared out the truck's windshield.

“Oh,” she said, “I hate the rain.”

“Yeah,” I said. “It’s a good thing I found you when I did. This area is prone to flash floods, you know.”

A convulsive shiver shook her entire body. I cranked up the heat.

“Hey, not to sound like a pervert, but shouldn’t you get out of those wet clothes? I have some spare dry ones in the back, and I won’t watch you change, I promise.”

“Okay,” she said. She pulled her coat and shirt off right then, before reaching in the back and grabbing an old T-shirt I kept as a spare in the back. 

“Oh my god,” I said. 

Now that her coat was off I could see her neck. A thick, purple bruise encircled it.

“Are you okay?” I asked. “Do you need medical attention?”

“Ambulances don’t come out here,” she said. “Same for police. It’s too remote.”

“Er, right,” I said. This woman was starting to make me uncomfortable, and our conversation once again faded into silence. It was a few minutes before she spoke again, right as the car was about to crest a large hill. 

“Stop the car,” she said. 

I slowed, but didn’t stop. 

“What’s the matter?” I asked.

“Stop the car.”

“I can’t do that,” I said, “I’m on a tight schedule, you know? And besides, I can’t just leave you out here in this weather.”

She turned to me. The look on her face was totally blank as she seized the wheel and pulled. The truck jerked to the right, and tires squealed as I slammed on the brakes. I jerked the wheel back but it was no good, the truck slammed into the guard rail, shearing off a post and plunging into slushy mud.

“God damn it!” I yelled. “What the hell is wrong with—what the hell?” 

The woman had disappeared. I squinted out the window into the shifting gray canvas of rain. 

*Had she somehow fallen out while the car was skidding?*

I looked at her seatbelt, still buckled. This was too weird for me. I hit the gas, but the truck’s wheels only spun. They were stuck in the mud. I pulled out my phone and called the police to let them know where I was, but they said they couldn’t reach me until conditions improved. 

I resigned myself to waiting, flipped on the radio and took a nap.

I awoke to a knock on my window. I opened my eyes to see a policeman, motioning for me to roll down the window. I obliged.

“Well,” he said in a thick Southern drawl. “Believe it or not you might just be the luckiest son if a bitch on the planet.”

“Excuse me?”

“Come on out, I'll show you.” 

I did as I was told, and the two of us walked to the top of the hill. Lying in the middle of the road below, lodged in a massive swell of mud, was a rock about half the size of my truck.

“You come over that hill,” said the policeman, “I reckon you never would have seen it in the rain. It’s a lucky thing you lost control when you did, otherwise, well…” 

He looked at me pointedly.

“But I didn’t lose control,” I said. “A hitchhiker jerked the steering wheel and sent me into the mud.”

“That right?” he said. “Where’d he go?”

“She,” I said. “It was a she.”

A peculiar expression stole over his face.

“Remember what she looked like?”

“Er, yeah,” I said. “Black hair, blue eyes, and…”

“And what?”

“A bruise around her neck. It was a bad one.”

The policeman nodded and sighed. 

“Looks like you ran into Maggie. She’s the local legend round here.”

“Legend?” 

The officer nodded, and explained.

Apparently Maggie was a single mother who had locked her daughter in a her, in order to keep the girl from running off with an abusive boyfriend. She went off to work one day, taking the key with her. It rained hard that day, and the house was flooded. The daughter couldn’t get out, and drowned. 

Maggie was inconsolable—she hanged herself a week later. Her note said that she was going to hell to atone for her sins.

But she didn’t go to hell. According to the legend, she stayed on earth to atone by saving wayward travelers from the same fate her daughter had suffered. 

I supposed I might have bumped my head in the crash, that Maggie might have been nothing more than a hallucination—except for one thing. When I went back to my truck, the shirt and jacket she had been wearing were sitting there still, soaking wet, on my passenger seat.

I still have them.

BayonettaBasher,2019-02-23 20:03:34+00:00,[OC] The Suns can still make the playoffs if 9 conditions are satisfied.,"Okay there were a couple of posts on this already, but they got removed because some users (myself included) thought that they still had a chance, the reasoning behind this being that the Suns could finish with 33 wins if they won out and the Jazz could finish with 32 wins if they lost out. However, I just realized this doesn't really work out all the time because there are still several teams below 32 wins that play each other many times. I was curious if this meant the Suns were screwed or if they still had a chance, so I looked into the matter for quite a bit.

I concluded that there are 9 conditions, involving 9 different teams, that must be satisfied in order for the Suns to make the playoffs. Scroll down to the TL;DR if you don't want to read the reasoning, or otherwise prepare for a r/wedidthemath post explaining it all:

#Tiebreakers and Basic Implications

The Suns, already with 49 losses, can only finish 33-49 if they win out. Four teams in the west have over 33 wins already: the Warriors (42), Nuggets (40), Thunder (38), and Trail Blazers (35). Three more have exactly 33 -- the Rockets, Spurs, and Clippers, so the Suns, at best, can hope to tie these teams. Then, there are all the teams with less than 33 wins, who the Suns can theoretically overtake: the Jazz (32), Kings (30), Lakers (29), Timberwolves (28), Mavs (26), Pelicans (26), and Grizzlies (23). However, it doesn't necessarily mean the Suns can still finish above all these teams since these teams still play each other several times. 

**Implication A**: For the Suns to make the playoffs, we need the **Suns to win out** and for **the team with &lt;= 33 wins to lose every game possible** (aside from ones where they play each other). This will be the implication in the tiebreaking process we are about to see.

For reference, let's look and see which teams the Suns hold or can hold the tiebreaker against. The first tiebreaker is head-to-head record, the second tiebreaker is division winner (irrelevant in this scenario), and the third tiebreaker is record in conference games. There are more tiebreakers, but I don't want to get in that deep.

* Rockets: 0-1, two games remaining. By Implication A, the Suns will win both remaining games. Therefore, the Suns **have won** the season series.
* Spurs: 1-3, no games remaining. The Suns have lost the season series. We **discard the Spurs** from this scenario.
* Clippers: 0-3, one game remaining. The Suns have lost the season series. We **discard the Clippers** from this scenario.
* Jazz: 0-1, three games remaining.  By Implication A, the Suns will win all remaining games. The Suns **have won** the season series.
* Kings: 1-2, one game remaining. The best outcome for the season series is a tie, in which we go to the next tiebreaker: conference record. The Kings have 16 conference wins to the Suns' 7, but by Implication A, the Suns will overtake the Kings as there are more than 9 conference games remaining for both teams. Therefore, the Suns **have won** the season series.
* Lakers: 0-3, one game remaining. The Suns **have lost** the season series.
* Timberwolves: 1-2, no games remaining. The Suns **have lost** the season series.
* Mavericks: 2-1, one game remaining. By Implication A, the Suns will win the remaining game. Therefore, the Suns **have won** the season series.
* Pelicans: 0-1, three games remaining. By Implication A, the Suns will win all remaining games. Therefore, the Suns **have won** the season series.
* Grizzlies: 1-1, one game remaining. By Implication A, the Suns will win all remaining games. Therefore, the Suns **have won** the season series.

With the Spurs and Clippers out of the picture, the Suns are only able to overtake the Rockets, Jazz, Kings, Lakers, Timberwolves, Mavericks, Pelicans, and Grizzlies, a total of **8** teams. We now consider whether these teams can lose out, since they play each other several times. I am using [Playoff Predictor](https://playoffpredictors.com/Basketball) to easily fill out the standings for all remaining games.

* The Suns will win all remaining games by Implication A, which will finish them with a record of **33-49**.
* The Jazz and Rockets, the teams the Suns can overtake who have the most wins, are both able to lose out since they don't play each other anymore. The Rockets will thus finish at **33-49** (behind the Suns due to the tiebreaker) and the Jazz at **32-50**. The Jazz have the ability to take one more win due to the status of the tiebreaker. If needed, we can adjust the Jazz's win total.

We can make this out as **Implication B**: the Rockets will lose out and **Implication C**: the Jazz will lose out.

#Remaining Requirements

Now let's take a look at the remaining teams: Sacramento, LA Lakers, Minnesota, Dallas, New Orleans, and Memphis. These are all the games these teams have against each other.

* Sacramento vs. LA Lakers (**1 time**)
* Sacramento vs. Minnesota (**1 time**)
* Sacramento vs. Dallas (**2 times**)
* Sacramento vs. New Orleans (**2 times**)
* LA Lakers vs. New Orleans (**3 times**)
* LA Lakers vs. Memphis (**1 time**)
* Minnesota vs. Dallas (**1 time**)
* Minnesota vs. Memphis (**1 time**)
* Dallas vs. New Orleans (**1 time**)
* Dallas vs. Memphis (**3 times**)

There are still 16 games remaining involving these teams, so there must be 16 unfortunate winners; we can't just have every team lose out. Here's a reminder of our current win totals before distributing wins.

##Case of Memphis

* Sacramento: **30** (games: LAL, MIN, DAL x2, NOP x2)
* LA Lakers: **29** (games: SAC, NOP x3, MEM)
* Minnesota: **28** (games: SAC, DAL, MEM)
* Dallas: **26** (games: SAC x2, MIN, NOP, MEM x3)
* New Orleans: **26** (games: NO x2, LAL x3, MEM)
* Memphis: **23** (games: LAL, MIN, DAL x3, **+** UTA, HOU)

If Memphis wins every game against these six teams (5-0) and lose every other game, they will finish with 28 wins, five games behind the Suns (33-49) via Implication A. However, they can't lose out because of Implications B and C: they still play the Rockets and Jazz a total of two times. Memphis needs to win these games, but doing so will only put them at a final record at **30-52**, still behind the Suns. I will call these conditions for Memphis **Implication D**.

Having finished simulating the Grizzlies, we can take them off our list.

##Case of New Orleans

* Sacramento: **30** (games: LAL, MIN, DAL x2, NOP x2)
* LA Lakers: **29** (games: SAC, NOP x3)
* Minnesota: **28** (games: SAC, DAL)
* Dallas: **26** (games: SAC x2, MIN, NOP)
* New Orleans: **26** (games: SAC x2, LAL x3, DAL **+** UTA x2, HOU)

New Orleans can win twice against Sacramento, three times against LA, and once against Dallas while losing all other games. This puts them at 32 wins. However, New Orleans still plays Houston once and Utah twice. As per Implication B and C, New Orleans is now at 35 wins, which is a no-no since they have passed Phoenix now. The best we can do is give one of New Orleans' wins to Dallas and another one to the Lakers, putting the Pelicans with a final record of **33-49**, tied with the Suns. However, the Suns hold the tiebreaker. I will call these conditions for New Orleans **Implication E**.

Now let's look at our standings without NOLA.

##Case of Dallas

* Sacramento: **30** (games: LAL, MIN, DAL x2)
* LA Lakers: **30** (games: SAC)
* Minnesota: **28** (games: SAC, DAL)
* Dallas: **27** (games: SAC x2, MIN  **+** UTA, HOU)

Our next worst team to consider is Dallas. Dallas still plays Utah and Houston once each, which will put them at 29 wins, and then when we add in the 3 wins against these other teams under the assumption they lose everything else, they will have a final record of **32-50**. No problem here, that's still below the Suns. We also have one extra win to give out just in case it's necessary at the end, since Phoenix holds the tiebreaker and is situated at a cool 33-49. I will call these conditions for Dallas **Implication F**.

##Case of Minnesota

* Sacramento: **30** (games: LAL, MIN)
* LA Lakers: **30** (games: SAC)
* Minnesota: **28** (games: SAC **+** UTA, HOU)

The Timberwolves will finish at 29 wins if they beat Sacramento. They have two more games against Utah and Houston. If they go 2-0 in those games, they will finish with a final record of **31-51**. We have one extra win to dole out if necessary because the Wolves hold the tiebreaker against the Suns. I will call these conditions for Minnesota **Implication G**.

##Case of the LA Lakers

* Sacramento: **30** (games: LAL)
* LA Lakers: **30** (games: SAC **+** UTA x2)

Pretty straightforward. I'll give the Kings the win here because if the Lakers win all 3 of their remaining critical games, they will be at 33-49 and ahead of the Suns. Instead, we have the Lakers at **32-50** to finish.  I will call these conditions for the LA Lakers **Implication H**.

##Case of Sacramento


* Sacramento: **31** (games: UTA, HOU x2)

Per Implication B and C, they have to win these. This will put Sacramento at 34 wins, which is ahead of Phoenix. But remember how Utah has a win to spare because under this scenario, they finish 32-50? If we have Utah beat Sacramento, then Sacramento will finish **33-49** and below the Suns due to the tiebreaker, while the Jazz will also finish **33-49** and below the Suns. We modify Implication B (the conditions for the Jazz) as a result, and create the set of conditions for the Kings as **Implication I**.

##More Tiebreaking

Assuming I did everything right on Playoff Predictor (the site I linked above), our final win totals for seeds 7-15 will look like what is below. Note that since we have a 5-way tie at 33-49, the tiebreaking is based on head-to-head record among ALL teams tied. Using all of the assumed records from above.

* 33 wins: Phoenix, Utah, Houston, New Orleans, Sacramento
* 32 wins: Dallas, LA Lakers (LA wins tiebreaker with 3-0 season series victory)
* 31 wins: Minnesota
* 30 wins: Memphis

To break the five-way tie, let's look at each team's assumed record among teams in the tie. Note that team records don't all total to 16 because sometimes they play each other only 3 times.

* Phoenix: 9-6
* Utah: 7-8
* Houston: 6-9
* New Orleans: 9-6
* Sacramento: 6-10

With Sacramento and Phoenix still tied after the tiebreaker, we look at the next one up on the list for 3+ team ties ([according to ESPN](http://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/matchups)). The tiebreaker is now highest winning percentage within division if the teams are in the same division. However, New Orleans and Sacramento are in different divisions. The next tiebreaker is highest winning percentage in conference games. Under this scenario, the conference records are:

* Phoenix: 21-31
* New Orleans: 23-29

Therefore, New Orleans wins the tiebreaker and will be seeded ahead of Phoenix as well as all the other teams involved in the tie.

#Final Standings

Our final standings are now:

* 7th seed: [](/NOP) New Orleans Pelicans: 33-49
* 8th seed: [](/PHX) Phoenix Suns: 33-49
* 9th seed: [](/UTA) Utah Jazz: 33-49
* 10th seed: [](/HOU) Houston Rockets: 33-49
* 11th seed: [](/SAC) Sacramento Kings: 33-49
* 12th seed: [](/LAL) Los Angeles Lakers: 32-50
* 13th seed: [](/DAL) Dallas Mavericks: 32-50
* 14th seed: [](/MIN) Minnesota Timberwolves: 31-51
* 15th seed: [](/MEM) Memphis Grizzlies: 30-52


#TL;DR

It is still possible for the Phoenix Suns to slide into the 8th seed, but all of these conditions have to be true:

1. The Suns win every remaining game. (Implication A)
2. The Rockets lose every remaining game. (Implication B)
3. The Jazz beat the Kings and lose every other remaining game. (Implication C)
4. The Grizzlies beat the Lakers, Timberwolves, Mavericks (3x), Jazz, and Rockets and lose every other remaining game. (Implication D)
5. The Pelicans beat the Kings (2x), Lakers (2x), Jazz (2x), and Rockets and lose every other remaining game. (Implication E)
6. The Mavericks beat the Kings (2x), Timberwolves, Pelicans, Jazz, and Rockets and lose every other remaining game. (Implication F)
7. The Timberwolves beat the Kings, Jazz, and Rockets and lose every other remaining game. (Implication G)
8. The Lakers beat the Pelicans and Jazz and lose every other remaining game. (Implication H)
9. The Kings beat the Lakers and Rockets (2x) and lose every other remaining game. (Implication I)

So the Suns still have playoff hopes, and are not officially eliminated until one of those nine conditions is violated.",nba,1764

#**1. NBA Basketball 101**

**Scoring ‘Baskets’.** Putting the ball through the hoop either awards you 1, 2, or 3 points depending on the circumstance. 2-point shots are the most common, and the default for any shot, lay-up, or dunk. The shot is worth 3-points if it enters the basket from beyond the aptly-named 3-point line, also called ‘the arc’ (e.g. ‘from beyond the arc’ or ‘from downtown’). Common types of standard shots include the ‘jump shot’, when a player’s feet leave the ground as the ball leaves his hands, and the ‘step back’, when a player quickly steps backwards, away from the defender just before shooting. The only 1-point baskets are free throws – open, uncontested shots awarded to players who have been fouled, or whose team has amassed a certain number of fouls in a quarter.

**Fouls &amp; Violations.** The penalties of the NBA come in a wide variety of obscure forms, but the ones you’re going to see the most are:

•	Personal Fouls – When an opposing player hits, pushes, shoves, holds, or illegally obstructs another player. If the fouled player was shooting the ball, and the ball went in, they’re awarded one free throw (i.e. they get 2 points for the basket, or 3 if it was a 3-pointer, and have an opportunity to make it a 3-point or 4-point play, respectively, by scoring a free-throw). If the fouled player was shooting the ball while fouled and missed, they are awarded either 2 free throws for a missed 2-pointer, or 3 free throws for a missed 3-pointer.

•	Charging – You can’t plow into a defending player.

•	Blocking – You can’t plow into an offensive player.

•	Traveling – You can’t move while holding the ball and not dribbling it.

•	Carrying – You can’t hold the ball from underneath between dribbles.

•	Goaltending – Imagine a shot ball as traveling in an arc through the air. Once it reaches the apex of that arc and begins to fall downward toward the basket, it can no longer be blocked, or touched, by any player.

•	3-Second Violation – In general, you cannot stand in the ‘key’ or ‘lane’ – the painted rectangle just under the basket – for more than 3 seconds. There are a variety of exceptions, but in general this prevents a player from standing under the basket for a substantial period of time.

There are others that are less common and less important. Understand that many of these fouls and violations are, to some degree, subjective, and that the referees who determine whether they’ve taken place are imperfect. Mistakes are made. Calls are made that shouldn’t have been, and calls aren’t made that should’ve been. It’s part of the game. Get used to it.

**Assists.** Assists are a stat awarded to players who pass the ball to a player who then promptly scores. This stat reflects a player’s passing ability, their unselfishness, and their ‘vision’ – their ability to know where other players are on the court and to get the ball to them at the right time to guarantee a score. [Here’s a montage of some beautiful assists.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=032N4hay1QY) 

**Rebounds.** Also called ‘boards’, rebounds are when a player grabs a missed shot – often as it falls away from the hoop or backboard. Offensive rebounds are those rebounds secured from the opposing team’s basket, i.e. your team missed a shot, but you’ve retained the ball. Defensive rebounds are those secured from your own team’s basket, i.e. the opposing team missed a shot and you have reclaimed possession for your team.

[Here’s a game from Psychotic Ambassador to North Korea Dennis Rodman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF6qOsgb1cs), whose hands seemed to be magnetically attracted to any ball that fell from the rim any time he was in a game.

**Blocks.** Any time a player attempts a shot, layup, or dunk, and another player interrupts the ball from going into the basket, that is a block. Goaltending fouls generally occur as a result of mistimed blocks. [Here are some of last season’s best blocks.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGVtoBqv4-Q) Blocking is one of two purely defensive stats, along with…

**Steals.** This one’s pretty simple. If you manage to take possession of the ball away from a player on the opposing team, you have recorded a steal. But hey, [let’s montage it anyway.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW9X5h-cFC0)

**Screens.** When one player takes a firm stance on the court and stops players from the opposing team from getting around them, they have ‘set a screen’ or ‘set a pick’. This is often done by offensive players assisting the ballhandler by slowing down and rerouting defenders, allowing their teammates the time and space to score. The ‘pick and roll’ is a common type of 2-player offensive play designed to allow an offensive player to escape defenders via the use of a screen. A ‘switch’ is when defenders must reassign which defensive players are guarding which offensive players often as a result of screens and similar offensive adjustments. Forcing ‘mismatches’ and ‘bad switches’ can be a crucial offensive tactic in generating poor defense and better scoring opportunities. [Here’s a compilation of some ‘brick wall’ screens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcAW6g6BNao), i.e. clips of people setting such firm screens that other players smack off of them like they’re a wall.

**Cutting/Driving/Finishing.** This is the term for when an offensive player runs toward the basket to attempt a dunk or lay-up. It is often preceded by a screen or by fancy dribbling (like ‘a crossover’) intended to disrupt the defender’s ability to run alongside them. Here, [watch Kyrie put on a driving showcase.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOiyFW1Vcs0)

**Posting Up.** Playing in ‘the post’ is when an offensive player is between the 3-point line and the basket, often nearer the basket or in ‘the paint’, with their back or shoulder facing the basket and a defender pressed against them. This was a very common circumstance in the NBA for a long time, but as the value of shots taken from this middle area has decreased in the current strategic ‘meta’, ‘posting up’ is considered less valuable than either driving to the basket directly for a lay-up or dunk, or passing to the arc for a more valuable 3-point attempt. [The best highlight reel for post play I could find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcULJMJFuNs) is from 2014. See what I mean?

#**2. Positions &amp; Player Types**

There are five standard positions in most basketball: the Point Guard and Shooting Guard, the Small Forward and the Power Forward, and the Center. The two Guards are generally the smallest players on the floor and the best at shooting from range. The two Forwards are generally larger and better at playing nearer to the basket. The Center is generally the largest player on the team and assigned to work very close to the basket. In the modern NBA, these positions are becoming increasingly obsolete as more players fill liminal, hybrid roles.

**Point Guards – The De-Facto On-Court Leader**

The ‘floor general’, on most teams, the Point Guard starts each offensive possession with the ball, making the first pass or the first shot. They are often referred to as ‘primary ballhandlers’ for their job in controlling the ball at the start of a play. For a Point Guard, their intelligence, ability to read a defense, and their leadership are as important as their tangible, physical skills, and many of the best PGs are renowned as much for their ‘basketball IQ’ as they are for their jump shots or driving ability.
Stephen Curry and Kyrie Irving fill fairly traditional PG roles for the Warriors and Celtics, respectively. Notice how nearly every possession for each team begins with Steph or Kyrie scoping out the defense, directing their teammates, and initiating a play.
Shooting Guard – The Flashy Shooter and Driver

A role that increasingly steps on the toes of the Point Guard and the Small Forward, the Shooting Guard is traditionally a sharpshooter and an independent playmaker – a player who roams the 3-point line waiting for a chance at a 3-point shot, or hoping to be defended in isolation (‘iso ball’ is the name for 1-on-1 play) where they often excel at drop-stepping or cross-overs to push away the defender for an open shot, or to beat them to a drive to the basket.
Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant were both archetypal SGs, tremendous long-range shooters who also had the skill to blow by defenders and drive to the rim. In today’s game, James Harden exemplifies the Shooting Guard role.

**Small Forward – The All-Around Problem-Solver**

The ‘middle’ role on the court, between the two Guards and the Power Forward and Center, the Small Forward is a role often assigned to players of general, all-around skill and athleticism, jacks of all trades who are not big and powerful enough to take on around-the-rim roles, but who aren’t small and agile enough to be Guards. Small Forwards should ideally be capable of performing essentially every role on the court as-needed, and depending on the team, the coach, and the play, can fulfill a wide range of functions.
Unsurprisingly, the two players widely-regarded as the best in the NBA today – LeBron James and Kevin Durant – are both Small Forwards, as they are each capable of doing just about anything – shooting 3’s, driving to the basket, setting screens, defending, and everything in-between.

**Power Forward &amp; Center – The Rim-Protector and Two-Hand Dunker**

These two positions have gravitated together to such a degree that distinguishing between them is, in my opinion, not valuable. Often when sports journalists discuss the best Power Forwards or best Centers in the NBA, they stumble over the comparisons, being unsure exactly who should be counted as which position. Power Forwards and Centers are the biggest players on the court (the two positions, combined, are referred to as ‘Bigs’), and as such, are generally the most talented rebounders and shot blockers by sheer virtue of their strength and height. Traditionally, PFs played slightly farther away from the basket than true Centers, playing in the post and taking mid-range shots. As this type of play vanishes in the NBA, their role has become all-but identical to that of the Center.

Great historical Centers include Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell (once upon a time, the Center was more like today’s Point Guard in serving as the de-facto team leader) as well as Shaquille O’Neal, who is perhaps to this day the most archetypal Center of all time. Great Point Guards include Tim Duncan and Dirk Nowitzki – both of whom were capable of playing at greater range than most Centers are. In today’s game, great Bigs include Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid.

#**3. A Brief History of the NBA**

**1946-1959: The Early League**

The Basketball Association of America was founded in 1946 by a bunch of dudes who owned hockey arenas when they realized that basketball teams could make them some cash when their arenas were sitting around empty. The BAA absorbed two other leagues – the ABL and the NBL – by 1950, when it became the NBA. The game was substantially different back then – there was no 3-point line or shot-clock (explained later in the next paragraph) – and things like player training, nutrition, travel, and salary were basically non-existent. Stories abound about players who drank and smoked excessively, who had to hitchhike to games in rural places like Fort Wayne and Rochester where teams were located, and retiring because they got jobs that paid them too much to justify playing (can you imagine that happening today?).

The first non-white player, Wataru Misaka, played in 1947, and the first black players joined the league in 1950. The shot-clock was introduced in 1954 (the shot-clock can be seen ticking down in the corner of the screen during any NBA game – it allows the offensive team only 24 seconds to attempt a shot, which resets if the ball touches the rim – preventing one team from simply holding onto the ball the entire game, which is exactly what some teams were doing in the early 50’s, famously once resulting in a final score of 19-18).

The Minneapolis Lakers (now Los Angeles) won five titles in ’49, ’50, ’52, ’53, and ’54 under legendary coach John Kundla and headlined by the first basketball star in history, George Mikan, nicknamed “Mr. Basketball”.

**1960-1969: Russell’s Celtics Dynasty**

Bill Russell, the winningest American sportsman in history, joined the Boston Celtics and their star guard Bob Cousy and soon-to-be-legendary coach Red Auerbach in 1957. Between 1957 and 1969, the Celtics would win the NBA Championship a staggering 11 of 13 times, including 8 straight from ’59 through ’66. The NBA has never seen anything like it again, and likely never will. Bill Russell was a defensive monster (in an era before most defensive stats were tracked) and selflessly devoted to winning above all else. Russell was not just the star of the team, but also the coach for the ’68 and ’69 championships as well. Player-coaches are not something we’re going to see again, but Russell got two titles doing both jobs.

During the Celtics’ reign, they would beat Elgin Baylor and Jerry West’s Lakers in ’62, and ’63, Wilt Chamberlain’s Warriors in ’64, then Baylor and West’s Lakers again in ’65, ’66, and ’68. Wilt teamed up with Baylor and West for the ’69 finals, during which West averaged over 37-points per game against the Celtics, now led by a 35-year old player-coach Bill Russell.

And the Celtics still won. Bill Russel’s Celtics were incredible. In any other era, Baylor and West would’ve won several titles (Wilt is less certain: he seemed to care a lot more about his stats, which were admittedly absolutely preposterous, including a 100-point game, than winning).

**1970-1979: The ABA and Over-Expansion**

Understanding the NBA in the 1970’s can be a little difficult. There was a lot going on. During the early-to-mid ‘70s, the ABA gave the NBA a run for its money by offering a more exciting, fast-paced, player-centric game with a multi-colored ball, a 3-point line, a dunk contest, and flashy players with cool nicknames like Julius “Dr. J” Erving. Meanwhile, the NBA went from 9 teams in 1966 to 18 teams in 1974 and was thoroughly diluted with talent. The 70’s are largely remembered as an era when basketball was not especially popular, strangled by racism both internally and by the potential audience, with TV networks offering very little to the league that was increasingly known for losing out to sitcom reruns and hit by multiple drug scandals (NBA players were just famous enough to have as much cocaine as they wanted, but not quite famous enough to get away with it).

The great players of the 1970’s besides Dr. J (who would eventually join the NBA when the ABA merged into it by the end of the decade) include Kareem Abdul-Jabaar (statistically one of the three greatest players of all time), Rick Barry (who shot his free-throws grandma-style, underhanded), Elvin Hayes, Knicks hero Walt ‘Clyde’ Frazier, 3x MVP Moses Malone, George ‘The Iceman’ Gervin, and ‘Pistol’ Pete Maravich (who was born a few minutes away from where I was born, and my name is also Pete – please clap).
The 70’s are the only decade in NBA history where we really can’t talk about anything resembling a dynasty. The talent was so dispersed by the rapid expansion that no team even managed to win back-to-back titles the entire decade, and only the Knicks (’70 and ’73) and Celtics (’74 and ’76) won 2.

Then, in 1979, the 3-point line was added to the NBA the same year that two rookies joined the league – a scrawny white farm boy named Larry Bird joined the Boston Celtics, and a charismatic, wide-smiling showman joined the Lakers. His name was Earvin Johnson – but everyone called him Magic.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tMmaXRSeL4

**1980-1990: The Bird-Magic Rivalry**

If it weren’t for Larry Bird, Magic’s Lakers would’ve dominated the 80’s like the Minneapolis Lakers dominated the 50’s. If it weren’t for Magic Johnson, Bird’s Celtics would’ve done to this decade what Russell’s had done to the 60’s. Luckily for all of us, instead of domination, the 80’s were fierce competition – and that competition sparked a huge upturn in broadcast numbers and ticket sales. These two players, who had played against each other in the ’79 NCAA College Championship Game, would, through their rivalry (first a genuine spite, and later a genuine friendship), reinvigorate a shoddy league and set the stage for the modern NBA. From here on, from Magic and Bird on, the NBA is the league as we know it today – superteams, corporate sponsorships, 3-pointers, flashy dunks – the NBA we know and love was born between Magic and Bird.

The Lakers, with young superstar Magic and veteran leader Kareem, won the ’80, ’82, ’85, ’87, and ’88 championships under legendary coach Pat Riley. The Celtics won the ’81, 84, and ’86 titles, with Bird leading a remarkable team of the likes of Kevin McHale and Robert Parish. During the battle between these two juggernauts (three of those NBA finals were Celtics-Lakers), Moses Malone got to three championship series – one loss with the 76ers, one win with the 76ers, and one more loss with the Rockets – and Hakeem Olajuwon’s Rockets, a team that would’ve been amazing in any other era, got to, and lost, one finals series against Boston. With these exceptions, the ’80 to ’87 era was dominated by Boston and Los Angeles.

In ’88, Magic’s Lakers won their last title against Isiah Thomas’ Bad Boy Pistons – who would go on to beat them in ’89 and then beat the Portland Trail Blazers and Clyde Drexler in ’90. The Pistons three straight finals and two straight titles are something of a forgotten bridge between the famous Bird-Magic ‘80s and the even more famous era that was to follow…

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkySfD_uZbY

**1991-1998: Michael Jordan**

Drafted into the league from the University of North Carolina in 1984, Michael Jordan grew up while Bird and Magic were still sharing the crown, on a Bulls team that just wasn’t quite up to snuff. But as Magic and Bird aged and the Lakers and Celtics faded, and Isiah Thomas’ Pistons took the crown, the Bulls and their now-prime Michael Jordan were ready. Under the leadership of coach Phil Jackson, the Bulls ousted the Pistons to face Magic in his last finals appearance in 1991, and won in 5 games. The next year, Michael’s Bulls beat Portland. The year after that, they beat the Suns. Michael Jordan was the greatest player the league had seen in decades, maybe ever… and at the height of all that, after three straight titles… his father was murdered, and he was faced with a personal crisis that culminated in his retirement from the NBA to play for a minor-league baseball team (If it sounds like there has to be a larger story there – there is, but we don’t have time to get into that here).

While Michael was gone, Hakeem Olajuwon’s Rockets (remember them from the 80’s?) came back to win back-to-back titles in ’94 and ’95. Hakeem caught a break… or so he thought.

“I’m back.”

With those two words, Jordan came out of retirement, and immediately led the Bulls to a regular-seasons record of 72-10, the best in history to that point, followed by another threepeat, winning the ’96 title over Seattle, and the ’97 and ’98 titles over Karl ‘The Mailman’ Malone and John Stockton’s Utah Jazz. Two threepeats, 6 titles, an undefeated record in the finals, and now, at last… Jordan would retire again, this time for good.

…wait, he came back AGAIN? And played for a terrible team that missed the playoffs? Okay, we’re going to pretend that didn’t happen. Jordan retired for good as far as anyone is concerned. And so in 1999, after years of the leadership of epic players like Bird, Magic, Thomas, Olajuwon, and Jordan, the league was opened up for new blood.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAr6oAKieHk

**1999-2010: NBA in the New Millennium**

From ’99 through ’10, coach Gregg Popovich’s San Antonio Spurs won 4 titles, and coach Phil Jackson’s (remember him?) Lakers won 5 titles. That probably makes it sound like this was another of the NBA’s great rivalries, but it really wasn’t – at least, not in the same way as the Lakers-Celtics, for example. The Spurs and Lakers are both in the Western Conference, meaning that the two teams could never play against one another in the finals. Popovich’s Spurs were championed by legendary Power Forward Tim Duncan, while Jackson’s Lakers road the wave of devastating Shooting Guard Kobe Bryant. Besides the hiccup of the ’04 Pistons, the ’06 Heat (coached by Pat Riley – remember him, too?), and the ’08 Celtics, the Spurs and the Lakers dominated this decade.

I imagine many of the people looking to get into the NBA grew up with the ’99-’10 NBA happening in the background. It might stand out as odd to you that the Shaq-Kobe Lakers duo was such a cultural phenomenon even outside of the basketball world, while Tim Duncans Spurs seemed to slip under the radar. The Spurs played a very clean, unselfish, systematic style of basketball, and Tim Duncan had the exact opposite of a superstar personality, creating a very professional and undramatic dynasty compared to those led by spotlight-lit stars like Kobe or Shaq – or even Allen Iverson, who I distinctly remember as a non-basketball-fan growing up, even though his team never managed to win a finals (they made it, but lost, in ’01).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juBiQUjwx7c

**2011-2016: LeBron James**

Best to just come out with it from the very start. LeBron James has been in every NBA Finals game since 2011. His Miami Heat made the Finals every year from ’11 – ’14, and when he returned to his hometown of Cleveland, his Cavaliers made the finals every year from ’15 – ’18. Were the Heat in the Finals the year before LeBron arrived? Nope. Were the Cavaliers in the Finals the year before LeBron arrived? They weren’t even in the playoffs. LeBron James is a phenomenon.

LeBron, a son of Akron, Ohio, not far from Cleveland, was drafted by his hometown Cavaliers straight out of high school in 2003. Though he managed to drag them to one Finals in ’07, Popovich and Duncan’s Spurs swept them 4-0, and by 2010, it became clear that LeBron’s talents were being wasted in Cleveland. Most NBA fans wanted him to stay there, to be loyal to his home team, and to hold out through some bad years and help them see a championship. But in what was dubbed ‘The Decision’, he chose to leave and join superstars Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh on the Miami Heat. The very next season, he made it to the Finals.

The year, 2011, they lost to Dirk Nowitzki (a Power Forward who can shoot 3-pointers, a unique and remarkable player) and the Dallas Mavericks, before winning the ’12 and ’13 titles against the Oklahoma City Thunder (spearheaded by an incredible trio of Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook) and Popovich’s eternal Spurs, who proceeded to best them in ’14.

Remember Jordan’s “I’m Back”? In 2014, LeBron announced he was returning to Cleveland. The team had developed while he was away. They acquired Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, and Kevin Love, and were ready for the King’s guidance. His first year back, they made the finals, and like his first year in Miami, they lost – this time to the Golden State Warriors, led by Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, perhaps the two single greatest shooters in the history of the NBA, as well as superstar Andre Iguodala and defensive machine Draymond Green.

The next year, 2016, the Cavaliers met the Warriors in the Finals again – this Warriors team having beaten Jordan’s Bull’s record of regular season wins, going 73-9 – and the Cavaliers came back from being down 3-1 in the series to win the title, LeBron hoisting his third Championship trophy, and his first with Cleveland, breaking the city’s half-century-long title drought. That win is one of the most legendary in the history of the NBA, and really, in the history of American sports.
And then something happened.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vre_nWbPxk

**2016-Present: Golden State Dominance**

The Golden State Warriors had made it to the 2016 titles by beating the Oklahoma City Thunder, who were led by Kevin Durant, widely regarded as the second-best player in the league after LeBron.

And the Warriors signed Durant. This team, already featuring the deadliest pair of shooters in NBA history, the league’s Defensive Player of the Year, having gone to back-to-back titles, having just gone 73-9 in the regular season… signed the league’s second-best player. It shook the entire league. Kevin Durant is the greatest villain in the NBA to this day – nobody else comes close. Many regard this as having destroyed all parity in the league.

In 2017 and 2018, the Warriors and Cavaliers faced off in the Finals two more times – marking the first time the same two teams have played in four straight finals – but this time, the Warriors won 4-1 and 4-0. LeBron, despite seemingly never aging and playing as well as he ever has even into his mid-30’s, despite carrying an increasingly-mediocre Cavaliers team to the Finals year after year… simply couldn’t do anything against a Warriors team with not just Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, with not just Draymond Green, but with Kevin Durant as well. Even the Houston Rockets, who in the 2017-2018 season built and designed themselves specifically to defeat the Warriors, whose whole philosophy and strategy was designed around killing the Warriors, who ended this season with a better record and home court advantage over the Warriors, fell in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals against them.

The Warriors sit on top of the whole league right now in a way that no team has in a very long time. It’s hard to imagine who could beat them.
This offseason, LeBron finally left Cleveland for the second time to join the Los Angeles Lakers. They’re a very young and untested team mixed in with some veteran talent. The Rockets got a little bit worse. The team that would’ve won in the East last year, if not for LeBron, the Celtics, got a little bit better. And what did the Warriors do? The Warriors signed a played named DeMarcus ‘Boogie’ Cousins, one of the most dominant Bigs in the NBA today. He’s coming off a devastating injury and it’s unclear when he’ll be able to play, and whether he’ll be his old self, but there is no indication whatsoever that the Warriors have gotten anything but even better than before. Can anyone possibly threaten them?

Everyone outside of the Bay Area is hoping so. But none of us are feeling very confident about it.

So that’s where we are now.

#**4. Team-by-Team Breakdowns**

I’m going to provide brief summaries of each team in the NBA. These are intended to provide you with the bare basics necessary to have some idea of who they are – what kind of history they’ve had, what their last few seasons have been like, what the expectations are for this season, what we’ll all be watching for, and what particularly notable players have been, or currently are, on their rosters. Stuff will be left out. Important things will be forgotten. People in the comments will be telling me how I left out incredibly vital things that are essential to understanding their favorite team. I know. These are meant to be a primer for new fans, just to get your footing in understanding where a team is coming from and where they're going. I recommend the team's wikipedia pages to learn more.

***

**Atlanta Hawks**

**Hallmarks:** Bob Petit in the ‘50s and ‘60s, Dominique Wilkins in the ’80s and ‘90s; ’58 Champions

**This Year:** Bottom 10

One of the oldest teams in the league, dating back to the Buffalo Bisons in 1946, they won their only NBA Championship in 1958 and haven’t made it back to the finals since ’61, which was before they moved to Atlanta. They have sparsely even managed to make it to the playoffs since then – every time they get the ball rolling and make a playoff break, something seems to fall apart. Dominique Wilkins was one of the great, fun-to-watch dunkers of the ‘80s and his statue sits outside of their arena today. The Hawks had some good fortunes in the late 90’s, and again between ’08 and ’10, but never quite enough to propel them to another Finals. In 2015, finally, it looked like their luck was turning around, having a 17-0 month in January, and even advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals… where LeBron was waiting for them. In 2016, they lost in the first round of the playoffs, and in 2017, they slipped back substantially, as seems to be their curse. They drafted Luka Doncic with the third overall pick in this year’s draft, who they traded for a 2019 first-round pick to the Mavericks for Trae Young. The way that whole thing played out was… controversial.

This year, keep an eye out for Trae Young, who should at the very least be exciting to watch. 41-year old Vince Carter might well be in his final season on their bench. It’s very unlikely that the Hawks will find a lot of success this year, but even if Young and their youthful roster show signs of promise, it will be all the success the Hawks could really hope for. At least the expectations are low. 

***

**Boston Celtics**

**Hallmarks:** 17 NBA Championships, from ’57 through ’08; Bill Russell and Larry Bird.

**This Year:** ECF Contenders

The Boston Celtics are the most successful team in NBA history. They have won 23.9% of all NBA championships in history, and their leaders have won 10 MVPs. Since 1986, they have only managed to win one Championship, the 2008 title. The Celtics have made it to the last four straight playoffs – losing in the first round on ’15 and ’16, and losing in the Eastern Conference Finals to LeBron’s Cavaliers back-to-back in ’17 and ’18. Many commentators speculate that if their last season hadn’t been weakened by injuries to stars Gordon Hayward and superstar Point Guard Kyrie Irving, the Celtics could’ve beaten LeBron and gone to the Finals last year. This year, LeBron has moved to the West, and under the guidance of their incredibly talented coach Brad Stevens and assuming healthy years for their stars and continued growth for their young stars Tatum and Brown, the Celtics have the clearest path to the Finals of any team in the East.

This year, watch the Celtics as closely as any other team. If they stay healthy, the combined power of their all-star lineup, their incredibly deep bench, their all-NBA coach, and the weakened Eastern Conference should make them the clear favorites to face off against Golden State in the Finals. Whether they could beat them is an entirely different question.

***

**Brooklyn Nets**

**Hallmarks:** ABA Champions ’74, ’76, Eastern Conference Title ’02, ’03. Jason Kidd &amp; Dr. J.

**This Year:** Bottom 10

Formerly of New Jersey, the Nets were an ABA team that merged in 1976, bringing Julius Erving into the NBA as the reigning ABA Champs. Though the Nets had a strong streak in the early 00’s under the guidance of Jason Kidd, they never managed to secure an NBA title. Currently in a rebuilding process, they’ve let go of briefly-superstar Jeremy Lin and picked up the likes of Shabazz Napier and Ed Davis from the Blazers on short contracts. It’s been rough going for the Nets, who foolishly gave away their own first-rounders for three straight years, and at last, now, the light might be beginning to peak over the horizon. They have a lot of money in their pockets (and will have even more after this season), and their Brooklyn home attracts superstars far more than a team of their stature normally could. Finally under strong, smart leadership, though the Nets are very unlikely to see any success this year, everything is set up for them to come into next season looking dramatically better.

This year, just enjoy watching some of their young players and one-year contracts, hope for some fun games, and desperately try to make yourselves look like the kind of team that a superstar will want to come to next season.

***

**Charlotte Hornets**

**Hallmarks:** Alonzo Mourning in the early 90’s

**This Year:** Middle-of-the-Pack

The Charlotte Hornets joined as an expansion team in 1988, then moved to New Orleans and became the New Orleans Hornets. Then in 2004, another expansion team started in Charlotte – the Bobcats – until the New Orleans Hornets renamed themselves the Pelicans in 2013, after which the Charlotte Bobcats became the Charlotte Hornets again.
Did you catch all that?

TL;DR the Charlotte Hornets organization as we know it today has only existed since 2004, but they own the rights to the history of the Hornets team from 1988 until 2002 when it moved to New Orleans. So, while the early-90’s Mourning/Johnsons/Curry-era Hornets were a pretty good team… they really have nothing to do with the current Hornets organization. Today’s Hornets, owned by Michael Jordan since 2010, have made three playoffs – each time losing in the first round – and have finished the last two seasons with identical 36-46 records. They are the definition of mediocrity – good enough, maybe, to crack one of the lowest playoff seeds in a year when the conference is weak, but never good enough to do anything with it, and never bad enough to secure a #1 draft pick.

This year, expect much of the same thing. Kemba Walker is talented and entertaining, and this could be his last year in Charlotte. Spurs vet Tony Parker is here to provide guidance and support if things get too dark. You might get to see the first round of the playoffs. Or next year might be the start of a true tanking. It’s all up in the air for the Hornets.

***

**Chicago Bulls**

**Hallmarks:** Michael Jordan and the two 90’s threepeats; the brief spark of light that was Derrick Rose.

**This Year:** Middle-of-the-Pack

The Bulls were a mediocre team until they were the greatest team. Jordan won them their only 6 conference titles and their only 6 championships. Since then, mediocrity has returned to Chicago. Derrick Rose’s ’10-’11 bizzaro-world MVP made it seem like the Bulls might have had another Jordan on their hands, but alas, things are not always as they seem. The Bulls in recent years have been back down toward the bottom of the league, but with rebuilding thoroughly underway and a young and promising roster, it’s not all frowns for the Windy City. LaVine and Markkanen both look very promising (Lauri’s injury was announced as I was typing this – my bad, Chicago), and their draft pick Wendell Carter Jr. is poised to be one of the most exciting rookies to watch this year. It’s not impossible that this is the year the Bulls’ fall comes to a halt and they start turning the plane around and squeeze into the 8th Seed. But it’s also not impossible that the pieces just aren’t in place yet.

This year, watch their young players putting on a fast, exciting show – particularly Wendell Carter Jr., who’s poised to be a Rookie of the Year candidate if anyone is.

**Cleveland Cavaliers**

**Hallmarks:** LeBron James, and then again, LeBron James; Incredible 2016 Championship

**This Year:** Middle-of-the-Pack

The Cavaliers joined the league in 1970 and lost the first 15 games they ever played. They made the ECF in 1976, and it was all downhill from there. The Cavaliers were a mediocre-to-bad team until they drafted a kid from Akron named LeBron James, and even in his first few years, they struggled. He got them to one Finals in 2007, but it otherwise took him until his 13th season to manage a Championship in Cleveland. It’s hard to win there. It’s always been hard to win there. And now that the King is gone… there’s no reason to think it’s gotten anything but much harder again. Were the Cavaliers really a bad team that just had the greatest player in the world on their roster last year, or do they, now led by Kevin Love, actually have a real team on their hands?

This year, the Cavaliers will be one of the biggest questions, and one of the most-watched and curious teams in the league. For all we know, Love is going to carry the Cavaliers to some amount of success and even crack the playoffs. If the Cavaliers made the 6th Seed, even, I don’t think we’d be shocked. And if they were one of the 5 worst teams in the NBA, we wouldn’t be shocked either. It’s going to be interesting, that’s for sure.

**Dallas Mavericks**

**Hallmarks:** Jason Kidd and Steve Nash (neither in their prime), Dirk Nowitzki; 2011 NBA Championship

**This Year:** Bottom 10

The Mavericks joined the NBA in 1980 and had bad luck, drafting quality players like Detlef Schrempf (no, I didn’t just make that name up) and Mark Aguirre only to see them reach their potential once they were no longer on their roster. They drafted Jason Kidd, who had two separate tenures on the team, but who saw his best years – again – while not playing for the Mavs. Their franchise’s true hero is German-born three-point-shooting-Center Dirk Nowitzki, a strange player with a strange life who took the NBA by absolute storm for a few years and won them their sole NBA Title. That 2011 Championship, as the years go on and every title since has been won by either LeBron or Golden State, is looking increasingly prestigious and remarkable. This offseason, they traded for #3-but-projected-by-many-#1 draft pick Luka Doncic, who has just come off from winning virtually everything you can win in professional European basketball at the ripe age of 19. In what is likely Dirk’s last year, the team’s hopes rest on his shoulders – but you couldn’t ask for better shoulders to rest your hopes on.

This year, watch Luka. The Mavs are unlikely to see a lot of success – the team just doesn’t have enough talent in enough places – but it’s not an uncommon opinion to project that Luka Doncic is going to do things that very few NBA rookies have ever done before. He has played and succeeded at very high levels of professional basketball, playing with and against adults and veterans. He’s no high schooler or even an NCAA senior. He’s a whole different monster.

Dinhgi,2018-09-26 10:42:34+00:00,Payment of a US hospital bill as a german citizen,"Hello r/personalfinace community,

My father, who has a german citizenship, went a personal trip to Los Angeles, CA just a few weeks ago. On the day of his flight back to Germany he suddenly went very sick. It turned out that he had a stroke which left his right arm and his right leg weakened. He cannot stand without held and has to rely on a wheelchair since then. Also he had to stay in the hospital for further check-ups. That happened on September 24th. 

Today he was released from the hospital with a bill of 50.000 USD. He has a general insurance in Germany but not a foreign health insurance (which is ridiculous 20 Euro/year). It was my fault not to get him an additional insurance just because i didn't know it existed. The bill will be paid by a friend but that puts us in a huge guilt and in a big debt for that friend. 

I talked with the insurance here in Germany but they said that they could not help us now because it cannot be paid in arrears (retroactive) anymore. The hospital will give him the papers and results about his stroke. 

Is there a way for a foreign citizen who had to hospitalised into an US hospital to pay off the bill? 

I would be glad for every suggestion from you guys!

InMyBrokenChair,2018-09-16 01:27:27+00:00,(OC) What if the NBA eliminated the last-place franchise after each season?,"What could raise the stakes (and lower the incentive for tanking) more than the threat of a team’s complete deletion from existence? In this alternate reality, the NBA removes the franchise that comes in last each season. This means the league continuously shrinks until there is just one team left.

In order to find that one team, we’ll say that this system started 29 seasons ago (as there are 30 teams). We’ll use their real-world records to determine who the eliminated franchise is.

Now, ideally, I’d only look at the games that non-eliminated teams played against each other. However, it’s incredibly difficult to sift through, say, 20 teams’ schedules to look for their records against *each other* by removing their results against the 10 teams that no longer exist. I have no idea how to do that efficiently. Instead, I will use their full, real-world, 82-game records for the first 20 seasons. Then, when there are just 10 teams left, I will only use their records *against each other* as if they were the only teams in the league.

The NBA championship is not changed by any team’s elimination. **The Pistons win the championship by defeating the Trail Blazers in the Finals.**

**1990-91 (Year Two):** The Denver Nuggets come in last place in the league at 20-62. **The Nuggets are permanently removed from the NBA.** The NBA championship is not changed by any team’s elimination. **The Bulls win the championship by defeating the Lakers in the Finals.**

**1991-92 (Year Three):** The Minnesota Timberwolves come in last place in the league at 15-67. **The Timberwolves are permanently removed from the NBA.** The NBA championship is not changed by any team’s elimination. **The Bulls win the championship by defeating the Trail Blazers in the Finals.**

**1992-93 (Year Four):** The Dallas Mavericks come in last place in the league at 11-71. **The Mavericks are permanently removed from the NBA.** The NBA championship is not changed by any team’s elimination. **The Bulls win the championship by defeating the Suns in the Finals.**

**1993-94 (Year Five):** The Detroit Pistons and Milwaukee Bucks tie for last place in the league at 20-62. (There are worse teams in the real world, but they have already been eliminated in this universe—this will become increasingly common and I won’t note it from this point forward.) Because the Bucks won 4 of 5 games against the Pistons, **the Pistons are permanently removed from the NBA.** The NBA championship is not changed by any team’s elimination. **The Rockets win the championship by defeating the Knicks in the Finals.**

**1994-95 (Year Six):** The Los Angeles Clippers come in last place in the league at 17-65. **The Clippers are permanently removed from the NBA.** The NBA championship is not changed by any team’s elimination. **The Rockets win the championship by defeating the Magic in the Finals.**

**1995-96 (Year Seven):** For some reason, the NBA decides to add two new teams in the middle of deleting all of their franchises. The Vancouver Grizzlies, one of the new teams, comes in last place at 15-67. **After just one season of existence, the Grizzlies are permanently removed from the NBA.** The NBA championship is not changed by any team’s elimination. **The Bulls win the championship by defeating some team I’ve never heard of in the Finals.**

**1996-97 (Year Eight):** The NBA’s most storied franchise, the Boston Celtics, fall to last place in the league at 15-67. After fifty years and sixteen championships, **the Celtics are permanently removed from the NBA.** The NBA championship is not changed by any team’s elimination. **The Bulls win the championship by defeating the Jazz the Finals.**

**1997-98 (Year Nine):** After just three seasons of existence, the Toronto Raptors come in last place in the NBA at 16-66. **The Toronto Raptors are permanently removed from the NBA. The NBA spent just three seasons in Canada.** The NBA championship is not changed by any team’s elimination. **The Bulls “win” the championship by “defeating” the Jazz the Finals (I won’t be silent. Just saw it live sry.)**

**1998-99 (Year Ten):** Just one season removed from the referees handing them their sixth championship in eight years, the Chicago Bulls come in last place in the NBA at 13-37. The franchise literally could not survive without Michael Jordan. **The Bulls are permanently removed from the NBA.** The NBA championship is not changed by any team’s elimination. **The Spurs win the championship by defeating the Knicks in the Finals.**

**1999-00 (Year Eleven):** The Golden State Warriors come in last place in the NBA at 19-63. Nobody knows it at the time, but the league has been saved. **The Warriors are permanently removed from the NBA.** The NBA championship is not changed by any team’s elimination. **The Lakers win the championship by defeating the Pacers in the Finals.**

**2000-01 (Year Twelve):** The Washington Wizards come in last place in the NBA at 19-63. They unknowingly save Michael Jordan’s legacy by preventing his comeback. **The Wizards are permanently removed from the NBA.** The NBA championship is not changed by any team’s elimination. **The Lakers win the championship by defeating the 76ers in the Finals.**

**2001-02 (Year Thirteen):** The Houston Rockets come in last place in the NBA at 28-54. The world is much better because of it. **The Rockets are permanently removed from the NBA.** The NBA champion is not changed by any team’s elimination, but the Eastern Conference champion is. In the real world, the Nets won the East. However, since they don’t exist, that title goes to the non-eliminated Eastern team that went farthest in the playoffs that year: the Charlotte Hornets. **The Lakers win the championship by defeating the *Hornets* in the Finals.** Ashamed by their loss, the Hornets immediately move to New Orleans.

**2002-03 (Year Fourteen):** The Cleveland Cavaliers come in last place in the NBA at 17-65. In response, an eighteen year-old LeBron James announces he will be taking his talents to the Guangdong Southern Tigers of the Chinese Basketball Association. He promises to win one for the ‘Dong. **The Cavaliers are permanently removed from the NBA.** Again, since the Nets don’t exist, the new East champion is the team that went the farthest in the real world. **The Spurs win the championship by defeating the *76ers* in the Finals.**

**2003-2004 (Year Fifteen):** The Orlando Magic come in last place in the NBA at 21-61. **The Magic are permanently removed from the NBA.** For the first time, a real-world NBA champion has already been eliminated from existence. That means the championship goes to the runner-up, and the longest-surviving East team wins their conference championship. **The *Lakers* win the championship by defeating the *Pacers* in the Finals.** No one makes fun of Karl Malone for being ringless anymore.

**2004-05 (Year Sixteen):** The Atlanta Hawks come in last place in the NBA at 13-69. **The Hawks are permanently removed from the NBA.** The East champion is changed. **The Spurs win the championship by defeating the *Heat* in the Finals.**

**2005-06 (Year Seventeen):** The Portland Trail Blazers come in last place in the NBA at 21-61. **The Trail Blazers are permanently removed from the NBA.** The West champion is changed. **The Heat win the championship by defeating the *Suns* in the hottest Finals on record.**

**2006-07 (Year Eighteen):** The Milwaukee Bucks come in last place in the NBA at 28-54. People everywhere wonder how they lasted this long. **The Bucks are permanently removed from the NBA.** The East champion is changed. **The Spurs win the championship by defeating the *Heat* in the Finals for the second time in three years.** (Interestingly, the Heat were swept in the first round in the real world. Every other East playoff team had already been eliminated.)

**2007-08 (Year Nineteen):** One year after making it to the NBA Finals, the Miami Heat come in last place in the NBA at 15-67. **The Heat are permanently removed from the NBA.** The NBA champion is changed to the real-world runner-up. **The *Lakers* win the championship by defeating the *76ers* in the Finals.** (The 76ers went 40-42, but were the only non-eliminated Eastern playoff team.)

**2008-09 (Year Twenty):** The Sacramento Kings come in last place in the NBA at 17-65. **The Kings are permanently removed from the NBA.** The East champion is changed. **The Lakers win the championship by defeating the *76ers* in the Finals for the second consecutive year.** (The 76ers were 41-41, but they again were the only East playoff team that hadn’t been eliminated.)

**2009-10 (Year Twenty-One):** For the first time, /u/InMyBrokenChair is willing to take the time to count up the existing teams’ records **solely against each other.** The Philadelphia 76ers, one year removed from being back-to-back Eastern champions, come in last in the NBA at 6-18 against the other existing teams. **The 76ers are permanently removed from the NBA.** Again, the East champion is changed. **The Lakers win the championship by defeating the *Bobcats* in the Finals.** Yes, the Bobcats. No, that’s not a mistake. It was either them, the Knicks, or the Pacers in the East, and the Bobcats made the playoffs while the others didn’t.

**2010-11 (Year Twenty-Two):** The Charlotte Bobcats, one year removed from an Eastern Conference championship, come in last place in the nine-team NBA at 4-15. **The Bobcats are permanently removed from the NBA. The Charlotte Hornets never return.** Both conference champions must be changed to the longest-lasting non-eliminated team. The team that made it farthest in the real world is declared the champion. **The *Thunder* win the championship by defeating the *Pacers* in the Finals.** The Pacers win the East because, in the real world, they won one playoff game while the Knicks got swept.

**2011-12 (Year Twenty-Three):** The New Orleans Hornets come in last place in the eight-team NBA at 4-16. **The Hornets are permanently removed from the NBA. The Pelicans never come into existence.** The East champion is changed, and the Finals runner-up becomes the champion. **The *Thunder* win the championship by defeating the *Pacers* in the Finals for the second consecutive year.**

**2012-13 (Year Twenty-Four):** The Phoenix Suns come in last place in the seven-team NBA at 4-15. **The Suns are permanently removed from the NBA.** The East champion is changed and the Finals runner-up becomes the champion. **The *Spurs* win the championship by defeating the *Pacers* in the Finals.**

**2013-14 (Year Twenty-Five):** The Utah Jazz come in last place in the six-team NBA at 3-13. **The Jazz are permanently removed from the NBA.** The East champion is changed. **The Spurs win the championship by defeating the *Pacers* in the Finals once again.** The Pacers are now the Buffalo Bills of the NBA, losing four consecutive Finals.

**2014-15 (Year Twenty-Six):** The Los Angeles Lakers come in last place in the five-team NBA at 3-10. Things are good. **The Lakers are permanently removed from the NBA.** Both conference champions must be changed to the longest-lasting (or best) non-eliminated team. The team that made it farthest in the real world is declared the champion. **The *Spurs* win the championship by defeating the *Pacers* for the third consecutive year.** The Pacers have lost five consecutive Finals. They didn’t even make the playoffs in the real world, but won the East because the Knicks went 17-65.

**2015-16 (Year Twenty-Seven):** The New York Knicks come in last place in the four-team NBA at 1-6. They spent six seasons in a two-team Eastern Conference, but didn’t manage to win it once. They didn’t gain any championships or extra conference titles out of this entire experiment. It’s somewhat of an accomplishment to make it this far, but it doesn’t really get more hollow than this, Knicks fans. **The Knicks are permanently removed from the NBA.** **The *Thunder* win the championship by defeating the *Pacers* in the Finals.** That’s six straight, Indiana.

**2016-17 (Year Twenty-Eight):** The Oklahoma City Thunder, one year after winning their third championship in six years, come in last place in the three-team NBA at 1-5. **The Thunder are permanently removed from the NBA, and the league is down to two teams.** **Those teams face each other in the Finals, where the *Spurs* yet again defeat the Pacers.** Seven straight.

**2017-18 (Year Twenty-Nine):** Two teams left. The San Antonio and the Indiana Pacers. The Spurs have won eight championships over the last twenty-eight years, four of which were against the Pacers. They play just two games against each other to decide the last team standing. [The first game is a thriller in Indianapolis. The Spurs are up by two in the final minute, but Victor Oladipo drains a three with ten seconds left to put the Pacers ahead. The Pacers hang on to win by three.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/pbp/201710290IND.html) The second game is a bit less exciting. [After a strong third quarter in San Antonio, the Pacers are able to hold off the Spurs to sweep the season series.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/pbp/201801210SAS.html) That means two things: **The San Antonio Spurs are permanently removed from the NBA**, and… **THE INDIANA PACERS ARE THE SURVIVOR! THEY ARE THE LAST REMAINING NBA TEAM!**

---

So what changed in this world?

The Spurs and Thunder won an extra three championships and the Lakers won an extra two. The Pacers won the last one by default. Nobody else gained a championship. The old Charlotte Hornets won an Eastern Conference title then immediately left town never to return. The 76ers gained a fuckton of extra Eastern Conference championships. The Pacers lost seven consecutive Finals. Despite having a single-digit number of teams, this league doesn’t really have much less parity than the real NBA in the last few years. Somehow.

---

What can we learn from this experiment?

The Bucks know how to be bad for a long time while not being the absolute worst?

The Knicks can’t win the East even if there’s only one other team to compete with?

The Pacers have to be **literally the only team left in existence** in order to win an NBA championship?

/u/InMyBrokenChair has to get back to his schoolwork?

These are all valid points.

La2philly,2018-09-14 15:24:59+00:00,[OC] 3 Potential Underlying Causes of the NFL's ACL Problem,"Hey everyone, I’m back and on the latest edition I explore three potential underlying causes of one unfortunate reality that comes with the start of summer OTAs and camps, ACL tears.

You can find the original piece [here]( https://theinjuryinsight.com/3-potential-root-causes-nfl-acl-epidemic/) on my sports blog TheInjuryInsight.
______
A running back hoping to prove his value as a starter after years of being relegated to a “situational role” takes the hand-off in a seven-on-seven drill, and accelerates toward the “B” gap. At the last second he realizes that his offensive guard hasn’t released off the defensive tackle to get to the second level and close down on the inside linebacker.

“Well, not today bro” — the running back thinks as he instinctively sticks his leg into the ground to change direction and bounce outside…and then crumples to the ground clutching his knee.

https://imgur.com/9GP5hoK

He’s carted off the field, taken for an MRI and the worst fears are confirmed: an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) rupture.

All the hours he put in leading to this moment, finally on the cusp of breaking into a starting role, hitting that lifelong goal, and now he’s faced with the spectre of a nine-month (on average) rehab process with side-to-side deficits potentially lasting two-plus years and increased risk for osteoarthritis in the knee.

To pour salt on the wound, the team could even drop him with limited ramifications (the NFL is built on non-guaranteed contracts) and move on to business as usual.

This scenario isn’t the latest script for a Lifetime movie—rather it’s what [happened to Jerick McKinnon](http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/24548405/jerick-mckinnon-san-francisco-49ers-knee-injury) of the San Francisco 49ers, and unfortunately, many more just like him. ACL tears have become a common reality for NFL players and hopefuls as they get back to OTAs and minicamps, known as [“phase 3”](https://247sports.com/nfl/dallas-cowboys/ContentGallery/NFL-offseason-FAQ-The-difference-between-OTAs-minicamp-more-118396909/#118396909_1) of the NFL offseason.

Over the past five years, there have been an [average of 23 ACL tears](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sports/profootballdoc/sd-sp-pfd-hunter-henry-acl-nfl-ota-0523-story.html) prior to Week 1 of the NFL regular season. In 2018, [that number stands at 22.](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/injuries.htm)

The majority of these ACL tears — nearly 73 percent according to a [recent study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29466019) — are non-contact injuries. Unlike a contact ACL injury where blunt force trauma to the knee or surrounding area stresses the ACL beyond its capacity, a non-contact ACL tear points to to some underlying cause(s).

After rummaging through numerous possibilities, three were bouncing around in their seats yelling, “Ooooo, pick me! Pick me!”

### 1 — Off-Season Training Quantity and Intensity

### 2 — Off-Season Training type

### 3 —Playing surface

Lets go through each in a little more detail:

### **1 — Training Quantity and Intensity**

In the off-season, NFL players and hopeful NFL players aren’t allowed to work out under team supervision. Rather, they’re working with trainers or on their own to get ready for OTAs and minicamp.

This opens up a whole can of possibilities as you have players who have grown accustomed to a set and segmented scheduled that are now left to their own devices.

As one retired NFL player put it:

&gt; “You wake up with nothing to do. You’ve spent months having a schedule, and now you have none.”

Naturally, this can lead to a lot of variability in training — from taking it easy and not training most of the summer to training and working hard every single day. [Extensive research](https://www.scienceforsport.com/acutechronic-workload-ratio/)shows that a specific ratio of training quantity and intensity optimally prepares the body for current and future activity.

This ratio is known as the “Acute-to-Chronic Workload Ratio.” The terms acute and chronic, in this formula, are defined as days of activity. Acute refers to activity over the past three days and chronic refers to activity over the past 21 days. The original ratio was seven days to the past 28 days, but further research showed the 3:21 ratio as being more reliable.

This ratio dissects whether the activity level in those past 21 days was appropriate in preparing for the current three days of training. Every activity on each of those days is given an arbitrary unit (AU) based on the rate of perceived exertion, aka RPE. This is a scale of 1–10 with 1 being “watching Netflix on a waterbed” and 10 being “I might die” multiplied by the number of minutes. Those units are then totaled up for that day.

So if you had a lifting session this morning for 90 minutes at an RPE of 6 and then cardiovascular training in the afternoon for 45 minutes at a RPE of 8, that would equal (90 x 6) + (45 x 8) or 900 AU for that day. These units are averaged for the acute (last three days) period and chronic (last 21 days) periods and then divided.

Taking that one step step further, lets say player “X” got a new contract last season and goes into the summer thinking “I’m set, I’m just gonna take it easy with my own workouts and then get into shape during OTAs and minicamp.” His workload ratio could look something like this:

https://imgur.com/8EYoaf6

Ideally, that number on the bottom corner (the acute to chronic workload ratio) should be between .8 and 1.3. If that ratio is lower than .8 or higher than 1.5, studies have found the risk of soft tissue injury goes up by over five times.

https://imgur.com/eYbyzkM

In this case, player “X” is woefully unprepared for OTAs and that creates a lot of risk.

I think most people understand that “doing too much too soon” and overloading/fatiguing the body may lead to injury. Whether they follow that advice is a different story, but not doing enough and under-preparing the body is potentially just as damaging.

That’s why if you’re injured and want to get back to your activity of choice, rest alone won’t cut it. You have to gradually increase your activity intensity and/or quantity or your body will be under prepared.

To further that point, harken back to Jerick McKinnon. He tore his ACL in a non-contact manner during the last play of his first practice after returning from a calf strain that kept him out most of the Niners preseason. Mere coincidence? I highly doubt it.

I’d wager that if we tracked his AU’s and acute to chronic workload ratio, he was in that “under-prepared” zone due to being limited by his calf strain.

The body needs to be prepared and loaded appropriately to be able to handle the rigors of that activity. In the same vein, it can’t be overloaded and fatigued. It needs to be just right — the Goldilocks effect.

https://imgur.com/Hl5qAmY

If the workload ratio of Los Angeles Chargers’ Hunter Henry, who [tore his ACL](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2750378-hunter-henry-ota-knee-injury-reportedly-diagnosed-as-season-ending-torn-acl) on the first day of OTAs, was out of whack as he transitioned from his summer programming to Chargers OTAs, that would increase his risk for increased soft tissue injury, which includes ligament injuries, five times.

Additionally, these acute to chronic ratios and risks may be compounded by the shortened amount of time NFL teams are allowed to spend with players. This may seem counterintuitive at first. NFL players having longer offseasons and less practice may mean more injury risk, and there’s a perfectly valid reason why.

By numerous accounts, the shorter amount of time for OTAs and minicamps has led to teams jumping in feet first with their players on day one rather than allowing for a gradual progression of activities.

Here’s how Dr. David Chao, aka ProFootballDoc, put it:

&gt; “Because of fewer practices, there are actually no walk-throughs. Everything is full speed, so everything puts the ACL at risk.”

I can understand the rationale from NFL coaches and staffs. They’re trying to install the same amount of information and habits in less time. That lends itself to cramming things in and jumping straight into high intensity practices.

You try telling this guy to ramp down practice intensity a little bit:
https://imgur.com/ZJcO56J

(Khalil Mack probably brought up acute to chronic workload ratios and that was the final straw)

For a player who isn’t prepared for that intensity or a player who is already fatigued, they’re at a higher risk for ACL rupture, so too little or too much training quantity and intensity is potential reason number one for the NFL’s barrage of non-contact ACL tears. Moving onto number two…

### 2 — Training Type

There are a multitude of ways for NFL players to train during the offseason: weightlifting, which itself can be divided into different categories such as strength or muscle growth, interval training, like sprints or circuit training, endurance, plyometric, ballistic, etc., etc.

However, one type of training program has repeatedly been shown in large-scale studies (click [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=15592608), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=11720295), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=24030303), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=18503876), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=29584523), or [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=27797732) for more info) to reduce ACL injury risk: neuromuscular training (NMT). The neuromuscular system is an unconscious feedback system through which muscles are timed and activated to optimize joint stability and promote efficient and effective movement.

https://imgur.com/2LOYhNt

If we think of the physical components of the body as the “hardware”, then the neuromuscular system is part of the “software”.

The foundation of optimizing this NMT software is exercises that involve unanticipated reactions and movement perturbations. This forces the neuromuscular system to react quickly and maintain joint stability.

Here’s a video with multiple examples:
https://youtu.be/XCvfIhequOc

This maintenance of joint stability by the neuromuscular system is critical for preventing ACL injuries because most non-contact ACL injuries happen during spontaneous cutting and changes in direction in which the knee drops into a valgus (inward) and internally rotated (rotated towards midline) position.

https://imgur.com/sSBuuec

If the knee continues to dive inward and rotate, there comes a point of no return where the ACL is placed under huge stress and ruptures:

https://imgur.com/rMuQo9n

Through NMT, the neuromuscular system can recognize that unstable joint position quicker (“Ah, $%&amp;! Red alert!”) and then activate the necessary muscles to bring that joint back into a better position.

For example, let’s say Titans’ safety Jonathan Cyprien, who tore his ACL during practice in early August, had focused more on NMT during his off-season programming. I have no idea whether he did or didn’t nor to what extent, but as he made a reactive cut during practice, and his knee dropped into an inward, high-risk position, his highly trained neuromuscular system would have recognized it quicker, got the knee joint out of danger and not allowed it to reach the point of “no return.”

In other words, NMT increases the margins for error during movement.

Based on some personal knowledge of NFL players’ offseason programs and what is available to the public (I’m the first to admit this is completely anecdotal evidence), NMT doesn’t seem to be that common.

There’s plenty of: 

https://twitter.com/twitter/statuses/1014435104997994498

and: https://twitter.com/twitter/statuses/1015780900892823552

or: https://www.instagram.com/p/BHiQiZlDETN/?utm_source=ig_embed

But I have a much harder time finding things like this: https://youtu.be/D_8ESddi3rI

From what I’ve seen and heard, Odell Beckham Jr. is a shining beacon on the hill when it comes to training variation and challenging multiple systems.

If players are in a program that utilizes NMT (neuromuscular training), the evidence shows that it needs to be done at least two times per week with appropriate progressions throughout the regiment to be be effective.

It’s a highly skilled level of training, and I’d wager a large number of NFL athletes aren’t aware of its benefits in their offseason training. As these players get back to spontaneous changes of direction during OTAs and minicamp, they’re at a comparatively higher risk for ACL injuries.

These first two underlying causes have focused on training, but the third and final possible reason for the NFL’s ACL problem takes a sudden, sharp left turn. Don’t worry, though. This piece did NMT training. ACLs are safe.

### 3 — Playing Surface

The more traction a playing surface has, the more likely a player is to suffer an ACL injury (click [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=16423913), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=15150050), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=12840631), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=26036677), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=20194954), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=22920310), and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=25164575) for more info).

Each time Los Angeles Rams’ defensive end Morgan Fox, who [tore his ACL ](http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000934414/article/rams-de-morgan-fox-suffers-torn-acl-in-practice)during the first week of OTAs, stuck his foot in the ground to make a cut or change direction on the drought-stricken, high-traction grass fields, that foot had a higher chance of getting caught in the ground and torque-ing the knee.

To that point, [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=9429878) has found that less than five percent of ACL injuries in football occurred on a wet (low-traction) surface, whereas dry, hot weather (high-traction) was [linked](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=10327970) with a higher rate of ACL injuries. Generally, cold weather has been [associated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=12840631) with lower rates of ankle and knee injuries, including ACL tears.

Think of this high versus low-traction situation like ski bindings going to work when a skier loses control.

https://imgur.com/GEpZeGe

High-traction conditions are akin to crashing and the bindings not freeing your foot (the foot getting stuck in the grass), whereas low-traction conditions are the same situation but with the bindings releasing your foot (the foot skids along the grass), like in the video you just saw. In the latter case, your foot and knee are clear from getting twisted.

NFL OTAs and minicamps take place in high-traction conditions — the dead heat of the summer with hot, dry conditions. Players are cutting and changing directions on high-traction surfaces, which opens them up to the risk of crashing with skis still attached to their feet.

So the next time you see a player slip on a cold, chilly surface or see a rainy-weather forecast as you make your last second fantasy changes— try thanking it instead of screaming expletives.

## All in All

When you combine all three factors — an inappropriate training quantity and intensity plus lack of neuromuscular reaction training plus a higher-traction surface, it might explain this trend of non-contact ACL ruptures.

A few of you may be wondering, “Well, what about knee braces? I’ve heard those can help.” There’s no evidence that knee bracing prevents ACL tears (click [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=17279043), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=3578630), and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=2372083) for more info). In fact, one [two-year study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=19827861) found that ACL injury rates were actually _higher_amongst players who wore a knee brace compared to those who didn’t.

We’ve come a long way in treating ACL injuries, and they aren’t a death knell by any means, but they still place a significant and possibly preventable physical and mental burden on the player. For those players just trying to make the team, preventing an ACL injury could mean the difference between a livelihood and foundation for their family (the minimum NFL salary is $450,000).

Although we’ll likely never know the definite root cause(s) of these non-contact ACL injuries during NFL OTAs, minicamps and training camps, I hope this piece shed some light on possible causes and ways to reduce ACL rupture rates. After all, the best injury is the one that never happens.

Sorry for formatting Im on mobile at the airport and my laptop is packed. Ive had a vacation planned for months and already got the time off months in advance. Everything going smoothly on my last day of work before I enjoy my 4 1/2 weeks vacation with my girlfriend in Sanfran and Los Angeles. As I was on break, a known mombie coworker of mine who is known for constantly asking days of for whatever inane thing her brat is doing or because the little shit has the sniffles. 

Anyways she approached me and started up some small talk, but I knew it would probably lead to talk about her brat since thats what *all* her conversations lead to, and she mentioned some soccer game he has tomorrow and asked me if I could cover her shift in the morning, well aware I wont be here for 3 weeks and also knows Im CF. Here's how the conversation went down

Mombie: yeah so *little shit* has a soccer game at 10 am tomorrow so I was wondering if you could cover for me

Me: Sorry Im leaving tonight for California

Mombie: man I wish I had the time to do whatever I want and have no responsibilities

Me: Yeah its great actually I get lots of sleep and have a great relationship with my girlfriend

Mombie with a self entitled look of shock: I cant belieeeeeeve this! Why cant you put off your stupid vacation just to help me out!? You have NO idea what its like to be a mooooooooooom!

Me: Well you selfishly breeding doesnt constitute an emergency for me, I said no and if you bring up the topic again I will go to *boss*

She stormed off and I got a quick bite to eat before my break was over and I thought that was that

However before my shift was over *boss* approached me. Now me and her are on great friend basis and she is also CF! She told me mombie went to her saying I was being selfish and that I called her a cunt and that she should have aborted. I laughed it off and said exactly what I said. She told me that mombie demanded I be forced to work tomorrow but she was told the same thing in nicer words. We shot the shit for a few more minutes before I clocked out and said goodbye to everyone. Also mombie has been known to ask for halloween off for the past 5 years to bring little shit, but *boss* told me she will deny her request this year (because she always asks the day before) because of how entitled and rude she acted towards me. 

Well thats all for me, I happily type this knowing mombie has to work tomorrow and miss out on her little brat kicking a soccer ball around while all the other soccer moms scream at the coach for their brats losing and then ranting about how Im selfish for not letting her entitled breeder ass trying to ruin my vacation while me and my girlfriend happily explore the gay parts of California and go to Disney Land on a tuesday where there wont be that much crotchfruit since school is back

La2philly,2018-09-07 14:44:15+00:00,[OC] Why Nabil Fekir's Right Knee Scared Liverpool Off,"Hey everyone, I wrote this in-depth look at the failed transfer saga of Nabil Fekir and what about his right knee scared Liverpool away.

For reference, I'm a doctor of physical therapy who runs my own clinic and athletic development program in West Los Angeles.

You can find [the original](https://theinjuryinsight.com/nabil-fekir-right-knee-concerns/) on my sports blog [TheInjuryInsight](https://theinjuryinsight.com/).  Feel free to leave comments/questions.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Nabil Fekir was [expected to move to Liverpool over the summer for 52.8m pounds with a 5 year contract agreed](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/nabil-fekir-transfer-liverpool-shrouded-14763471) upon prior to joining up with the French National team for the World cup (spoiler alert: they did well). However, during his physical in June Liverpool’s medical staff[ found some warning signs](https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/19/nabil-fekir-hits-back-liverpool-failed-medical-7642694/) that indicated “increased wear on his cartilage” in his injury plagued right knee, concerning enough that they sought a [second medical opinion](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/nabil-fekir-transfer-liverpool-shrouded-14763471) in July.  After that 2nd opinion, Liverpool [tried to re-negotiate for a lower fee but the transfer fell through](https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/19/nabil-fekir-hits-back-liverpool-failed-medical-7642694/).

The entire saga left Nabil Fekir looking at Liverpool like:

&amp;#x200B;

![gif](gsneql74vtk11 ""This ep gets me every damn time."")

In this piece, I’ll delve into why this increased wear in the right knee cartilage of Nabil Fekir triggered Liverpool’s concerns, how he got to that point, and what it means for Nabil Fekir going forward.

Lets start at the beginning of his right knee injury history…

# I. 2015/16: Nabil Fekir ACL Rupture

Early into September of 2015, Nabil Fekir ruptured his right ACL (anterior collateral ligament) during an [international match against Portugal](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2561386-nabil-fekir-injury-updates-on-lyon-midfielders-knee-and-return).

ACL stands stands for “anterior cruciate ligament” and is a major stabilizer in your knee during any forwards, backwards, or rotational movement.  Think of it like a rubber band that connects your thigh bone (femur) to your shin bone (tibia) and keeps the knee joint from moving outside its intended normal range of motion.

Here’s what the ACL anatomy looks: 

![img](apfz39t9vtk11)

Nabil Fekir underwent surgery to repair the torn ACL, often termed an “ACL reconstruction”. Check out this work-safe video of an ACL reconstruction: 

[https://youtu.be/w8qud2qu2Jw](https://youtu.be/w8qud2qu2Jw)

[There’s been some concern](https://www.rousingthekop.com/2018/06/10/why-fekir-deal-fell-through/) that the type of graft used for Nabil Fekir (the surgeon used an allograft which is tissue taken from a cadaver) opened him up to increased risk for subsequent problems or re-injury. This is in contrast to an autograft which is taken from the person’s own body (most commonly from the patellar tendon or hamstring).

Although allografts are typically used in middle-aged athletes who engage in low-impact sports, they [have not been found to be inferior](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=20051509) to autografts. In fact, no particular graft has proven superior or clearly demonstrated superior functional outcomes (click [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=17308473), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=16012491), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=20051509), and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=25514139) for more info).

What’s far more concerning to me was how quickly Nabil Fekir returned to play.  He came back in early April 2016, after missing 39 games for Lyon – a mere 7 months after his injury.  That’s [nearly 3 months quicker than the average](http://submissions.mirasmart.com/Verify/AAOS2018/Submission/out/AAOS2018-002130.PDF) for professional soccer players after ACL injury.

It’s certainly possible that Nabil Fekir is an outlier, recovered much quicker, and got back earlier.  That does happen.

However, [evidence shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=16084292) that early participation and accelerated ACL protocols do carry some risks. Athletes in accelerated rehab programs may have ongoing abnormal motion and relative weakness for up to 22 months following surgery, in addition to an increased risk for knee osteoarthritis (click [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=16084292) and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=26608134) for more info).

This is in addition to key inherent risks after ACL injury, regardless of how quickly or slowly you return.

These include, first and foremost, [nearly a 25 percent chance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=27215935) of re-rupturing the same ACL after surgical repair . It’s no coincidence that [prior ACL injury is the best predictor for future ACL injury](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=27215935).

Secondly, the risk of rupturing the other side (“contralateral”) ACL after surgical repair is [upwards of 20.5 percent!](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=27215935)  Bio-mechanics, proprioception, and compensation are a love-hate relationship.

Lastly, there’s evidence of side-to-side deficits potentially lasting two-plus years and asymmetry [has been associated](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/important-muscular-symmetry-strength-sports/) with an increase in injury risk for high speed and cutting sports like soccer.

However, the overall outcomes on ACL repair in elite athletes is pretty dang good.  [Recent high level evidence on return to sport after ACL surgery](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2017/02/22/bjsports-2016-096836) has shown that nearly 83% of elite athletes return to sport following an ACL surgery and most performed comparably to non-injured counterparts.

Regardless, Nabil Fekir did come back and that right knee continued to give him some problems…

# II. 2016 and 2018 Right Knee Injuries

In late August 2016, Nabil Fekir suffered an undisclosed injury to his right knee during Lyon’s 4- 2 defeat vs Dijon. What we do know is that this injury [required an operation](http://www.beinsports.com/us/soccer/news/lyon-confirm-nabil-fekir-to-undergo-knee-oper/326178) and Nabil Fekir missed 23 days and 3 games for Lyon.

He was able to [play through the rest of the season without incident](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/truth-nabil-fekirs-injury-record-12672684) and he played quite well, making 49 appearances in all competitions for Lyon with a stat line of 14 goals and 12 assists for the season.

During the following 2017-2018 season, Nabil Fekir was able to make it through unscathed until he suffered a [“knee contusion” in late February](https://www.transfermarkt.com/nabil-fekir/verletzungen/spieler/203496).  This caused him to miss 35 days and 7 games, returning early in April.

Based on the time missed, this “knee contusion” was very likely a bone bruise:

&amp;#x200B;

![img](0pfw7sthvtk11)

For more on what a bone bruise is, check out [this piece.](https://theinjuryinsight.com/igoudala-lateral-leg-bone-bruise/)

In a vacuum, these injuries aren’t a big deal.  However, in conjunction with his previous ACL tear, these are two additional insults that may have exacerbated ongoing changes in his mechanics, tissue quality, and loading at the right knee joint.

These changes very likely contributed to the problem that led to Liverpool re-considering their initial bid…

# III. 2018 Failed Transfer: Worn Out Right Knee Cartilage

The inflection point in the Nabil Fekir transfer saga were the results of his MRI.  L’Equipe had a physician on record who stated:

&gt;“In this case, what poses a problem no doubt, is the wear of cartilage.

So what exactly does that mean?  Lets start with some anatomy

## A. The Knee Joint

The knee joint is comprised of the upper leg bone (femur), the shin bone (tibia), the patella (kneecap), and two types of cartilage (articular cartilage and the meniscus).  Take a look:

&amp;#x200B;

![img](lm8u8rtlvtk11)

Generally, cartilage serves to reduce friction and dampen force. The first type, articular cartilage, covers the ends of the femur (thigh bone) and tibia (shin bone) and the inside of the patella (kneecap). The second type of cartilage, the meniscus, is a dual-crescent shaped pad that sits between the femur and tibia:

&amp;#x200B;

![img](mpmff2ipvtk11)

Knee cartilage has normal age related changes due to the constant loading that it endures. That’s perfectly normal. I wager that if you took an MRI of most active individuals over the age of 25, you could find some meniscal wearing.

However, the concerns and doubts creep up when you see an increased rate of degeneration on that cartilage which can lead to….

## B. Knee Arthritis

When the articular cartilage and/or meniscus have deteriorated to a certain extent, the knee is considered to have “mild arthritis”.

I like to think of the knee cartilage like a shoe insole and knee loading like taking a step.  Normally, the force from taking a step is distributed evenly across the cushioned insole of your shoe. However, if you start to walk differently (lets say you start to favor the inside of your foot, for whatever reason), then the inner part of the insole is going to wear out much quicker.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](frjxns8svtk11)

It’s the same concept for the knee cartilage.  Repetitive force on the same spot leads to increased wearing out of the cartilage on that spot.

It’s very likely that the ACL rupture in 2016 was the root cause for Nabil Fekir developing this “worn out cartilage” in his right knee.  There are two main purported reasons:

1. The traumatic impact to the knee during the initial ACL rupture initiates a chemical degeneration process of the knee cartilage (click [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9397261), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22886741), and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12649034) for more info).
2. An ACL injury, even after it’s been repaired and the ligament is providing optimal stability, can change the mechanics and loading patterns at the knee. This results in accelerated wear and tear and irreversible changes on the knee cartilage (click [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19097796), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26320976), and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15701610) for more info).

Combine that with other potential risk factors:

* Accelerated return from ACL rupture in 2016
* Two other injuries to that same knee
* Repetitive and constant loading at the knee (running, jumping, cutting, kicking, etc etc)

And that’s a recipe for developing mild arthritis early on in your career.

Further, that mild arthritis can gradually evolve into moderate and severe arthritis where the bones are actually rubbing against each other, this is called osteoarthritis (OA).

Here’s an anatomical representation: 

![img](ob03xdkuvtk11)

And what it looks like on x-ray (notice the decreased space and side to side asymmetry):

![img](0g57kv8wvtk11)

When the Liverpool medical staff saw that worn out knee cartilage, it tilted their risk/reward calculation.  Here’s what the physician had to say:

&gt;It’s a risk factor. It can cause pain, functional issues and eventually a lesser resistance to impacts.”

Based on that new medical concern, it makes sense that Liverpool’s valuation changed,  especially for a player they would be investing a huge sum and 5 years into.

Additionally, there are long-term ramifications that Liverpool had taken into account as well…

# IV. Long-Term Ramifications

The research shows some potentially serious long-term consequences after ACL surgery.  These include:

* [Higher overall degeneration rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7810787) of knee cartilage
* Nearly a [3.6x increase](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24214929) in developing osteoarthritis (OA), compared to an uninjured knee.  However, not getting an ACL repair leads to a [4.98x increase](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24214929) in developing OA.
* OA risk is even higher when the original ACL rupture also involves damage to the knee cartilage. Research shows anywhere from an [18%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20713644) to [48%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19567666) increase in osteoarthritis (OA) risk with this combined injury compared to only an ACL rupture.

Those are in addition to the ACL re-injury rates that I listed back in section I.

Obviously Liverpool already knew Nabil Fekir had an ACL rupture and understood those risks but they are just probabilities, not certainties. However, when they saw the MRI and the overt evidence of increased degeneration of knee cartilage, it set off alarm bells and eventually led to the failed re-negotiation.

In the midst of all this, you have a player in Nabil Fekir who was really looking forward to a move to Liverpool and now has to deal with disappointment. However, not all hope is lost.

# V. The Future of Nabil Fekir

Obviously his injury history and increased rate of right knee cartilage degeneration isn’t ideal but it’s not a death knell. Rather, it’s a sign that he has to be extra proactive and disciplined in taking care of his right knee and overall physical and mental fitness.

His keys for preventing knee pain and symptoms will be:

1. Muscular strength and endurance.  Muscles are the body’s shock absorbers so the stronger and more endurance they have, the less force goes into the knee joint.
2. Neuromuscular control which is akin to the “software” that controls the physical “hardware”.  It consists of the proprioceptive and vestibular systems which are unconscious feedback systems that inform the brain of where the body is in space (joint positioning for example) and help activate the appropriate muscles.  The more they’re trained and finely tuned, the more stable and safe the knee joint becomes.

![img](pkwpkc21wtk11)

Nabil Fekir has [explicitly mentioned](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-target-fekir-injury-history-14764186) the level of diligence he puts into reinforcing the right knee.

However, building muscle strength and training the proprioceptive and vestibular systems around the knee after an ACL rupture can be an uphill battle.  [Research shows](https://journals.humankinetics.com/doi/abs/10.1123/jsr.9.2.135) that an ACL rupture causes long-term weakness in key knee muscles, specifically the quads, and decreased proprioception around the knee joint due to something called “[arthrogenic muscle inhibiton](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4271337/)” in which pain and swelling in the knee joint actually impair muscle activation.

I wouldn’t be surprised if Nabil Fekir does miss games here and there (barring overt injury) due to increased inflammation and irritation in that knee joint. There’s the possibility he eventually looks into [cartilage restoration procedures](https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/treatment/articular-cartilage-restoration/) like [matrix assisted autologous chrondocyte implantation](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0363546512463675) or [microfracture.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5808973/)

Regardless, that right knee will have to be managed methodically and astutely.

If he’s able to do so and able to avoid additional serious injuries to his right knee while keeping his mindset positive and resilient and continuing to work extremely diligently on his right knee muscle strength/endurance, sensory systems, and overall fitness, it’s definitely possible that he has an extended career in Europe and at some point does make that fated trip to Anfield to never walk alone.

Anamcara69,2018-09-03 06:32:07+00:00,You probably don't remember me,"39 years ago I was that 10 year old girl who asked if I could sit with you on the deck of a fancy restaurant in LA.  Inside my mother was drunk, again. She was in bad shape, putting cigarettes out in her wine glass and drinking it, falling down when attempting to get up and clearly a beautiful mess. Her date had that familiar look of luck mixed with confusion about what to do with me. 

I had to get away from that table and the deck seemed like the place to be. A crowd of happy people talking and some dancing. You were pretty with blond hair and you had kind eyes, and you were alone. When I asked If I could sit with you, there was no hesitation in your ""yes"" and I appreciated it more than you know.  I cried my eyes out at your table and you let me get my self together with understanding and kindness. 

I realized later that you May have been there looking to meet some friends or even a date. Instead it was me who you shared two hours of your time.  In those two hours I could relax and talk about school and even confided about My father and his wife and about how I didn't belong anywhere. You told me it wouldn't alwAys be so hard, and you truly meant it.  You had no idea that it would get much worse but for that time it was nice to have hope. My mother ended up drinking herself to an early death and my father remains wrapped up with his narcissistic wife.  We don't talk. 

I have a 15 year old daughter and though I am not perfect, I  don't drink.  You were so nice to me and I sometimes wonder if you were even human or real.  I hope you realize what you did for me that night and I am sorry for getting in the way of you having a fun night. I really don't know what I would have done rethought you there. I was seriously contemplating just walking away from that place and never looking back. Los Angeles isn't so broken kid friendly so you May have saved my life. My mother wouldn't have tried to find me.  So just wanted to say thank you for being there for me.",UnsentLetters,1385

I just got this email from Riot about increased security! I'm thrilled that they are taking the right steps to increase security for everyone involved.

""Hi -,

Thank you for being a fan of the NA LCS and for planning your visit to our studio in West LA to watch and cheer for your favorite teams live! Our show thrives on the energy, enthusiasm, and fandom of our attendees, and we thank you for your attendance and excitement. The NA LCS Events team would like to update you with a few adjustments to our security policy of which we'd like you to be mindful. If you have any follow-up questions after reading the above, please reach out to Tickets@RiotGames.com and someone from our team will respond as soon as possible.

Changes You'll See Throughout 2018

Beginning with Semifinals on Saturday, 9/1, and continuing through Regional Qualifiers 2018, the following augmentations will be made to our home studio security protocol: 
All fans and guests in attendance, professional players, production crew, contractors, and Riot staff will be screened through metal detection and thorough bag search. No exceptions. If you are on NA LCS property, you will be screened. 
No backpacks will be allowed on NA LCS property unless you are an employee, in which case your bag will be thoroughly searched. While in the past we've allowed attendees and guests to bring in backpacks to help carry their merch, electronics, and personal items, we are deciding to limit bag size to 9"" x 6"" x 3"". This means small purses and clutch bags will be allowed for personal items, but they will be thoroughly searched. Prepare to step to the side and have your bag screened separately if you wish to bring a purse, clutch, or small bag. This is being done to eliminate the risk of any concealed weapons being brought onto our premises. For the comfort of our guests we will have female security officers present in addition to male officers to complete these bag searches. 
Meet the Pros will no longer take place outside. While we are still coordinating how we may present this experience to our fans over the next season, we have to weigh the security of our pros against the possibility of physical threat. Meet the Pros will now be held inside the Battle Arena after the matches wrap, with security officers present and within arms' reach of the pros at all times. Also, Meet the Pros will also be voluntary for teams, meaning we can no longer assure the attendance of every competing team on every game day. We are aware that this is the highlight of many fans' visits to NA LCS Studios, however, we believe the best course of action to be in securing the space and allowing teams to decide their participation.
Similarly, Winners' Walk High-Fives will be optional for teams. Player Management will be presenting the option of Winners' Walk to teams before they commence their games, and it will be up to the teams' discretion as to whether they want to visit the foot of stage to engage in high-fives with the audience. While we love this moment for our fans and for our broadcast, we want to respect all team wishes to maintain personal space when desired. Simultaneously, there will be a noticeable presence of security officers and event staff in the crowd near the foot of stage should a team choose to engage in high-fives. 
Anyone caught violating the personal space of pros will be blacklisted from NA LCS events for the foreseeable future. We are not taking breaches of personal space lightly, and we respect that our fans do not dismiss our wishes for the comfort of our pros. Similarly, if you try to bring in any item that could be deemed a weapon, you will also face a potential blacklisting. Our security team is professionally trained and Rioters will always be on-site to assist with any grievances, but as a rule of thought: if someone could think the item is a weapon, do not bring it to NA LCS. 
Cosplay is still permitted and encouraged, but we will need you to walk through metal detection and have any foam or worbla weapons screened. When possible, please avoid using metal components in your cosplay, as we cannot guarantee that all components of your cosplay will be deemed safe for entry. 
The Team Tailgate Zone will be reevaluated for potential risks, with a possibility of the program being ended. While we love they hype we've been able to bring to fans with the tailgate zone in our lot this year, we cannot guarantee that it will continue into 2019 without further iteration to how we can best secure an outdoor activation. We are leaving the decision to participate in Team Tailgate Zone up to team discretion, as with all public-interaction activations. 
While these extra security measures may seem to dampen the excitement of attending NA LCS live, we believe them to be the responsible next steps following the incident in Jacksonville last weekend. We are certain that NA LCS will still be an exciting and rewarding experience for all who attend, and we don't want our fans to believe we have traded hype and the excitement of the moment for security procedure. This program is always evolving, always getting better, and the more time we have to personalize it to our show while simultaneously considering the needs of our players and community, the stronger and less intrusive it will become.

Thank you for understanding our desire to provide a safe space for our fans, staff, and professional players to assemble, and please don't hesitate to reach out to us at Tickets@RiotGames.com with any feedback or follow-up questions. We will continue to iterate on the best way to provide a safe environment for everyone on-site at NA LCS Studios and at Finals, and we will update our security policies for 2019 to balance the bespoke nature of our esports with the best practices of the sporting event security industry.

Below you will find some context on the current security measures we have in place that would have prevented a tragedy like the one in Jacksonville from occurring at NA LCS Studios. These measures have been in place since 2016, and will see the addition of the above-mentioned enhancements starting this coming weekend. Thanks!

Existing Security Measures at NA LCS Studios (June 2016 to present day):

For context around our existing security procedures at NA LCS Studios: 
Events team has used metal detection and bag search at every event that NA Esports has produced (all NA LCS events- including Spring and Summer Finals- and internationally at MSI, Worlds, Rift Rivals, and All-Star Event) since the start of Summer Split 2016. This includes all of our home studio shows as well as every NA Esports-produced road show (Los Angeles, Toronto, San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Barcelona, Vancouver, Boston, China, Miami, Paris, and upcoming with Oakland and throughout Korea). 
After the tragic Christina Grimmie incident in June 2016 Events team considered it imperative to develop a security plan that would be mindful of and two steps ahead of the type of threats exemplified in Jacksonville last weekend, which is why we work weekly with licensed and insured security managers and security companies to continue evolving our home studio security plan for weekly games. 
The current measures at NA LCS events are routinely audited by the LAPD to make sure they are consistent with the best practices of the security industry, always include metal detection and bag search upon entrance as well as a secure perimeter, utilize security posts at all critical junctions and cameras for visibility, and are designed expressly to prohibit incidents like the one in Jacksonville from happening. 
On the road, Events team and our security managers, who are retired police officers with years of large event experience doing sporting events at major stadiums for ESPN, NFL, and MLB, along with the venues' security management teams (who we've found to also be on high alert for these types of incidents), spend hours developing a strong security plan with contingencies, guard posts, rally points, and security visibility at all entrances as well as in our common spaces, concourses, and on the event floor. 
Riot's main campus security manager, also a retired police officer, has assisted Events team in devising emergency preparedness plans focused on safety that we tailor to every event we produce. At many venues and now at our home studio shows, Rioters also have to go through metal detectors and bag search with crew when utilizing the stage door so that no weapons may enter via staff bags or personnel. Depending on the road show venue we will utilize walk-through mags (like at our home studio) or metal detector wands, which are as effective as walk-through mags when used by trained security officers, but take longer when moving large groups through a security checkpoint (because of the 1:1 time it takes to wand a person). Often times we will use a combination of the two. 
Bag search is always utilized at our events, and many of our larger arenas will not even allow backpacks or large bags to enter, screened or not, as standard procedure. We are adopting this policy for NA LCS Studios. 
We establish secure perimeters at all outdoor gathering areas within our road show events, including our tailgating sections and team zones as will be found at Oakland Summer Finals, which will utilize a perimeter that secures the area of the Coliseum as well as Oracle Arena for the concurrent games happening that day. Because this is more difficult at NA LCS Studio games, we are revisiting any activations that take place outdoors, including Team Tailgating Zone and Meet the Pros. While our perimeter is secure at NA LCS Studios, the openness of our location on Olympic Avenue, with a number of buildings in the area, means we must continue evaluating our outdoor activations in light of the Vegas tragedy last year. 
Our retired police officer security managers for road shows escort teams through any open areas, often with the assistance of venue security. We secure pathing ahead of time and maintain a pace to keep our teams moving from Point A to Point B. If you see us walking with teams, please don't be offended when we refuse to stop for autographs; this is the reason why. 
At every road show we contract the local police department to perform dog-assisted bomb sweeps before opening the property to a secure perimeter. The dogs make sure the area is clean, the secure perimeter makes sure nothing new comes in. 
We often utilize plain-clothes police officers at our events, who are mindful of all entering our property and add an additional set of eyes to our perimeter. We are considering utilizing uniformed officers for specific events in the future to show a display of authority in the space. 
We in Riot Events and Riot Security are taking these types of incidents very seriously, and want all fans, guests, players, and crew to know that though they may not see all components of a security plan, there is in fact an ever-iterating strategy in place with the utmost importance being placed on the safety of all persons on site.

Thank you for understanding that your safety is our top priority, and we will not settle for any security plan that is not fully vetted to ensure our safety standards are consistent with the best of the industry. Thank you, and see you at the NA LCS!""",leagueoflegends,2821
Kennonf,2018-08-31 01:12:56+00:00,What the Forsaken opening screen could look like if it was all dark:,"Hey everyone!  I'm a motion designer and director based in Los Angeles, and also a huge Destiny fan.  I'm in the process of launching a company that will design and create title sequences for movies, games and tv series, so I decided to take it upon myself to recreate the opening screen of Forsaken with a purple color scheme in a way that I think we were all hoping it would look like.

I did this in about 30-45 minutes today in order to demonstrate what it \*COULD\* look like, so the actual title screen doesn't have the sacred geometry motion in the background, but I tried to build something that fit the mood using some smoke and particles.

Don't get me wrong, the designers and shops that Bungie hires out to work on Destiny are amazingly talented artists; I just felt that there was an oversight in what could have set the mood for Forsaken from the very opening screen.

Anyway - If someone from Bungie ends up seeing this, please know that I would \*love\* to work on some motion design elements for Destiny.  I work with a team of guys who can really take things to the next level, and I have been a fan of the Bungie brand since modding Marathon as a 9 year old.  Anyway; here it is:

EcoleBuissonniere,2018-08-20 14:47:18+00:00,[Magic: The Gathering] Known cheater is allowed to compete at a tournament level,"If you're at all into the Magic pro scene, you probably know an infamous name: Alex Bertoncini. Also known as Alex Bertoncheati or ""Two Explores"", Bertoncini is probably the most notorious cheater currently operating in the game. Bertoncini is most infamous for having multiple high-profile examples of cheating caught on camera. I'll try to explain them both here, before getting into the current drama.

The first, and most infamous example is ""Two Explores"". You can find a video of this [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd7cd-K8ImQ) In this example, Bertoncini is playing a deck which utilizes the card [Explore](https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/en/wwk/99.jpg?1530592601), which allows him to play a second land (the game's resource mechanic, which you normally only get one of per turn) on the turn it's cast. On his first, he plays a land. On his second turn, he plays a land, casts an Explore, and plays a second land, for a total of three lands. On his third turn, he plays a land, casts an Explore, plays a second land, then plays an *illegal* third land, for a total of six lands, when he should only have five (a sixth land on turn three would have required a third Explore). When the person filming asks what turn it is, he doesn't even say; he simply gestures to his graveyard and says the infamous phrase: ""Two Explores."" 

A second notorious example can be found [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZYQh6TR-hQ) In this example, Bertoncini is playing a deck that utilizes the card [Kira, Great Glass-Spinner](https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/en/bok/40.jpg?1517813031) in order to protect his creatures. His opponent has a copy of [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/en/wwk/31.jpg?1530592252) on board, as well as a copy of [Cursed Scroll](https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/en/tmp/281.jpg?1517813031). After Bertoncini plays a Kira, his opponent uses Jace's -1 ability, using up Kira's protection ability for that turn, then shoots it with Cursed Scroll, killing it. Next turn, Bertoncini plays another Kira, and his opponent does the same thing. This time, however, Bertoncini slides the second Kira back into his hand, rather than putting it in the graveyard. He casts that same Kira the next turn, something which the commentator even catches, but apparently gives Bertoncini the benefit of the doubt on.

These are only two of the most infamous examples of Bertoncini's cheating. He's been well known to do things like draw four cards off of a [Brainstorm](https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/en/cns/91.jpg?1517813031), ""forget"" to put two cards back off of a Brainstorm, and a wealth of other cheats. This pervasive pattern of cheating has resulted in him not only being banned from competitive Magic for it, but in him being banned *twice*.

However, neither ban was a permanent one. This past weekend, with his last three-year ban lifted, he competed in Grand Prix Los Angeles. At GP LA, he was noted to do [several shady things](https://twitter.com/tommartell/status/1031306348187672577). However, none of them resulted in action being taken against him. At the end of the tournament, he made Top 8 of the tournament, meaning he got to compete in the single elimination round for a chance to win the tournament. His announcement of the Top 8 was [met with a chorus of boos by GP competitors](https://mobile.twitter.com/nicknprince/status/1031328753203404800). 

While he was subsequently [defeated by Ben Friedman in the quarterfinals](https://twitter.com/magicprotour/status/1031349079576473601), the fact that he's allowed to play has caused an uproar in the Magic community. Not only has he cheated numerous times in the past, and every time been unapologetic about it, but there's a chance he's cheated at this very Grand Prix. Moreover, Wizards of the Coast seems to be censoring as much discussion of his past as they can; any mentions of him cheating (or of his nickname, Bertoncheati) in Magic's Twitch channel has led to a swift ban. 

Only time will tell how long it will be until Bertoncini is banned for a third time, and is forced two explore other hobbies.",HobbyDrama,1017

Long story short, my older brother is in a physically and emotionally abusive relationship with his girlfriend. His girlfriend got accepted to be on the show for her anger issues and my brother asked me if I would like to be on the show too. I spent about 2 hours last night talking with producers about my brother’s relationship, my wardrobe specifications, and even a mental evaluation that is required for every guest that comes on the show. They asked me for pictures of myself, my teeth, and a short video of me directly talking to Dr. Phil about the situation my brother is in. I’m being flown out tonight and flown back Monday after we record the episode. 

Basically my question is, what should I know, if anything? I have never been to Los Angeles before. I have never been on television before. I’m just a confused 20 year old. Any information would be very much appreciated!",NoStupidQuestions,1402

That's over 10% of all NBA rings.,"I hear the talk in the media, NBA players, and even some on /r/nba complaining that the warriors are too dominant and destroying NBA parity when they've only won 3 titles in 4 years. The truth is that parity in the NBA has always been an illusion. Lakers and Celtics together have over 43% of the rings. The top 5 teams have 70% of the rings. But the real 

* Steve Kerr himself has 8 NBA championship rings. 

* That's more than all teams but LAL and BOS. ([3 with Bulls, 2 with Spurs,](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-8CM8tEIVu-Q/U3U3pm6YNhI/AAAAAAAAv8U/Yk1Wn4WsMCo/w800-h800/Steve+Kerr+Rings+Shot+Science.gif) and 3 with Warriors)

* Kerr's Championship Rate (aka CHAMPR) is 8 rings / (17 player season + 4 coaching seasons) = **38.09%**

* The next best CHAMPRs are BOS 23.61%, LAL 22.86%, CHI 11.54%, SAS 9.80%, and finally the ""sp00ky"" GSW with a whopping 8.33%. (I did the math on them all so if you want your team's % just ask and I'll reply, but it's not pretty.)

* Even the mythical Michael ""perfect ""NBA ""Skip's ""G.O.A.T."" pornhub"" Jesus"" 6of6"" Jordan was 6 titles in 15 seasons for a **40%** CHAMPR. But if you count his years as owner? Then it's 6 of 24 for **25%** It's looking like Kerr is the one winning those 2nd run chips for MJ and not the other way around. MJ thanked him with a punch to the face too *SMH*.

* Reminder that GSW had Jerry West, Stephen, Klay, and Draymond for years and hadn't won the chip with those guys until Steve came along. The secret sauce ain't Curry, it's Kerr.

* How many Jordan win without Kerr? 3. Kerr won 5 without Mike.

* How many Duncan win without Kerr? 3. Kerr won 6 without Duncan.

* How many rings Curry win without Kerr? 0. Kerr won 5 without Stephen.

**TL;DR Warriors aren't destroying NBA parity. Steve Kerr is destroying NBA parity. The sexy little slut keeps winning titles and secretly ruining the NBA for those of you guys who love parity (Personally, I rather like [Kerr](https://www.popovichkerr2020.com/)). But for imaginary parity's sake the NBA needs to stop him. I personally suggest Adam Silver secretly funding a cloning program splicing the DNA of Bill Russell, Flyod Mayweather, Father Time, and Dwayne Douglas Johnson together.**

cariboustewwwwwwwww,2018-07-31 21:57:54+00:00,[OC] What if the NBA had 100 teams?,"Talk about expansion is all over American professional sports, and basketball  is no exception. The NBA’s a bit different from most leagues, though, in that (besides Seattle) it’s not entirely sure *where* it wants to expand to. The other leagues are more certain -- hockey has Quebec City and Hamilton, soccer has at least 6 cities on standby, the NFL’s got at least a couple more teams to fit in the LA metro area, and Baltimore could really use a professional baseball team. The NBA, though? There's no consensus. Maybe Kansas City, maybe Louisville, maybe Omaha, that dude who was talking about Little Rock a while ago, Mexico City, Hampton Roads, Montreal, Vegas, St. Louis, Vancouver, who knows how many others. 

So why limit it to only adding one or two? If we’re gonna be expanding the league, I feel like we should be really, truly expanding the league. Maybe balloon is the better word, actually. Or detonate. I don’t know. Regardless, your initial reaction might be, “aren’t there innumerable downsides to suddenly rivalling D-1 college football in size?” And yes, but I believe there are also upsides:

1. There are dozens of cities that want an NBA team, and it’d be rude to turn them down. Would you go up to some little kid playing basketball in Edmonton and tell him he doesn’t deserve a pro team? I wouldn’t, mostly because they could probably beat me up, but that’s besides the point

2. The NBA is, like every other business in this hellworld, built on the back of the eldritch horror that is capitalism, a beast whose thirst for profit is unquenchable. Seventy more teams means 3.3 times the profit for its gaping maw

3. I’m from San Diego and this is the only realistic way I could get a local team

4. With this level of team saturation, team moves wouldn’t really happen anymore, mostly because there would be no open cities for the teams to move to. As a Kings fan, this would really take a load off my mind

5. Basketball and hockey both have a blessing football and baseball sadly don’t: their stadiums don’t take many people to fill up. The biggest NBA stadium doesn’t break 21,000 people, and the biggest basketball stadium *in the world* barely meets the *minimum* requirement for an NFL stadium, and it’s in the Philippines anyway. This means the NBA can expand to cities the NFL and MLB never could.

6. If this doesn’t happen, and expansion continues at the incredibly slow pace it’s going right now, we’ll still get to a number of teams that seems ungodly today at some point. The UN’s more moderate projections predict a US population of 450 million by 2100, and a North American population of 650 million, so it’s not like there won’t be enough fans in the future. Why not make the teams now, so not only will everyone get the teams they’d eventually get anyway, but also so those 2100 fans will have successful histories to look back on longingly when their team finishes 78th overall?

I believe these benefits outweigh the myriad problems the NBA would face with 100 teams. 

#The teams

So we’ve decided that there should be enough NBA teams to match the entire minor league baseball pyramid in a single league. Sweet! But where should we put all the new teams?

1. Firstly, we should put teams back in the cities who lost theirs to a move. That means, yes, bringing back the Sonics, but also adding teams in 11 other cities, not including the [Quad Cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quad_cities) and Fort Wayne because I’m trying to maintain at least a facsimile of realism. So there’s 41 teams.

2. Secondly, we wanna add teams to metro areas that can support them, which given point 5 shouldn’t be too hard. However, we’re gonna want to start with the non-American markets, since we don’t want America hogging all the teams. Since it’s the least complicated one, let’s do Canada first: every metro area with a population over 800,000 people -- half of that of the smallest NBA metro area, Salt Lake City -- gets a team (plus Winnipeg, since it barely misses the mark). There’s 47. 

3. Next we’ll add Mexican teams, which is more complex, since Mexico’s already got a pro basketball league, the LNBP. Should we even try to break through it? Not in *all* of Mexico, but in the north, yes; the cities (and the 4 existing northern LNBP teams) are pretty far from the south, and culturally pretty distinct as well. Besides those 4, we’ll also add another 5 metro areas without preexisting teams, since they’re big enough to support teams as well. There’s 56.

4. Why not add some Caribbean teams? Oh, what’s that you’re bemusedly listing? Reasons to not add Caribbean teams? That'd be great if I cared. Now there are really only 6 metro areas with enough people in the Caribbean for a team, but we’ll leave one of them, Port-au-Prince, out -- Haiti’s still reeling from the 2010 earthquake. There’s 62.

5. Also, just since they’ve got the people to support it and I like intercity rivalries, let’s add one team to metro areas that can handle more than one team, like Chicago and Dallas. That brings us up to 69. As a mature and respectable adult, I had an entirely mature and respectable response to that number when it came up. 

6. So now we’re finally able to add teams to new cities in the U.S. itself. We’ve got 31 left to work with, which is more than enough to sprinkle across the the country. I tried to spread them out evenly, which is why there’s a Boise team but not a Richmond team, and also wasn’t incredibly strenuous in my city choices, by which I mean I avoided cities I don’t like. In other words, if you’re annoyed your city didn’t get a team, you’re taking this more seriously than I am.

Also, I decided to stick with the 5-team division model in the current NBA, but put 5 in each conference, and bump the number of conferences up to 4, named after cardinal directions because I’m creative but not quite creative enough. Here they are:

As you can tell, the team names are the only (mostly) serious thing in this post. I tried to make up for it with the division names

#The Expansion Draft

So we’ve got 100 teams now, but we don’t have players for them. The CBA guarantees a league average of 14 players per team, which would mean we’ll need 1400 players for the league. That’s, uh. That’s a lot. How are we gonna get such a ridiculous number of players?

One word: G League. Two words. One and a half words. Who cares. See, there were 491 players at the beginning of the 2017-18 season, which, combined with the rosters of the teams we stole from Mexico, could probably be raised to about 550. The G League, though, has at least a thousand players -- I didn’t bother figuring the exact number, suffice to say there’s a lot -- more than making up for the deficit. 

So here’s what I’m proposing as an expansion draft: each already-existing team from the NBA or LNBP can keep 2 of their players, and the rest are thrown into a lottery consisting of them and every 2017-18 G League player. The players are then chosen at random and assigned to each team in a ridiculously long ceremony probably spread out over the space of 2 or 3 weeks. Truly a waste of time for everyone involved, just like this post was a waste of my time, but a necessary waste of time to ensure there’s basketball for the fans to watch. Maybe not good basketball, but basketball.

#The Season 

Instead of an 82-game season, I’m thinking we expand it to 110: 15 4-game series with 15 in-conference teams, then 25 2-game series with 25 out-of-conference teams. 
 
So after this season of only interacting with less than half the league, we come to the playoffs. What we should do here is obvious: the same thing the NBA does, but instead of 16 teams we go up to 64, 16 from each conference. Teams are reseeded once we get down to 16, then 4. This might be kind of an unnecessarily long playoff season, reminiscent of early MLS when 8 of 10 teams went to the playoffs, and I’m sure there’s more scientific ways to do it with fewer than 50 teams, but I’m not a science man, so whatever. 

Who wins? Who knows. Probably Golden State, since they’d keep KD and Steph and also because God is real and he hates us. Maybe we’d get an upset from Hawai’i or Albuquerque or something. Whatever, it’s 2:00 AM and I have to wake up at 7:00, I barely care anymore. Thanks for coming to my TED talk",nba,9568

This image is from the K-Mart Teen 1996 Fall Catalogue, and it actually has quite a peculiar story behind it.  

As far as anyone can tell, this is the only existing image of Kaylee Huston, who vanished without a trace in the summer of that year, shortly after moving with her family to the city of Glendale, California, just outside of Los Angeles.

The Huston family had moved from Shawndale, Arizona, to California in May, to a house on Wesker Street.  The house, a classic craftsman, was the oldest in the entire neighborhood, originally part of a housing development in 1933.  It was smaller than the grand five bedroom McMansion they had owned in Shawndale, but far more beautiful.  Entire Huston family had been excited for the move.

Kaylee, nineteen, was the oldest of three sisters.  In Shawndale she had always been the focus of much praise for her good looks, with many people encouraging her to pursue a life infront of cameras, as a model, an actress or a newscaster.  But Kaylee, a shy and nervous girl by nature, had always been camera shy, and up until her senior year of high school, resistant to the attention foisted upon her.

Kaylee was homeschooled, and spent the majority of her time alone.  This had all changed when Kaylee, encouraged by her sisters and her mother, auditioned for the local high school’s winter play.  Though she was not technically a student of Fairview Valley High, Kaylee won the role of Hermia in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and was allowed to participate in the play.

The experience was transformative for Kaylee, who found that she loved to be on stage.  She began to ask her parents every day to move to Los Angeles, so she could pursue a career as an actress.

Though it seemed an unlikely dream, Kaylee’s change of attitude came at the perfect time for the family.  Her father, Jay Huston, was recently retired, and her mother, Diana, was between jobs.  Her two young sisters were both in the process of switching schools, and their family dog, Pepper, had recently been put down after she was attacked by a coyote or some other small predator in the woods.

Kaylee had been the one to find Pepper, injured and crusty with dried blood and drool, her collar missing.  Her throat had been pulled apart and one of her eyes torn out.  Kaylee had cried all the way to the vet, and the experience had rattled the Hustons badly.  Kaylee’s new ambitions towards California were a welcome change of pace, one that would guide the family to a new beginning, and the decision was made to go west.

The move itself had been frustrating; several boxes had been lost, and Jay Huston had begun his first morning in California in a two hour long phone argument with the moving company, switching lines to yell at men from the insurance company, and then back again to accuse the movers of everything from incompetence to outright criminal theft.  The women of the Huston family had brightened their day by unpacking, and exploring the new house.  It had come unfurnished, other than a single landline telephone in a hallway downstairs between the kitchen and the living room.

It was in fact on this phone, that first evening, that a single call had come through.  Kaylee had answered it, on instinct; though the Huston Family’s phone service had yet to be set up.  The call had been short, and when she hung up, Kaylee said it had been a wrong number, or some kind of prank.

Kaylee said that the connection had been bad, and choppy, and that she had only understood part of what the caller was saying.  Though Kaylee attempted to move on from the conversation, the call had clearly upset her, and her mother pressed for more information.  Kaylee said that the only thing she’d heard was a very soft, very quiet voice, possibly a man but gentle and near a whisper, repeating a phrase again and again.

When Kaylee’s mother later spoke to the police, she couldn’t remember the phrase word for word, but said it had been something like: “I’m reaching for you, I’m reaching for you with my little fingers.”

In the following weeks the Huston girls had registered for the local school districts, and Kaylee had gone out to meet with several commercial modelling agencies her mother had found in the yellow pages.  Most of them were the kind of one stop shops that were common in Los Angeles at the time; photography studios with an agency or management arm attached, working directly with brands and catalogs.  Kaylee did a single shoot with an agency called Torrie Michelle Model Factory; in it she wore new K-Mart Teen Apparel, with the common practice being to photograph several dozen models and then send their photos in large batches to the distributor for them to pick and choose.

Kaylee was thrilled by the shoot and felt emboldened, making fast friends with several other young models in the waiting room, making plans to visit a local mall, the Glendale Galleria, that evening.  Diana Huston, excited to see her daughter’s newfound outgoing attitude in action, allowed her daughter to go out unchaperoned, but ultimately, Kaylee’s anxiety got the better of her, and she stayed in, playing board games with her family.  It was at three AM that evening that the family was awoken by the sound of a dog barking from outside.

When Jay Huston went outside to check, he found a small red collar, torn apart and stained with blood, left on the front porch under one of the lawn chairs.

This sparked a debate within the family; the parents believed that the collar must have been dropped and discarded during the move, and its discovery now was a coincidence.  Kaylee’s two sisters, both young, speculated that it could have been a coincidence, but Kaylee herself was certain that this was Pepper’s collar, the same collar that had been missing when when she’d found Pepper, staggering torn apart onto the front lawn several months ago.  Things became more complicated when Kaylee, in an effort to prove her point, attempted to locate a picture of Pepper.

It was rapidly discovered that one of the boxes that had gone missing in the move was the one containing all of the Huston Family’s framed family photographs, and another containing all of their photo albums.  This meant, in short, that there was no picture of Pepper to be found; no evidence of the dog ever having existed within the family, at all. Pepper had in effect, vanished without a trace, leaving behind only an illustration by one of the younger girls in her journal.

This re-invigorated Jay Huston’s anger at the movers and the insurance company, and the mystery of the barking dog and the torn red collar was slowly forgotten as the family struggled to get back to sleep.  Over the next two weeks, Kaylee repeatedly tried to bring up the collar, but Diana Huston had thrown it in the garbage the morning it had appeared and the rest of the family, unsettled by the incident, was eager to move on from the experience.  A month passed, and the appearance of the collar was mostly forgotten.

On the morning of June 25th, Jay Huston contacted the Glendale Police Department to report that his wallet had been stolen.

That evening, while walking home a long awaited hang-out with her new, Los Angeles friends, Kaylee Huston disappeared and was never seen again.  She was last seen leaving a Burger King on Brand Avenue at 6:35 PM, headed back home to meet up with her younger sisters to see a movie.  There are reports of a girl matching Kaylee’s description walking quickly, looking upset and anxious, from several eye witnesses but none of them could confirm that it was her.

In fact, efforts to confirm these sightings were when, in the wake of Kaylee’s disappearance, that things became truly confounding.  Glendale Police and the LAPD, as was common practice, asked for a photograph with which to identify Kaylee, only for the Hustons to, with some degree of consternation, realize that they could not supply even a single photograph of their daughter.

Homeschooled, Kaylee had no yearbook photographs.  The entirety of family pictures from vacations and holidays had been lost in the move.  And the single portrait that Jay Huston had kept with him at all times had gone missing the previous morning, inside his stolen wallet.

The Hustons, confused and upset, contacted Torrie Michelle Model Factory, asking after the photographs from Kaylee’s K-Mart shoot; they were informed, to their great distress, that the negatives and only existing copies of the photographs had been mailed to the K-Mart headquarters in Illinois two weeks prior, and since Kaylee had not taken a headshot, there were no photos on file.

The Hustons, at a loss, contacted Fairview Valley High, hoping to get a photograph of Kaylee from her performance in the class production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream.  Furthering their frustration, they learned that the single large photograph taken of the cast and displayed in the auditorium had been vandalized in a student break-in that March, half of the of the photograph, including the portion featuring Kaylee, having been torn off.  The culprit was never found.

The photographer themselves, drama teacher Marcia Sims, had died of congestive heartfailure in April, and most of her possessions given away through Goodwill, so any attempt to find the original photonegative would be near impossible.

Unable to supply a photograph, the Hustons were forced to wait for the publication of the K-Mart Teen Fall Catalogue that August; bureacratic red tape prevented the police from subpoening the full shoot across state lines, and even when K-Mart themselves tried to internally track down the rest of the photographs, forty in total, they could not find them within the tens of thousands of photos submitted weekly for K-Mart marketing purposes from agencies all over the united states.

The Huston family copied the single image of their missing daughter from the catalogue, and, months after her disappearance, were finally able to put up missing photos, the single glossy catalog image plastered all over telephone polls and bulletin boards in Los Angeles County.

Months passed.  Years passed.  And Kaylee was never seen again.  Slowly the posters stopped going up.  After four years, the Huston family separated; Jay had become too angry, flying into rages, and had been involved in an obsessive litigation with the moving company, who he blamed for the disappearance of their daughter.  Diana moved with the girls back to Shawndale, and then in with her ailing mother in Florida.  Gina Huston, Kaylee’s youngest sister, died of an overdose in 2007.  Paula, the middle child, now takes care of Diana, who fell ill with alsheimers in 2010.  Sometimes, late at night, Diana will mistake Paula for Kaylee, and can often be found in the front yard of their Tampa, Florida home, calling out for their dog, Pepper.

The forty original photographs of Kaylee have never been found.  In November of 2013, a break-in was reported at the home of Andrew Michelle, son of Torrie Michelle, and now the owner of the still operational Torrie Michelle Modle Factory.  At first it appeared to be an intentional robbery, but the type of damage reported was more in line with a small animal, with something having torn apart dozens of old files in his storage unit.  Nothing was reported stolen.  To this day Andrew Michelle and the LAPD assume it was a racoon.

Now, with the liquidation and closing of K-Mart stores throughout the country, and the collapse of the brand, one can only assume that those photographs, and their negatives, will have to be moved out of storage, somewhere.  And it’s for this reason that I ask for your help now; they have to be out there, somewhere, the pictures, my pictures.  The one picture, the original, of the K-Mart Catalogue photograph.  You can help me find it

If you or anyone you know has information on how to locate the originals, or the rest of the K-Mart shoot, please contact me as soon as possible, as I am eager to find them.  stop keeping it from me i need it you the photograph There are of course digtal copeis but those dont matter as much they arent realyou see

i have all the others you seei have them all and kaylee too just need that last photographh iwant it

and when i get my little fingers on it

pryzless1,2018-07-26 08:24:03+00:00,"Zodiac Killer possible clue? Internet sleuths, what do you guys think about what I potentially digged up while looking through some of the clues the Zodiac had sent.","With all the headway being made through DNA matches in 2018 regarding past serial killers, I decided to attempt to decipher some of the ciphers left behind by the Zodiac killer. While my discovery may be small, and no I did not decipher any of the unsolved letters, I believe it fits the killers game he was playing with the police and also increased my suspicion on one of the later main suspects Richard Gaikowski. 

Here is a link to the Letter I am referring too - [http://www.zodiackiller.com/HalloweenCard.html](http://www.zodiackiller.com/HalloweenCard.html)

The left half of the letter is where I believe I made some headway, the first part has been overall agreed to have been part of a comic book series named Tim Holt, and the reference Death by gun, fire, rope, and knife comes from the cover of Tim Holt #30 comic. - I would like to point out that the author of this comic looks just like the sketch of the zodiac killer- weird coincidence.

Anyways the second half of his letter, Shows a skeleton and reads - ""From your secret pal- I feel it in my bones, you ache to know my name, and so I'll clue you in...""

The skeleton is holding 3 fingers up, and forming and O or zero with his other two fingers and there is also a number 14 written on the hand. On the following page he also makes another reference to the number 4-teen but spells it as so, and a following quote state ""but then why spoil ... game. Happy Halloween.""

Now my ""finding"" to the puzzle, I went and looked at the comic book online, Tim Holt #30, I believe the skeleton hand is referencing the number 30 and not just 3 as a reference to the comic book series #. But if it does just reference #3 I looked at the 3rd page in the comic and it shows Death by gun on the ""spin the wheel"".  This letter was sent Oct- 27,1970. His last confirmed victim was the cab driver who was shot in the head Oct 11, 1969. That may be a reference to the year anniversary of his killing. That however is very open to debate and can be attributed to coincidence.

Now the number 14, this is where it gets interesting, on page 14 of the comic book series #30 that he referenced, starts off by giving the names of 4 characters in the comic. At first I was extremely excited, I though wow the first letters on that page give 4 names and the Zodiac killer is suppose to ""clue us in"" on his name. Here is a link to page 14-[http://comicbookplus.com/?dlid=21570](http://comicbookplus.com/?dlid=21570) . Carl Pasoach- Eli Welles- Frank Hoover- Tom Tisdale. None of which were first or last names of any suspects. In the comic these 4 people arrange to kill a character by the name of Will Martin. Again not a suspect, so I was pretty disappointed. But then I looked at the page again.

On the comic square showing the depiction of 2 characters standing over Will Martin, one of them looks to be shooting him in the face, and above that characters speech bubble, it states ""He found the Mine, but we'll say we found It! It will make us all RICH!"" The word Rich is on its own line and capitalized, right above what looks to be the killer shooting and killing a character. Now Rich is also short for Richard, and Richard Gaikowski in my mind is the most likely to have been the zodiac killer due to the evidence against him.

It has been suggested that the Zodiac killer has made multiple references to comic books which show his interest and he likely collected them.

Him sending us these clues and having his name written on that page of the comic but now so obvious to be used as proof, fits well with how the zodiac killer behaves. Give them some evidence but not the whole thing, and keep it vague to keep them guessing if their right or not. His 2 cipher which may have been solved recently or as solved as it can be showed he purposefully messed up at places to make it impossible to truly solve, and according to the solution, RicherdMNikons is written on it, a referral to the president at the time. It also spells out Rich, again, abstract, in his head his name is in plain site but impossible to prove, Boast his ego and how inferior he believed the investigators were to him.

Richard Gaikowski is also on tape talking about the zodiac codes and how sometimes the military can send real and fake codes to mess with the enemy which is the main believe of some of his ciphers. you can hear the audio on the source site under suspects/Richard Gaikowski.

Here are some very interesting facts about him that raise suspicion and in my eyes make him the most probable suspect. Source [zodiackiller.com](https://zodiackiller.com)

That is all I have to add to this unresolved mystery. Hopefully, it is helpful information to bring one more suspicion to the killers identity. Although Richard Gaikowski did pass away in 2004, due to cancer, if it was him he left this world and got away with it.

 Zodiac victim Darlene Ferrin of Vallejo, Calif. got married on [**Jan. 1, 1966**](http://www.zodiackiller.com/images/deemarriage.jpg) and moved to Albany, NY. Gaikowski [**quickly followed**](http://www.zodiackiller.com/images/gykepc1large.jpg), moving across country from Martinez, Calif. (near Vallejo). Ferrin's husband worked at the Albany *Times-Union* newspaper; Gaikowski worked in the same building at the rival Albany *Knickerbocker News*. In August 1973, four years after Ferrin was killed by the Zodiac, the *Times-Union* received [**a letter**](http://www.zodiackiller.com/images/albanyzenvelopebig.jpg) from someone claiming to be [**the Zodiac**](http://www.zodiackiller.com/images/albanyzletterbig.jpg). When solved, the cipher that was included with the letter made reference to the Albany Medical Center.  


\*In 1969, 1970 and 1971, Gaikowski was a member of an anti-police, [**pro-violence**](http://www.zodiackiller.com/images/103070.gif)counterculture newspaper and commune in San Francisco called [***Good Times***](http://www.zodiackiller.com/images/goodtimeszodiac.gif). During this time, Gaikowski was known to smoke pot regularly and to use heavier drugs such as speed and LSD.  


\*As early as January 1969, the *Good Times* newspaper was running violent works of fiction that were [**nearly a blueprint**](http://www.zodiackiller.com/images/lennyheller.gif) for Zodiac's future crimes.  


\*Wednesday was ""production day"" for the weekly *Good Times* newspaper, with the staffers working from early in the morning until very late at night to prepare the new issue. Between Zodiac's debut in July 1969 until the* Good Time*s folded in 1973, the Zodiac mailed 15 letters. Never did he mail a letter on a Wednesday, although he did on every other day of the week.   


\*At the time of his murder, the *Good Times* [**""switchboard""**](http://www.zodiackiller.com/images/shortbits.gif) was located [**only yards**](http://www.zodiackiller.com/images/stineswitchboard.jpg) from the residence of Zodiac victim Paul Stine on Fell Street in San Francisco.  


\*Carol, Paul Stine's sister, recognized Gaikowski as having attended Paul's funeral.  


\*Stine was killed on San Francisco's Washington Street. Only one Gaikowski was listed in a city directory at that time, Richard's cousin, and she [**lived on Washington Street**](http://www.zodiackiller.com/images/sfgaikowski.jpg). Her birthday was October 11, the very day Stine was murdered by the Zodiac. Stine -- a cab driver -- was the one victim whom the Zodiac could choose when and where he would be killed.  


\*On the very day Zodiac debuted by mailing three ""rush to editor"" letters to three separate newspapers in the San Francisco area (with each letter containing one third of a code), the *Good Times* (edited by Gaikowski) just happened to run a cover that was [**split into thirds**](http://www.zodiackiller.com/images/73169gt.jpg). It was the only instance of Zodiac mailing a letter on a Thursday until after the *Good Times* folded in 1973. Five months later, the *Good Times* published a [**three-part code**](http://www.zodiackiller.com/images/goodtimescipher.jpg) of its own. The *Good Times* also occasionally ran sensationalistic ""Zodiac Killer"" headlines that were [**out of place**](http://www.zodiackiller.com/images/late1969.jpg).  


\*In articles he published in 1969, Gaikowski had the habit of shortening his last name to four letters and use multiple spellings, such as ""Gike"" or ""Gaik."" Interestingly, ""GYKE"" can [**clearly be seen**](http://www.zodiackiller.com/images/ciphergyke.gif) in Zodiac's three-part cipher mailed on July 31, 1969. What's more, how Zodiac chose to code the cipher phonetically gives you Gaikowski's [**full last name**](http://www.zodiackiller.com/images/gykeausekeyexplanation.jpg).  


\*At the very time the Zodiac wrote his only letter to the Vallejo *Times-Herald*, Gaikowski's best friend, Bob, worked at that very newspaper.  


\*Even though the *Good Times* was a counterculture/hippie newspaper, once Gaikowski came aboard it ran free ads for such unlikely events as performances of [**The Mikado**](http://www.zodiackiller.com/images/mikadogoodtimes.jpg), a Zodiac favorite. (Zodiac sometimes quoted from The Mikado in his letters.)   


\*On March 13, 1971 the Zodiac sent a letter to the Los Angeles *Times*. Coinciding closely with the mailing, Gaikowski was involuntarily committed to the Napa State Hospital after ""going berzerk."" He was then diagnosed with a mental illness and began treatment at Mount Zion Hospital in San Francisco. The Zodiac didn't write again for almost three years.  


\*When the Zodiac reemerged in 1974 with letters referring to recent movie releases, Gaikowski was operating a storefront theater in the Mission District of San Francisco. A film buff, Gaikowski eventually became involved with San Francisco's Roxie Theater.  


\*Nancy Slover, the police dispatcher who spoke with the Zodiac in July 1969, has [**identified Gaikowski's voice**](http://www.zodiackiller.com/nancygyke.mp3) as being the same as the Zodiac's voice. [**Click here**](http://www.zodiackiller.com/richard.mp3) for an MP3 of Richard talking about Zodiac's codes.  


\*In 1986, the Napa County Sheriff's Dept. briefly investigated Gaikowski.

MatPatGT,2018-07-25 18:41:53+00:00,More Context Around Ronnie,"I wanted to follow up today’s video with a bit of extra information here since individuals here on reddit and Twitter had started to ask questions about Ronnie’s health and well-being leading up to today’s video. Hopefully, this answers some of those questions and gives added context for the reasons I/we chose to handle the situation in the way we did:


Why did it take so long to talk about his death?

Like I mention in the video, I wanted to make the video for weeks, but honestly, we waited because it didn’t feel like our news to tell. The whole Theorist team agreed that, out of respect to Ronnie and his family, that we should get permission from his next of kin before doing a public announcement or memorial. At the very least, we were waiting for a public obituary. And for the next few weeks, we tried everything we could think of to find the contact information for his mother: contacting banks, friends, the coroner, etc. We continually checked both Los Angeles and Idaho-centric papers for any sort of public acknowledgement of his death. Nothing yielded results. But when awareness of the coroner’s notice started to spread online, it became important to make the video in the hopes of informing the community, answering as many questions as they had (and that we had answers to…which admittedly, we unfortunately DON’T have many answers), and preventing any further confusion. 


Did the E3 drama cause his suicide?

Obviously, I can’t say for sure, but based on conversations we had with Ronnie leading up to July 4, the answer seems to be no. It probably didn’t help his mental state, but it certainly wasn’t the cause.

To give some context: Some of you know that in the aftermath of this year’s E3, someone complained about Ronnie being rude at one of the booths and posted about it on reddit. The story eventually spread to YouTube. Because his death happened a couple weeks after E3, it’s understandable why these things would be conflated, however, behind the scenes, there was a lot of other personal issues Ronnie was working through at the time. 

Let me make a few things clear, though: The person who posted a complaint did nothing wrong; you should say something if you feel like you were treated badly. And from our investigation, while Ronnie himself didn’t recognize when/where the transgression occurred, others witnessing his behavior at the event saw how there could be validity in the claims. As I mention in the video, Ronnie often struggled to understand how his behavior would be perceived by others; it was rarely if ever meant to be malicious.

On our side, Ronnie was not fired over the incident, we didn't yell at him or anything like that. This was the first time we'd ever heard a complaint about Ronnie at an event like that; we chalked it up to a misunderstanding and moved on. We simply had a long series of calls with him to understand what had happened, explain to him why that behavior was problematic, and make sure we were all on the same page about something similar not happening in the future. I think it's important to say this because my relationship with Ronnie has been one of the longest in my life. Clearly, he was such an important collaborator and a long-time friend. He kept right on working for us just as normal after E3; we spoke with him on July 2nd on the Pokemon video he was set to deliver and he was positive, upbeat, and looking forward to delivering his next edit draft. 

Obviously if I had even an inkling that something was wrong, I would have done everything possible to talk to him, be with him, or support him in whatever way I could. Since he didn't give us any clue that something was this wrong, or we weren't able to read the signs, none of us will have that chance. I can't tell you how tough it is to say that.

ItalicSlope,2018-07-17 00:44:43+00:00,Kiké Hernandez and The Case of the Extra Tight Pants,"on april 23, i watched [kiké hernandez](https://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*723/enrique-hernandez-nlcs.jpg) go 3 for 4 with a home run, two singles, and two golden glove-caliber catches to help the dodgers win against the marlins at dodger stadium. his pants were particularly tight. i had noticed kiké had different pants in different games; all of them were tight, but some of them were extremely tight. 

as the season wore on and kiké’s pants changed day by day, i began to wonder if kiké’s pants affected his performance in games. it seemed like the days when he wore his tightest pants were the days he performed the best, but i couldn’t tell if his performance was actually better on those days, or if i just paid more attention because i love looking at his hot butt. the more i thought about kiké’s pants, the more i convinced myself that this research was necessary and important. i worked on multiple research projects in graduate school, but i hadn't actually used my skills in the ""real world"" yet. this was my chance. 

i began to chart kiké’s pants tightness game by game, matching it with statistics from baseball reference. i determined kiké has three tiers of pants tightness, which i named moderately tight, tight, and extra tight (hereafter referred to as moderates, tights, and extra tights). he actually has two subtypes of extra tights: straight leg extra tights and tapered leg extra tights, but for purposes of this study i grouped all extra tights into one category. please see [this album](https://imgur.com/a/04n2vv3) for image examples of pants tightness.

then i had to figure out the best way to determine kiké’s performance in each pant tightness tier. i spent two months analyzing statistics, learning how to calculate them, and identifying the best options. i narrowed it down to WPA and OPS. after hours upon hours of calculations, questions to r/Dodgers, and lost sleep, i discovered an online OPS calculator that could have saved me a lot of trouble. i decided to calculate the OPS for each pants tightness tier; this was easily achievable using my detailed excel spreadsheet (found below) and the online OPS calculator.

i am proud to present my findings as part of my dissertation for the honorary Master's of Thirsty Baseball (MTB) from the University of r/Dodgers. i have summarized my findings in the paragraph below, and following my summary, i have attached my formal research paper and excel spreadsheet for your information and enjoyment.

my research has determined that kiké’s performance is significantly better when wearing his extra tights. kiké’s OPS while wearing moderately tight pants was 0.552; tight pants was 0.682; and extra tight pants was 0.974. he wore his moderates in 16 games, his tights in 37 games, and his extra tights in 35 games. the biggest different in stats was in home runs: kiké hit 10 home runs while in extra tights, while he only hit 4 in tights and 2 in extra tights. i have attached my excel spreadsheet [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oLltxnikJViloVN-YLcnOa3EzRSolVsqQdVZxEFZFsc) if you are interested in more in-depth statistics; if you filter the column by each pants tightness, the “subtotals” line at the bottom shows the totals per filter. 

please see my [formal research paper](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AbeMBI-vLJ0C-MLgmIO9HpKasX18GKwv) for further in-depth analysis of kiké’s pants and his performance. i think you will find it both informative and entertaining.

upon completing this research, it is my recommendation that kiké wear his extra tights as often as possible to improve his overall performance. we saw last night that kiké is an outstanding player (he was wearing his extra tights), and the data suggests he is not cooling off anytime soon. i believe increasing the frequency of extra tights will only serve to improve his statistics, and will definitely make me a happier woman.

ZandrickEllison,2018-07-16 15:50:09+00:00,An Ode to Roy: What History Should Really Remember about Roy Hibbert,"This summer, Roy Hibbert is an unrestricted free agent, although you wouldn't know that by reading ESPN. Hibbert's name has never gotten mentioned in any rumor mill so far. He didn't play last season in 2017-18, and most likely won't get signed by a team in 2018-19 either. By all accounts, his career is finished. 

What makes that so odd is that Hibbert is only 31 years old, and only a few seasons removed by two All-Star appearances (the latest in 2014). It's pretty astounding that a player can go from All-Star to entirely ""out of the league"" in 3-4 years time. 

When we talk about Roy Hibbert these days, it's usually in regards to that drop off. *What the hell happened?* Of course, there are two easy ways to explain it. 1) The Game Changed. In an era of mobile big men and stretch 5s, there's not as much of a place for a traditional center anymore. And 2) Roy Hibbert Changed. Some say his confidence got shaken and soured by some bad experienced in Indiana, and he never recovered from there. For many, Hibbert's sudden and shocking decline will be the most noteworthy item about his career. 

But not for me. To me, Hibbert's sudden and shocking decline isn't as noteworthy as the shocking NBA *career* that he had. Allow me to explain more.

**Hoya Suxa**

I went to Georgetown University for undergrad, a school that had enjoyed a storied history with basketball. Patrick Ewing, Alonzo Mourning, Dikembe Mutombo, Allen Iverson... Some of the most exciting and legendary icons of the college game had swung through D.C. during the 80s, 90s.

But I didn't go to school in the 80s and 90s. I didn't go to school during the Big Bad John Thompson Era. I was there at a dark time known as the Craig Esherick Experience.

Who is Craig Esherick? Arguably the worst basketball coach I've ever witnessed in my life. He had been a Thompson (the elder) assistant who took over after Thompson resigned suddenly in mid-season. He had the looks and charisma of a high school vice principal, and the basketball acumen of a… high school vice principal. Somehow, Esherick kept the job for 5 full seasons to follow, punishing Georgetown students and fans of the sport of basketball in general. 

I remember one game, where the Hoyas had the ball with 15 seconds left, down by one point. Time for one last shot. Rather than let the team play it out, Esherick called a timeout to go over a play. He huddled the team together and diagramed something on the board. I'm presuming it was a set play, but it could very well have been a scribble of a kitty cat for all I know. Because when the team came back onto the court, they tossed it around the perimeter, over and over, not attacking, just passing... 10 seconds... 5 seconds... and... BZZZZ. Game over. They could not get a shot *attempt* off. I was stunned.

I was *less* stunned when this same thing happened again. And again. And no, I'm not joking. There were three separate times when Esherick teams had failed to get off a shot in a buzzer beater situation. Not get a *good* shot. Not get a *clean* look. GET OFF ANY FUCKING SHOT. Please, for the love of god, just heave it up there. Something. Anything. Nope. BZZZ. Game over. Again.

Whatever ""Georgetown basketball"" was supposed to be was not Georgetown basketball anymore. Coach John Thompson competed for titles, and made the NCAA Tournament a rite of passage. His teams made the tournament in 18 of his last 20 years at the school. His disciple Esherick made the tournament 1 time in his 5.5 years. Clearly, I was born in the wrong era to be a Hoya fan.

**The New/Leftover Recruits**

This may shock you, but super recruits weren't lining up at the door for Coach Craig Esherick.

As you know, basketball recruiting is top heavy. Only the top 10 players in the country may be instant impact ""one and done"" type superstars. Only the top 20-30 are players who may realistically be expecting a pro career at the end of the road. Only the top 100 are even listed on the recruiting page on ESPN.

Georgetown's ""big recruits"" that year? Ranked # [141 and # 145](https://247sports.com/Season/2004-Basketball/CompositeRecruitRankings?InstitutionGroup=highschool).

So much for the days of Patrick Ewing. Suddenly, we were in the dark ages where even the NCAA Tournament felt out of reach. The downward spiral was too obvious to ignore.

The athletic department finally realized this situation was untenable, and mercy killed Craig Esherick. Esherick would never coach basketball again. Seriously. The one-time leader of a historic program never landed another coaching job at any level. According to wikipedia, he's now an assistant professor of sports management at George Mason. 

In his place, the school hired John Thompson III (the star coach's son). Thompson was a legitimate rising star from Princeton, but he had his work cut out for him. He'd be joined a team with very little talent, and two holdover/leftover recruits who were barely Big East talents.

But surprisingly, one of those recruits (#145) wasn't half bad at all. He started right away as a freshman (albeit on a thin team) and put up decent stats: 13.1 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. In fact, he'd go on to develop into a legitimate NBA prospect after all: Jeff Green. Huh. Who knew.

On the other hand, no one had any real hope for the *other* recruit in the class. Roy Hibbert. He was a legit 7'2"", but that's there the basketball talent ended. He was overweight, and couldn't run. He couldn't even *walk* right. You could see him lumber down the dorms with a pigeon-toed gait. Roy didn't have the personality of a basketball player either; he was shy and liked video games. Totally normal for a college freshman, but not the prototype for an impact player.

And at that time, that was the question mark with Roy Hibbert. Not whether he would go off to the NBA. Not whether he could be an All-Star one day. But whether he could play at all for Georgetown, a mediocre Big East team. 

The early returns suggested ""no."" While Jeff Green was playing well as a freshman, Hibbert looked even stiffer than expected. He averaged almost as many turnovers (1.8) and fouls (2.3) as he did rebounds (3.5). A lot of people around the program criticized Coach Thompson for even playing Hibbert at all. He should have been redshirted; he was *that* far away.

Stubbornly, Thompson stuck with Hibbert, and planned to start him full-time the following year. From Thompson's perspective, Hibbert could fit his slower-paced Princeton offense. From our perspective, JT3 was trying to force a fit here, clamoring to recreate his father's magic with big men, only with the wrong big man. Hibbert couldn't play, remember?

But behind the scenes, Hibbert had been working at his body and his game. He would never be an elite athlete, or good athlete, or even ""average"" athlete, but he developed a nice touch. He improved to 11.6 points and 6.9 rebounds as a sophomore. For the first time in 4 seasons, the Hoyas made the tournament. We were finally on the right track.

That next season proved even better, as the juniors Jeff Green and Roy Hibbert were both clicking at the same time. Their status didn't jump off the page -- 14.3 points, 6.4 rebounds for Jeff Green, and 12.9 points, 6.9 rebounds for Roy Hibbert -- but they were playing a slower paced game than most of their peers. Their size helped seal off the paint (2.4 blocks for Hibbert, 1.2 for Green) and make the Hoyas a good defensive squad that could grind out wins with some smart play. Apparently, you were allowed to shoot at the end of the game. If Coach Esherick only knew! In fact, Jeff Green hit a buzzer beater against Vanderbilt in the Tournament that led to a stunning Elite Eight win over a more-talented North Carolina team. Miraculously, these lowly recruits had led Georgetown to the Final Four!

After that run, Jeff Green would go on to the NBA, while Roy Hibbert stayed behind to finish his senior season. He was a fringe first round NBA prospect at this point, so the idea of getting his degree and being the lone star on the team must have appealed to him. As a senior, his stats stagnated (13.4 points, 6.4 rebounds), and his team got bounced in the second round by some scrawny guard from Davidson whose name escapes me at the time.

But that disappointment aside, Roy Hibbert had done a remarkable thing. He had actually become a good college player. A few years prior, and no one would have expected that. And obviously, no one would expect what would come next.

**Upping the Pace**

After a solid college career, Roy Hibbert had established himself as a draftable NBA player. I could see a scenario in which he'd have a long career in the league.

But it's important to know the expectations at the time. Even then, it was clear that Hibbert had limitations. He was below average athletically, which showed up in his rebounding numbers (he never cracked 7 per game in college). Essentially, the problems that Jahlil Okafor is having now are problems that Roy Hibbert were bound to have in the NBA. 

As much as we say ""the game has changed,"" it didn't become cricket overnight. The best center in the game at that time was Dwight Howard, a hyper athletic rebounder and shot blocker. 

I knew that Roy Hibbert could never become *that*. In my head, he had a clear lane in the NBA. He'd be a long-time backup and third center who soaked up a few minutes and a few fouls here and there. He would no doubt be someone like Aaron Gray, his college rival from Pitt. Gray was the same type of plodding, high-IQ big man who could succeed in college (14 points, 10 rebounds per game) but be a fringe player in the league. Sure enough, Gray would go on to have a decent 7-year career in the league, never averaging more than 5 points as a reserve. If Hibbert did the same, I would have considered his NBA career a success.

But given those limited expectations, I found myself surprised that Hibbert went # 17 in the draft (Gray went # 49 the prior year). That felt like quite a reach. The Pacers had a need at center after Jermaine O'Neal left, but Hibbert would be hard-pressed to fill that role. Perhaps they viewed him as a replacement for Jeff Foster, the big bodied role player that had been soaking up minutes there in his wake. 

As expected, Hibbert struggled as a rookie despite being force-fed some starts. But as expected, Hibbert worked at his game and his body behind the scenes. He improved to the point where he could be a productive player. While he wasn't going to prowl the lane and spring out of nowhere to slap balls away like Dwight Howard, he could plant himself in the lane and use ""verticality"" to serve as a blockade. I don't think I ever heard that term prior to Hibbert, but he helped make it popular.

And in turn, he helped the Indiana Pacers establish a quality starting five and a hell of a defensive front under Frank Vogel. Again, Hibbert's stats didn't jump off the page (he'd peak with 12.8 points and 8.8 rebounds), but he was a key cog on a good team. Advanced stats said Hibbert was *the* key cog to the Pacers' dominant defense. In hindsight, I wonder if he actually benefited more from the long-armed perimeter defenders around him like George Hill and Paul George, not to mention the ultimate war daddy captain in David West. But regardless, the Pacers excelled thanks to a balanced and smart team. They went toe to toe with the LeBron-led Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals two years in a row: losing 4-3 and then 4-2. Roy Hibbert was more than along for the ride in that; you could clearly see the difference in how LeBron attacked the Pacers when Hibbert rested versus when he was in the game.

As a result of those high profile series and his team success, Hibbert became a national name. He made two All-Star teams, and earned himself a healthy $58 million contract (he'd make over $70M in his career all told, not counting his contract with Entertainment 720.)

**The End of the Road**

Unfortunately for Roy Hibbert, that era would be short lived. The Pacers imploded on and off the court, and Hibbert took a drastic decline in production thereafter. 

He struggled enormously outside of the Pacers' system and without his excellent defensive teammates swarming the lanes. With the Lakers in 2015-16, he dropped down to 5.9 points and 4.9 rebounds (in a decent 23.2 minutes per night), a far cry from the 10.6 points and 7.1 rebounds (in 25.3 minutes) the year before. It wouldn't be long before he'd become reduced to a rotational player, and then a bench player, and then out of the league altogether.

Those obvious explanations (the evolving modern game, and his eroding confidence) aren't just mere talk. There's legitimate truth to both. Hibbet has publicly talked about his struggles with [mental health](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/13382086/roy-hibbert-looking-career-resurgence-los-angeles-lakers). There are those rumors about clashes and friction with his teammates in Indiana as well. It doesn't feel like Hibbert has a real future in the NBA left. We've seen the best of him, and we likely won't see any more.

But to me, Roy Hibbert's career is in no way a disappointment. In fact, it's downright shocking how far he's come. When I see Roy Hibbert, I remember the awkward and clumsy kid wobbling down the freshman dorms. In some ways, he *still* feels like that kid, only this time with the eyes of an entire nation staring at him and judging him.

We shouldn't judge him at all. We shouldn't criticize him at all. We should marvel at how this # 140 ranked basketball recruit who some people thought would never contribute to a middling college team wound up in the NBA, competing at the highest level against arguably the greatest basketball player of all-time. Aside from his size, he didn't have the physical gifts of his peers; he worked for it, every step of the way. 

Somehow, some way, that goofy kid that I had zero expectations for became a fucking NBA All-Star. ",nba,2663

My dad on the other hand is a lifelong Lakers fan which is where this story begins. 

In 2001 my dad went to LA to watch 2 Lakers games since he had only ever seen them play in Dallas previously since it's so much closer to us. He brought us back Lakers keychains with our names on them. I had that son of a bitch on my keychain for a decade (I was 7 in 2001, didnt need a keychain until 2008ish). Anyways, it lasted for a long ass time. Fantastic quality. Last year the hole in the plastic gave out and finally broke off. 

Here is a picture of it: https://imgur.com/a/C09TQRX

For being in my pocket for pretty much a decade, as well as sitting in drawer for the previous years, it still looks pretty good. That things 17 years old now. It was a trooper. 

Anyways, my girlfriend was in LA and knew how much that keychain meant to me(don't see much of my dad anymore) so she went and got me another one. While it's not really the same thing, I appreciated the thoughtfulness and put it on my keychain since I was so used to having it on there. After only 1 year it looks far worse than the 17 year old one. It looks terrible. 

Here is a photo comparing the 2: https://imgur.com/a/M82HoRX

The Lakers logo is almost completely faded. They also changed up the design a tiny bit with font sizes and such. Mainly though, look at that shit! The other one lasted 17 years and it still looks pretty damn good.

Paul is reluctant to overstate the significance of the sit-down because no single exchange delivered James to Los Angeles. Even pinpointing a primary motive behind James's third free-agent decision is difficult. ""In 2010, when he went to Miami, it was about championships,"" Paul continues. ""In 2014, when he went back to Cleveland, it was about delivering on a promise. In 2018, it was just about doing what he wants to do.""

kafkawannabe,2018-07-11 02:12:18+00:00,"Theory: The reason behind LeBron's decision throughout his career to sign with Cleveland, Miami, and ultimately Los Angeles... is to draw a transmutation spell across America.","[For those of you that don't know what a transmutation spell is, here's a picture of it and an explanation below.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fma/images/e/e6/Simpletransmutation.png/revision/latest?cb=20140620115910)

Alchemy (錬金術 Renkinjutsu) is, as it is understood in the Fullmetal Alchemist series, the ancient metaphysical science/mystical art of manipulating and altering matter by using natural energy. This act is known as ""Transmutation"" (錬成 Rensei) and its sequence is usually described as:

*Comprehension - Understanding the inherent structure and properties of the atomic or molecular makeup of a particular material to be transmuted, including the flow and balance of potential and kinetic energy within.

*Deconstruction - Using energy to break down the physical structure of the identified material into a more malleable state so as to be easily reshaped into a new form.

*Reconstruction - Continuing the flow of energy so as to reform the material into a new shape.

[Now that's out of the way, take a look at the pattern formed from LeBron Itinerary](https://imgur.com/a/wSbumnV) ... he is literally drawing a transformation spell in order to sacrifice mankind in exchange for MJ's GOAT status... and I'm totally okay with this.",nba,1733

Obama was one of us... until I began to realize he wasn’t helping us.

In 2016, I started cheering for Bernie but noticed CNN slanting debate results. Then the DNC rigged the primary, &amp; Hillary was caught cheating (questions given before) debates... 

But when Bernie lost &amp; supported Hillary, (trump called it “like occupy wall st endorsing wall st”) that was the last straw! That’s when I, a registered Democrat in Los Angeles, voted for TRUMP. And he hasn’t let me down.

Previously, I was a nomadic freelance writer working for outlets like VICE, Eater, the Los Angeles Times, Bon Appetit, Saveur, and CNN. I was once  on Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern [talking Chinese food](https://www.travelchannel.com/shows/bizarre-foods/episodes/hidden-los-angeles).

I [wrote this regional Chinese food guide](https://www.kcet.org/food/regional-chinese-food-guide-to-los-angeles) to Los Angeles for KCET and for First We Feast, I wrote about [how Los Angeles because a powerhouse for Chinese food](https://firstwefeast.com/eat/2015/01/how-l-a-became-a-powerhouse-for-chinese-food). 
 
When I'm not writing madly about food, I'm usually offline either gardening, scuba diving, or hiking. I once was a volcano hiking guide in Nicaragua, I've lived off-the-grid in Costa Rica, and diving with manta rays in Hawaii changed my life.

runthrowawaygirl,2018-06-13 07:02:04+00:00,21 and a prisoner in my parents' home,"I'm 21, located in southern California. My parents' home is in Orange County, and I was attending university in Los Angeles County up until recently (fall 2014 \- winter 2017), when I took a leave of absence from school due to personal issues. Once my leave was finalized in January 2018, my parents made it clear to me that they wanted me to return home and live with them. However, I was not keen on this idea, since my parents and I have a somewhat strained relationship due to them not agreeing with a lot of my decisions and generally wanting to control aspects of my life. 

So I decided to stay put in the city where my university is located, and picked up several odd jobs in order to support myself financially (rent, food, other expenses); I continued to do this through May 2018. Through these 5 months, my parents would contact me occasionally to see how I was doing. If I didn't respond within an ""appropriate time frame"" in their eyes, which is less than a few hours, they would repeatedly call me (20\+ times in a row) or even show up outside my apartment unannounced. Finally, they got fed up with my lack of responding and forced me to move back home with them at the end of May; they did so by notifying my landlord that I would no longer be living there, coming to move out my stuff unannounced, and taking away my bank cards/ID/keys.

Originally when my parents brought me back home, they said that they would leave me to my own devices. So if I wanted to get a job, I could do so. Or if I wanted to go out and do something with my friends, I could do so. Basically, it would be like they were my landlords, so we were only tied together by a common living space. On the second night I was home, I made plans to go with some friends to a dance class. My parents allowed me to go out, and I told them approximately what time I'd be back home (between 1\-2 am). However, once it hit around 11 pm, my parents started calling and texting me, telling me to come back home because it was too late. I told them that I couldn't come home, since I had left my car at a friend's house because we had carpooled to the dance class together. For the next 3 hours, they continued to call and text me, and once I actually got home around 1:30 am, they took away my car keys and told me I wouldn't be allowed to leave the house again without them.

It's been 2 weeks now since I've been home, and I've only ever left my house to run errands with my parents. I've applied to multiple jobs near my house, since my parents keep pestering me to get one and I'd love to not be at home all the time, but my parents automatically veto any job I'm offered (retail, restaurant, tutor, receptionist, office clerk, etc). Therefore I've resorted to try and make some money by selling stuff online, like some of my clothes and shoes. One of my friends back at university is aware of everything that's happening, and he has offered to let me come stay at his place so that I can get away from my parents and figure stuff out. I have my debit card now and some cash, and I am planning on packing a few bags of necessities. I can get to my friend's place through public transit or by getting a ride with a friend.

So here are my legal questions:

1. If my parents report me as missing to the police, what will happen? Can I tell the police the details of my situation, so that I can prove I'm not ""missing"" and I left my parents' house on my own accord? What will the police say to my parents after I do this?
2. Is there a way to prevent my parents from contacting me or showing up at my new place? I'm guessing a restraining order, although I'm not sure if I would have enough evidence for the court to grant me one.
3. If my parents do show up at my new place, how do I get them to leave? Are there any legal consequences for them?
4. If I take belongings with me, like my cell phone and laptop, that my parents purchased for me years ago, could that be considered as stealing from them?
5. After I leave my parents' place, is there any way for me to come back and retrieve the rest of my stuff without having to interact with my parents directly?
6. What can I tell my parents in terms of legal facts of what they can and can't do? I think by giving them factual information on what they can and cannot do legally, they will be less likely to resort to extreme measures. I am still open to having a relationship with them in the future, just not right now because they are literally holding me hostage.

Thanks in advance for reading my post and for any advice you may have. I can clarify any questions as well, I tried to make my post as succinct as possible so I left out some things that I thought were non\-essential to the story.",legaladvice,1249

I decided to compile a list of things that the Sonics have done more recently than each team in the league. 

&amp;nbsp;


| Team Name | Thing the Sonics have done more recently  | Explanation  | Odds this changes within 5 years |
|:-----------:|:------------:|:------------:|:--------------:
Atlanta Hawks | Win an NBA title | The last time the Hawks won an NBA title was in 1958. The Sonics won their only title in 1979. | 3% You never know.
Boston Celtics | be coached by Bill Russell | The last time the Celtics were coached by Bill Russell was in 1969. The Sonics were coached by Bill Russell in 1977. | 0% Russell is too old to coach again.
Brooklyn Nets | had their city fight to keep them | The New Jersey Nets fans didnt really fight super hard to keep them in Jersey. Seattle fought to keep the Sonics as recently as 2008. | 0% Brooklyn is not going to move again.
Charlotte Hornets |  win 50 games | The Hornets have never won 50 games in a season. The Sonics won 50 in 2005. | 10% a lot can change in 5 years.
Chicago Bulls | Change their logo | The Bulls last changed their logo in 1966/67. The Sonics last changed theirs in 2008. | 0% It's been around for 50 years, it'll be around for 5 more.

Because the Timberwolves finally made the playoffs this year, they now have made the playoffs more recently than the Seattle Supersonics. I decided to compile a list of things that the Sonics have done more recently than each team in the league.

jordonkry,2018-06-12 04:39:37+00:00,[OC] Ranking all 30 Teams by Attractiveness,"It is the offseason, my dudes, and you know what that means; low-effort shitposts! But this is not one of those. Actually, this took way too much time, but I was already too committed by the time I wanted to give up.

But anyway, as the title implies, I'm going to be ranking each NBA team by how attractive on average their players are. [If you want to just see the rankings of all the individual players, here's a google doc.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n27aE8NbcZt0YyIfkL-a6pLsG46OMsqoe_EMImwnfXM/edit?usp=sharing).

Before I start, there's a few things I should get out of the way. First off, only players who were on the team at the end of the season counts. Any two-way player who played in at least 15 games for their team counted.

Also, before you come at me saying ""you fucking idiot there is no way x is more/less attractive than y"", keep these two things in mind. First, this is all the opinion of a 16-year-old girl (so no, you can't call me gay). Also, pretty much all of these numbers are completely arbitrary and just the first number I thought of. The only number that really means anything is 5, which was that I had literally no opinion. So odds are if there's some egregious ranking that puts someone over someone else, I probably agree with you, but I'm too lazy to keep consistent. There's also a chance I fucked up my math because I'm a dumbass. So without further ado, onto the rankings.


**30. Sacramento Kings- 4.80 avg**
Turns out, the Sacramento Kings are the ugliest group of players in the league. Frank Mason III (6.55) and Iman Shumpert (6.35) lead this team in looks, but it all goes downhill from there, with players like JaKarr Sampson (4.25), Nigel Hayes (4.15), De'Aaron Fox (4.00), Justin Jackson (3.95), and Kosta Koufos (2.90) really bring this team down.


**29. Milwaukee Bucks- 4.93 avg**
Before I even thought about these rankings, I just assumed the Bucks would be the ugliest team in the league. And I was almost right. When Delly (6.15) is your second most attractive player, it can only get worse from there. The Bucks have some of the ugliest players in the league in Thon Maker and Tony Snell (3.75) and the ugliest in Tyler Zeller (1.25).


**28. Brooklyn Nets- 4.97 avg**
With Nik Stauskas being the most attractive player (6.45), it's pretty bad in Brooklyn. Timofey Mozgov (4.00), Allen Crabbe (4.20), and pretty much the entire team are some ugly motherfuckers, and Joe Harris (6.35) and D'Angelo Russell (6.10) couldn't salvage them.


**27. Atlanta Hawks- 5.04 avg**
Miles Plumlee (6.25) is the only player above a 6, and with 6 players all being sub-5 (with Taurean Prince at a 3.95), the Hawks are ugly as shit. Maybe that's why no one goes to their games.


**26. Los Angeles Clippers- 5.05 avg**
I barely even knew anyone on the Clippers before doing this. Lou Williams (6.60) and DeAndre Jordan (6.35) are decent looking, but this team also has Boban (3.25). This team also has probably the most difficult to rank player on here. Milos Teodosic (5.50) has some pictures where he looks like a homeless man, but others where he looks like a really attractive homeless man.


**25. Miami Heat- 5.07 avg**
I swear to God, looking at these Heat players I wasn't totally convinced they were real NBA players and not created 2k ones. Hassan Whiteside (6.70) is decent looking, and this team definitetly were saved from being really fucking ugly from that. The number of players over and under 5.00 are equal, but there's also a 3.05 Kelly Olynyk in there.


**24, 23, 22, and 21. Toronto Raptors, New Orleans Pelicans, Portland Trail Blazers, and New York Knicks- 5.10 avg**
Yup, we have a 4-way tie. Starting off with the Raptors, no one on this team is really ugly, with C.J. Miles (4.75) and Pascal Siakam (4.45) being the ugliest players. The thing is, no one is really attractive, either, with Demar DeRozan (5.75) being the most attractive. The Pelicans have DeMarcus Cousins (7.95), and Anthony Davis (6.00), but things get messy after that.  The Trail Blazers suffer from the same fate as the Raptors, with no one hideous, but no one really attractive (Wade Baldwin is the most attractive at a 5.95). Lastly, the Knicks got a couple of European cuties in Porzingis (7.05) and Enes Kanter (6.85), but Jarrett Jack (4.30), Joakim Noah (4.15), Michael Beasley (4.10), Troy Williams (4.05), and Ron Baker (4.00) completely kill them.


**20. Orlando Magic- 5.20 avg**
Fuck I really don't know anyone on this team. Like, I haven't even heard of over half of these people. Vucevic (6.25) and Aaron Gordon (6.10) are both solid, but this team really suffers from a lack of really
 attractive players and also from just some below average guys like Shelvin Mack (4.80), Rodney Purvis (4.80), and Mo Speights (4.50).


**19, 18, and 17. Houston Rockets, Denver Nuggets, and Phoenix Suns- 5.23 avg**
Another tie here. I didn't even realize the Rockets were one of the less attractive teams, but after Chris Paul (8.00) there's a pretty big drop off to Gerald Green (6.15) and Nene (5.55). Chris Paul really saved them, because a team with James Harden (4.70) and Zhou Qi (3.95) is just destined to fail. The Nuggets are yet another team without anyone really hideous, with Will Barton (4.70) being the ugliest, but at the same time Jamal Murray (6.40) wasn't enough to carry the team. Finishing off the 5.23s, besides Booker (7.05) and Tyson Chandler (6.25) they have a lot of guys hovering around average, with Dragan Bender (4.70) at the bottom. (Side note: I find Bender kinda cute, but in an ugly way, kinda like pugs).


**16. Chicago Bulls- 5.24 avg**
Finishing off the below-NBA-average teams, my Chicago Bulls feature the love of my life Lauri Markkanen (7.60) and the technically more attractive Zach LaVine (7.65). Looking at the top, you wouldn't think that the Bulls would be that ugly, with guys like Kris Dunn (6.40) and Robin Lopez (6.15). There's some ugly pieces of shit on our team though, like Shrek (4.15) Cam Payne (4.00), Jerian Grant (3.85), and Omer Asik (3.80).


**15. Detroit Pistons- 5.26 avg**
I assumed the Pistons would be really ugly. Turns out, I only assumed that because they're another one of those phantom teams where I only know what like 3 of the players look like. The team in general is pretty average, but Blake Griffin (7.35), Jon Leuer (6.10) and Andre Drummond (6.00) help bring up the average. Not only that, out of the  7 sub-5 players, only 2 are below 4.85, those being Henry Ellenson (4.75) and Anthony Tolliver (4.60).


**14. Dallas Mavericks- 5.27 avg**
I kinda have a crush on Dirk (6.15) and I definitely ranked him too high, but fuck it. Maxi Kleber (6.35), DSJ (6.05), and J.J. Barea (5.60) don't have crazy high scores, but all the guys on this team are generally not-ugly enough so that even Salah Mejri (4.15) didn't completely kill this team.


**13. Charlotte Hornets- 5.28 avg**
I'm actually pretty surprised by this. I actually probably messed up my math, but I'm too lazy to check it. I mean, can Kemba Walker (7.50) and Dwight Howard (7.10) really make up for the sins of Treveon Graham (4.65) and Frank Kaminsky (3.80)? I guess.


**12. Minnesota Timberwolves- 5.32 avg**
No one is really ugly on this team. Cole Aldrich (4.95), Jamal Crawford (4.90), Marcus Georges-Hunt (4.90), and Tyus Jones (4.85) are the ugliest of them all. Throw in a D Rose (7.75) and you've got yourself a borderline top-10 team.


**11. Indiana Pacers- 5.33 avg**
Much like the Timberwolves, the bottom players on this team aren't even that low, with Cory Joseph (4.95), Ike Anigbogu (4.95), Thaddeus Young (4.80), and T.J. Leaf (4.75) being the only below 5 players. On top of that, there's some pretty good looking guys on here as well, like Oladipo (6.55), Domantas Sabonis (6.35), and Lance Stephenson (5.85).


**10. Memphis Grizzlies- 5.35 avg**
Kicking off the top 10 we have... the Memphis Grizzlies? I mean, sure. Whatever. Chandler Parsons (7.45) may suck at basketball now, but he's still got a pretty face. Mike Conley (7.15) is a lot more attractive than I realized, and Marc Gasol (6.05) and Kobi Simmons (6.00) aren't too bad looking themselves.


**9. Washington Wizards- 5.36 avg**
John Wall (7.45) is a very attractive man. Kelly Oubre (6.40) is also attractive. Hey, would you look at that, Bradley Beal (6.25) and Markieff Morris (6.00) are also good looking. I don't really give a shit about the Wizards. 


**8. Oklahoma City Thunder- 5.38 avg**
Can I just get out the way that I fucking despise the Oklahoma City Thunder as a basketball team? Okay? Okay. But they are a very attractive team. ""Playoff P"" (still waiting to meet him) and Carmelo ""Literal Trash Can"" Anthony (7.95) make up for Raymond Felton (4.45) and Kyle Singler (4.40). Not Carmelo, Abrines (6.00) also helps contribute to this team's average. 


**7. Los Angeles Lakers- 5.41 avg**
Another team I didn't expect, the Lakers have some ugly ass players on their team. I just realized I forgot Alex Caruso, which definetely helped them out, because that hairline is an automatic 4.00. Anyway, there's some pretty unattractive guys on the team, like Ivica Zubac (4.40) and ROY Finalist Andre Ingram (4.65). But they also have the likes of Isaiah Thomas (7.55), Lonzo Ball (6.95), Slenderman (6.85) and Kuzma (5.95), who I just realized I ranked too high. This whole one I kinda fucked up. Y'all got lucky.


**6. San Antonio Spurs- 5.42 avg**
I overrated Manu (6.55) because I'm madly in love with him, similar to how I overrated Dirk. Manu was fine when he was younger, but he's currently old enough to be my dad which is kinda weird I guess. Anyway, Kawhi (8.00) is what really takes this team over the top, but it's really a team effort, much like the real Spurs. Danny Green (5.75) and LaMarcus Aldridge (5.55) also add to this team average, and only 4 players are below 5, with Derrick White (4.75) being the lowest.


**5. Philadelphia 76ers- 5.51 avg**
Kicking off the top 5, we have the Philadelphia 76ers. J.J. Redick (8.95) is hot as hell, Ben Simmons (7.00) doesn't look that much like the Mona Lisa, Joel Embiid (6.85) is good looking, and T.J. McConnell (6.70) is a cutie. If it weren't for RoCo (4.35) and Dario (3.45), this team would be even higher.


**4. Boston Celtics- 5.71 avg**
I honestly considered including coaches just because Brad Stevens is such a DILF. But still, the Celtics are borderline top 3. I mean, how can a team with Gordon Hayward (8.75) be ugly? Have you seen that man? That glow up gives all ugly people (like me) hope. Throw in a Kyrie (8.00) with that smile, a Jayson Tatum (7.15), a Marcus Smart (6.80, don't @ me), Jaylen Brown (6.50), and, hell, even Al Horford (6.15) and you've got yourself a superteam. They got a few ugly sons of bitches holding them back, like Aron Baynes (4.30), Guerschon Yabusele (4.00), and Daniel Theis (4.00), but it's still not enough to keep them from being at the top of the attractiveness scale.


**3. Utah Jazz- 5.75 avg**
Ricky Rubio (9.00) is one of the few men that can only be described with ""beautiful"". Raul Neto (7.45) is a Brazilian babe. Donovan Mitchell (7.15), Thabo Sefolosha (6.35), Rudy Gobert (6.15), and Jonas Jerebko (6.00) only add on to the beauty that is this Utah Jazz team. They do have Alec Burks (4.50) and Ekpe Udoh (4.40) but... Ricky Rubio.


**2. Golden State Warriors- 5.80 avg**
For once, the Warriors aren't the best at something. Just like when it comes to actual basketball, their big 4 of Steph Curry (9.00), Klay Thompson (8.25), Kevin Durant (7.75), and Swaggy P (7.75) really make this team elite, not to mention Andre Iguodala (6.15). However, their weakness is in the center position, with Kevon Looney (4.30), Javale McGee (4.15), and Zaza Pachulia (4.00) killing the average.


**1. Cleveland Cavaliers- 5.86 average**
They couldn't get it done in the Finals, but the Cavs got the best of the Warriors when it comes to most attractive. Let's just get this out of the way; [Kevin Wesley Love is gorgeous.](http://phi-lophobic.tumblr.com/post/124569814674/if-you-think-he-isnt-hot-theres-probably-smth) I mean, [just look at him.](http://heybelinda.tumblr.com/post/128933134805/kevin-love-on-late-night-with-seth-meyers) I gave him a 9.15, which I'm pretty sure is the highest I gave anyone, which may or may not be accurate. There's like 3 ugly people on this team. Ante Zizic and Jose Calderon (4.50) aren't even that ugly, but yeak Perk (4.00) is. Hell, there's barely even anyone *average* on this team. Korver (7.65). LeBron (7.00). JR (6.75). Cedi (6.35). TT (6.25). Y'all may have gotten swept, but at least you looked fine doing it.

This is my first time doing this, anything I am getting wrong about the cap or anything else it would be great to list in the comments.

1. I will be using the projected cap of $101m
2. Lebron will not take anything less than the 'Max' in Free Agency (35&amp;#37; of cap = $35.35m). He has publically stated he would not do this again (He did in MIA) in order to protect players.
3. If Lebron leaves, Dan Gilbert will value getting below the tax line ($120m) over anything else to avoid a very high repeater tax (This will be used in sign\-and\-trades)

**Lakers Cap Situation**

In the cap table below, for each team I will put their current gtd contracts, along with along potential players going into FA that they may want to re\-sign. (Pick projections from [https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/info/rookie\_scale/2019](https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/info/rookie_scale/2019))

|Player|2018\-2019 Salary|
|:-|:-|
|Luol Deng|$18,000,000|
|Lonzo Ball|$7,461,960|
|Brandon Ingram|$5,757,120|
|Tyler Ennis|$1,656,092|
|Kyle Kuzma|$1,689,840|
|Josh Hart|$1,655,160|
|Ivica Zubac|$1,544,951|
|Thomas Bryant|$1,378,242|
|Pick #25|$1,455,700|
|Julius Randle|$0 (Restricted FA)|
|Isaiah Thomas|$0 (UFA)|
|KCP|$0 (UFA)|
|Total Cap|$40,599,065|

As seen above, there are **no** moves that the Lakers would have to do to sign Lebron to a max. In fact, signing Lebron would only get them to $76m, allowing them to potentially sign other FAs / Julius Randle. This is even including Deng's $18m contract. However, is the current roster enough to get Lebron to sign? Unlikely.

(Note: A sign\-and trade for Lebron is unlikely, as to make the trade they would need to be able to get contracts to match up)

Now onto the bigger question, how do they get Lebron **AND** Paul George?

Paul George's Max Contract is 30&amp;#37; of the cap ($30.3m). As of right now, the Lakers would not have the cap room in order to sign him ($40.6 \+ 30.3 \+ 35.3 = 106.2) but they are close. They would want to shed approximately $5m in contracts.

The only way the Lakers (and any other team for that matter) to get rid of guaranteed contracts is to trade them to another team with the cap space to take them (and likely add assets along with the trade). Let's see what it would take in order to try to trade Luol Deng to another team.

The first question is, who has the cap space to take Luol Deng's contract ($18m) next year? We will be using this list for other teams as well. (Data from [http://www.spotrac.com/nba/cap/](http://www.spotrac.com/nba/cap/) looking at the ""Practical Cap Space"")

|Cap Space Available|Team|
|:-|:-|
|Chicago Bulls|$41.5m|
|Philadelphia 76ers|$30.5m|
|Atlanta Hawks|$29.2m|
|Sacramento Kings|$24.6m|
|Dallas Mavericks|$23.9m|
|Houston Rockets|$22.0m|
|Brooklyn Nets|$16.7m|
|Orlando Magic|$15.1m|

We can cross some teams off this list. The Sixers and Rockets aren't going to be looking to take on dud contracts. That leaves the Bulls, Hawks, Kings, Mavs, Nets, and Magic (The Nets and Magic would have to give up enough in cap in order to keep it below $18m). Also note that Deng is not a 1 year deal. He will make 18.8m in 2019\-2020.

However, do all of these teams **really** have this cap room? (Stay with me, this analysis will be helpful in future articles, especially the Rockets). Let's look at each team individually.

Bulls \- The Bulls have a very intriguing player to deal with this offseason, Zach Lavine. He wants a max deal (which would get him $25m). Let's say the Bulls pull some Magic and sign him for $18m and get Vonleh for cheap ($2m). They also have to take on the #7 pick ($3.7m). There's no other big players for them to resign. I think it is reasonable that Chicago would have $18m to take on a Deng contract. They will stay on the list.

Hawks \- The Hawks will stay, they are only going to definitely add the #3 pick ($5.4m). They are also a team that will likely look to tank next year, making this look better.

Kings \- The Kings have to add the #2 pick ($5.3m) already taking them close to being under $18m. However, looking at their contract situation, I don't see them having to sign anyone else. But, Sacramento has a lot of contracts ending next year. They would presumably like to start with a clean slate in 2019\-2020 with a young core of Fox, Luca, Bogdan, and Buddy, and cap space to try to put something together. They likely wouldn't want Deng's $18.8m 2019\-2020 contract holding them down. We'll keep them on the list, but they are going to need to acquire a lot of assets in return for a trade.

Mavs \-  Definitely some tank potential here taking on Deng. However, there's some questions on what they will do with Nerlens / Seth Curry / Yogi Ferrell. Keep them on the list for now though. The mavs pick at #5 ($4.4m).

Nets \- I am going to take the Nets off the list. In order to make the trade for Deng, they would have to send back at least $2.3m in contracts. That would likely require some combination of young\-ish talent. I don't see them making this trade.

Magic \- The Magic have to sign Aaron Gordon. Not on list.

**What Assets do the Lakers have to give up?**

Assets include: 2017 picks 25, 47

2018 1st round pick

2019 1st round pick

2020 1st round pick

A bunch of 2nd round picks

Josh Hart ($1.6m)

I don't see them trading any of their other young talent (Lonzo / Ingram / Kuzma) in a cap dump and don't consider Ennis / Zubac / Bryant as 'assets'

**So what does a trade to dump Deng really look like?**

In order for teams to make up space to get these players, there may be some competition trying to unload big contracts. What will it take, say, the Hawks to take his contract? Because note, by taking Deng at $18m, they lose the opportunity to say, take Ryan Anderson at $20m and potentially get better assets. A trade that I think seems reasonable and fair for everyone is **Deng \+ #25 for a protected 2nd rounder to the Hawks** (or any of the teams listed above).

**If this trade goes through, now what?**

If the Lakers end up unloading Deng (and giving up pick #25) they will save an additional $19.5m. This would bring them to only **$21m** in gtd contracts. This would allow them to still get Lebron, PG **and** still have \~$14m left in contracts, along with the Room\-Level Exception (worth $4.5m/year). This would likely allow them to keep Julius Randle **and** get some old vets willing to take a pay\-cut to play with Lebron / PG (Aaron Afflalo, Trevor Ariza, Jeff Green, Ian Clark, Gerald Green, etc.).

Suddenly, this starts to look appealing, doesn't it? Their starting lineup would be:

PG: Lonzo

SG: Ingram

SF: PG

PF: Lebron

C: Randle? Kuzma? Random FA (Channing Frye re\-sign?)

With a bench of Josh Hart and re\-treads coming over for a ring.

This team starts to look like a team that can switch a lot defensively and has some potential. Can Lonzo work with Bron? He said he wants to work off ball more, time will tell. Perhaps Lonzo could get traded as well? All I'm saying here is that going to LAL with PG instantly makes them a contender. Better than GSW and HOU? No. Do they have a chance in a 7\-game series? Probably.

ZandrickEllison,2018-06-10 18:01:31+00:00,[OC] Projecting the Future for Each Possible LeBron Team,"If you hadn't heard, LeBron James may become a free agent this summer. He'll have his fair share of suitors -- essentially every team in the league. In order to help LeBron make up his mind, I'm going to run through each possible destination for him, and project their **chances to win in 2018-19.** 

Now to do that, we can't simply add LeBron James into each lineup. We need some semblance of reality here. Instead, we're going to have to chart a semi-plausible path to that team getting LeBron. They either need the $30M+ it'd take to sign him in free agency, or work out a sign and trade package that the Cavaliers would actually accept. 

Keep in mind, this is me running through these ""simulations"" fairly quickly, so feel free to criticize my roster decisions or my projected results. 

######**THE LEBRON SIMULATION SERIES**

**Atlanta Hawks**

*how they get LeBron*

The Hawks have around $25-30M in cap space, which isn't too far away from the max that LeBron James would need. It's certainly possible for them to get to that mark. They can ""stretch"" Miles Plumlee (who somehow makes $12M a year) or attach an asset (they have three R1 picks) in order to get rid of him. 

*the LeBron lineup*

PG: Dennis Schroeder

SG: Kent Bazemore

SF: LeBron James

PF: John Collins

C: Dewayne Dedmon (FA) / # 3 pick Marvin Bagley

*how they do with LeBron*

While the Hawks have *some* talent, it may be diminishing returns for scorers like Dennis Schroeder or John Collins to play off the ball with LeBron running the show; neither are great spacers. The Hawks have a bumpy ride all season, finishing 45-37 and earning the # 7 seed. The team gives # 2 Boston a fight in R1, but lose 4-2. In hindsight, trading the # 3 pick for another veteran may have been a better way to contend in 2018-19. Not off to a great start, GM Zan.

**Boston Celtics**

*how they get LeBron*

With no cap space at their disposal, Danny Ainge and the club will have to work on a sign and trade. Fortunately for them, they have all sorts of assets to dangle Cleveland's way. The ones with the highest price tag would be either Kyrie Irving or Gordon Hayward; either one plus some change may make the salaries work. Given their history, we'll say the Celts shed Irving over Hayward (although ""fit wise"" it may be better in reverse.)

*the LeBron lineup*

PG: Terry Rozier / Marcus Smart

SG: Jayson Tatum / Jaylen Brown

SF: Gordon Hayward

PF: LeBron James

C: Al Horford

*how they do with LeBron*

Watch out, East. Not only would this Celtics' squad be loaded, they'd be coached by Brad Stevens. Better yet, they'd have the depth on the wing to allow LeBron James some much needed rest during the regular season. Let's pencil them in for a 62-20 regular season record before they turn on the gas and crush the East in the playoffs. Would they beat Golden State in the Finals...? This new look team may be a little short on shooting and chemistry, so we'll give them a 4-3 Finals loss. If LeBron could have made amends with Kyrie, it may have been a different story.

**Brooklyn Nets**

*how they get LeBron*

Despite the lack of talent on the roster, Sean Marks and company don't have loads of cap room to offer: only around $15-20M. As a result, they're going to have to work hard to make this math work. Timo Mozgov is a big salary that they can try to work a sign and trade with, but he'd have to come with plenty of assets attached -- maybe D'Angelo Russell, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, *and* Caris LeVert.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG: Jeremy Lin / Spencer Dinwiddie

SG: Allen Crabbe

SF: DeMarre Carroll

PF: LeBron James

C: Jarrett Allen

*how they do with LeBron*

Here on the Nets, LeBron James would have some decent spacing to work with, but the key would be determining how ""ready"" second-year center Jarrett Allen may be. It's unlikely that the talented Allen would take a major leap this soon, which, along with the depth the team lost in the dealmaking would leave them short-handed. The Nets struggle and finish 44-38. They give Philadelphia a tough battle but lose 4-2 in R1.

**Charlotte Hornets**

*how they get LeBron*

Maxed out with nearly $120M on the books, new GM Mitch Kupchak will have to engineer a decent trade. Nicolas Batum ($24M) is the big salary on the board, but his stock has stagnated. Instead, let's package MKG ($13M), Cody Zeller ($14M), and Jeremy Lamb ($7M.) 

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Kemba Walker

SG:	Nicolas Batum / Malik Monk 

SF:	LeBron James

PF:	Marvin Williams

C:	Dwight Howard

*how they do with LeBron*

If they can actually swing a sign and trade, this Charlotte Hornets lineup looks pretty well balanced all the way around. They have enough vets to win 53 games and grab a top 3 seed. Their upside may be determined by how quickly Malik Monk can develop into the dead-eye shooter he showed in college. Presuming he's still another year away, so this team would battle Boston but fall 4-3 in R2.

**Chicago Bulls**

*how they get LeBron*

With $40M+ in cap room, the Chicago Bulls can simply sign LeBron James to a max. But if we presume they do that, let's say they allow erratic scorer and RFA Zach LaVine to chase big money elsewhere.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Kris Dunn

SG:	Justin Holiday / Denzel Valentine 

SF:	LeBron James

PF:	Lauri Markkanen / Bobby Portis

C:	Robin Lopez / # 7 pick Mo Bamba

*how they do with LeBron*

Personally I'm a fan of the young Bulls, so I'm higher on this team than others may be. Kris Dunn has the potential to be an elite on-ball defender and Lauri Markkanen can provide the complementary spacing. He may remind LeBron too much of Kevin Love as a PF/C, but that's still good enough to win 51 games and grab a 3 seed. I'll say the young guns step up to the plate and knock off Philly in R2, before ultimately falling 4-2 to Boston in the Eastern Conference Finals.

**Cleveland Cavaliers**

*how they get LeBron*

Simply strap him down and force him to stay. 

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	George Hill

SG:	J.R. Smith / Jordan Clarkson 
 
SF:	LeBron James / Kyle Korver / # 8 pick Mikal Bridges

PF:	Kevin Love

C:	Tristan Thompson / Larry Nance

*how they do with LeBron*

In terms of projecting the upside of this Cavs team, a lot depends on whether they can actually land the ""veteran"" rookie Mikal Bridges or re-sign Rodney Hood. At their best, both can serve as 3+D wings and complementary scorers. If LeBron actually stays, this team should also benefit from another year of chemistry. I'll say they improve to 53 wins and advance to the Eastern Conference Finals, battling with Boston again. But alas, the coaching and defensive deficit leads to a 4-3 loss.

**Dallas Mavericks**

*how they get LeBron*

The rebuilding Mavs have the cap space to sign LeBron James outright. 

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Dennis Smith Jr.

SG:	Wes Matthews

SF:	LeBron James / Doug McDermott

PF:	Harrison Barnes

C:	Dirk Nowitzki / # 5 pick Jaren Jackson Jr.

*how they do with LeBron*

This new look Mavs team would be a hodgepodge of the young and the old in a way that may not be to their benefit. LeBron may actually murder shot-happy Dennis Smith Jr. by midseason. So while I like the fit with Wes Matthews and Harrison Barnes, I foresee a stumbling 46 win season here, and a R1 loss to New Orleans. Again, the team may have considered trading their young talent for vets, but their GM Zandrick got too lazy to look around for offers.

**Denver Nuggets**

*how they get LeBron*

Maxed out, the Denver Nuggets would need to figure out a trade package. Paul Millsap ($30M) may still be seen as a slight asset, so let's give him the benefit of the doubt here and make that the offer. The Cavs would presumably flip Millsap elsewhere after.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Jamal Murray

SG:	Gary Harris 

SF:	LeBron James

PF:	Wilson Chandler / Kenneth Faried

C:	Nikola Jokic / Mason Plumlee

*how they do with LeBron*

The offense around LeBron James may be deadly here. Jamal Murray in particular is on the verge of breaking out, and could be an ideal spacer for LeBron. I'll pencil the Nuggets in for 54 wins and a # 4 seed in the tough West, where they draw a tough matchup with Golden State in R2. Unfortunately, there may be too many limitations on defense (especially with Nikola Jokic) to get past that barrier. 4-2 Warriors.

**Detroit Pistons**

*how they get LeBron*

Maxed out, the Pistons need to work a trade here. Given Blake Griffin's bloated salary and history of injuries, it'd be hard to convince a team to take his contract on. Fortunately for them, this is a silly exercise so they manage to sweet talk Dan Gilbert into making it happen (with the intention to flip him elsewhere.)

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Reggie Jackson / Ish Smith

SG:	Luke Kennard 

SF:	Reggie Bullock

PF:	LeBron James

C:	Andre Drummond

*how they do with LeBron*

With a big man rebounder down low and decent spacing on the wings, the recipe appears there for a solid LeBron team. Again, I'd pencil them in around 48 wins and the 4 seed in the East. The question when it comes to the playoffs would be Reggie Jackson, and whether he can provide the (efficient) complementary scoring to help push them through the tougher teams in the conference. I doubt it. A bitter R2 loss.

**Golden State Warriors**

*how they get LeBron*

With nearly $130M committed in salary, we have to consider a trade here. The only realistic scenario would be to offer Draymond Green or Klay Thompson (with Andre Iguodala attached.) Both would be difficult losses to overcome, but the Cavs push for Klay Thompson and get him. Harsh. But necessary.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Stephen Curry

SG:	Nick Young / Shaun Livingston 

SF:	Kevin Durant

PF:	LeBron James

C:	Draymond Green / Jordan Bell

*how they do with LeBron*

Losing Klay Thompson would sting badly. For a while. In fact, it may take these new look Warriors some time to find their rhythm, giving them a ""disappointing"" 64 wins on the year. But by the time the playoffs roll around, they find their groove and show just how dominant their superstar trio can be; after all, these may be the top overall 3 players in the entire NBA. The Warriors CRUSH the playoff competition, going 16-2 en route to an easy NBA title.

**Houston Rockets**

*how they get LeBron*

The Rockets have about $20M or so in free space, and would have about $10M more if they stretch Ryan Anderson and Nene. Is that enough to land LeBron? Not really. But hey, maybe LeBron would be so determined to beat Golden State that he'd agree to a discount. Even if Chris Paul and Clint Capela did the same and the team let Trevor Ariza walk, the luxury tax would be obscene. But hey, that's the price of chasing history.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Chris Paul

SG:	James Harden / Eric Gordon 

SF:	LeBron James

PF:	P.J. Tucker

C:	Clint Capela

*how they do with LeBron*

We're *stretching* to find a way to squeeze LeBron James onto this team, but that Dhalsim-level yoga paid off with a three-headed monster that would have lineup balance to boot. The Rockets win 66 games and square off in an epic showdown with the Golden State Warriors. And here, they squeak it out 4-3! From there, Houston crushes Boston 4-1 in the Finals and wins the title.

**Indiana Pacers**

*how they get LeBron*

The Pacers have about $25M in cap room and can make some moves (encouraging Thaddeus Young to leave or trading him, declining Lance Stephenson/Al Jefferson) to sneak LeBron onto the roster.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Darren Collison / Cory Joseph

SG:	Victor Oladipo 

SF:	Bojan Bogdanovic

PF:	LeBron James

C:	Myles Turner / Domatas Sabonis

*how they do with LeBron*

While Victor Oladipo may be the ideal secondary scorer to take pressure off LeBron James, he doesn't exactly have the ideal skill set to play alongside him (unless he shoots as well as he did in 2017-18). As a result, this team finishes with 52 wins and a disappointing # 3 seed. They power up and best the Sixers in R2, but stumble and lose 4-2 to Boston in the Eastern Conference Finals.

**Los Angeles Clippers**

*how they get LeBron*

Maxed out, the Clippers will need to get creative to find a LeBron James trade that makes sense from Cleveland's perspective. They can package Tobias Harris ($15M), Austin Rivers ($12M), and draft picks to make it happen. 

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Patrick Beverly / Milos Teodosic

SG:	Louis Williams 

SF:	LeBron James

PF:	Danilo Gallinari 

C:	DeAndre Jordan

*how they do with LeBron*

Trading for LeBron (and extending DeAndre Jordan) will hurt the Clippers in terms of their depth. So while I love the idea of Patrick Beverly being an attack dog 3+D PG, there may not be enough defense on the wings to help this team get over the hump. The LeBron Clippers win 51 games, but stumble in R2 of the playoffs.

**Los Angeles Lakers**

*how they get LeBron*

Magic Johnson and the Lakers have as much cap space as any team, bolstering $60M+ in the bank. They can certainly sign LeBron James to a max, but the question is: what else? Let's go for the gusto here. They can ALSO sign Paul George and maybe even work a sign and trade for DeMarcus Cousins if they attach some younger assets like Kyle Kuzma and Julius Randle to make the math work.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Lonzo Ball

SG:	Paul George

SF:	Brandon Ingram

PF:	LeBron James 

C:	DeMarcus Cousins

*how they do with LeBron*

While this may be a star-studded team, they would have to rely on a few youngsters in Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram who may not be ready for prime time yet. As a result, the 55-win Lakers roll into the playoffs with massive expectations, only to get the boot by Houston in R2. However, if Ball and Ingram can keep improving, this may have the look of a juggernaut in 2019 and beyond.

**Memphis Grizzlies**

*how they get LeBron*

With $100M in salaries committed, the Grizzlies would struggle to find a way to land LeBron James. They can't simply offer Chandler Parsons' massive contract, because no one wants that. However, if they did attach the # 4 pick along with that? That would be enough for the rebuilding Cavs to accept a bunch of dead weight. 

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Mike Conley

SG:	Ben McLemore 

SF:	LeBron James

PF:	JaMychal Green 

C:	Marc Gasol

*how they do with LeBron*

You can't find a steadier trio than Mike Conley + LeBron James + Marc Gasol, although the supporting cast would be questionable beyond that (re-signing Tyreke Evans may help.) The team has a strong regular season with 53 wins, but doesn't have enough switchable pieces to handle the Golden State Warriors, who knock them off 4-2 in R2. 

**Miami Heat**

*how they get LeBron*

The Miami Heat have one of the highest payrolls in the league with $120M+ committed, and would have a hard time finding appealing matching salaries in a trade. For their sake, let's say the Cavs are generous and accept a package of Goran Dragic, Justise Winslow, and returning hero Dion Waiters.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Tyler Johnson

SG:	Josh Richardson / Dwyane Wade 

SF:	LeBron James

PF:	James Johnson / Kelly Olynyk 

C:	Hassan Whiteside

*how they do with LeBron*

This rugged Miami Heat bunch would have a good amount of size, defense, and swagger. So while I'm only projecting they win 53 games (and land the # 3 seed) in the regular season, they'd be able to crank up that intensity and push hard in the playoffs. They battle back and forth with Boston in the ECF, eventually getting knocked out in a decisive Game 7.

**Milwaukee Bucks**

*how they get LeBron*

Another maxed out team that will need to find a workable sign and trade, the Milwaukee Bucks do have salaries to offer back. A deal for Tony Snell ($10M), Thon Maker, and FA Jabari Parker may be able the heart of a deal that makes sense for both sides,

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Eric Bledsoe / Malcolm Brogdon

SG:	Khris Middleton 

SF:	LeBron James 

PF:	Giannis Antetounkmpo

C:	John Henson

*how they do with LeBron*

So much for Greek Freaks -- this may be Mount Olympus. LeBron James and Giannis together wouldn't have much spacing to speak of, but the length and athleticism would be frightening. The team finishes with 59 wins and only a # 2 seed in the East because it may take some getting used to. That said, they'd have huge upside and enough talent to knock off Boston and advance to the Finals. There, they trade punches with Golden State but ultimately have a few lapses that lead to an epic 4-3 loss. Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither was Zeus' victory over the Kronos and the Titans.

**Minnesota Vikings**

*how they get LeBron*

The Wolves don't have the cap room to sign LeBron James outright, so they need to find a workable sign and trade. And here, they get creative. They get Dan Gilbert drunk and angry enough to agree to Andrew Wiggins, citing him as the fated savior of Cleveland from the start.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Jeff Teague

SG:	Jimmy Butler

SF:	LeBron James 

PF:	Taj Gibson

C:	Karl-Anthony Towns / Gorgui Dieng

*how they do with LeBron*

This team looks loaded on paper -- not only with veterans, but with tough and rugged defenders. The Thibodeau T-Wolves beat up on the competition with 63 wins and a # 2 seed, which allows them to advance to the WCF against Golden State. There, Thibs attempts to bring back ""Bully Bull"" to knock the Warriors off balance. Unfortunately for them, they can't match the consistent shooting of the Warriors, who win 4-2 in a great series.

**New Orleans Pelicans**

*how they get LeBron*

Capped out, the Pelicans have two choices: center a package around Jrue Holiday or a sign and trade DeMarcus Cousins. In terms of ""fit,"" you'd rather trade Boogie. But unfortunately for them, they don't control his rights. As a result, the team decides to send Jrue Holiday+Nikola Mirotic for LeBron, after which Boogie agrees to come back.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Rajon Rondo / Ian Clark

SG:	E'Twaun Moore 

SF:	LeBron James / Solomon Hill

PF:	Anthony Davis

C:	DeMarcus Cousins

*how they do with LeBron*

The size and skill of the new Pelicans frontcourt would be overwhelming, and potentially wreck the smallball NBA. The team racks up a 63 win season and a # 2 seed. Heading into the playoffs, the team feels like they have a great chance against Golden State with their ability to dominate on the glass. Unfortunately, they don't get that chance. Houston stuns them with superior guard play and chemistry, winning a shocker 4-2 in R2

**New York Knicks**

*how they get LeBron*

With no cap room, the Knicks need to work out an appealing trade package. They convince Dan Gilbert in the merits of Tim Hardaway + Enes Kanter, with an assist from the league office, which ""encourages"" the deal to help the New York market.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Frank Ntikilina / Trey Burke

SG:	Courtney Lee 

SF:	LeBron James 

PF:	Kristaps Porzingis / Lance Thomas

C:	# 7 pick Wendell Carter Jr.

*how they do with LeBron*

The fit with Porzingis (a true stretch big) and his buddy coach David Fizdale would be ideal, but the rest of the roster leaves a lot to be desired. It would be a rocky road for LeBron all season long, with a 44-38 record and a # 6 seed. For the first time, the Toronto Raptors get the better of the King, knocking them off 4-3 in R1.

**Oklahoma City Thunder**

*how they get LeBron*

With no cap room, Sam Presti needs to work out a trade. His only real options may be a package of Andre Roberson + Steven Adams, or a superstar in Russell Westbrook. Given the thin roster, Presti decides on dealing Westbrook and offering the angry local fans a free LeBron jersey to make up for it. On the bright side, Paul George happily re-ups with the team. 

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Ray Felton / FA Mario Chalmers

SG:	Andre Roberson 

SF:	Paul George 

PF:	LeBron James / Carmelo Anthony

C:	Steven Adams

*how they do with LeBron*

The huge hole at PG creates some real issues for the team all season long, but they make up for it with excellent defense from 2-5. LeBron works as a de facto PG and wins MVP by leading the team to 58 wins and a # 3 seed. Unfortunately, the more balanced and experienced (in their system) Rockets knock them off 4-3 in R2.

**Orlando Magic**

*how they get LeBron*

With nearly $20M in cap space, the Orlando Magic are fairly close to being in range for LeBron James, but wouldn't be able to offer him the max he seeks. Instead, they package together Nikola Vuevic and S&amp;T FA Aaron Gordon to make the deal happen. 

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	# 6 pick Trae Young / D.J. Augustin

SG:	Evan Fournier 

SF:	LeBron James 

PF:	Jonathan Isaac

C:	Bismack Biyombo

*how they do with LeBron*

Again we see a mix of LeBron + some youngsters, as the Magic struggle to get rookie Trae Young and Jonathan Isaac up to speed for a title run. The team wins a solid 47 games, but gets upset in R1. Magic fans grumble to Zan, wondering what the heck he's doing as GM. Although in Mr. Ellison's defense, Trae Young and Isaac should be a great pair to build around in the future.

**Philadelphia 76ers**

*how they get LeBron*

With cap room this summer, the Sixers should be able to sign LeBron James outright. In fact, they may even have room to bring back J.J. Redick, whom presumably wouldn't mind taking a haircut to chase a title.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Ben Simmons

SG:	J.J. Redick / Markelle Fultz 

SF:	Robert Covington 

PF:	LeBron James / Dario Saric

C:	Joel Embiid / # 10 pick Robert Williams

*how they do with LeBron*

While the spacing would not be ideal, the sheer size and athleticism of this unit would overwhelm the NBA. LeBron + the young pups crush it with 63 wins, grabbing the # 2 seed in the East and setting up an epic showdown against Kyrie Irving and Boston. The trouble here may be whether or not LeBron James is an ideal ""fit"" alongside Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid, a scoring center unlike any he's had before. Trying to figure that out on the fly with two youngsters may lead to inconsistent play, which allows Brad Stevens and Boston to beat them 4-3. On the plus side, an epic rivalry will develop between the two squads.

**Phoenix Suns**

*how they get LeBron*

With around $20M in cap space, the team may be able to squeeze enough room together to sign LeBron James outright. Offering their # 16 pick may allow them to shed Brandon Knight's salary, for example.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Elfrid Payton

SG:	Devin Booker 

SF:	T.J. Warren / Josh Jackson 

PF:	LeBron James / Jared Dudley

C:	# 1 pick DeAndre Ayton / Tyson Chandler

*how they do with LeBron*

The fit between LeBron James and a shooter like Devin Booker would be ideal, although there are some clunkier chemistry issues elsewhere as neither T.J. Warren nor Josh Jackson have that same spacing ability. That, coupled with a teenage center in DeAndre Ayton, leads to some growing pains. A 48 win season culminates in a R1 loss in the tough West.

**Portland Trail Blazers**

*how they get LeBron*

With $110M committed, Neil Olshey will have to work out a trade with Cleveland, ideally without breaking up his superstar backcourt. He could offer assets like Zach Collins, Al-Farouq Aminu, and hope that the Cavs would take back Evan Turner ($17M) to help make the math work. Does it? Sure why not. This is a made up exercise anyway. Maybe the team can involve RFA Jusuf Nurkic in a sign and trade to push it over the top.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Damian Lillard

SG:	C.J. McCollum 

SF:	Moe Harkless 

PF:	LeBron James

C:	Ed Davis / Meyers Leonard

*how they do with LeBron*

If the Blazers can actually acquire LeBron James AND keep their star guards, then they'd be a force to be reckoned with out West. After being a soft # 3 seed last year, LeBron pushes them up to 59 wins and a legit super team. There may be some doubts about their big men, but LeBron + shooting allows the team to beat Houston 4-2 in R2 before taking on Golden State in R3. Again, trying to figure out the chemistry issues in one season may be difficult against a more experienced and more defensive-minded Golden State squad, causing them to lose a heartbreaker, 4-3.

**Sacramento Kings**

*how they get LeBron*

With nearly $40M in cap room, Vlade Divac can essentially sign LeBron James outright. 

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	De’Aaron Fox

SG:	Buddy Hield / Iman Shumpert 

SF:	# 2 pick Luka Doncic / Bogdan Bogdanovic 

PF:	LeBron James

C:	Willie Cauley-Stein / Harry Giles

*how they do with LeBron*

This would be an awkward fit because the Kings are essentially all young talent while the actual ""King"" would want to win now. A trade for veterans may be in the cards here -- with the # 2 pick being a heck of a carrot to offer. Sacramento decides to play it out at first, but regrets their laziness when they stumble with a 44-38 record and get bounced in R1. That said, the roster composition should make sense once the kids develop. This may be a title team down the road.

**San Antonio Spurs**

*how they get LeBron*

The Spurs would need to figure out a trade scenario to the Cavs' liking, which may be difficult without including Kawhi Leonard or LaMarcus Aldridge. Best case, they may be able to cobble together an offer with Patty Mills, Pau Gasol, and a Kyle Anderson sign and trade. It wouldn't be enough to make it worth Cleveland's while, but perhaps the Spurs could push it through by including the # 18 pick and future R1 picks.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Dejounte Murray

SG:	Danny Green 

SF:	Kawhi Leonard 

PF:	LeBron James

C:	LaMarcus Aldridge

*how they do with LeBron*

If the Spurs could actually pull this roster off, it may be close to unbeatable. They have spacing, size, and great defenders on the wing. And of course, a great coach in Gregg Popovich. As a result, the team cruises to 66 wins in the regular season and the # 1 seed. But the big question is... could they top Golden State? The Warriors still may have more talent, but Pop's slight edge in terms of tactics over Steve Kerr may allow them to squeak out a 4-3 win. From there, the Spurs roll on to beat Boston 4-2 in the Finals.

**Toronto Raptors**

*how they get LeBron*

Capped out, Masai Ujiri will need to find a workable trade package. There may be some way to make the math work with Jonas Valanciunas and a hodgepodge of young talent, but the clearest path would be a straight up deal for DeMar DeRozan. DeRozan's youth makes him a more appealing asset than Kyle Lowry, although neither have a huge amount of trade value given their salaries.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Kyle Lowry 

SG:	C.J. Miles / Delon Wright

SF:	LeBron James / O.G. Anunoby

PF:	Serge Ibaka

C:	Jonas Valanciunas / Jakob Poeltl

*how they do with LeBron*

Despite joining a 59 win team, LeBron James may not be able to reverse the sagging momentum of this club. War dogs Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka are on the decline, and big Jonas Valanciunas may be not be a natural fit as a LeBron center either. There's still enough talent and depth here to crank out 60 wins and slug through to the ECF, where they enter as underdogs against Boston. Here, new coach Nick Nurse wisely switches to a faster lineup (with Ibaka or Poeltl at center), allowing them to win a 4-3 battle. But alas, they don't have quite enough to compete with Golden State, losing 4-2 in the Finals.

**Utah Jazz**

*how they get LeBron*

With only $15-20M in space, the Utah Jazz resort to a trade as well. There may be a path forward in that regard, perhaps with Ricky Rubio ($14M), Alec Burks ($11M) as a throw in, and a sign and trade with Dante Exum and Derrick Favors.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Donovan Mitchell

SG:	Jae Crowder

SF:	Joe Ingles

PF:	LeBron James

C:	Rudy Gobert

*how they do with LeBron*

The roster looks primed for success here, with a complementary scorer in Donovan Mitchell to take the pressure off, and a defensive force down low in Rudy Gobert, not to mention a glue guy in Joe Ingles and a top notch coach in Quin Snyder. As a result, the Jazz roar to 62 wins and a # 2 seed. The question in a matchup between them and Golden State would be whether Mitchell can shoot consistently well from deep, and whether Gobert can stay on the court. The doubt about both result in a stinging 4-2 loss to the Warriors in the WCF. 

**Washington Wizards**

*how they get LeBron*

While they may be capped out, the Wizards have a fairly easy path to make this math work. They would need to trade one of their ""big three,"" with Otto Porter being the most obvious candidate. The Cavs would likely agree to take the young wing on despite his hefty price tag, even with some cap filler attached. 

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	John Wall

SG:	Bradley Beal

SF:	LeBron James / Kelly Oubre

PF:	Markieff Morris

C:	Marcin Gortat / Ian Mahinmi

*how they do with LeBron*

The Wizards' strong starting five only gets better with LeBron James taking charge. He'd be a dream fit with Bradley Beal, although it may take some more time to work out the chemistry with a lead dog like John Wall. As a result, we'll peg them for 57 wins in the regular season and a # 2 seed. They storm into the battle with the favored Boston Celtics with an alpha dog mentality and no fear, allowing them to pull off the upset 4-2 win as they go small to match up. But against Golden State, the sleeker and cleaner-fit Warriors win a tough series, 4-2.

**OVERALL**

This may be inexact science (at best), but it does demonstrate how hard it will be to win the title no matter where LeBron James goes next year. Golden State is still absurdly good, and Boston will be a tough ""out"" in the East.

According to this exercise, LeBron James would lose in R1 with 8 teams, lose in R2 with 9 teams, lose in the Conference Finals with 6 teams, lose in the Finals with 4 teams, and win the title with 3 (Golden State, Houston, San Antonio.)

#MAGA ON PATRIOTS!




",The_Donald,2579
Xelif,2018-06-08 11:53:10+00:00,Trump targeted Canada. Every American should be outraged.,"On September 11th, 2001, there were two major news stories.

The first, of course, was the despicable attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

The second was Canada's reaction to those attacks and the events that followed. It went like this:

* America: ""Oh shit, we've been attacked by terrorists hijacking airliners. We don't know who they are, where they came from, or how many more of them are out there waiting to strike. Every airliner is a potential missile.""
* Canada: [""We've got your back. Send them here.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Yellow_Ribbon)

At 9:45, 8 minutes after the third plane hit the Pentagon, the FAA fully closed American airspace. Simultaneously, despite no apparent threats to the country, Transport Canada closes Canadian airspace as well - but unlike the US, does not ban incoming flights. Canada volunteered to accept all incoming transcontinental flights to the US - even though Canada, as a US ally, could very well be a target, and if terrorists took over planes diverted to Canada they could improvise and crash them into Canadian buildings.

When Canada volunteered to take all incoming flights, the danger had not yet passed. Flight 93 was hijacked at 9:28, but it didn't crash until 10:03 - and that was early, thanks to the brave passengers of that plane. Canada took in flights before the attack had even ended.

While the US was on fire, Canada was the one who ran into the burning building.

Most Atlantic flights were diverted to Gander International Airport. Gander, a town of 10,000 people, still has a huge airport because it used to be a key refueling stop on the Transatlantic route. It took in 38 wide body aircraft, which is 38 more wide body aircraft than Gander gets in a normal year. With a population of less than 10,000, Gander cared for over 6,600 guests in their time of need. Similar situations played out in Halifax, St. Johns and Moncton, and as most people could not be housed in hotels, thousands of Maritime Canadians opened their homes to passengers, providing room, board, and for those with friends and family in New York, a shoulder to cry on.

Gander is a big airport in a small town, so if an aircraft had been hijacked, the damage would have been tragic but minimal. But there's no such thing on the west coast. The only non-US airport on the Pacific coast capable of handling large aircraft is Vancouver International Airport, which is smack dab in the middle of Vancouver, BC. A foiled hijacker bound for Seattle or San Francisco or Los Angeles would have found many ripe targets in Vancouver. But Canadian authorities willingly landed dozens of Transpacific aircraft at Vancouver, despite the danger. As on the east coast, ordinary Vancouverites lined up to house thousands of passengers bound for the US in their own homes. Vancouver International's switchboard was overwhelmed with calls from people and companies asking how they could help.

We're liberals, and we're going to be bothered by most everything Trump does. But his recent disrespect of Canada should outrage every American who remembers 9/11, and it should motivate us to rise above lazy ""lol Trump"" and take action. Canada voluntarily took in 269 flights - at that time, 269 potential missiles - carrying nearly 50,000 passengers bound for the US. They didn't have to - they could have easily said tough luck and thrown the problem right back at the FAA. They did so out of pure friendship. 

Every time ""NINE ELEVEN!"" passes Rudy's rotting jaw, remind your Trump-supporting friends and family of how Canada had our back on 9/11. If you're the slacktivist type, consider tweeting at [your Canadian consulate](https://travel.gc.ca/assistance/embassies-consulates/united-states) to thank them for being #FriendsForever. And if you know any Canadians, thank them personally!",esist,10352

* ~640k* (House 1)

* ~510k* (House 2)

* ~332k** (House 3, currently pending sale for ~1.05m, I own about 1/3rd)

* ~321k (Vanguard as of Monday)

* ~52k (liquid)

**Total networth: 1.85M (give or take 100K based on RE estimation)**

**- value of both homes is an estimate based on current Zillow/Redfin estimations and the past ten years of personal experience in the industry after accounting for agent commission.  Numbers are fairly conservative, but can reasonably assume actual sale value plus or minus 50K for each.  Depending on market movement between now and time of sale value may further grow or shrink.*

***-This was a separate issue with my father.  Basicly Mom and Dad borrowed against our inheritance to finance the building of their retirement home.  After my mother's death, my father (who had designed the home himself, he's also an architect) couldn't bare to part with the home for about 8 years, at which point he remarried.  His new wife (quite reasonably I think) didn't want to live in his dead ex-wife's dream home and asked him to sell, which is being finalized now.  I still don't quite believe he's going to sell the house so I'm not counting on this piece of money any time soon*

**How I arrived at this point**

 

One of the most incredulous things that seems to come up from time to time on this sub is the *“Here’s how I did it and so can you!”* notion.  As far as I can tell one’s financial circumstance is the product of hundreds of variables, many outside your personal control, and I don’t know how valuable one person’s “success story” is when applied to strangers over the internet.  **Frankly my path has been weird, risky, inefficient and reeks of serendipity.  Probably not a road map for much of anyone out there.**

 _

On that pessimistic note here’s my story.

_

 

In late 2006 my mother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and she was dead nine months later in August 2007.  I was 19 year old college student at the time and a sophomore at a fairly prestigious architecture program in upstate New York.  This was not a pleasant time as I’m sure you can imagine.  But the “silver lining” on lady luck taking a dump on my family was that when life insurance / inheritance came through I suddenly had about $200K from my dead mother as of mid 2008 – right in the middle of the recession.   **In a nutshell, I found myself in the enviable position of having a chunk of new money at a time when all around me people were going broke - particularly in the building industry.**

 _

I had a full scholarship and my parents had been giving me a 1000K a month stipend for school (which in upstate NY was enough for a crappy room and food).  I decided to use the inheritance money to buy two repossessed small houses in my college town for about 60K each and fix them up.  This was late 2008 and prices had (almost) cratered.  **This wasn’t me being smart so much as me doing what I wanted and being fortuitous.**  I was at a fancy school studying architecture but I didn’t feel like my education had the practical instruction I desired as to how designs are actually realized, and I figured the best way to learn how to make architecture was to build some stuff myself.  So I got out of my apartment lease and moved into the less shitty house while fixing up the other.  I loved it.  For me, that stuff is fun.  I essentially stopped going home for breaks and summers just so I could have more time to sweat copper piping and hang drywall.  After about a year and half of splitting my time between working on the houses and going to school, I rented out one house to some friends in the program and got myself some roommates to pay rent and live with me in the other.  After about three months of not working (outside of my architecture studio) I fell into a kind of funk and started to get “the itch” all the time to get back to work.   But I was heading into my thesis semester and had less than zero time for other stuff.  After graduating I sold both houses for an OK profit (actually sold one to my former professor who fancied himself a slumlord) and got back into the market again.  Rinse and repeat again and again – wherever I was working (Boston, now Los Angeles for the past 4 years) I would buy two bank / city owned properties in cash so I could work on one and live in the other before selling (and sometimes renting, but that’s not my favorite thing to do.  AirBNB can be a real hassle in my experience).   Rarely more than two, rarely less than two. The properties just got pricier and (hopefully) my skills and industry relationships got better as money grew.

 _

The thing is, I never did any of this because of money.  **If the goal was to make money, I’ve done a pretty poor job in terms of ROI.**  My two younger sisters, who are both business women, invested their inheritance and have done very well without ever having to strap on a tool belt.  That having been said, all I ever wanted to do was design and actually manifest architecture.  I never took it as a “real job” and basically this was my “fun hobby” for weekends and after work if time allowed.  Some people like to travel, or cook, or go to the theater.  I like to make crazy shit that also keeps the rain out.  After I finished a project the interest is gone and I typically short term rent to fellow architects / designers while I went through the process of selling.  They keep the place looking good and I keep their rent cheap.  The selling process has at times been pretty long, especially considering not everyone wants a highly “designed” contemporary residence.  But eventually it would work out and get sold.  **Fast forward 10 years and that 200K has grown quite a bit.**

_

The second “good decision / luck” I made was marrying my wife two years ago.  She’s an architect herself and comes from a building industry family background.  No debt, no expensive hobbies, decent savings for someone our age and lots of common sense (which I tend to lack).  What I love most about her isn’t that she likes who I am, but what I am trying to become (and now, what WE are trying to become).  Give or take a variable or two, and that’s the same thing she wants to be as well.  We’ve been working together in a semi-professional capacity for about 1.5 years and so far its been better than I dared to hope for.  This includes work on job sites.  She may not have a ton of upper body strength but she’s a wizard with calibrating a table saw and has a knack for finish details that I always struggled with, for instance.  

Sorry to gush.  If I get divorced in the next few years I'll be sure to post about it here so we can all have a good laugh at my naivete and everyone can tell me what an idiot I've been.

_


**So Here's What's happening Now:**

Since my wife and I started dating 5 years ago we've been planning to one day start our own firm.  That's always been the dream.  But with recent success in financial situation we've altered that dream a bit. 

 **Basically, we want to start a firm where we have the requisite capitol to do our own projects as the primary focus, and take on clients when we WANT to, not because we NEED the income.**  So .... financial independence of some sort.  I'm sure that this is not going to be what most people would want for their ""retirement"", but its what my wife and I want and quite frankly its what I've wanted for a very long time.  

_ 

**In January, my wife quit her job at her firm.**  Prior to that, we managed to line up 2 commissions for private homes (both of which are considerably more expensive than our own properties) and she has been working on those commissions since then while continuing to ""pound pavement"" drumming up potential business and fostering new industry relations.  I work with her on these commissions in the evenings after work and on weekends we are working round the clock on our own current ""project house"" (that's house no.2 in the net worth estimation).  Its been a slog but those weekends have been some of the happiest of my life thus far.  

_

 
**In one week I'll be giving notice to my firm that I am quitting.**  Unless the firm feels otherwise, I'll be out the door on Friday, August 10th.  I wanted to give a lot of time so that we can leave on the best of terms with a firm that honestly has been pretty good to me.  This will be the first time since I was 17 I've never gotten a paycheck of some sort and I'm trying to be calm and not panic but so far results have been mixed.  

**I don't know what I'm doing and any success I've had thus far is at least partly attributable to blind, stupid luck and a surging housing market.**  I've seen what happens when the bottom drops out like 2008 and there isn't a firm in the state that isn't collapsing.  I remember walking in on my boss in the men's bathroom crying after our most important client canned us in 2010.  I remember the spare room full of herman miller chairs left over from all the people who got fired.  

Setting all that aside, I don't know the first thing about finance.  I don't know how to run a real business of any sort.  I only own one suit and I got that so wouldn't have to get married in a pair of coveralls.  I've NEVER been a client-facing architect - always the worker bee grinding it out behind the curtain, though my wife is thankfully much better at that stuff.

**Honestly I'm not sure what my point is here.  I just wanted to write this out because its hard to talk about with anyone except my wife.  She's trying to be strong for me right now and I'm trying to be strong for her heading into the scariest year of our life.**  


_


If you've read this far I'll just say thanks and leave it at that.  Sorry for the dramatics at the end.  Hope you all have a good Friday.

_


**TLDR:**

Mother died.  Used inheritance to buy and renovate houses for the past 10 years.  Starting small design/build firm with my wife in August as our personal form of ""retirement"".  Nervous but excited.

ilovetraps8778,2018-06-06 07:01:56+00:00,[Start to Finish Caroline Drama 100% DETAILED],"
I'll break the whole drama show down from today in case the dots haven't been connected. Gonna probably delete this shit in case I get heat from it so feel free to copy+paste it yourself. Also, fuck Ice Poseidon he a fucking bitch.

• Ice gets a blowjob from a viewers wife in Missouri in the back of RV. (debatable if true or not)

FRIDAY
• The RV arrives to Austin for Dreamhack and Ice spends most of the day with Sodapoppin and Greek.

• Ice flies out Caroline to Austin from Los Angeles to apologize for cheating on her in Missouri and spend some alone time together.

SATURDAY
• Ice is mysteriously absent the whole day and SSJ admits that Ice is sleeping in a hotel ""4 hours away"" from the convention center.

• Caroline invites her ""best friend"" Kbubblez over to keep her company in Austin.

• Kbubblez streams at home and leaks through a phone call that she is flying to Austin to meet up with Caroline/Ice at there hotel. Caroline remarks that Ice will reimburse her for paying $1k+ for the flight to Austin.

• Caroline and Kbubblez to not raise suspicion say they're going to Colorado to chill.

SUNDAY
• Ice rents out a Camaro in order to make the 2 hour from/2 hour to trip from the mysterious hotel to the convention center in Austin to throw a scuffed ass party.

• Caroline streams at the hotel pool and Kbubblez shows up in the background with her confirming they're at the same hotel. Kbubblez fumbles her words and says they're in Austin instead of Colorado.

• The Purple Army begins to connect the dots and confirms that Ice is with Caroline and Kbubblez at the same hotel.

MONDAY
• Ice begins damage control, he invites all the close Yes Men/Andy's from the RV trip to his hotel room at the resort to spend the night on Monday. Ice excludes: Chad/Asian Andy who are in there own hotel room in Austin, Hampton/Mexican Andy who stayed at the RV in Austin.

• SSJ kicks out Hampton/Mexican Andy from the RV and drives the approved Yes Men/Andy's to Ice's hotel.

• Caroline reserves a boat trip for her and Ice bonding time on Tuesday.

• Ice sneaks out the hotel room with Kbubblez at night and they go onto a strangers boat and she gives Ice a blowjob.

TUESDAY

• In the morning he tells Caroline that he cheated on her with Kbubblez.

• Caroline distraught, confronts Kbubblez at the hotel pool about the infidelity and they physically fight with each other and security has to intervene.

• Ice uses the boat ride reserved for him and Caroline to get away from security and starts his stream and explains the situation to the stream. (never apologizes btw)

• Caroline cancels the boat ride reservation with the hotel, the complication infuriates the hotel and the situation escalates and the county Sheriff gets called.

• Ice and everybody else is barred from exploring the hotel and are told to stay in there room or they'll get arrested. Caroline and Ice argue in there room and he continues to humiliate her infront of 30k+ viewers.

• County Sheriff kicks out a distraught Caroline from the hotel room.

• Ice goes to take a shower and coincidentally Kbubblez just so happens to shower too and it is implied that they fucked by the Yes Men Andy's.

• SSJ sees the car crash coming and immediately fucking dips out and in the process crashes the RV into a lamp post.

• Kbubblez gets a call from her dad and he basically disowns her ass and frustrated she can be heard arguing to Ice that she, ""didn't get anything from this deal.""

• Everyone goes to 7-Eleven and the streams go dark.

Alright so, I think by Monday night Ice realized the situation was fucked and decided to throw Caroline under the bus by committing adultery with her ""best friend"". Ice instead of taking responsibility for lying to his community for 6 months chooses to deflect the hate onto Caroline. If he decided to just breakup with Caroline on Tuesday nobody would believe him and why should they, he's lied to us for 6 months. He needed to add some weight to the break up so he cheated on Caroline with Kbubblez to ensure the community knew shit was real. The key thing to note here is that everyone knew what was happening except Caroline, this was all brand new to her. She was kept in the dark until today and it fucking ruined her.

The funny thing is Kbubblez was in Maryland with Mitch not even a month ago where he admits to fucking her. The thing that threw Mitch over the edge today was the fact that Mira found out he cheated on her with Kbubblez and broke up with him. Which made Mitch suicidal and he ended up guilt tripping his viewers to giving him love.

I think Kbubblez befriended Caroline to get close to Ice because her attempt to get E-Fame from Mitch wasn't successful a month ago. Mitch is known to smash and pass different Twitch thots, the only exception being Mira. Caroline had innocent intentions when inviting Kbubblez to Austin but Kbubblez had alterior motives to get close to Ice. That's why she was arguing with Ice outside the hotel telling him ""I didn't get anything from this deal"". She planned on meeting up with Ice and Caroline for completely selfish reasons.

To end, I've been a member of this community for almost 2 years now and everyone had the suspicion Ice was sociopath. The Enza birthday cake was a good example of this. When he went to LA his ego grew and overtime even his close friends like Kyle decided to distance himself from him until it was only the Yes Men/Andy's surrounding him. The piece of shit Sociopath that is Ice Poseidon came full circle and now he is a fucking cocaine abusing monster. Ice was once a lovable autist who lived with his parents in Florida playing OSRS, VR chatrooms, and doing cooking streams.

Hey guys, I made this post to just follow how loaded some of the top teams from the 2007-08 season were and to show that really any of these teams had a shot at a title.  I found this interesting because we got to see the start of some young players careers take off an saw some of our long time stars start to dwindle.  The 2007-08 season might have been the most competitive season for the top teams in the league and it was an interesting one to follow.



______________


##The West

**Los Angeles Lakers (57-25):**

*Notable Players:* Kobe Bryant (all star &amp; MVP), Lamar Odom, Pau Gasol (acquired half way through season), Andrew Bynum (injured most of the year), Derek Fisher, Luke Walton.

Kobe and Phil Jackson deserve all the credit in the world for dragging this team to the #1 seed in the West and going all the way to the Finals.  Bynum was injured for most of the year, and although they had Odom and Gasol, Gasol was a midseason acquisition and it took another season for Kobe and Pau to gel and get that ring. 


**New Orleans Hornets (56-26):**

*Notable Players:* Chris Paul (all star), David West (all star), Peja Stojakovic, Tyson Chandler.

Led by Byron Scott, we got to see a 3rd year Chris Paul make his first all star appearance by dropping over 21/11.  Although many people remember him for his years with the Clippers and now Rockets, CP3 provided some nice highlights like [dunking over Dwight Howard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZWov-x85KA) which you wouldn't think is possible by watching him today.


**San Antonio Spurs (56-26):**

*Notable Players:* Tim Duncan (all star), Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili.

Led by Pop, this core has been around for as long as anyone can remember (at least on this sub).  These guys led the Spurs to 56 wins and the #3 seed in the West while keeping Ginobili as the 6th man.  Not much to say.  Just the Spurs being the Spurs.


**Phoenix Suns (55-27):**

*Notable Players:* Steve Nash (all star), Amare Stoudamire (all star), Shaq (for the last half of the season), Grant Hill, Raja Bell.

Coached by Mike D'Antoni with Steve Kerr as an executive, even the front office of this team is a super team.  With the late addition of Shaq and the departing of Shawn Marion, this team had all the right pieces to compete for the best team in the league but fell short of their goal.



**Houston Rockets (55-27):**

*Notable Players:* Yao Ming (all star), Tracy McGrady, Shane Battier, Luis Scola, Dikembe Mutombo (old as dirt).

Rick Adelman coached this team to 55 wins with only 1 all star (although TMac was all star worthy) and the Rockets stayed relevant for another year.  Unforuntely after this season, TMac's production dropped off and Yao only played one more season 'full' season because of injuries.


**Utah Jazz (54-28):**


*Notable Players:* Carlos Boozer (all star), Deron Williams, Mehmet Okur, Andrei Kirilenko, Ronnie Brewer, Paul Millsap, Kyle Korver.

Although they have a few familiar faces on the team, this team overachieved with Jerry Sloan coaching them to a 4 seed (although they didn't have the 4th best record in the conference).  We saw the birth of Deron Williams who put up almost 19/10 in his 3rd season with the Jazz.  We also saw a two future all stars in role playing positions with Kyle Korver and Paul Millsap.  Carlos Boozer had a monster year with a line of over 21/10 and was their leader for the season.


**Dallas Mavericks (51-31):**

*Notable Players:* Dirk Nowitzki (all star), Jason Kidd (all star, traded to the Mavs halfway through season), Josh Howard, Jason Terry.


Although forgotten about, Josh Howard was the Mavs second leading scorer behind Dirk with 19.9 ppg this season.  Avery Johnson coached this team to the playoffs with some help of a midseason acquisition in Jason Kidd (although I hated it being a big Kidd and VC fan).  Future coaches were loaded on this team though: Jason Kidd, Jerry Stackhouse, and Ty Lue all were on the roster.


**Denver Nuggets (50-32):** 

*Notable Players:* Carmelo Anthony (all star), Allen Iverson (all star), Kenyon Martin, Marcus Camby, JR Smith.

This wasn't your *loaded* super team like we have seen today, but to have Allen Iverson and Melo on the same team with defensive powerhouses like Marcus Camby and Kenyon Martin shows that this team wasn't messing around.  George Karl was the head coach but I don't have anything interesting to say about that.


**Golden State Warriors (48-34):**

*Notable Players:* Stephen Jackson, Monta Ellis, Baron Davis, Al Harrington.

This team was the only team I listed that missed the playoffs, and at 48-34, you wouldn't expect them to miss.  Stephen Jackson, Baron Davis, and Monta Ellis *all* averaged over 20ppg that season which is an incredible feat and a shame they couldn't pull out a few more games to make the playoffs.  None of those players even made an all star team so that tells you what you need to know about how stacked the West was this year.  Don Nelson coached them but since I didn't watch many GS games back then I don't have much to say about him.


**Other notable players:** Brandon Roy made his first of 3 all star appearances in which it looked like he was about to take over the East.  Injuries cut his career short or who knows how the Blazers with LMA and Roy could've been.  Kevin Durant was also drafted by the Sonics with the #2 pick and Greg Oden was taken by the Blazers with the #1 pick.  Oden was regarded as the top pick who was the next Shaq, but injuries spiraled his career downwards.  Imagine a KD-Roy-LMA combo if the Blazers draft differently.  Blazers fans were not too fond of this year I'm sure.  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3yaDgNh-aQ) is KD winning one at the buzzer for the Sonics in double OT as a rookie.



##The East


**Boston Celtics (66-16):**

*Notable Players:* Kevin Garnett (all star), Ray Allen (all star), Paul Pierce, (all star), Rajon Rondo, Kendrick Perkins, Brian Scalabrine.

Doc Rivers led the Celtics Big 3 to a Finals victory over the Lakers.  They finished the season with the best record in basketball and dominated the East.  Their combination of the Big 3 and emergence of Playoff Rondo helped propel this team to victory.  [Paul Pierce also went doodoo in Game 1 of the Finals.](https://imgur.com/a/JgCKmtB)



**Detroit Pistons (59-23):**

*Notable Players:* Richard Hamilton (all star), Chauncey Billups (all star), Rasheed Wallace (all star injury sub), Tayshaun Prince, Rodney Stuckey, Antonio McDyess.

This team was a defensive machine.  Coached by Flip Saunders, this team gave up only 90.1 ppg to opponents which was good for best in the league.  Their big 3 was competing in the East all year long with Boston until the Celtics beat them in 6 games in the ECF.



**Orlando Magic (52-30):**

*Notable Players:* Dwight Howard (all star), Rashard Lewis, Hedo Turkoglu, Jameer Nelson, Keith Bogans.

Dwight Howard was a beast.  Averaging over 20/14 for the season, his performances [(especially in the dunk contest)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iepcgEstIyg) earned him the nickname [Superman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k1b8s1VfMQ) which we do not hear as often today.  Stan Van Gundy was coaching the team at the time and the Magic ended up losing to the Pistons in 5 games in the playoffs.



**Cleveland Cavaliers (45-37):**

*Notable Players:* Lebron James (all star), Zydrunas Ilgauskas

What is there to say aside from this being Lebron's team?  Big Z was a force at times but Lebron led this team through the East and took on the Celtics big 3 and forced them to a game 7 back in Boston.  You may not think Lebron has much help right now, but I suggest you take a look at the 2007-08 Cavs roster.  They cycled through 23 players that season trying to find some sort of help for Lebron but it wasn't enough.


**Washington Wizards (43-39):**

*Notable Players:* Caron Butler (all star), Antawn Jamison (all star), Gilbert Arenas, Nick Young.

Although they had some talent, there wasn't much going on with this Wizards team.  Eddie Jordan was their coach and that says about all you can say.  Swaggy was on this team though so it's been interesting to see where he has been in his career.


**Other notable players:** Chris Bosh (all star) helped lead the Raptors to a 6 seed in the East with a 41-41 record and Dwayne Wade (all star) got hurt and missed 30 games that year but it didn't matter because the Heat finished with a 15-67 record.  It's interesting to look at the precursors to see how the Big 3 in Miami formed a few years later.  Al Horford was also drafted #3 this year by Atlanta.

**I decided to just make this list to show all of the teams above .500 for this season and cut the mark off there.**

[Here is a playoff chart if you were interested in series outcomes of this season.](https://imgur.com/a/4Ix5gdJ)



##Some other interesting factoids:

**NBA GMs were asked before the season a few questions and here is how they responded:**

*Who will win the 2007-08 MVP?*

**29.6% said Lebron James**, 22.2% said Tim Duncan, 18.5% said Kobe Bryant (actually won MVP), 11.1% said Steve Nash.

*If you were starting a franchise today and could sign any player in the NBA, who would it be?*

**59.3% said Lebron James**, 25.9% said Dwight Howard, 11.1% said Kobe Bryant, 11.1% said Tim Duncan.

*Which player forces opposing coaches to make the most adjustments?*

**34.6% said Kobe Bryant**, 15.4% said Steve Nash, 11.5% said Tim Duncan, 11.5% said Lebron James, 11.5% said Shaquille O'Neal, 7.7% said Dirk Nowitzki.

*Which player is most likely to have a breakout season in 2007-08?*

**14.8% said Luol Deng**, 14.8% said Al Jefferson, 7.4% said Kevin Durant, 7.4% said Andre Iguodala.

*Voted best Point Guard*

**Steve Nash with 85.2%**, Jason Kidd with 14.8%.

*Voted best Shooting Guard*

**Kobe Bryant with 92.6%**, Ray Allen and Dwayne Wade both had 3.7%.

*Voted best Small Forward*

**Lebron James with 74.1%**, Carmelo Anthony with 14.8%, Tracy McGrady with 7.4%.

*Voted best Power Forward*

**Tim Duncan with 48.1%**, Kevin Garnett with 25.9%, Dirk Nowitzki with 18.5%.

*Voted best Center*

**Tim Duncan (again) with 48.1%**, Yao Ming with 33.3%, Dwight Howard and Shaquille O'Neal both had 7.4%.


Thanks for taking the time to read this guys.  If this gets enough traction I will do more in the future and take requests for other seasons!

There were three original versions of the video in the US, totalling 36 missing children shown. The children shown varied with the location of the broadcast, using missing children from that area. 


**Resolved Cases**

Vicky Hamilton and Dinah McNicol both went missing in 1991. Their remains were found in 2007 at a house in Margate belonging to [Peter Tobin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Tobin) (who is often believed to be Bible John). He has since been convicted of both murders and is serving three sentences of life imprisonment with a whole life order for three murders committed between 1991 and 2006. 


Curtis Huntzinger went missing as a 14 year old in 1990 when he was last seen walking home from his sister's home. It was initially believed that Huntzinger, who had some trouble in school and a recent run in with the law, had run away from home. His remains were located in 2008 in a shallow grave on the outskirts of Blue Lake. His convicted killer Stephen Daniel Hash is currently serving a sentence of 11 years for manslaughter. Interestingly, in April 1999, during a confrontation with Huntzinger's mother, Hash (who was a family acquaintance), admitted to killing Huntzinger, even taking his mother to her son's burial site. 


Elizabeth Wiles left her home at 13 in Lamar, Arkansas. She and her boyfriend hitchhiked to California where she and her family had lived before moving to Arkansas. They were in California for two years before the music clip aired. In 1993 Elizabeth and her boyfriend had seen the music clip on TV, and after a week's hesitation, contacted her mother and returned home. 
 

The version shown in Australia showed a number of young backpacking tourists whose families were looking for them. Several of them turned out to be victims of [Ivan Milat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpacker_murders, the Backpacker Murderer) whose bodies were discovered in Belanglo State Forest, New South Wales Australia. 

**Unresolved Cases**

[Christopher Kerze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Kerze) is a missing American man last seen in April 1990 from Eagan, Minnesota whose story has been covered a few times on Reddit. Kerze had stayed home from school noting that he was unwell, and when his parents returned home they found both Kerze and their blue 1988 Dodge Caravan missing. A note presumably written by Kerze was found in the kitchen, stating that he would be back by 6pm unless he got lost (notably, the word ""lost"" was underlined twice). He is currently still missing and classified as an endangered runaway. 


[Martha Wes Dunn]https://api.missingkids.org/missingkids/servlet/PubCaseSearchServlet?act=viewChildDetail&amp;orgPrefix=NCMC&amp;caseNum=745077)went missing from Daingerfield, Texas in 1990 aged 15. It's known that the night before her disappearance, she had spoken with her boyfriend in relation to an argument she had her parents concerning her moving home to Texas from Oklahoma where she had been living with relatives. The next day she and her boyfriend were gone. Several unconfirmed sightings of the two have been made in Oklahoma, however one theory explored by police is that they were both kidnapped by a drug dealer (Dunn's boyfriend was allegedly involved with drugs.) 

Andrea Durham went missing from Fort Walton Beach, Florida in 1990 aged 13. Andrea was vacuuming the apartment at the Royale Apartments while her mother and sister left the home. When they returned, they found the door to the apartment unlocked and the vacuum in the middle of the floor. Andrea was gone. 


[Wilda Mae Benoit]( http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/420dfla.html) was last seen at her family's residence in Creole, Louisiana on July 23, 1992. Her case was reclassified from a runaway to endangered missing in 2005. 


[Byron Eric Page](http://charleyproject.org/case/byron-eric-page) went missing on 29 January 1992 from Los Angeles, California. He was last seen at a bus stop at Overhill and Slauson Streets in Los Angeles and was planning to visit a music warehouse and video store twenty miles away in West Hollywood. Byron never arrived home and has been missing since. Employees at the store do not recall him being there that day (Byron was a regular at the store and familiar with many of the staff). 

**Not-so Resolved Cases**

Featured in the UK version was Mark Bartley, a runaway who went missing in 1992. He was recognised in the video by a man who knew Bartley was staying in the tenant's house below them, but was unaware of his missing status. By the time police arrived, Bartley and the man he was living with were gone. His whereabouts are currently unknown. This case seems to be, on face value anyway, a case of a runaway who doesn't want to be found. 

Thomas Dean Gibson disappeared from Glendale, Oregon in 1992 at the age of 2 and is still missing. His father, Larry Gibson, a former deputy sheriff, was convicted of second degree manslaughter for accidentally shooting his son to death when he shot at a stray cat in his front yard even though no remains were ever found. He steadfastly denies killing his son and has worked on finding him since being released from prison in 1996.



**Other featured missing people**

l0gica1,2018-05-25 10:16:09+00:00,"I lost my mom to cancer, wen't crazy and made a cyberpunk video game.","Like the title said -- I lost my best friend, my mom, to a rare cancer suddenly; wen't crazy and ended up making a video game about it while I grieved.

This might get rant-y; so I apologize, but today I am looking back in retrospect, proud of where I am, two weeks from a trailer and a minor promotion at E3.

Like my character in my game, I'm a successful self-taught, unconventional software engineer, who is very close with his mother, living in almost a perfect world. One day, tragedy strikes unknowingly, and, like my character, I gave up everything to try to save her.

Like my character, I failed.

I spent the last 3+ years in a self-destructive, depressed state. It doesn't help that I am clinically bipolar; which amplifies every feeling to extremes.

While I lay in bed, and watched my business, self-made fortune and marriage rot and decay... I fantasized about what I'd do if I was an unstoppable force, with nothing to lose, fighting against what happened... In my head, I officially deemed the misdiagnosing doctors, who were my mothers c-workers and friends, the enemy...

Once she passed, I moved back across the country and dealt with the ruins of my life. I wrote, sketched and recorded my fantastical ideologies as a cyberpunk fiction; and being a software engineer, decided to write and produce my first 3-D game.

I hired two 3-D artists. Did all of the mo-cap using the Perception Neuron system with my wife and daughter as the engineers; and gave the voice acting roles to friends and family.

I luckily befriended on Facebook, years ago, one of my favorite electronic music vocalists, Kathleen Fisher... Her husband, Ron Wasserman seen what we were doing, and wanted to score the whole game... You may know him more formally as ""the guy who made the Power Rangers Theme song; or perhaps the X-men theme song... or maybe you've seen sponge bob, NCIS or almost any other show ever""

That was luck. The soundtrack is phenomenal.

We're close to a trailer, but I wanted to share where we're at today. I just couldn't hold it in any more.

This is a third-person, open world, RPG, set in a dystopian Los Angeles, in the year 2108. You can drive motorcycles, fly cars, hack systems, hack brains, shoot, kill, talk, control the future (1 of 12 endings and tons of side missions, the game is not on on rails); and there are ZERO building facades. If you see it, you can enter it. Underground sewers, tunnels, and tons of interactive elements. Cybernetic augmentations, a very in-depth crafting system, tons of personal and vehicle upgrades, and a story that will make you say ""wow"".

We post constant facebook updates at www.facebook.com/nothingcanstopyounow

We will eventually have to kickstarter, but up to now I have coded and funded everything on my own. I'm very happy with what I've done, but welcome any criticism or suggestions... this may just be the game others were looking for.

SavageCardigan,2018-05-22 16:22:39+00:00,I don't think my father in law likes me very much,"I met my wife’s father for the first time only the day before the wedding. Other than our mutual love for his daughter, we had almost nothing in common. He was a hard-assed former Federali who grew up in Los Cabos, and I was a twenty-two year old English major from the burbs. He’d been shot twice taking down members of the cartel, and I was a member of an acapella cover band. Needless to say, we didn’t exactly hit it off.

I had, of course, wanted to meet him earlier and on different terms, but a certain beautiful accident accelerated my and Maria’s relationship timeline, and it seemed like a good idea to have the wedding before she started to show. From the moment I first saw him and tried to shake his hand to the moment he and Maria’s mother drove away, I didn’t see a single crack in his steely reserve. The man was not the smiling type, and I considered myself lucky to have gotten through without him taking a swing at me.

I was a scrawny little guy, pale from a life lived almost exclusively indoors during the daylight hours. He was from an era where the signs of a good provider were the calluses on your hands and the grit in your soul. At the rehearsal dinner, Maria insisted I try to connect with her father. “My two favorite guys in the whole world.” How could I say no?

Hector and I sat outside the manor, the two story plantation style bed and breakfast we’d rented for the weekend for the service and reception. As night fell, Maria and her mom made excuses and left us alone. I tried for small talk, but nothing was going to get through to this guy. Until, “You feel like a drink?”

Hector turned away from the vineyard where he’d been casting a dead stare for the last half hour and raised his eyebrows at me, the closest I’d come so far to a smile and I was grateful. He asked, “You got any tequila?”

This made me hopeful. If there was one thing my college experience had taught me how to handle, it was taking shots. I found a bottle and a couple double shot glasses and poured the first round. Hector gave me a disapproving look when I pulled out the limes and salt, so I put them away and pretended I had never brought them out in the first place.

We took our drinks and Hector loosened up. Or maybe it was just me, becoming less aware of his unbearable scrutiny. He let a few things slip. Not exactly secrets at first, more unspoken realities that we had yet to acknowledge.

“You know, I don’t see how an English degree is going to provide for Maria.”

He poured the next shots.

“This place is too fancy for me. Those fields look like they’re just here for show.”

He poured the next shots.

“It’s really not your fault you’re the way you are. But this country is weak. It makes weak people. And I want more for my Maria and our grandkids.”

He poured the next shots. This guy wasn’t slowing down or showing any signs of needing a break. And before I knew it, it was two in the morning and I was hammered worse than at my bachelor party.

“Kid, let me tell you something. I’ve been shot, stabbed, everything but killed. And I’m better for all of it. But you ain’t worked a day in your damned life.” He pulled down his shirt to show an old faded scar on his collar bone. “I got this from a shithead in Los Cabos. He took a knife to me. When I got the upper hand, he begged for his life. I can still see that pathetic little worm begging. But I put that same knife into his gut and twisted. That’s what it means to be a man. I made the world a better place. But look at you. You can’t even handle your booze like a man.”

I considered for a split second lecturing the old fossil on the effects of toxic masculinity, but instead I threw up in the rose bushes.

We didn’t speak of it again. We didn’t speak of anything again until after the wedding. Maria asked how it went, and I lied and said “Good. I think we’re really starting to bond.” I was a little hung over for the wedding, but other than that, the ceremony was beautiful.

	Half a year later, little Brianna came into this world, which meant that Maria’s parents would once again be coming to visit. I surprised my wife by insisting this time around that Hector and I spend at least one night together, bonding time for the guys. I splurged for the whole thing, surprising her with a couple of weekend passes to a fancy spa / daycare for new mothers that I found on Groupon. (Say what you will about Los Angeles, but I love how capitalism caters to the specific.)

I dropped Maria, her mom, and Brianna off at the front doors of the spa and told them to have fun and relax. Maria told me not to let her dad get too far into my head. “He knows how to hit you where it hurts. Remember that I love you both, and all I want is for the two of you to get along.”

Those were the words floating around in my head as I drove back to our house, where Hector would be waiting for me. The final words of my adoring love, asking me to do whatever necessary to make peace with the man who raised her.

Hector was waiting in our den with a bottle of tequila. He was sitting in the recliner (my seat), with an actual honest-to-goodness smirk on his face.

“Ready for round two?” he asked, waving the bottle of bottom-shelf liquor at me.

I laughed and said, “Actually, I thought we could start the night off a little differently.”

“Don’t be a pussy. Let’s take a shot first. Then we’ll do whatever mamsy pamsy kumbaya bullshit you got planned for this weekend. But I ain’t talking about feelings. I ain’t gonna hug it out or call you son.”

“Whoa, whoa, whoa,” I said, holding out my hands for him to stop. “I think you’ve got the wrong idea about why I asked to spend the weekend with you.”

“I don’t care why you did it. Nothing you can say will make me change my mind. You’re not good enough for my daughter. So why don’t I go to the bar for the weekend, and you can go to your room and draw, or whatever it is you do.”

I relaxed and let out a laugh.

“Can I be real with you for a second?”

He made no reaction, which I took to mean yes.

“I’m not stupid. I know you don’t really like me. And that’s okay. But for Maria’s sake, I want us to at least be on speaking terms. This constant negging is fine when she’s not around, but when she’s here can you at least pretend you don’t hate me?”

He opened the bottle and poured a shot for himself, threw it back, and said, “I don’t hate you and more than I’d hate a stray dog pissing on my car. You aren’t worth hating. You annoy me.”

Wow. Maria was right. He certainly had a way with words.

“I want to propose something,” I said. “Let me show you what it is I do. If you still don’t think I can provide for Maria after that, we don’t ever need to speak again. Hell, I’ll even open you a tab at any L.A. bar you want. Sound like a deal?”

He shrugged.

“I want you to see my studio.”

I walked towards the door leading downstairs into the basement. A second later, I heard him stand up and follow.

Good, I thought. He’s going to at least give it a shot.

He followed me downstairs to a place where I rarely let other people see. This was my studio. Half-completed canvases adorned the walls. Some of the work was commissioned pieces for local companies. Logos and commercial work. It paid the bills. Some of the paintings were passion projects. Images of dreams or scenes from my own imagination. An eight by-three canvas was propped against one wall. A piece I’d been working on for two years now, an otherworldly landscape dominated by mushrooms and trees in the moonlight called “Mysterium.” I won’t bore you with the details, but I will tell you this: Hector was not impressed.

“You’re saying people actually pay you for this shit?”

“Some of it.”

He looked all around, nodded, then said, “Okay. I think I’ve seen enough. Let’s find that bar, huh?”

But I ignored him, walking over to Mysterium. The purple had dried too bold. I’d need to add another coat to make the other colors pop right.

“Do you know who Lucas Cadiz was?”

I turned to see that Hector was furrowing his brow. The question had taken him off guard. He recognized the name, and I knew he would.

“Yeah, Cadiz was a drug runner for the cartel in the eighties, before you were born. A real asshole, went down in a firefight in Mexico. They filled him so full of lead his corpse was more metal than meat. What do you know about him?”

	“Well,” I said, “Here’s a fun fact. This home you’re standing in right now used to belong to Lucas Cadiz.”

	“What?”

	“Yeah, it wasn’t a matter of public knowledge. I really had to do my research to find out. But Cadiz made frequent stops here. Used this place as a sort of hideout. Really, it was more of his warehouse. He hid drugs down here, in a secret room behind his false wall. That’s why I picked this home to buy.”

	“Alright, man. You’re starting to freak me out. Let’s just go upstairs already.”

	“But you haven’t even seen my artwork yet.”

	I pulled back the canvas and place it gently against another wall. Even if the painting hadn’t been there, I doubt anyone would have seen the switch on the wall if they weren’t looking for it. It even took me almost a week to find Cadiz’s secret room. Hidden down here. Not on the official floorplan. A secret space. One that I could keep all to myself. One where I could do my work in privacy.

	I pressed the latch to open the door, then I took a step inside, confident that Hector would follow. I heard him gasp and felt a slight sense of accomplishment when he saw what was on the other side.

	Today’s piece was a scumbag named Vincent Garcia, suspended by the shackles around his wrists about two inches above the drain in the center of the concrete room. I could raise or lower the chain as much as I needed to, depending on my piece’s height. And I alway liked to keep them right about this far from the floor. Close enough that they could almost reach the ground if they stretched.

	His mouth was taped shut and his eyes were wide open, and I knew that there would be fear when he saw me again, but when he saw Hector there was suddenly something else. An understanding. Like all hope was lost.

	He was a special piece. Took me a long time to track him down, but I knew that this needed to be perfect for Hector. And this was the only one that would do. Vincent was a low life. A monster. He’d killed the children of his enemies and made their parents watch. He’d gone decades without getting caught. And fifteen years ago, he shot a Federali named Hector in the stomach and left him for dead. Vincent was the one that got away. And when Hector saw him, I could suddenly feel the energy in the room transform.

	After a few long, glorious, painfully powerful seconds, Hector found the words.
	“What the fuck is this?”

	“Do you like it?” I asked. “I made this all for you. You’ll find a series of tools in the box at your feet. You can use anything you want. Or I can go and get you something else.”

	He looked at me with horror, or amazement, or something else entirely. “What are you?”

	I laughed. “I’m a killer, Hector. And I’m an artist with a very special talent. I can track down the worst of the worst. And when your Maria sleeps peacefully upstairs, I give the bad men of this world what they deserve. I prefer pieces like this one.” I tapped Vincent on the head, prompting him to shake and fight, but he was far too weak to really do much. “The child murderers. Not a whole lot of people more deserving of what I do than this lot. But every now and then I get to mix it up. Like right after I bought this house, when some of Cadiz’s men came around looking for the smuggler’s secret stash. It took four days for the last one to die. Sometimes I’ll cull the rapists. The mass murderers. The politicians.” I gave him a wink.

	“You… you’re… you’re crazy,” he stammered.

	“Aw come on now, Hector. You know that this is the way the real world works. I didn’t expect you of all people to turn out to be a big softy. I know you’re probably thinking of pulling out the gun in your ankle holster and putting two in my ticker right now. And if that’s what you want to do, I won’t stop you, even though I absolutely could if I wanted to. You see, I may look soft, but that’s the same thing every one of these men thought before I choked them out and brought them down here. I may not be the strongest guy ever, but I’m faster than I look.”

	Hector pulled the piece, just like I was afraid he might, but he didn’t point it at me right away. He hesitated, aiming the gun at the ground.

	“You kill people?” he said, breathing heavily.

	“Only bad people. And trust me, your girl has never been safer than she is with me. I considered keeping this all secret. Never telling a soul. But she wants so desperately for you and me to get along. I’ll admit, I considered arranging for you to have an accident that left you at the bottom of a cliff with no arms or legs.”

	I took a step forward, and he took one back.

	“I thought you said you only kill bad people.”

	“Are you saying you don’t think you’re bad people?” I asked with a smile.

	He pointed the gun at me and I snatched it away.

	He went pale, and I said, “Sorry. Natural reaction. Here.” Then I extended the weapon by the barrel, offering it back to him.

	I could see the gears turning. Then, finally, he did what I wanted him to do. He knelt down to the box of tools and picked out a saw blade. An excellent choice.

	I put the gun onto the ground and started for the door. “Once this thing is closed, you can be as loud as you want. Nobody can hear anything through these walls.”

	“Wait a second,” he said, prompting me to stop. “Aren’t you going to stay and help?”

	I looked at him, and he extended a long, sharp knife. As I reached to take it, Hector gave me the biggest smile.

	Now we’re getting somewhere, I thought. As we began our first real night of father and son bonding, I couldn’t help but suspect that it wouldn’t be the last.

Chriscftb97,2018-05-18 21:36:16+00:00,[Satire] Why John Tavares would sign with every NHL team,"Concept from /r/NBA

_________

**Anaheim Ducks**


Tavares believes in the magic of Disney. He'll end up getting sick from eating too much funnel cakes and riding too many rides. He'll have a career worst season.


**Arizona Coyotes**


Tavares has been practicing his French on duolingo but doesn't want to be forced into being a right winger.


**Boston Bruins**


Tavares has PTSD induced flashbacks to all of the wet willies he received in his minor hockey dressing rooms. He can’t risk being licked by Marchand so he signs with the Bruins.


**Buffalo Sabres**


Tavares goes to Buffalo to follow in the footsteps of his uncle and play lacrosse for the Buffalo Bandits. He'll also play a bit of hockey on the side for the Sabres I guess.


**Calgary Flames**


Tavares always wanted to be a firefighter. Unfortunately he missed a lot of class because of hockey practice so he never learned what a firefighter actually does. No John, firefighters don’t fight for the Flames.


**Carolina Hurricanes**


John Tavares will not sign with the Carolina Hurricanes.


**Chicago BlackHawks**


Tavares wants to be massively overpaid. Tavares will sign with the BlackHawks will be so far over the salary cap that the only players they’ll be able to play next season are Toews, Kane, Tavares, Keith, Seabrook, Saad, Crawford, &amp; Rozsival. They still win the Stanley Cup.


**Colorado Avalanche**


Tavares signs with the Avs because their GM is his childhood favourite player. With him the Avs have a historically bad season. Tavares is dicked around in trade talks for a year +. Stop me if you’ve heard this one before.


**Columbus Blue Jackets**


Tavares is sick of being chirped for his defensive game so he signs with Columbus to learn to block shots from the great John Tortorella. Tavares takes a shot to the face in his first game with the team and is never the same offensively again. He becomes a very good two-way forward. Kind of like a Dubinsky lite.


**Dallas Stars**


Tavares feels slighted that he wasn’t chosen to be an All-Star last season. He signs with Dallas so he can always be a Star.


**Detroit Red Wings**


Tavares misses the companionship of Frans Nielsen so he signs with the Red Wings. Tavares is still on a mediocre team, but at least he’s on a mediocre team with his best friend.


** Edmonton Oilers** 


Tavares wants to win a Hart Trophy so he signs with the Oilers. As a first overall pick, it’s only a matter of time before he’s traded.


**Florida Panthers**


Tavares hears about all of the hullabaloo around LeBron in free agency and remembers how LeBron built a super team in Miami. Tavares sets out to do the same thing this year. Unfortunately he’s the only good FA on the market this year. The Panthers sign a big 3 of Tavares, Mike Green, and Rick Nash. They miss the playoffs. The “big 3”’s bloated contracts (with NTC’s) mean that the Panthers have to move two of Huberdeau, Barkov, or Ekblad.


**Los Angeles Kings**


Tavares has always been an aspiring actor &amp; he’ll sign in Los Angeles after being offered a role in blockbuster film Avengers 4 as Squirrel Girl.


**Minnesota Wild**


Tavares wants to play in Canada but doesn’t want to deal with Canadian fans or media. He settles for Canada lite.


**Montreal Canadiens**


Tavares is the top free agent center on the market and Montreal is looking for a 1RW.


**Nashville Predators**


Tavares wants Cups. He’ll sign with the Preds but will end up being overpaid for like Johansen and Turris.


**New Jersey Devils**


Tavares sells his soul to the devil to win a Stanley Cup… but he accidentally sells his soul to the Devils instead. He doesn’t get his Cup.


**New York Islanders**


Tavares was just trolling everyone by waiting until July 1st to sign a deal. He was going to re-sign with the Isles all along so he can continue to wallow in mediocrity.


**New York Rangers**


Tavares thought he was signing with the other New York team. I mean, what other reason is there to sign with the Rangers? Whatever. The outcome will be the same as it would’ve been with the Isles.


**Ottawa Senators** 


Eugene Melnyk cannot afford to sign John Tavares.


**Philadelphia Flyers**


Tavares signs with the Flyers because they’re one of the few teams that actually have cap space for him. He has a mental breakdown after being booed heavily and having items thrown at him in his first home game. He subsequently retires and never plays again.


**Pittsburgh Penguins**


Tavares is sick of the pressure that comes with being the guy, so he signs in Pittsburgh to play 3C. Crosby and Malkin both get injured but Tavares goes on a tear and puts up 100+ points because that always seems to happen when one or more Pens superstars get hurt.


**San Jose Sharks**


Tavares is super into BDSM and signs with the Sharks so he can get off to their choking. Tavares and Thornton both get massive fines after the Sharks are reverse swept by the Kings in the first round after a game where Tavares scored 4 goals. 


**St. Louis Blues**


Tavares, sad that he hasn’t yet received a good contract offer, signs with the only franchise sadder than him. Throughout his 7 year tenure, the Blues put up 100+ points each season but never make it past the 2nd Round.


**Tampa Bay Lightning**


Tavares loves Canadian fans but not Canadian media so he signs in Tampa Bay. A team that tried to accommodate the snowbirds by making their home jerseys as similar to Toronto’s as possible.


**Toronto Maple Leafs**


Tavares misses his mama’s cooking. He signs with the Leafs and eats so much of it that he puts on a few pounds and eventually gets chased out of town by Steve Simmons.


**Vancouver Canucks**


Tavares heard about this forknife game from that Barzal kid in New York. He signs with the Canucks so Juolevi can teach him how to play. Tavares develops a video game addiction and drops out of the NHL to become a mediocre Twitch streamer.


**Vegas Golden Knights**


Tavares wants to make history at some point in his career so he makes the historic move of being the first player to sign with the Vegas Golden Knights after their first season in the NHL. H I S T O R I C.


**Washington Capitals**


Tavares walks by Wilson at an offseason party and Wilson leaves his feet to launch into Tavares’ head. Tavares is knocked unconscious and wakes up in a room with Brian MacLellan and a contract offer. In his woozy state Tavares signs the deal.


**Winnipeg Jets**


Tavares, still unable to grow a proper playoff beard, seeks the help of the beard guru Patrik Laine. With his help, the Jets win the Stanley Cup, led by two pube bearded superstars.",hockey,1114

I'm writing this in hopes that somebody may benefit from my story.

When I was a teenager and someone asked what my mom was like, I would always say that she yelled a lot. When I asked my mom why she was always yelling, she said 'I never used to yell. I'm yelling because of you! It's your fault."" My mom could yell for hours. In fact, the last time I ever saw her she yelled at me for 6 hours. It was a full on performance when she yelled \- mocking, voices, making stupid faces and telling me ""This is what you look like!"" Sometimes when she was yelling she would say, ""This is your pep talk."" She actually called the berating, hurtful, self\-esteem destroying, crushing, heartbroken, rage\-filled tirades ""pep talks."" After that last 6 hour screamfest I was subjected to, and promised myself that I would never see her again, she asked me if I wanted to go for a ride in her new BMW that she purchased 3 days after telling me that she would no longer be paying for my college tuition. So, I got in the car and we went for Chinese takeout.

There are so many stories I can share, but to make a long story short here are 11 things she did: 1. forced me to go to every school dance/prom even though I was overweight and had no self\-esteem and felt humiliated when I went \(I ended up taking a 23 year old man to prom\) 2. She would yell at my dad every night after he got home from work \(no wonder he worked 12 hour days\), 3. She would get drunk and play the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds over and over in the living room and cry \(she was on full display in the living room\), 4. Yelled and screamed at her mother in the living room, kicked her out of the house and never spoke to her again \(I witnessed the whole thing as a 12 yo and blamed myself\), 5. Made us 'angry dinners' \- she would buy weird, prepared frozen food and then sort of toss the plate in front of us and yell at us for no reason \(she would give us expired food sometimes \- btw, we were upper middle class\), 6. Tell me about how much sex she was having with my dad \(and then told me I was immature when I gagged\), 7. Told me to have sex with my boyfriend at 18 \(I was a virgin\) and sent me a weird negligee and an engagement ring so we could get married \(I think she was afraid I was gay and thought that a penis could fix that \- btw, I'm gay \- she also called him for long conversations and told him all of the stuff I liked so he could impress me\), 8. She chose the college I went to, picked all of my classes and selected my major \(she would also call me everyday at college and yell at me \- wonder why my grades were low\), 9. She cared only what strangers and acquaintances thought of her. She put on a charm show for everyone she met and saved how she really was with Edad, GCbrother and me, 10. She made me throw out my CDs because she didn't like the music \(when she found out that I sold them for cash she yelled at me because she wanted me to throw them out \- she wanted me feel what it felt like to throw the bands I liked in the garbage\), 11. She picked up my framed recommendation letter from my favorite teacher in HS that I sent with my college application and slammed it on the floor in front of me \(Edad was right there when it happened and he said nothing and walked away\),12. She forced my dad to stop talking with his whole family and she stopped talking with her family so the four of us were isolated from the rest of the world. When I left, I had no one.

When I was 19 in 1999, the year after my parents told me they weren't going to pay for college anymore, they decided to put me in Los Angeles. I don't know why they selected that city, I didn't know anyone there and I didn't want to go. But, they found an apartment for me \(they paid rent\) and said I was going to live there. I got some shitty retail job and tried to figure out how to live alone. I was there for about a year when I realized I was gay. I had an inkling when I was younger, but my mom said gays were child molesters and pervs, so I kept it to myself. It basically got to the point that I wasn't willing to live some fake life. They were paying my rent and I felt that they were controlling my life with money and guilt and yelling and I was sick of living in a way that made my cray mom happy. Living under my parents control meant that I could not be myself \- I had to sacrifice my own goals, clothes I wanted to wear, music I wanted to listen to, friends I wanted to have, colleges I wanted to go to, subjects I wanted to study, it meant I couldn't have my own perspectives, emotions, ideas...the list continues. Staying under my parents control \(meaning they would give me money if I did want they wanted\) came at a gigantic cost \- I would be giving up my soul, my dignity and my agency.

I was now 20 and debating what I wanted to do with myself. I got a call from the parents that said ""You have two options, come home and go to the local community college because we need to keep an eye on you or you're on your own."" So I told Edad, ""I'm on my own."" He was shocked. A few days later my dad called and I came out to him. He hung up the phone and called me right back. When I picked up it was my mom screaming, ""Your are out of the family. Don't come to the house, don't call the house, you are out of the family."" That was the last time I spoke to my mom.

I filled up my car with whatever I could fit in there and moved to another city in another state. I had tumultuous, abusive relationships with people that I should have avoided because I was trying to not be homeless. I worked my ass off in jobs that paid ok for a young person. I worked, did all the overtime I could and moved to another city. I did this several times through my 20s. Unfortunately, I couldn't take out loan and go to college because of my parents. In the US, you have to be 26 yo to be considered independent. SO, even though I was supporting myself, this policy prevented me from college. I felt that I really had two options: 1. Kill myself or 2. Live a life I wanted to live. At the time, I wanted to be a writer and I wanted to experience what life had to offer. So, I traveled. I would move to a new city and get a job. Kick my ass for a year or two and take a college class if I could afford it, then pack up my car and move again. By the time I was 30 I had lived in 7 different cities across the US. I love the anonymity of it all. Nobody knew who I was, I wasn't going to be cornered and confronted by someone who had heard slanderous stories about me from my mother.

I talked to my dad one when I was 27. He called me to tell me that my mom had breast cancer \- that it was stage 4, but she fought through it and she was fine now. Why didn't they call me when she was diagnosed, I wondered. I also considered that maybe things would change since she was faced with her own mortality. Of course, she never reached out to me.

Last year I was getting ready for my dissertation defense, the last step before earning a PhD, and I got a call from my aunt \(we started speaking a few years prior \- comparing stories of my nutty mom\). She saw an obituary in which the deceased shared the same name as my mom. After some internet research I discovered that it was my mom. I logged into my old email account, one that I never check, and there was an email from my dad saying that mom had died and that her ashes were going to be delivered to her favorite city by the beach and that I ""may want to pay my respects."" I felt relief when she died. I had been mourning her for a long time \- maybe not her specifically, but the mother I never had. I felt that with her death went the burden I had been carrying for 37 years \- that angry silence that exists between two people who do not speak to each other. When she was alive I counted the years that we were not speaking \- I collected the shame, anger, devastation, from each of those deafening yet silent years and I didn't need to do that anymore now that she was gone. There would be no more years to collect.

A few months later I got a package in the mail from my dad. It seemed that he was going though all of their stuff now that my mom was gone. I opened up the package to find: my infant immunization records, a few photos, my senior HS yearbook, a few photos and some other paperwork. I didn't know what to do with this. We hadn't spoken since the flying monkey conversation where he told me mom was a cancer survivor, which was 10 years ago. My Edad was so emotionally stunted, beat down, and obedient \(yet complicit in the abuse\) I didn't think he was trying to hurt me. But, I was hurt by this. Did he consider how I would feel when he sent me this package? Of course, he did not. He ended up sending me a similar package a few months later, this time with my elementary school report cards and other random stuff.

These are the takeaways from my 19 years of NC \(minus the one conversation and the two packages\): It was difficult for a long time in my 20s. I was learning to be a person for the first time. I was socially awkward and had low self\-esteem. I picked the wrong people for relationships. But, I wanted to go to college and I waited around to turn 26. By the time I could take out loans, I was ready for college. I got straight A's in all 4 of my college degrees. I met someone is amazing and we have been together for almost 8 years \- she is almost finished with her PhD, too.

I'm not the person I once was, I'm better. I'm worldly now, I have interesting perspectives that typical people don't have because I did everything on my own. This makes my academic projects more unique \- all of the hardship and being by myself, and feeling like a loser, and pushing myself out of my comfort zone, and taking chances, and hustling for money, and going to therapy, and working shitty jobs, and crying at night wondering if I should run home, and waiting for 7 years to go to college and seeing different kinds of people across the country has made me a unique person that has empathy, that is nonjudgmental, that takes chances, that thinks outside of the box, that is a hard worker, that is honest and that is a good friend \- all things that my mom never was. And I did this all on my own \- no one can take credit for any of it. I started out 19 years ago with some shit in my car and I am here now with a degree in what I wanted originally and my mom wouldn't let me have. It's mine and she can't ever take it away from me.

This is my story. I'm happy to answer questions if you have them. Young people, it gets better. It's devastating at first to leave. There are so many things to mourn. But, keep your head up and find some people you can trust and work hard and prove them all wrong. It's your journey, remember that. This is my pep talk.",raisedbynarcissists,1286

""Unfortunately, in both situations, in New York and in Los Angeles, there were competing [factions] from within the organizations,"" says Laurel D'Antoni, the coach's wife and daily sounding board.

Laurel, who has been with Mike since his playing days in Italy, long ago internalized her husband's run-and-gun, share-the-wealth basketball aesthetic. ""I hate iso,"" she's said often, including in a recent Lee Jenkins Sports Illustrated story.

But her view is also evolving—thanks to Houston's breakthrough season and out of deference to Harden's unique brand of scoring genius.

""He's just morphed because of his players,"" Laurel says of Mike. ""My husband is in looove with James Harden. I mean, I would like to have a little bit of that love that he's giving James Harden in my household. But I understand why. Because Mike said he's the best offensive player he's ever, ever, ever coached.""

seanymac14,2018-04-25 19:53:52+00:00,"""You'll Be Silent Forever"" [other]","Hi everyone, my name is Sean McNamara, I'm the nephew/godson of Michelle McNamara, author of I'll Be Gone In The Dark, the true crime book written about the EAR/ONS/Golden State Killer who ravaged through Sacramento and raped/murder countless victims in the 1970's and 80's. As I'm sure you all know, a suspect by the name of Joseph Deangelo was arrested today and will surely be convicted for his disgusting, heinous crimes. 
I believe that at one point there was a voice in his head that told him that he would get away with it all, that people would close their ears either due to distractions or wanting to erase him from their lives. But we never stopped listening for his voice. Michelle never stopped listening.

Waking up to this news today put me in a dissonant state of joy and melancholy. I remember in our summer cabin on Lake Michigan, about six or seven years ago. The area the cabin was in was blanketed by wilderness, and we owned two properties connected by a winding, dirt road overlooking a ravine. Late one night, she told me and all of my cousins the whole story of the EAR, from the crimes to the escapes to the lack of leads. the room was filled with around 10-12 people, all dead silent, mouths agape, listening. And as we walked back on that winding road in the middle of the night that seemed like it was dark as death,  I felt a grave feeling in the pit of my stomach that I had never felt before but I knew exactly what it was the moment I began to feel it. It was fear. When we made it to the other house, my cousin found a recording of a message left by the EAR on YouTube and played it, and I almost began crying; however, I couldn't stop listening. Michelle never stopped listening. 

Michelle's memorial service in Los Angeles was a melting pot of celebrities, Irish people, and policemen. The diverse group sounded like the beginning of a joke about three unlikely companions entering a bar together. But I think that it spoke to Michelle's compassionate connections that she made with everyone she encountered. One of the policemen she worked with closely when researching the EAR case spoke at her memorial, and the one quote I can't clear from my conscious is his last sentence. ""She never wore the badge, but she was one of us."" She had a vigor that inherently invigorated everyone around her. Family parties were always louder when Michelle was around. I was always happier when her smile radiated across a room.

I was brought to tears when I saw the support that this subreddit and the countless, COUNTLESS people who have showed love to Michelle's work and life today. I'm sure Michelle is watching down on us today and smiling her radiating smile because she knows that the largest step to closure for this crime was taken today. I hope she heard a doorbell ring at a quiet, small house in Citrus Heights, an “insistent bell” as only she could put it. I hope you watched the police take him away. And I know you did, because you were always listening, Michelle. 
Thank you for keeping your ears to the ground and helping us as a society take more steps to put more fuckers like this where they belong. Behind Bars. ",UnresolvedMysteries,3386
bus214,2018-04-23 19:40:30+00:00,Can I return this dress? Ignore the underwear.,"I used to work at a women's clothing store in a large out\-door mall in Los Angeles. The majority of our stock were jeans, tops, and ugly faux fur vests, but we also had a selection of ""special occasion"" dresses. These were usually on the skimpier side, and favored by young female 20 somethings headed to Las Vegas. Due to this trend, our store had a very strict 48\-hour return policy on these dresses, to try to deter women buying them, keeping the tag on, partying in Vegas, and returning them. When they are returned, they have to have a the original tag inside the dress attached, a tag that says ""48\-hour return policy"" that is attached to the OUTSIDE, and the original receipt. It was store policy to also write 48HRS in highlighter across the receipt just in case the customer missed/ignored the tags. 

That didn't stop plenty of customers from trying to return the dresses anyways. My personal favorite story is this: I am ME, the customer is C, and my manager is M

C: Walks up to the counter with a wrinkled bag and stands, staring at me, not saying anything. 

Me: Hello, did you want to return or exchange today?

C: Yes. I want to return this dress. \*tosses bad onto counter\*

Me: Oh no, I'm sorry, did it not work out?

C: No. I don't like it.

I took the dress out of the bag to ensure the tags were still attached. The tags were gone, the dress was wrinkled and there were pretty obvious deodorant stains on it. 

Me: Do you have the original receipt?

C: No. I threw it away.

Me: I'm sorry, we don't accept returns without the receipt, it doesn't have the tags, and this looks like it has been worn. We can't accept a return for this. 

She demanded to see my manager who I brought over and explained the situation. My manager says the same thing, we need a receipt etc etc.. while inspecting the dress.

M: I'm sorry, she's right this looks worn, and we have a strict rule to not accept returns if the item has been worn.

My manager is talking and lifts the dress to inspect it further. As she lifts it up, UNDERWEAR fall out of the bottom. Clearly used underwear. My manager and I stare at them in silence as the customer grabs them and sticks them in her purse. 

C: So can I return it?

M: \*Trying to stay professional\* No ma'am. You can't. You clearly wore it, we cannot accept this return. 

Thankfully the customer glared at us while tossing the dress back into the bag and stormed off without saying anything else. It was the weirdest attempted return I got the whole time I was there.

My name is Owen Husney and I have been in the music industry for 50 years. As an artist manager in Minneapolis, I discovered an 18 year old Prince, and was able to land him his first record deal with Warner Bros. Records. It was one of the biggest new artist signings in history at that time. Prince and I worked closely from 1976 to 1980 and lived together in Minneapolis, San Francisco and Los Angeles during this time. 

Since then, I have also worked as as a nightclub promoter and tour marketer working closely with many legendary artists including the Rolling Stones, Alice Cooper and Sonny and Cher. I signed Andre Simone and Jesse Johnson to record 
deals, earning 11 gold and platinum albums along the way. 

I’ve just released my memoir entitled “Famous People Who’ve Met Me” which is available [here] (https://www.famouspeoplethebook.com/)  for those interested in learning more about my life as a rock and roll businessman. 


For now I’ll be answering questions about myself so reddit, please AMA!

A few months ago San Francisco state representative Scott Wiener first proposed a piece of legislation **(SB 827)** which, if enacted, would very dramatically alter the building code landscape in Los Angeles (as well as other CA urban centers) in a manner directly tied to those issues I addressed in the previous post.  After reading a number of news articles concerning the proposal I'm struggling to find any breakdown of the bill which adequately summaries its provisions and lays out the ""winners and losers"" in our city should the bill come to pass.  

**Given that this would be the most impactful ""pro-urbanization"" piece of legislation in many years, and profoundly alter city and state wide residential development, I'm hoping to take an honest stab and writing up as impartial and comprehensive a summation as I can to its effect in the context of Los Angeles.**  For the sake of readability I'll first lay out what is in the provision as it currently stands, and then list those individuals and groups who benefit as well as those who likely will be negatively impacted by the bill.  For the sake of brevity and accuracy, I'll limit my take just to the effect on Los Angeles, where I primarily work as an architect.  



_




***What does SB 827 do?***

Put simply, the bill would override a significant portion of local (neighborhood and city) code that limits large, vertical construction anywhere within half a mile of a mass transit hubs.  

The most signficant changes would be: 

* a sharp decrease (or elimination) of required parking 
* a sharp increase in allowed height
* a significant increase in requirements for very low, low, and moderate-income units (after recent changes to the proposal) 
* very strict provisions of accommodating displaced current residents. 



_





***What areas of the city would see this change?***

It may be easier to say what areas WOULDN'T change.  The key is that the provision not only effects those parcels near metro and light rail stops (as has been the case with previous alterations to the code), but also anything within 1/4 of a mile from a ""high-quality bus corridor"".  This is defined as any bus line that runs with service intervals of no more than 15 minutes during peak hours and 30 minutes on weekends (essentially).   If it was just metro and light rail, that would be a relatively small area of impact but because bus lines are included the **affected area is almost all of the city that is NOT up in the hills**.



_




***What are the changes to required parking?***

This bill if enacted as currently written would constitue the most significant decrease in required parking for multifamily residential in the city's history and its not close.  All new qualifying residential development within 1/4 of a mile from a metro or light rail stop would see **parking requirements eliminated entirely.**  As I addressed in detail in my previous post nine months ago, dense multifamily housing's embodied cost of construction is drammaticly increased when (almost without exception) parking requirements must be met with above or below grade parking structures.   Per my firm's estimates, parking can encompass roughly 40% of all building costs in extreme cases (such as DTLA) and is rarely less than 15% of the cost of new construction in Los Angeles.  It is by far the most quasi-unique aspect of our code stipulations that increase cost per square foot of rentable units.  

But the larger impact may actually be outside this relatively small ""parking free"" zone.  The provision also limits parking requirements for anything built within 1/2 mile from metro OR 1/4 mile from a bus line to **.5 parking spots per unit - which would constitute at least a 50% reduction** in almost all affected areas of the city compared with current parking minimums.  THIS is the most significant aspect of the bill when it comes to spurring development, but has received almost no attention in most media publications I can find.  To be fair this matters most in LA and many writeups are coming from the SF perspective which has slightly different concerns.

***What are the changes to height limits?***

This is the change discussed the most from what I can see and to be fair it is in fact a big deal.  All new projects within 1/4 of a mile from a metro or light rail stop would be allowed to build up to **55ft above grade regardless of any lower limit**.  Further, anything built within 1/2 mile of a stop will have a limit of 45 feet.  This is significant but the increases are not a pronounced as one might imagine.  Given LA's willingness the past 5 years to allow exemptions from height restrictions near metro stations, the most significant change will be that developers can build up to five stories ""by right"" instead of having to go the city and essentially beg / horse trade for an exemption.  While this will cut costs and encourage more building starts, this metro adjacent area won't see a dramatic change.  The original proposal said 85 feet for its limit, but this was reduced to 55 in the last few days as the bill in being altered to make it more palatable for opponents (more on that later). **However, its very important to note that 5 stories in most cases is what a given site can support in most areas of the city** (excepting very dense areas like DTLA or Ktown).  Per LA seismic code you are allowed to do up to three stories of Type 5 (wood frame AKA cheap) structure.  Anything higher will require Type 1 (concrete AKA expensive) or Type 2 (steel AKA expensive) construction.  Typically what you would do for a low cost per square foot mid rise building is a first floor of concrete (the podium) which houses retail and a lobby and then build those 3 stories of wood condo or rental units on top of the podium.  That is why you'll see so many new multifamily resi projects in LA with roughly 4-5 stories (including a tall first floor or retail built in concrete).  **This is one of the least expensive ways to build multifamily residential and if we want to actually build affordable new construction its probably going to look a lot like this.  Big tall concrete buildings get more attention but its these 4-5 story projects that actually make a dent in the housing crisis.**  Some urbanist voices have said in recent days that the reduction from 85 to 55 feet ""neuters"" the bill, but actually even if it was increased back to 85 the effect would not be significant in most areas of the city that do not have the demand for expensive, Type 1 towers.  Most areas that DO have such demand already have provisions for such height.  

**Put simply, those areas near metro stops that are NOT highly urbanized but can support higher density for ""mid-rise"" developments will be the true change, overriding dozens of local provisions and planning limitations that make mid-density impossible currently without specially granted waivers from local governing bodies.**

As a note, there are also key changes to FAR (floor area ratio) limitations but these mostly keep the changes in line with what is proposed for height limitations.  For the purpose of this writeup I'm not going to get into FAR as it can get confusing fast and height is easier to understand.

***What are the changes to requirements for low income units?***

Here is where things get complex.  When the bill was originally put forward in January, there were virtually no provisions for low income housing.  But after strong condemnation from various representative groups and governmental bodies, the bill has been altered significantly to include very high requirements for low income units.  Many of the writeups I've seen lambast the bill for its original lack of provisions and I can't find many that address the changes added in the past few days.  

Significantly, this includes three distinct types - very low, low, and moderate-income units.  This ""shades of grey"" approach is relatively novel here in LA where typically the only distinction will be ""low"" or ""market rate"" per the building code (local distinctions vary).  Though the explicit bill itself **does NOT define** what constitutes ""very low"" ""low"" and ""moderate income"" **its reasonable to expect those who are too well payed for the traditional low income housing but are too poorly paid to afford market rate units may qualify for ""moderate-income"" housing.**  

**More importantly perhaps though, the required percentages per SB 827 are, in the bill's current form, MORE restrictive than current provisions in most if not all of LA's municipalities.**  The specific percent varies according to the size of the project, with larger projects requiring high percentages of below market rate units.  For instance, here are the requirements for a project with 51 or more units in the affected area:

* 11% of units shall be ""very low income households""
* 20% of units shall be ""low income households""
* 40% of units shall be ""moderate-income households"".

I've worked on over a dozen major resi towers in LA over the years and I have never seen a project with 40% below market rate units.  These may happen in certain places in LA but this bill would make such building starts a lot more common. **I don't think its an overstatement to say this bill would sharply increase the number of below market rate units in the city.**

As an added note, regardless of whether any current tenants remain in the new complex, **the number of affordable units on site may not be decreased under any circumstances** regardless of what form the new construction takes on.  This is considerably more ""pro-tenant"" from current policy with the exception of a small portion of South LA which has a comparable provision.

***What are the changes to provisions of accommodating displaced current residents?***
Similarly to the previous section, this question has very different answers depending if you read the bill as originally proposed or in its current, ammended form.  I won't go too deep here as doing so really is leaving my area of expertise.  But in essence, the current bill has very significant provisions for those displaced current renters should their unit be demolished in pursuance of a higher density construction project.  The original bill's provision might be generously called ""pretty thin"" but this has completely changed in the ammendments.

In a nutshell, if you have lived in a unit for at least 5 years which will be rendered unlivable during and/or after construction on site (i.e. demolished or considerably renovated) you will be entitled to:  

* a relocation assistance and benefits plan (similar to what is currently offered in most municipalities)
* you will have the right to remain after construction in a comparable unit (same or better square feet and ease of access)
* your rent during and after construction will be the **same as previous** (plus any standardized increase allowed by rent control)
* should you decide to leave at any point during or after construction, your unit will revert to being an affordable unit (so there **won't be any incentive for your landlord to use tricks to make you leave** as he/she will not be able to make any additional money from the new tenant that replaces you)

#WHO WINS AND WHO LOSES


_

##WINNERS

* **Any renter or prospective condo buyer who is hoping to use public transport for their primary ways to getting around.**
This one is pretty straightforward.  The primary motivation of this bill is to drasticly increase dense development near public transport for those who will use the metro / light rail / major bus lines to get to and from work, etc.  If you don't own or want to own a car in LA, or you use your vehicle only for the weekends for instance,  and don't want the embodied cost of car ownership rolled into your rent, you are arguably the ""biggest winner"" should this bill come to pass.

* **People who are too well payed to qualify for low income housing but too poorly paid to afford market rate units.**  As mentioned above, this bill specificly sets a ""grades of grey"" approach which allows those of in this economic range to have below-market-rate units.  Instead of a single yes or no qualification which is dominate in LA, the bill divides units into ""very low"" ""low"" ""moderate income"" and ""market rate"" units, with extremely high requirements  for these sub-market rate units.

* **People who qualify for low income housing currently but are unable to find such a unit due to lack of supply**  This one is also addressed above but in essence the number of affordable units constructed in the city would see a significant increase, particularly in those communities which previously have made such units very difficult to build.

* **Anyone who hopes to rent or buy a condo in areas of the city that have a developed mass transit system but do not allow or make it very difficult currently to build multifamily housing.** 
The best example of this is probably Santa Monica, but virtually all areas not in the hills and not within highly densified neighborhoods like DTLA and KTown can reasonably expect a significant increase in available units once the bill's provisions are enforced.

* **Anyone who currently owns a single family home (or condo) within 1/2 mile of metro and light rail stations.**  
There's no getting around the fact that your metro adjacent home (or more precisely the land under your home) would sharply rise in value due to the hypothetical potential of the site for more dense residential.   Given that Prop 13 already limits tax increases triggered by rising assessed home value, this would be purely a ""win-win"" for you.

* **Those who desire more pedestrian friendly retail near major mass transit stops.**
The provisions in the bill clearly incentive what's called ""mixed use"" development, with ground foor retail and office rentals and condos or rental units above grade.  This, coupled with LA's existing strong incentives for pedestrian friendly retail within 1500 feet of metro stops make new retail at ground level the overwhelming choice for new developments.  The closer the development is to the mass transit stop itself, the strong the incentive becomes.

* **Those for whom traffic, particularly rush hour traffic, is a major concern.**  
By sharply reducing parking requirements and sharply increasing density near mass transit, this bill directly incentives working tenants and condo owners to use such transit for their daily commute in particular as opposed to personal vechiles.  While we would be silly to expect less traffic on the highways in any immediate time frame, the traffic would be reduced relative to the hypothetical scenario where these ""mass transit hub"" concentrations do not exist and all those same people are driving on the highway to and from work.

* **People who are particularly concerned about the environment or want to reduce their carbon footprint.**
This is definitely a subsidiary benefit.  Supporting this bill exclusively due to its benefits on the environment seems drastic considering its effect won't be nearly as dramatic in this regard as in other ways.  BUT, more people living closer to where they work, and using mass transit for their commutes, and concentrating living, shopping, eating, etc along these metro lines would in fact significantly lower the carbon footprint of those prospective residents.  Just as importantly, a single family home in a feeder city (such as Riverside or Glendale) has exponentially higher carbon footprint compared to a similarly priced condo along a metro line in the city proper.  Just to understand the impact, you need to keep in mind that **new construction and maintenance of buildings account for 39% of all carbon emission in the United States.**

* **Smaller developers and developers primarily based outside of Los Angeles.**  This one is tricky but important.  Not all developers are created equal, and our current state of affairs significantly benefits those large, mainstay corporations of the city who have either the power and friendships to get waivers from city and community ordinances or the money to hire any of the dozens of city consultancies which make their living persuading and bargaining with the city for waivers which allow otherwise forbidden urban development.  A very key change that this  bill would enact is that many of the developments currently proposed could be build ""By Right"".  ""By Right"" construction means that the developer is entirely building according to code without the need for waivers.  This bill would allow for far more of such construction near mass transit, as well as faster turn around times (due to no bargaining and resultant lawsuits regarding such waivers).  





##LOSERS (aka people who will be hurt by this bill)

* **City, community, and neighborhood governing bodies**
This group is categorically the biggest ""loser"" should this bill come to pass due to loss of power on many fronts.  First and foremost the bill would essentially override local ordiances that limit height and require parking, as well as override community plans that limit the construction of multi-family residential in previously single family only neighborhoods.  **But JUST AS IMPORTANTLY, these governing bodies also lose their power to bargain with prospective developers hoping for waivers**.  Typically, if a developer wants to add more stories than are allowed, or have less parking than is allowed, they will have to ""give back"" to the community in some other way.  These ways include but are not limited to additional low income housing (though not typically as much as this bill would require) and also street improvements, bankrolling of community parks and gardens, graffiti cleanup, etc.  Its easy to see this as just gatekeepers mad about losing their power, but losing the benefits of that bargaining isn't something that can be so simply dismissed.

* **Those who want to live near a metro stop, but are highly dependent on their vehicle.**  While it is true that already such individuals have significantly more options for housing than in almost any major american city, this bill would significantly reduce the ratio of parking to tenants near mass transit in new construction, which would afford a car loving, urban renter or condo owner less options when buying or renting their next home.

* **Those who are in the market to own a single family home within 1/2 mile of a metro or light rail stop.**  As mentioned above, this bill would significantly increase the potential of such properties to be converted into multifamily buildings, and as such would raise the value of such properties accordingly.  

* **Those so do NOT desire increased vertical development in LA or in their specific community**.  This one is pretty obvious.  The feeling is certainly going to be particularly pronounced in places such as Santa Monica which have for decades made vertical construction very very difficult.  

* **Those who are hoping to expand mass transit to resistant areas of the city** We have already seen fights between local governing bodies and the city over expanding the metro and bus lines, but when that expansion also triggers opportunities for dense urban development those fights are going to get a lot more fierce I would venture to say.

* **Those who are living in a relatively cheap, underdeveloped area near the metro, and have been living there for LESS than five years.**  As noted above, the bill as currently proposed includes very strong tenants rights provisions.  However, those provisions are only available to those tenants who have been living on the prospective site of construction for 5 or more years.  If by some good fortune you found your perfect metro adjacent unit with a low cost in the last five years, you are put at risk of being evicted without those robust tenants rights provisions.
 



_







**So... do YOU support the bill?**

As it is currently written, I would *hesitantly* support the bill myself.  I have serious concerns about the sweeping scale of such a bill, but given we have proven so inept at addressing the housing crisis at a neighborhood and city scale, a statewide bill of this magnitude may be the best hope we have.  I would feel a lot better if in the coming days of discussion we are able to provide more clarity and specificity to some of the provisions, but after the most recent series of changes to the bill to strengthen tenants rights provision and substantially increase very-low, low, and moderate income housing provisions, I would consider the bill to be significantly more of a benefit to the city of Los Angeles than a impediment.  

**Also, why should we trust you?**

I've done my best to lay out the provisions as best I can and give an honest assessment of the pros and cons of the bill for specific people.  I am a practicing architect with quite a few years of work in LA - almost exclusively in multi-family residential.  While this gives me (hopefully) more insight into the issue than your average person, it also should be noted that I have direct personal stake in this issue.  If this bill passes it will (almost certainly) mean more work for me, less headaches working with city and neighborhood code issues, and faster turn around between original proposal and projects breaking ground.  I've tried to isolate those factors from my synopsis, but if you feel I've been unfair in my analysis then I suppose I can try to do better in the future. 


#TLDR - 
Put simply, the SB 827 would override a significant portion of local (neighborhood and city) code that limits large, vertical construction anywhere within half a mile of a mass transit hubs.  Should it come to pass as currently proposed, **it would constitute the most significant change to Los Angeles prevailing building code in a generation, and be by far the most significant move toward urbanization that we have yet seen**.  However, there are serious ramifications both positive and negative for different people and I'd encourage you to look back at least to the ""winners and losers"" section to get an idea of how the bill would affect you personally and your community.

PippyDickling,2018-04-16 13:00:25+00:00,The Kawhi Situation for Dummies,"First it was normal

Kawhi was injured, he played 9 games

[Then](https://imgur.com/rrCBvLN) 

1) Spurs doctors misdiagnosed him

2) He got injured again because they misdiagnosed him

3) Spurs doctors cleared him again

4) He's already been fucked over by them in 2012,  and recently again

5) He got his own doctors, they haven't cleared him, the fuck up Spurs doctors already have cleared him
(because that worked out great the last time) 

Basically the thing everyone is pissing their pants about is that ""hE iS clEarEd tO pLaY"" which he is, by a medical staff that's already fucked up.

6) So really he's not cleared to play by doctors who don't give a shit about basketball and more so his health. 

Fans are kinda dumb and don't understand how team doctors work but Shaq, Charles Barkley, Pierce, Scottie Pippen, Tracy McGrady, Kenny Smith and **David Robinson** all said team doctors don't care about what the athlete is feeling or their pain level they just want you out there, so they'll get a second opinion. 

This part up here is where the divide happens, you have some people taking the players side, and others taking the franchises side.

7) He's choosing to rehab and save his career instead of Isaiah Thomasing, Derrick Rose-ing and Grant Hilling his career.

Basically the ""*second opinion*"" is what has everyone's panties in a knot. (believe me I know, I'm in the Spurs subreddit) 

All this extra ""he must want a trade"", ""he wants out of San Antonio"", ""Manu is pregnant and it's Patty's"", ""he's forcing a trade"" and those things are all BS speculation headlines. There's this idea that he's secretly an emotional flamboyant diva conspiring a trade. (I've seen the dude show no emotion for 7 years, I doubt that's it).

People were pissing themselves and jumping to conclusions because he wasn't sitting with his team in California, I would hope not, he's trying to get healthy for next seasons in New York. 

Also regarding the ""he doesn't communicate"". He doesn't communicate with the media (who are all trash TMZ reporters who still think Lebron is going to Los Angeles because they live in Los Angeles) but he speaks to Popovich and the Spurs group chat on a daily basis.

So the two trains of thought are

1. He's secretly concocted an elaborate plot to leave a supermax contract in order to be traded

2. He's rehabbing for next season.

Which one sounds more fun?

I remind you this is the same internet and media that went crazy for a haircut Kawhi didn't have this offseason. (Google it) ",nba,12743

NitroXYZ,2018-04-12 04:54:15+00:00,[OC] Every NBA Team Ranked By How Well They Have Performed To Preseason Expectations This Regular Season.,"  
With the regular season now done and dusted I decided it would be cool to take a look back at every NBA team this season and place them into tiers on the level that they have performed at this season. Of course every situation is different and so I have factored in the teams overall win-loss record but also how they have responded to difficult situations this season such as injuries or the context of how they have performed.  
  
**This is just my opinion and I am keen to shuffle the list around if people disagree with my results so feel free to leave your input and I will be very willing to take it into consideration. Please don’t be too harsh and I will try to make sure my rankings are as accurate as possible**  
  
———————————————————————————————————————————  
   
Just a couple other things to consider:  
—When I state my predicted expectations It as an average of preseason rankings from ESPN, 
Bleacher Report, Sports Illustrated, CBS Sports and USA Today. 
-This is the link to the NBA preseason power ranking predictions that I make reference to in my post. (https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/76r1af/201718_season_predictions_from_the_rnba_power/) 
  
———————————————————————————————————————————  
     
**Completely Exceeded Expectations**  
  
**—Indiana Pacers** W/L Record: 48-34  
The Indiana Pacers were predicted to win 32 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as few as 30 games. They were viewed as a team that would be stuck in a difficult rebuild position after the departure of Paul George but have performed outstandingly. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions just 2/30 voters expected Indiana to make the playoffs and both of those were as the 8th seed. Indiana winning close to 50 games was just ridiculous to even consider and something not even the biggest Pacers fans would’ve thought possible.  

If they were to have any success this season most people thought it would come from the development of young centre Myles Turner who would carry the load for Indiana and have a break through season but it was former Thunder player Victor Oladipo that has come to the rescue. In his first season in Indiana Oladipo has improved his scoring this season from 15.9 points per game to an incredible 23.1while also posting career high numbers in rebounds, assists, steals, blocks and shooting the best splits of his 5 season career. Victors ability to turn the Pacers into a not just a borderline but great playoff team this season should not go unrecognised and he is likely to be awarded the NBA award for Most Improved Player by seasons end. 

**—Philadelphia 76ers** W/L Record: 52-30   
The Philadelphia 76ers were predicted to win 39 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as few as 33 games. The common thought process around the 76ers was that they were an exciting young team whose lack of experience may prevent them from making playoffs but they could make a lot of noise in a year or two. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 12/30 voters expected Philadelphia to make the playoffs with more than half of those tipping and 8th seed. This enough would’ve been considered a great achievement for the 76ers but instead they have improved tremendously and will own home court advantage in the first round of playoffs.  
  
Perhaps the most obvious reason for Philadelphias surge this year has been the emergence of rookie superstar Ben Simmons who has averaged 16/8/8 through the season and has played brilliant defence. His playmaking ability is already elite and despite the lack of an effective jump shot he is still able to score 16 points per game on efficient shooting. The generational talent is playing at a level we have rarely seen in the NBA from anyone but to be doing it at such a young age is frightening for the rest of the league. I might be a Utah fan but in the end I think that what Ben Simmons has achieved in his first year of actual play has been special which is why I think he is the 2017-18 Rookie of the year. 

**—Boston Celtics** W/L Record: 55-27     
The Boston Celtics were predicted to win 54 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as few as 49 games. Some people thought that was a little generous given the enormous roster turnaround that saw just 4 Celtics remain from the team that made the ECF just a year prior, while others considered this squad a direct upgrade over last seasons team. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions Boston were considered almost a consensus top 2 team in the East with 28/30 rankers voting accordingly. The Celtics season began in shocking fashion when they suffered a devastating blow as newly acquired all-star Gordon Hayward went down with a season ending injury. This lead many to questioning what Boston could actually achieve this season. Some wondering whether the squad could even make the playoffs.  
  
It hasn’t been an issue for them and they have marched to the second seed in the East despite other key injuries to forward Marcus Morris and defensive guard Marcus Smart missing close to a 3rd of the year. Kyrie Irving demonstrated to the league that he has what what it takes to lead a great team after leaving Lebron and the Cavs in the offseason and being able to take the 2nd seed in the East. As is the theme with these Celtics Irving has missed 20 games through injury and will be out for their playoff push. None the less what the Celtics have been able to achieve this season is nothing short of incredible and In my opinion Brad Stevens deserves recognition for his role in their success and should win Coach Of The Year.

**Exceeded Expectations**  

**—Utah Jazz**  W/L Record: 48-34       
The Utah Jazz were predicted to win 42 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as few as 36 games. In a somewhat similar situation to Indiana many expected a decline from the Jazz when Gordon Hayward left in free agency. The common belief existed that Utah were not a playoff caliber team and that their lack of offensive fire power would leave them exposed and their defence would not be able to compensate for that. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions only 3/30 voters expected Utah to finish higher than the 8th seed. In the end improvements from Ingles and Rubio, a bounce back year for Favors and the unexpected emergence Donovan Mitchell has helped lead the Jazz to the 5th seed in a super competitive Western Conference.   
  
However when speaking of impact and the Utah Jazz it is simply impossible not to mention defensive anchor Rudy Gobert. Their is a direct correlation to Utahs success and Rudy Gobert playing this season. None more so then when Gobert went down with a second knee injury in late November which lead to him missing close to 30 games before finally returning. However since his return the Jazz have a record of 30-8 and the best defence in the league. Despite the amount of games he has missed this year I think Gobert is deserving of this seasons Defensive player of the year award for his impact on the Jazz and how great of magnitude a difference he has made when he is on the court.  

**—Houston Rockets** W/L Record: 65-17     
The Houston Rockets were predicted to win 57 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as few as 55 games. Unlike most other situations were teams have exceeded expectations the Rockets still had very high hopes bested upon them after finishing second in the Western conference. There were concerns that the backcourt duo of Harden and Paul would struggle chemistry wise but that hasn’t been a problem at all. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30 voters predicted a top four seed for the Rockets with 18/30 voters expected Houston to finish second, but with no votes for first. A combination of outstanding performance and Golden State injuries has lead to them finishing as the far and away the number one team in the league and dare I say championship favourite?  
  
An underrated aspect of their excellence this season has been the defensive improvement of the Rockets powered by Ariza, Capella, Mbah A Moute and Tucker. Really though we can all pin point where the majority of the Rockets success has come from and that is the MVP level play of James Harden. The Beard is this seasons favourite for the MVP having averaged 31/5/9 but Houston and leading his team to the best record. Houston are every chance right now to go all the way and take home their 3rd championship in franchise history and I am intrigued to see if they can carry there form into the playoffs. 
  
**—Portland Trailblazers** W/L Record: 49-33  
The Portland Trailblazers were predicted to win 41 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as few as 37 games. Heading into the season they were expected to take home a low playoff spot as they hadn’t changed too much in the offseason but were still a reliably good team. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 21/30 voters anticipated a playoff berth but none saw the Blazers as a top 4 seed. Despite a poorer end to the season then they would’ve liked the Blazers were able to out perform their expectations lead by the amazing performance of Damian Lillard while CJ McCollum has still been effective in a bit of a down year. Perhaps what has been most impressive for the Blazers is the transformation for Portland on the defensive side of the court as they have finished top 10 in defence, A distinct characteristic that separates this squad from other Portland teams of the past.   
    
**—Toronto Raptors** W/L Record: 59-23  
The Toronto Raptors were predicted to win 47 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as few as 43 games. After a disappointing exist from the playoffs last season after being swept people still considered the Raptors to be a good team but didn’t quite think they would be competing for a championship. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30 voters expected playoffs but just 1 voter expected a top two seed which the Raptors were ultimately able to achieve rather clinically. A complete culture reset placing a greater emphasis on three point shooting and general ball movement has been a big part of their success and that is without even making reference to their incredible bench. They were expected to make the playoffs but a near 60 win season is something that not even die hard Raptors fans could’ve seen coming. While I am predicting Brad Stevens to win Coach of they year I definitely think Casey should be runner up.  
  
**—New Orleans Pelicans** W/L Record: 48-34  
The New Orleans Pelicans were predicted to win 41 games in the preseason with Sports Illustrated predicting them to win as few as 39 games. To be perfectly honest while New Orleans were recognised for their talent having two players that are arguably top 10 they were considered to in the preseason to be a team that would fail to succeed which is why expectations were so low. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions just 2/30 voters though they would finish sixth or higher. Throw in the fact that DeMarcus Cousins has missed 35 games and I think you have to say the Pelicans season exceed expectations. Huge credit is due to Anthony Davis who is having an insane season offensively and defensively is currently looking to win the first playoff series of his young career. The Pelicans are definitely a team to look out for next season with a healthy Cousins, rejuvenated Holiday and Mirotic continuing to play an effective role in the team.
  
———————————————————————————————————————————  
   
**Slightly Exceeded Expectations**  

**—Brooklyn Nets**  W/L Record: 28-54  
The Brooklyn Nets were predicted to win 28 games in the preseason with CBS Sports predicting them to win as few as 21 games. Even thought the preseason projections were pretty accurate Id say that the Nets were able to exceeded expectations with the way they were able to remain competitive against strong teams and were able to play overcoming an early season injury to Jeremy Lin and D’Angelo Russell missing large parts of the season as well. Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris and Rondae Hollis Jefferson all made big improvements this season for the Nets and capped of a satisfactory season for Brooklyn. Rookie Jarret Allen looks like an exciting prospect and was one of the bright spots on the year. I’m still not too sure what the future holds for the Nets but as a starting point they finally own their own draft pick next season. Additionally I feel that this season has helped Brooklyn at least identify more players part of their long term plans.  
  
**—Chicago Bulls** W/L Record: 27-55  
The Chicago Bulls were predicted to win 25 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as few as 20 games. After a shocking start where the Bulls were just 3-20 they had a mini revival as Mirotic returned from injury but he was moved in a trade to New Orleans later on. Lauri Markannen had an exciting rookie season, Kris Dunn improved tremendously and Zach LaVine played well after returning from his ACL injury. The Bulls fans might have preferred the team win less games to ensure a higher draft pick but I think this year will be considered a good result after departing from Jimmy Butler and starting their first season in the rebuild.  
  
**—LA Clippers** W/L Record: 42-40    
The LA Clippers were predicted to win 45 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report predicting them to win as few as 43 games. Despite losing Chirs Paul in the offseason people still expected the Clippers to be competing for and making the playoffs. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 20/30 voters said that the Clippers would make the playoffs. It makes it interesting to judge because on the one hand the Clippers were very close to their expected win mark but they still didn’t make the playoffs in a super competitive West. Their season began fairly well for the Clippers but as time went on they began to suffer seriously in injuries with Beverly, Gallinari and Teodosic all missing significant time. Blake Griffins trade was a move that has actually set the Clippers up well for the future as well. Sure they didn’t make the playoffs but Its hard for me to deny that what their side has been able to achieve through great adversity is commendable. The star of the show for the Clippers was definitely Lou Williams. The clear 6th man of the year played at an allstar level having a career best season. I think next season the Clippers are set to shake up the West when healthy.  
  
———————————————————————————————————————————  
   
**Met Expectations**  
  
**—Minnesota Timberwolves** W/L Record: 47-35  
The Minnesota Timberwolves were predicted to win 48 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as many as 50 games. The expectations coming into the season was that Minnesota were a young team who with an added allstar in Jimmy Butler would compete for a top 4 seed in the conference. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 25/30 voters expected the Wolves to make the playoffs with 11 of those expecting them to be in the 5th position. The drought is now finally over and Minnesota are back in the playoffs after ending a 15 year streak without postseason action. It was a nervy finish but they got there. They were expected to finish a little higher but to finally just make the 8, I don’t think any Wolves fans will worry. This squad was the 3rd seed in the West when healthy and will be looking to shake things up.  
  
**—New York Knicks** W/L Record: 29-53 
The New York Knicks were predicted to win 30 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as many as 35 games. The year didn’t start off too poorly and looked to be a dark horse competitor for a low playoff seed being lead by the terrific play of younger superstar Kristaps Porzingis. Porzingis had thrived in a role as the number one option following the Carmelo Anthony before an ACL injury derailed his campaign. Trey Burke has had a resurgence much like Michael Beasley, Tim Hardaway has been solid and Kanter has had a career best season. There is good reason for optimism for the Knicks going forward but they still need just one more young piece.  

**—Miami Heat** W/L Record: 44-38   
The Miami Heat were predicted to win 43 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as many as 44 games. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions they were tipped to finish as either the 6th or 7th seed in the East. There isn’t really too much more to add for the Heat as they have performed exactly the way many thought they would. Goran Dragic making his first all star appearance was a highlight of the season for the Heat and Wayne Ellington has been a big improver.   
  
**—LA Lakers** W/L Record: 35-47   
The La Lakers were predicted to win 32 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as many as 35 games. Things didn’t really start off very well follow for Los Angeles but after a poor first half of the season the Lakers played above 0.500 basketball for the 2nd half. It was a stretch that included some wins against good teams and showed their fans a slight glimpse into what the future holds. I think its fair to say Lonzo didn’t quite live up to expectations but Ingram’s improvement was exciting for the Lakers and they found and absolute steal in Kyle Kuzma. The future is promising and who knows, If they can attract a big name free agent this summer they could find themselves well in the mix for playoff next season. 
  
**—Sacramento Kings** W/L Record: 26-56      
The Sacramento Kings were predicted to win 31 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as many as 27 games. Bogdan Bogdanovic had a successful rookie season and Fox has produced some breathtaking highlights specifically in the clutch. In their first full season without DeMarcus Cousins in quite some time, despite not meeting the win expectations, I think the Kings have made up for that on the back of the performance of their young players this season which have provided them with some excitement in the future.  
  

**—Atlanta Hawks** W/L Record: 24-58   
The Atlanta Hawk were predicted to win 27 games in the preseason with USA Today expecting them to win as many as 32 games. While they weren’t really set with high expectations I still feel that Atlanta has been ok in their circumstances. Additionally they aren’t exactly just an easy beat that their record would have you suggest as the performed very well against the Western conference and some of there elite teams. Dennis Shroeder didn’t quite have the break out season Atlanta fans were expecting but Taurean Prince was able to elevate his play and the Hawks have found themselves in a good position to net a high draft pick and set themselves up for the future as they continue to retool while remaining competitive.  
  
———————————————————————————————————————————  
   
**Slightly Didn’t Meet Expectations**  
   
**—San Antonio Spurs** W/L Record: 47-35   
The San Antonio Spurs were predicted to win 54 games in the preseason with USA Today expecting them to win as many as 57 games. After a great playoff run that ended in disappointment following an injury to Kawhi Leonard the Spurs entered the season as one of the favourites for the championship and another great season. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 29/30 voters expected San Antonio to finish as a top 4 seed in the Western conference. Of corse this prediction was made with the assumption that Kawhi Leonard would play out the entire season. Similar to the Warriors Its hard to measure what the Spurs have achieved this year but ultimately I think they have been able to perform sufficiently enough to not be considered a big failure but in the end of the day what they achieved was still not what we planned. Their 20 year streak of 50 wins came to and end as well but their playoff streak lived on. LaMarcus Aldridge deserves tremendous recognition and respect for what he has been able to help San Antonio achieve this year as the number one option.  
   
**—Washington Wizards** W/L Record: 43-39  
The Washington Wizards were predicted to win 48 games in the preseason with USA Today expecting them to win as many as 51 games. I expected the Wizards to be a top 3 seed and based of off their form in the back end of last season I thought they could legitimately challenge for the Easts top seed. It is understandable why they have struggled this season however with star point guard John Wall having missed about half the season. It will be interesting to see how they play this playoffs with a healthy team and whether they can steal a series victory from one of the leagues top seeds.  
  
**—Denver Nuggets** W/L Record: 46-36   
The Denver Nuggets were predicted to win 44 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as many as 47 games. The expectations coming into the season was that Denver were a young team who with an added allstar in Paul Millsap would compete for a huge seed in the Western Conference but just a fall short of a top 4 spot. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 27/30 voters expected Denver to make the playoffs with 20 of those as a either a 5th or 6th seed. A late 6 game win streak wasn’t enough to for the Nuggets whose final night of the season loss saw them miss the playoffs. Jokic, Harris and Murray were seen as a big three that could matchup extremely well with the Warriors but in the end they won’t even qualify. Expect a big bounce back next season if they finally fire Malone and get an adequate coach
  
———————————————————————————————————————————  
   
**Didn’t Meet Expectations**  
  
**—OKC Thunder** W/L Record: 48-34
The OKC Thunder were predicted to win 52 games in the preseason with USA Today expecting them to win as many as 59 games. The external expectation around this squad was that Carmelo Anthony and Paul George where big upgrades to a squad that won 47 games the year prior. Some people were even considering OKC as the second best team in the league following the Paul George trade. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions their lowest rank was at 4th in the West from 30 voters so they were very much expected to do well. However that hasn’t eventuated and the team has been really disappointing as a whole this season. It seems strange that adding a player with 10 consecutive allstar appearances and another with 5 career appearances only helped OKC win one extra game. Thunder fans are quick to point out Roberson’s injury but the reality is that a team with two prime top 15 players should not have been struggling so much to make playoffs. Perhaps they have been cruising though and I guess we will see this postseason. 

**—Detroit Pistons** W/L Record: 39-43  
The Detroit Pistons were predicted to win 39 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as many as 43 games. Pre-season predictions often centred around the seeding of the final spots in the East with the Pistons one of the teams expected to compete. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 11/30 voters saw tipped them for make a playoff appearance but many others considering them a 9th seed at worst. Detroit looked to have shown the league that they were a playoff caliber when they started 9-3 but weren’t able to continue that form and ended up finishing as the 9th seed. A desperate trade for Blake Griffin in the back end of the season saw Harris and Bradley flipped in what appeared to be a panic decision and attempted quick fix but paired with Reggie Jacksons injury and other issues in play style they were unable to make a big playoff push. Andre Drummond took another step forward in his development after a down year last season and I think they could make the top 8 next season. I just don’t see a tremendous upside for this team in the long run. Oh, and after they took on Griffins lengthy contract, they could be stuck around the 7-10 range for a while.  
  
**—Orlando Magic** W/L Record: 25-57 
The Orlando Magic were predicted to win 31 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as many as 34 games. Expectations weren’t very high but there was hope that they would start to take a step forward and make solid progress in their rebuild. The Magic started the season looking like a playoff threat and were the surprise team of the first month after an 8-4 start which included big wins over Cleveland and San Antonio. That stretch however was completely unrepresentative of how their season would pan out and they finished with a bottom 5 record in the league. For most young teams I can see a sense of direction and progress but Orlando is one team that really confuses me. Expect a big fire sale this offseason as they try to clear out and start fresh again.  
  
**—Milwaukee Bucks** W/L Record: 44-38
The Milwaukee were predicted to win 46 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as many as 49 games. There was excitement around the team that they could be a legitimate dark horse and Giannis could push himself into the MVP conversation, which admittedly appeared possible early but the Bucks have just been mediocre since then. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions they were widely considered to be a top 5 seed or 6 seed with 20/30 voters placing them in this range. The early season addition of Bledsoe should’ve also helped them challenge for a high seed but ultimately they fell over the line to make their way into the playoffs. The pieces are there for the Bucks to be a better team and with a good coach next season It will be interesting to see how far they can go as Giannis is only getting better.  
  
**—Phoenix Suns** W/L Record: 21-61  
The Phoenix Suns were predicted to win 27 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as many as 30 games. They weren’t a team seen as a big threat or a squad ready to make a leap but they weren’t meant to be the outright worst in the league. For this reason despite not having a specifically impressive total of wins to meet expectations there was optimism around the Devin Booker lead Suns and fans really haven’t seen any of that. Its another disappointing season for the franchise who haven’t really found their way again since the heartbreak of 2013-14. One thing to look forward to for the Suns is that they do have the leagues best odds for the number number pick and should they draft well could have a legit duo to build around going forward.  
  
**—Golden State Warriors** W/L Record: 58-24  
The Golden State Warriors were predicted to win 66 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as many as 69 games. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30 voters expected the Warriors to finish with the leagues best record. It feels strange saying that a team with the leagues 3rd best record didn’t meet expectations but that ultimately is the reality. All thought Its a little hard to measure how the Warriors have performed this season with their starters missing significant time. Specifically two time MVP in Stephen Curry who missed 30 games in the year and the Warriors aren’t quite at the same level without him. Despite their clear injury problems I have to say that the Warriors have failed to meet expectation for the reason that they have struggled a lot more defensively this season and the fact that they didn’t finish first in the league. Additionally Klay Thompson and Draymond Greens performances in the closing games off the year without Steph were extremely below capitalised by a 40 point blowout loss to the Jazz.
———————————————————————————————————————————  
   
**Completely Didn’t Meet Expectations**  
  
**—Dallas Mavericks** W/L Record: 24-58    
The Dallas Mavericks were predicted to win 34 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as many as 38 games. I remember at one point last season Mark Cuban making a statement that if his team was in the East then they wouldn’t be tanking, and if I recall correctly, competing for a low playoff spot. Well Dallas didn’t even come close to that and finished with one of the leagues worst records. Dennis Smith Jr had some solid moments in his rookie year and Mavericks fans cant be disappointed with how he played, Dirk Nowitzki had a great season at his age and Harrison Barnes continues to play well as the number one offensive option. Dallas isn’t a team I see going back to the playoffs very soon and yes they were tanking but playing 10 games below expectation is clearly not meeting expectations at all.  
  
**—Cleveland Cavaliers** W/L Record: 50-32   
The Cleveland Cavaliers were predicted to win 53 games in the preseason with USA Today expecting them to win as many as 56 games. The majority of people tipped them to retain their crown as the Easts best team overcoming competition from Boston. Their opening night roster was considered one of the deepest in the league with a great group of experience veterans and solid role players. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions they were a consensus top two team in the East make the finals for a fourth consecutive season. You might think its harsh to place Cleveland so low when comparing things with their win expectations but in my mind the fact that the Cavaliers were underperforming so seriously to the extent where they needed a complete roster turnaround at the deadline speaks for itself. One of the biggest disappointments was Isaiah Thomas played very far below expectations when finally healthy and was traded after just 15 games. Clevelands form leading into the playoffs may have lead to people forgetting how bad they were early in the year but in the grand scheme of things they did not have a great regular season. It will be interesting to see how Cleveland perform in the playoffs and whether they can prove once more that their regular season efforts are irrelevant.  
  
**—Memphis Grizzlies** W/L Record: 22-60    
The Memphis Grizzlies were predicted to win 38 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as many as 41 games. While many people were thinking of the Grizzlies as a team to slip out of the playoffs very few expected such a dramatic decline. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 2 voters even predicted the Grizzlies to finish as the 5th seed in the West! The injury to Conley surely didn’t help but it wouldn’t have made this huge an impact in my opinion. While they were expected to compete and make things difficult for teams challenging a playoff position the Grizzlies have not done such at all and even fired their coach early in the season. Some question whether a healthy Conley, Gasol and new draft pick will be enough to give Memphis another playoff run but to be honest I don’t think Its enough and they face a long road back to contention.   
  
**—Charlotte Hornets** W/L Record: 36-46
The Charlotte Hornets were predicted to win 42 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as many as 44 games. Many considered this roster to be a big upgrade on their 2015-16 squad which was tied for the 3rd best record in the East but for whatever reason they have just failed to perform this year. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions they were expected to by 27 of 30 voters to features in playoff action most likely as a 6 or 7th seed. The future is bleak for the Hornets with many question marks regarding the teams direction including what will happen with Kemba and Howard. Monk has ultimately had an underwhelming season and I believe they will be tanking next year and finish in the leagues bottom 5.

urfaselol,2018-04-11 19:46:52+00:00,"[Arnovitz] As Chris Paul left the Clippers, Steve Ballmer reached out to his former point guard to figure out his reasons for leaving. He stated that Doc Rivers was one of the contributing factors.","Context: 

&gt;AFTER PAUL EXITED for Houston, Clippers owner Steve Ballmer reached out to his former point guard. As a relatively new owner, Ballmer wanted to learn from his organization's mistakes and invited Paul to share his thoughts about the current state of the franchise and, more pointedly, his reasons for leaving. When the two met over breakfast, league sources say, Paul stated that Rivers was one of the contributing factors.

&gt;More than half a dozen players from the 2013-14 to 2016-17 Clippers declined to speak on the record about Rivers' role in the ""dynamic,"" but a reliable consensus emerged. To a man, they saw a coach who grew frustrated with his inability to manage a complex locker room and who began to act out himself.

&gt;Several former Clippers characterized in Rivers a tendency to placate a player by telling him what he wanted to hear, on occasion even criticizing a teammate that player was beefing with. Rivers didn't account for the fact that players, even ones who aren't always simpatico, talk among themselves and exchange notes. Though players regard him as reasonably honest in film sessions and on game night, keeping inventory of what their coach said about specific players became a parlor game among those players and their confidants.

&gt;Rivers' salesmanship has long been heralded as a strong suit. ""We are all selling our stuff,"" he says, ""That's what coaches do. We've got to sell what you think is the best way to win."" But even those who admire Rivers' leadership style recognize his propensity to promise roles to players that don't materialize.

&gt;Indeed, over the course of Rivers' four years with the 2013-17 core, players came to doubt the sincerity of his comments or stated intentions. Some cited a statement by Rivers to ESPN's Zach Lowe this past fall that J.J. Redick was ""begging"" to return to the Clippers, a declaration that rang so false to anyone who knows Redick that there was a collective bewilderment that Rivers would even say it aloud in polite conversation. For several of his players, it was further proof Rivers had a willingness to peddle mistruths in an effort to spin perception to his liking. To them, Rivers had a talented politician's ability to inspire with rallying cries, but also to fudge the truth for personal expediency in the moment.

&gt;More than anything, Clippers players saw him as increasingly aloof as the team's playoff misfortunes mounted. They saw a coach who was frustrated and disappointed in the emotional makeup of his team and its unwillingness to buy in. He responded by maintaining a greater distance, forgoing necessary conversations and sometimes dispatching assistant coaches to deliver bad news.

Derrick Rose recorded a LiAngelo last night in five minutes of play, as Minnesota won in Los Angeles. I find it very fitting that it was against the Lakers.

wormhole222,2018-04-01 15:11:25+00:00,"What the new flairs are, and why they are triggering to fans.","Edit:  Just wanted to clarify I'm not a mod, and did not design these. 

**Houston:** It's Westbrook winning MVP over Harden.  Houston fans feel robbed, and even the Houston organization takes it personally if media members voted for Russ

**Toronto:**  It's Paul Pierce [who blocked the potential game winner in game 7 of the Raptors/Nets series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9j9KfDuigs)
 
**Golden State:** KD is a snake for joining the Warriors.

**Boston:** It's Lebron's face the night of [game 6 of the 2012 ECF](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201206070BOS.html).  He single handidly murdered the Celtics that night, and ended the Big 3 era. 

**Portland:** It's Raymond Felton.  When Felton went to play for Portland he showed up out of shape and fat.  He played like shit then promptly got back in shape when he went to the Knicks the next year.  Portland fans hate him

**Cleveland:** It's Lebron James when he did ""The Decision"" and took his talents to South Beach.

**San Antonio:** It's a broken robot.  Kawhi is often called a robot, and he's broken because he is injured.

**Philadelphia:**  Philly has had a lot of medical problems where their doctors have misdiagnosed their players injures (most notably with Embiid last year)

**Minnesota:** It's KG (who is by far the best Timberwolf ever) winning a championship with Boston.

**Indiana:**  [It's Ron Artest who started a huge brawl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXEFMfd9c1A) which went into the stands.  He got suspended for the entire season, including playoffs, which ruined the Pacers title chances that year.

**Oklahoma City** It's the Thunders big 3.  They traded away Harden very early, and later Durant left to join the Warriors (see the snake flair).  After this year all 3 will have won MVPs, and were on the same team.  

**Washington:** It's Gilbert Arenas with finger guns.  In Washington Gilbert Arenas and a teammate pulled guns on each other in the locker room during a fight.

**Utah:** [ It's Michael Jordan pushing off right before he hit a game winner which won the Bulls the championship.](https://youtu.be/PRCTp57LQro?t=25)

**Milwaukee:**  It's Mike Dunleavy, a dirty player, who did so much dirty stuff in the Bulls/Bucks series it led to [Giannis doing this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWajqr55HFg)

**New Orleans:**  It's Karl Anthony Town with a unibrow.  When KAT joined he had a great rookie year, (while Anthony Davis regressed).  This caused lots of people to give up on AD and declare KAT the next great big man.  

~ Credit to Abyss333333 on this one.

**Miami:** It's Dirk hitting a shot during the 2011 finals, when Dallas beat in Miami in the finals .. sigh

**LA Clippers:** It's a banner of the LA Sparks (the women's team) winning a championship.  I guess it is insulting because every basketball team in LA has won a championship except the Clippers.

**Detroit:**  It's Darko Milicic who the Pistons selected ahead of Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, and Dwyane Wade in the 2003 draft.

**Denver:**  It's Cornrow Carmelo, who forced the Nuggets to trade him because he didn't want to live in a small town like Denver.

**Charlotte:** It's Kobe Bryant after being drafted by Charlotte.  He was traded shortly afterward to the Lakers.

**LA Lakers:**  It's David Stern who [vetoed a trade which would have landed the Lakers CP3 in 2011](http://www.espn.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/7333285/los-angeles-lakers-deal-acquire-chris-paul-off) for ""Basketball Reasons"".

**New York Knicks:**  It's Phil Jackson who was supposed to be the GM/President that would be the savior of the Knicks, but ended up being absolutely incompetent.

**Sacramento:**  It's their owner Vivek who has been amazing at everything except putting together a winning team, or hiring a decent coach.

**Brooklyn:**  It's Danny Ainge, the Celtics GM, who traded them an old Paul Pierce and KG for 4 first round picks (technically 3 picks and swap rights on another).  They ended up being the 18th pick, the 3rd pick, the 1st pick, and this years pick (probably around 8).

**Dallas:**  It's DeAndre Jordan who agreed to go to the Mavericks, but later changed his mind and stayed with the Clippers (after it had been announced).

**Chicago:**  It's the Bulls and White Sox owner holding a World Series trophy.  On numerous occasions he has said baseball means more to him, and that the White Sox are more important to him than the Bulls.

**Memphis:** It's Marc Gasol while giving an interview which criticized his coach (who was later fired).

**Orlando:** It's Fran Vasquez who was drafted 11th by the Magic, but decided not to come to the NBA and played his career in Europe.  

**Phoenix:** It's Robert Horry who in the 2007 WCF [shoved Steve Nash](https://youtu.be/7LT_C7o5ZGM?t=50).  This caused several important teammates (Stoudemire and Diaw) to run to defend Nash and get suspended for the critical game 5 which they lost.

**Atlanta:**  It's the score during the 3rd quarter of the Superbowl in 2017.  The Atlanta Falcons proceeded the blow the 25 point lead and lose in overtime.  It more than doubled the largest lead blown in a Superbowl, and is one of the largest blown leads in an NFL game period.

I've been lucky enough to work closely with some of the most creative and talented filmmakers in the business.

I'm currently working on a new film, Suspiria with director Luca Guadagnino (Call Me By Your Name), as well as a crowdfunding campaign to publish a book about my life and career in Hollywood - [The Title Sequence Designs of Dan Perri](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-title-sequence-designs-of-dan-perri-movies-film) (you can see a sampling of my work in the campaign video).

I asked the people in the rows around me, and I was watching for anyone that looked like they were looking for something. Alas, I could not find the owner. After that, I decided to keep it. I was about to play it last night when I saw the owners save file with almost 40 hours on it, and I felt very guilty. I just want to check if this belongs to anyone on the switch subreddit,  the 3ds subreddit, or the pokemon subreddit.

Frnklfrwsr,2018-03-14 15:52:19+00:00,I'M STILL NOT DEAD YET! A very unlikely path to the 3rd spot in the Pacific Division remains for the Coyotes!,"This is the follow up to this popular thread:
https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/845pxk/im_not_dead_yet_this_is_the_specific_scenario/?st=JER9LBRE&amp;sh=af7e4b20

This post has a follow up can be found here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/84jvkk/were_not_dead_ye_oh_wait_yes_we_are_the_coyotes/?st=JES0TVMJ&amp;sh=d5713551

Alright folks, strap in cuz this is gonna get a little wild. 

First of all, the Coyotes need to win all 13 of their remaining games, and all wins need to be in regulation or overtime. No more shootout wins. 

Next we need San Jose to lose all 13 of their remaining games, all in regulation. 

Then we need LA to lose all 12 of their remaining games, all in regulation. 

Lastly, we need Anaheim to lose 11 out of their 12 remaining games, with the only win coming against LA. All 11 of those losses must be in regulation except for one, doesn't matter which one. 

The end result of this would be that San Jose and LA would fall out of the top 3 in the Pacific, Calgary would rise to 2nd in the Pacific, and the Coyotes would end up in 3rd by nature of owning the tiebreaker against San Jose of ROW. 

Now for the probability. 

There are 49 separate hockey games that need to go the right way for the Coyotes. Assuming each one has a 50% chance of going the Coyotes way (which of course isn't true), then the likelihood of this happening would be 1 in 2^49. 

That's 1 in 562,949,953,421,312. Or about 1 in 562 trillion.

That's roughly the likelihood of going through a database of all players to ever play at least a single NHL game (6,000ish), picking a random one and having it be Shane Doan. And then doing it again and having it pull up Shane Doan again. And then doing it again and having it come up Doan again. And then doing it a 4th time and having it once again be Shane Doan.

In conclusion, Los Angeles did NOT eliminate the Coyotes from the playoffs last night by pushing the game to the shootout. 

Other playoff paths may remain for the Coyotes but I believe this path is the most likely one for the Yotes.... which isn't saying much. I haven't looked at Wild Card scenarios because I'm lazy and don't want to do the math. 

The Coyotes are 11-3-2 in their last 16 games. ",hockey,1875

The Dota 2 Standard Hero Builds is a project I do in my spare time and without compensation. To survive, I have been working in esports for the past 8 years:

* I started in StarCraft II player-managing pro-gaming teams: VT Gaming, Team Dynamic, Quantic Gaming, Infinity Seven and ROOT Gaming (~50 players)
* I went on to work at events: LAN ETS, BarCraft Montreal, Special Tactics with White-Ra, Blizzard's WCS: Canada Nationals and the NASL Season 3: Finals [Toronto]
* In my spare time during college doing the above two jobs, I was also a writer for many news organizations such as ESFI World, Definitve Esports and ESEA News
* After graduating, I moved around the world to be involved in many start-up companies (some not so reputable):
 * I was first involved in a competing ESEA matchmaking client called PlayIGL as a Communications Director
 * I moved to Berlin, Germany to do business development for a studio-making esports web-shows: ESGN
 * Later, I moved to Copenhagen, Denmark to create a digital magazine called 1337 Magazine at Aller Media A/S
 * Two years ago, I arrived in Los Angeles to do business development for a live-streaming service named Azubu TV
 * and now I travel regularly to Moscow as part of ESforce Holding, involved in international affairs. I am also Managing Director for Cybersport.com 

**I will try to answer as many questions as possible**. I answer questions very extensively, so be prepared for very long and elaborate answers.

Zanctmao,2018-03-07 14:28:54+00:00,Stormy Daniels lawsuit against President Trump Megathread,"So here is the place to ask your questions on this litigation. This is not the place to attack the President, Ms. Daniels, or grind your political axes. There are ample places on Reddit for that. [Here is a copy of the lawsuit](http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/TODAY/z_Creative/Filed%20Complaint.pdf)

So what do we know? 

* This is a lawsuit for declaratory judgment. 

* Declaratory judgment is when one party, Here Ms. Daniels, asks the court to rule as a matter of law what the relative legal duties of the parties are between one another. 

* It is not a lawsuit for money - she is not seeking $$ from the President. She is simply asking that the Superior Court in Los Angeles look at the matter. 

So what is the suit about essentially? 

* Ms. Daniels wants the court to agree with her interpretation that 1) because President Trump never signed it, she is not bound to any agreement with him personally, and 2) that Mr. Cohn's decision to talk at length about his part in it invalidates her duties to him under the contract. 

* She is not asking the court to determine whether the relationship actually happened, or to otherwise opine on the factual allegations surrounding their alleged affair. 

* At most the court would determine that the contract is valid, invalid, or partially valid. 

EDITED TO ADD: 

How is this affected by the [ongoing parallel arbitration proceeding](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-tries-silence-stormy-daniels-n854646)?

* Apparently the arbitrator issued a restraining order, which Ms. Daniels would be violating by filing this lawsuit - assuming the contract is found to be valid. Beyond that very little is known about this arbitration proceeding. 

* Sarah Huckabee Sanders has asserted that the President prevailed in the private arbitration proceeding last week against Ms. Daniels. This means that he is or believes himself to be a signatory to the 'hush money' agreement with Ms. Daniels - otherwise there would be no arbitration agreement.

recrudescent_ally,2018-03-05 01:57:37+00:00,Woke up from a coma with Nmom given full rein control over my life,"So my mom is a crazy narcissist, and as I detailed on a previous comment she has done some horrific stuff like faking assault in lying to the police to have me thrown in a psych ward ""because she wanted me out of the house for a few days"".

In 2012 I had to flee my home in Los Angeles and moved 2000 miles away and as a result, I was finally able to cut her off. I had no contact with her for five years.

Fast forward to August 2017: I wake up in the hospital after a month in a coma, and find out she had been given complete control over my life and I feel like she's utterly destroyed me. 

I'm so hurt, and upset, and I feel like all the healing I ever had has been undone. She was never supposed to have any control over anything, and I had told the hospital this on previous visits. I'm utterly pissed because I was put into a month long coma and wasn't fucking told. I walked into the hospital awake and conscious on my own two fucking feet, and was with my boyfriend of seven years. They could have given me the two seconds of forethought to let me sign my life over to him before they put me into a medically induced coma. But because they didn't, the only person with control over my life, and death was.... Nmom! Fucking great!

She sure got back at me for those five years cut off. See, I'm a girl, close to 30 years old now, and I've always had long, gorgeous hair. It's always been my ""feature"". My freaking pride and joy. When I went to the hospital, it was waist length. When I woke up, I was near bald. It was all hacked off. 

She said they suggested it because my hair would mat while I was unconscious, and they couldn't afford to spend long times having nurses aides brush my hair out.. but they didn't have to cut it off to bald length with a freaking lawnmower hack job. They could have just cut it shoulder length. Or you know, she could have lovingly brushed the knots out of my hair, as I used to do for my grandma during the years I took care of her while she was bedridden and dying.

But... Nope! She had them hack every bit of it off, and I don't believe for one second that wasn't payback. 

Oh, I'm also vehemently anti-christian, and she snuck in at 11pm during my coma one night with a pastor and had me baptised into the Catholic religion, against my will. Which she knew I would have never done or gone along with, ever. I was fully sedated and paralyzed during my coma and I actually remember the baptism, I was barely conscious but I remember the terror I felt because I thought the ceremony meant I was about to die. 

I'm just so upset, I can't get over it. And my Nmom has been acting like I went to the hospital and almost died JUST to inconvenience her!

I'm going to start crying again, I'm at such a loss. I don't know what to do.

TLDR: had my mom out of my life for five years and woke up from a coma and she had been given complete control over me.

_stateofmind,2018-03-01 17:12:47+00:00,Report: Derrick Rose only getting interest in form of 10-day contracts,"[######cover](http://imgur.com/dDkZGrZ)

Ken Berger (BR): 

&gt; Barring something unforeseen, multiple team executives contacted by B/R are convinced that Rose may have to wait till next year.

&gt; To this point, Rose has received a couple of 10-day contract offers, but nothing more attractive or substantial, league sources told B/R. He's looking for an opportunity that could be a longer-term fit -- and one with a team that's ready to win now, or soon, as opposed to rebuilding.

&gt; ""He's not trying to go into a developing situation or trying to find out who is he is,"" the person close to Rose told B/R. ""He knows who he is as a player.""

&gt; There's a hope within Rose's camp that the Oklahoma City Thunder -- down a guard with the loss of Andre Roberson and looking for any edge they can find to contend with the Golden State Warriors and/or Houston Rockets in the postseason—may still come calling. As of Wednesday, there was no traction there, sources said.

&gt; There was talk Wednesday among rival general managers that the Los Angeles Clippers were interested, but they are a team at a crossroads after the stunning move to trade Blake Griffin to the Detroit Pistons at the deadline.

EspressoDragon,2018-03-01 02:49:45+00:00,2018 Guide to MLS,"The 2018 MLS season begins this weekend, so it's about time I get around to my fourth annual MLS guide. I've done the league structure [previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/48dame/2016_guide_to_mls/). If you are interested in the history of MLS, [check out this throwback guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/2wzjr3/2015_guide_to_mls/).

To recap, the 2017 MLS Champions and Supporters Shield Champions were Toronto FC. Sporting KC won the Open Cup (US Cup Championship), and Toronto FC won the Voyageurs Cup (Canadian Cup Championship).

I've covered much of the league's history and insane rules over the past few years. Instead of rehashing these topics, feel free to ask questions for either myself or other fans to answer. I can throw some down into the F.A.Q.'s below.

------------------------------------------------------------------

**What's new this year?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MLS upped their investment in targeted allocation money (TAM) to a total of $4 million per year. The MLS Monopoly money can be used to buy down player salaries to lessen their salary cap impact or to ensure they do not take a designated player spot. Additionally, the money can be spent as part of a transfer fee. It's MLS's method of incentivizing teams to spend money in the market while still attempting to keep their strict financial structure in place.

Additionally, MLS introduced video review in the middle of last year and will continue to roll with it this season.

As well, teams have begun to move away from aging European players in order to sign young Central and South American talents. Several teams have begun to splash large fees for young talent with Miguel Almiron and Ezequiel Barco being the prime examples. It's a shift from MLS as a retirement league towards a development league that can serve as a stepping stone to larger European leagues.

Controversially, there Columbus Crew's owner and MLS Commissioner, Don Garber, are actively working to move the Crew to Austin. Columbus is the league's first team and an iconic part of MLS's landscape. Fans across the league are obviously pissed, and there is a movement forming to prevent the relocation.

Otherwise, Los Angeles FC beings play this year.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Future**
-------------------

[I went pretty in depth with expansion candidates last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/5wnu9n/2017_guide_to_mls/). As an update, Nashville won a spot for either 2019 or 2020. Cincinnati is virtually a shoe-in, and Beckham's Miami continues to be a giant pain in the ass. Detroit and Sacramento are fighting for the final spot with Phoenix having an outside possibility. The losers will likely be in contention for the next round of expansion.

------------------------------------------------------------------


F.A.Q.
--------

(I can update this with new questions.)

*Why is there no relegation/promotion?*

* The league argues that it is not economically sustainable with the fear is that if a team gets relegated, fans will stop coming to matches, and the owner will fold the team. The average American sports fan is used to supporting the best teams in the world at their sport (NFL, MLB, NBA, etc.). Additionally, lower league teams tend to lack the infrastructure and finances for top division play. I personally want to see it in the relative near future, but it will be an uphill battle.

*Why does MLS run spring to fall?*

* It's the same reason that Scandinavia runs spring to fall. The northern part of our country gets bombarded with snow in the winter unlike most of Europe. Even in March, a handful of MLS cities are still covered in snow. Plus, we don't want to compete against the NFL, NBA, and NHL.

*Isn't MLS a retirement league?*

* Not at all. The league has generally been moving more towards signing players under 30 like Giovinco, Ezequiel Barco, Miguel Almiron, and Romain Alessandrini.


*Why is the Supporter's Shield less prestigious than the MLS Cup?*

* In part, America values playoffs far more than the regular season. Also, the unbalanced schedule makes it an unfair comparison between teams with teams not playing each team an equal number of times.

*Who is an attacking team in MLS?*

* You should probably look into Toronto, New York City, or Atlanta.

*Why is the league schedule not balanced?*

* The geography of this league is insane. The longest trip (Vancouver to Orlando) is further than Dublin to Tel Aviv. Since MLS does not allow teams to charter flights for more than a handful of matches each year (which is a whole other point), a balanced schedule would be hell for players.",soccer,1438

[Link to full article (Paywall) ](https://theathletic.com/243183/2018/02/16/klay-thompson-center-stage-at-all-star-weekend-in-los-angeles-not-if-he-has-anything-to-do-with-it/)

LOS ANGELES —In the 20 months they’ve been teammates, Kevin Durant’s favorite Klay Thompson story — or the one that best symbolizes Klay to him — came at the tail end of a cushy December homestand last season, right between a Saturday and Monday game, when Thompson went all Derrick Rose on a Sunday, vanishing without a trace.

“He missed a practice,” Durant said. “Totally missed it. Didn’t tell anybody. Just didn’t come.”

Why?

“I think he overslept,” Steve Kerr said.

“Yeah,” Thompson confirmed.

He missed prep for the upcoming Pacers game.

“Then that next night,” Durant laughed, “he went out and dropped 60 points (on Indiana). *Sixty*.”

That's Thompson, so often off in his own world, but so capable of detonating at any time, a polished shooter and stoic defender focused enough to repeat the same form every shot and lock into the league's best perimeter scorers every possession, but a quirky soul who will lose his train of thought mid-interview and labels his dog one of his best friends.

Welcome to the All-Star festivities in Los Angeles, an event set up perfectly to make Klay one of the weekend's biggest stories: He's from the area, his father is a legendary Laker, his free agency is less than 17 months away and both local teams have been lining up their salary-cap chips to dip into the market the next two summers, with Klay one of the premier players who could pop free.

Paul George, also from Los Angeles and available this summer, has already been flooded with free-agency questions, which should only intensify this weekend. The two All-Star events before Durant left Oklahoma City, he was peppered with that chatter.

In a league whose following is increasingly transaction-obsessed, that's the new norm: When a star's contract clock ticks under two years, all eyes start moving in that direction.

So this weekend, as Klay competes in Saturday night's 3-point shootout and Sunday's main event and has a few media availabilities in between, this will provide an early checkpoint on the pulse around him. Do local fans start a “We want Klay” chant, as they recently did with George? Is there any signage? Do reporters hound him?

The answer: Most likely not, on all three counts, for a couple reasons.

1: The Warriors' success, and all Thompson's prior comments, make it clear his preference is to stay. He even hinted at the possibility of taking a haircut come contract time in a podcast with The Athletic before the season.

A large part of what fuels the chatter is the perception of obtainability. Until there's any kind of public clue that Thompson would even entertain the idea of moving elsewhere, it's hard for people to rationally speculate.

“Klay's going to be a friend for life,” Durant said. “Don't matter who he play for or what decision he makes. Obviously, if a guy asks what I think about a situation, I'll give him what I experienced. But he's a guy who is going to make a decision on his own. He said he wants to be here, just gotta trust his word. Let him do his thing.”

2: On a crowded stage loaded with big names, it's hard to imagine Klay jolting himself to the front as one of the prime topics of All-Star weekend.

“He won't be because he don't want to be,” Durant said. “I'm sure he's going to avoid all that. You got James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, all from LA. And they all are megastars when it comes to that. Klay's a star that just wants to hoop.”

The Warriors' stable, winning situation is a great lure for Thompson to stay put. But what would likely await elsewhere also plays in the Warriors' favor. Thompson seems to have no desire to go chase more points, shots and media shine away from his headlining teammates.

According to his father Mychal, when Thompson was a kid, he was more introverted than most.

“Always had a calmness about him, off on his own, in his own little world, reading books, entertaining himself,” Mychal Thompson said.

If you’re on r/NFL a lot, you’ve probably noticed that whenever there’s a story about a player working in charity or something, I comment that if they were a dog, they’d be a good boy. I thought I should write something up like the [Which teams have fewer fans than their namesake? A study](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/6jarda/ocwhich_teams_have_fewer_fans_than_their_namesake/) that we got last year in the offseason. 

The way I am going to tell who the most good boy is by picking one player each team and giving them a good boy rating. Right now you’re probably asking, “oh, but u/CharleyJacksson, how did you decide what player represented each team?” Well, I basically just picked fan favorite players that have a good reputation for working in charity, or just didn’t rape someone or murder a guy. 

I recommend donating to your favorite good boy’s charity of choice :)

#Denver Broncos Good boy: Von Miller

Good boy rating: 7/10

[Charity link](https://www.vonmiller.org/)

Starting out with my Raiders most hated rivals, the Broncos most good boy is Von Miller, a 6-time Pro-Bowl OLB. The biggest knock to his good boy-ness came in 2013, when he was suspended for violating the league's rules on drugs. He apologised and has done a lot to help restore his character. Von is a big supporter of our troops, and has a foundation to help kids get glasses.

#Kansas City Chiefs Good boy: Eric Berry

Good boy rating: 11/10

[Charity link](http://eb29.com/online/eric-berry-foundation/)

If this were a test to see what player would be the toughest boy, Eric Berry would win. After playing 5 seasons in the NFL, Eric Berry was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, but was back on the football field a year later. Berry has suffered several injuries throughout his playing career, including a torn ACL in 2011, a high ankle sprain in 2014, and a ruptured Achilles this past season. As a Raiders fan, I find it very hard to root against him. He is exceedingly inspirational, and an overall great person. Eric runs The Eric Berry Foundation, which provides beneficial opportunities and a safe environment for children to participate in team sports and leadership development programs in order to encourage strength of body, mind and spirit. Eric also travels with mobile medical clinics, even going to Ugandan villages in 2013 and 2014. 

#Los Angeles Chargers Good boy: Philip Rivers

Good boy rating: 9/10

[Charity link](http://riversofhope.org/donate/)

Rivers is known for being a fantastic leader and great trash talker. A 7 year boy fighting two different types of cancer in LA wanted nothing other than to meet Philip, so Philip got in a car, drove two hours each way just to meet him, and watched a Ravens-Chargers game with him. Rivers said, ""there was a kid that could be dying any day, and he wants to meet me of all people. This 7-year-old could make any wish and he wants to hang out with me. Man, you don't turn that one down."" Philip’s charity is Rivers of Hope, a free 24 hour crisis line. 

#Oakland Raiders Good boy: Derek Carr

Good boy rating: 10/10

[Charity link](https://www.valleychildrens.org/)

Now for my favorite Good boy. This one was tough because I had to come up with a fair and unbiased rating for him. Derek is a fantastic man that is not shy to stand up for what he believes in. He is very involved in his faith, and works closely with Valley Children’s to help sick children. After signing his $125mil contract, the biggest contract in NFL history at the time, Derek was very excited to talk about all the positive ways he will spend his money, saying, “The exciting thing for me money-wise, honestly, is this money is going to help a lot of people. I’m very thankful to have it, that it’s in our hands because it’s going to help people. Not only in this country, but in a lot of countries around the world. That’s what’s exciting to me.”

#Houston Texans Good boy: JJ Watt

Good boy rating: 37,000,000/10

[Charity link](http://jjwfoundation.org/)

Everyone knew this one was coming. The Walter Payton Man of the Year winner this season, JJ Watt made headlines after raising $37,000,000 for Hurricane Harvey relief. He not only raised that substantial amount, but he also did as much as he could by going out and giving the men and women of Houston food and water. Although it took a detour to help after a disaster hit home, JJ’s foundation, “mission is to provide after-school opportunities for middle-school aged children in the community to become involved in athletics, so that they may learn the character traits of accountability, teamwork, leadership, work ethic, and perseverance, while in a safe and supervised environment with their peers.”

#Indianapolis Colts Good boy: Darius Butler

Good boy rating: 7/10

[Charity link](http://dariusbutler.com/foundation/)

This player is probably one one of lesser known good boys, but it is not undeserved. Darius’ foundation strives to help feed the hungry and inspire kids in rough communities. His father served 11 years in the Army, so Darius knew the importance of life and the cruel, uncaring void that we call a universe. 

#Sacksonville Jaguars Good boy: Blake Bortles

Good boy rating: 7/10

[Charity link](https://www.blakebortlesfoundation.com/)

Blake Bortles is anything but trash. A mid-tier starter on the field, Blake gets a lot of hate thrown his way. He has become a fan favorite after upsetting several teams who called him and his team garbage. Off the field, he is a fan favorite for his goofy, [awkward interview with Barstool](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/7qtapx/qb_blake_bortles_on_what_he_would_be_doing_if_he/), and his fantastic charity which supports first responders in the Jacksonville area, and helps people with intellectual and developmental disabilites persue full and indepent lives.

#Tennessee Titans Good boy: Delanie Walker

Good boy rating: 10/10

[Charity link](http://delaniewalker.org/)

Everything I hear about Delanie is positive. He has broken out the past 4 years, getting over 800 yards 4 seasons in a row as Marcus Mariota’s go-to receiver, and he has taken advantage of his success on the field and used to to spread awareness and help those less fortunate than himself. [You may remember him offering to let bullying victim Keaton Jones come to a Titans game.](https://247sports.com/nfl/tennessee-titans/Bolt/Delanie-Walker-brings-awareness-to-school-bullying-112048402) His foundation stands to provide inner city and low-income children with educational opportunites and resources to reach their full potential.

He has also worked with several of other Raven’s players foundations, including Ray Rice, Ben Grubbs, Derrick Mason, and Ed Reed. 

#Cincinnati Bengals Good boy: Andy Dalton

Good boy rating: 8/10

[Charity link](https://www.andydalton.org)

Andy is a fellow Texan and ginger, so I will always support him and his fire crotch. Andy’s foundation became famous after he put the Bills in the playoffs and fans donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to it. The foundation, run by his wife, does several things for Cincinnati and Texan communities, including bring technology, educational resources, and entertainment devices to schools and hospitals, a daycare for parents of sick kids so they can go and have a date night, a all-expense-paid trip to a theme park for sick kids, a fund for medical equipment that goes to the families of sick children, and trips to children hospitals from Santa and his Elves. 

#Cleveland Browns Good boy: Joe Thomas

Good boy rating: 10/10

[Charity link](http://www.sc4k.org/)

Joe Thomas is known for being a dedicated player, sticking with a franchise that shoots itself in the foot repeatedly. He is a fan favorite for being a super cool dude. He doesn’t have his own foundation, but is a huge advocate of Shoes and Clothes for Kids, which gives shoes and clothes to kids. One thing is for sure, Joe Thomas isn’t as terrible as his franchise is.

#Pittsburgh Steelers Good boy: Alejandro Villanueva

Good boy rating: 11/10

[Charity](https://secure.uso.org/?sc=WEBDONATE&amp;show_amount=true)

#Miami Dolphins Good boy: Kenny Stills

Good boy rating: 4/10

[Charity link](https://pledgeit.org/kennystills)

I honestly had no idea to pick for the Dolphins. Jarvis Landry, Ryan Tannehill, and Cameron Wake don’t seem to have favorite charities, and Jay Cutler’s foundation is shut down, or at least doesn’t have a website or anything. Most of the charity work I found under Jay Cutler is from years ago. Kenny was their Walter Payton Man of the Year nominee and is active in the stand against social injustice. 

#New England Patriots Good boy: Nate Solder 

Good boy rating: 6.9/10

[Charity link](http://special.patriots.com/offers/index.cfm?UUID=NEPCFDonations)

Nate protected Jimmy G’s beautiful face for a couple games. He also did some charity work or something with kids or something, but he protected Jimmy G’s face. 

But in all seriousness, Nate is a great guy. He works with the Patriots foundation to help build playground for kids.

#New York Jets Good boy: Quincy Enunwa

Good boy rating: 7/10

[Charity link](https://palnyc2008.thankyou4caring.org/pages/donate)

#Dallas Cowboys Good boy: Jason Witten

Good boy rating: 11/10

[Charity link](http://jasonwitten82.com/foundation/)

Jason is a stand up dude on and off the field. I always thought he ran real weird though. That doesn’t matter though, he’s a cool dude. His foundation helps with NFL Play 60, and helps put positive influences in battered women’s shelters all over Texas. I implore you to go to his charity link and read about all the things his foundation does. It’s fantastic and I’m not surprised because Jason is just so great. 

#New York Giants Good boy: Eli Manning 

Good Bote rating: 10/10

[Charity link](http://www.hackensackumcfoundation.org/site/TR?team_id=2016&amp;fr_id=1430&amp;pg=team)

Eli is a massive dork and is totally self aware of that. He’s such a great guy too. He is responsible for the Pats losing 2 SBs, and works closely with several charities and organizations. The one I linked to is one for children with cancer, and him and his wife will match all donations to it. Eli is a really good boy.

#Philidelphia Eagles Good boy: Carson Wentz

Good boy rating: 17/10

[Charity link](http://www.ao1foundation.org/)

Carson was so close to locking up the MVP trophy before he tore his ACL. After reading about his foundation, I had to up his Good boy rating. One of his foundations 3 objectives is to support the development of individuals by providing service dogs to help increase their quality of life. I got a service dog several years ago and he saved my life. I am so happy to hear Carson is trying to help more people get service dogs.

#Washington Redskins Good boy: Kirk Cousins

Good boy rating: 10/10

[Charity link](http://theelaineshusterfoundation.org/)

Kirk loves Julie very much. He is knowns for complementing players for hitting him and apologizing to his O-Line after sacks for holding onto the ball for to long. Whoever lands him in free agency is very lucky to get him and Julie. He and the Redskins donated several dollars to The Elaine Shuster Foundation, which brings money to education in Maryland. 

#Chicago Bears Good boy: Sam Acho

Good boy rating: 13/10

[Charity link](http://www.livinghopeministries.us/donate/)

As a massive Longhorns fan, I’ve always loved Acho. He is well known for his trips to Nigeria to help those less fortunate. He, and his brother, are fantastic and what he does for people cannot be understated. 

#Detroit Lions Good boy: Matthew Stafford

Good boy rating: 10/10

[Charity link](https://leadersandbest.umich.edu/find/#!/mimed/mott?utm_source=givetomott&amp;utm_campaign=givebtn)

Stafford is seriously underrated and I like him a lot. Everything I just read on him said that he does a lot of charity work but it isn’t publicized very often. I found a cool story where he won an auction for Lions tickets, parting with $15,000, then gave the tickets to a sick child. What a good boy.

#Green Bay Packers Good boy: Aaron Rodgers

Good boy rating: 7/10

[Charity](https://give.salvationarmyusa.org/site/SPageNavigator/national_memorial_form.html)

Aaron Rodgers is possibly the most talented QB to ever play the game of football. He’s also the star of some state farm commercials that has a very good boy in it. He doesn’t good work off the field too, he donated $38k to Salvation Army. 

#Minnesota Vikings Good boy: Teddy Bridgewater

Good boy rating: 10/10

[Charity link](https://give.bcrf.org/checkout/donation?eid=31404)

His purpose will not be denied. 

#Atlanta Falcons Good boy: Julio Jones

Good boy rating: 7/10

[Charity link](https://childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/donate/)

Julio would be a very good boy. He would be very good at catch. He, along with his Falcon teammates visit Children Miracle Network Hospitals to cheer sick kids up. He is also a big fan of Campbell’s Soup. 

#Carolina Panthers Good boy: Cam Newton

Good boy rating: 10/10

[Charity link](https://www.cam1newton.com/)

Cam is known for his confidence on and off the field, so I think he would be a hard boy to settle down and train, but I bet he would be a good boy once he is trained. He works at his foundation to enhance the lives of youth by addressing their educational, physical, and social needs. 

#New Orleans Saints Good boy: Drew Brees

Good boy rating: 14/10

[Charity link](http://www.drewbrees.com/)


I lived in the NOLA area when Hurricane Katrina hit, and what Drew has done for the people of that area is immaculate. He does his best to make the community better and inspire every person he meets. He would be a very awesome boy.

#Tampa Bay Buccaners Good boy: Gearld McCoy

Good boy rating: 7/10

[Charity link](https://secure2.convio.net/baf/site/Donation2;jsessionid=BDAAB0B7EE1BE2D63C1FA232EA5C6478.app260a?idb=862150179&amp;DONATION_LEVEL_ID_SELECTED=1&amp;df_id=1540&amp;mfc_pref=T&amp;1540.donation=form1&amp;idb=0)

Gerald grew up hungry and lost his mom at only 19 to an unexpected Brain Aneurysm. He had a rough road to get here, but that doesn’t matter, Brian, he’s here. He spends time with kids at free football clinics, teaching them how to be great men like himself.  

#Arizona Cardinals Good boy: Larry Fitzgerald

Good boy rating: 13/10

[Charity link](https://give.bcrf.org/checkout/donation?eid=31404)

Larry is well known for being a fantastic person. He lost his mother when he was young and only used that as motivation. He continues to help with breast cancer research to this day, and has played at an elite level for an extremely long time.

#Los Angeles Rams Good boy: Aaron Donald

Good boy rating: 7/10

[Charity link](https://secure2.wish.org/site/SPageServer?pagename=donate_now&amp;chid=100-000&amp;chid=100-000)

The winner of Defensive of Player of the Year in 2017, Donald is the best DT around. Wade Phillips even said he should have won MVP. A couple years back, Donald won a Madden charity tournament, giving $51k to the Make-A-Wish Foundation. 

#San Francisco 49ers Good boy: Jimmy Garoppolo

Good boy rating: Handsome/10

[Charity link](http://special.patriots.com/offers/index.cfm?UUID=NEPCFDonations)

Oh my god, he’s so beautiful. [Just look at his face.](https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/49ers_01.jpg?w=620)

#Seattle Seahawks Good boy: Russell WIlson

Good boy rating: 16/10
[Charity link](https://whynotyoufdn.org/)

Russell is the definition of a class act. He has donated millions on top of millions to various charities and hosts golf tournaments. He even gave the Patriots a Superbowl. He is a favorite of mine and if it wasn’t for Carson Wentz being such a dog lover, and JJ Watt saving a city, he would be the most good boy in the league.

mjc5077,2018-02-09 06:51:29+00:00,[Gear] this past month has been the worst of my life. My friend came over tonight and gave me this.,"A little backstory; I lived in Southern California, where I met my wife. I’m originally from Pennsylvania. While living there (Los Angeles) times got tough. My wife lost her job and I had to sell most of my gear to pay our rent and bills. I had to sell my baby, a Parker Nitefly S/A tobacco burst as well as most of my pedals and my amp, a carvin x100b head and Marshall 4x12 cab. We got through the rough patch and decided financially it was better to move back east to live closer to my family where cost of living was cheaper. She got a nice job out here managing a restaurant and I was able to get a pretty decent job. For a couple years we were perfect. In fact last year we bought a house, I was finally at a point where I was considering slowly trying to build my collection back up, when all of the sudden last month my world changed. I found out my wife had been having an affair for almost three months, she was sleeping with an employee and lost her job. I found out through them, and confronted her when she told me the truth. I told her we were done and that didn’t seem to bother her, she’s been with the guy ever since anyway. Since finding out, my life has been a very dark blur and I’ve just been struggling so hard. Luckily I’ve had my friends and family to get me through the really hard times. Tonight my buddy came over and handed me this: https://imgur.com/gallery/bRO3l  he said ‘I know you’ve had a rough few weeks so here, hope this keeps your mind off it. I didn’t know what to say, I was speechless, I still am. It’s nothing incredible, but this guitar is perfect for me. It’s just what I need to get back into it and get my mind out of the darkness. Anyway I just wanted to share. 



Edit: I woke up to find a ton of uplifting comments, and I honestly teared up. I know we don’t know each other but please know that you’ve all touched my life and helped fill the darkness a bit and that is incredible. I love this sub and I love you all ",Guitar,1317

hello_japan,2018-02-04 21:55:41+00:00,Muller BADLY bungled the biggest case he ever handled in 2002. Pushed forward with no evidence! IMPECCABLE CREDENTIALS MY ASS. History repeats itself.,"“Comey and Mueller badly bungled the biggest case they ever handled. They botched the investigation of the 2001 anthrax letter attacks that took five lives and infected 17 other people, shut down the U.S. Capitol and Washington’s mail system, solidified the Bush administration’s antipathy for Iraq, and eventually, when the facts finally came out, made the FBI look feckless, incompetent, and easily manipulated by outside political pressure.”

“Here are some facts: Despite the jihadist slogans accompanying the mailed anthrax, it had nothing to do with Saddam Hussein or any foreign element; the FBI ignored a 2002 tip from a scientific colleague of the actual anthrax killer, who turned out to be a Fort Detrick scientist named Bruce Edwards Ivins; the reason is that they had quickly obsessed on an innocent man named Steven Hatfill; the bureau was bullied into focusing on the government scientist by Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy (whose office, along with that of Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, was targeted by an anthrax-laced letter) and was duped into focusing on Hatfill by two sources – a conspiracy-minded college professor with a political agenda who’d never met Hatfill and by Nicholas Kristof, who put his conspiracy theories in the paper while mocking the FBI for not arresting Hatfill.

In truth, Hatfill was an implausible suspect from the outset. He was a virologist who never handled anthrax, which is a bacterium. (Ivins, by contrast, shared ownership of anthrax patents, was diagnosed as having paranoid personality disorder, and had a habit of stalking and threatening people with anonymous letters – including the woman who provided the long-ignored tip to the FBI). So what evidence did the FBI have against Hatfill? There was none, so the agency did a Hail Mary, importing two bloodhounds from California whose handlers claimed could sniff the scent of the killer on the anthrax-tainted letters. These dogs were shown to Hatfill, who promptly petted them. When the dogs responded favorably, their handlers told the FBI that they’d “alerted” on Hatfill and that he must be the killer.

You’d think that any good FBI agent would have kicked these quacks in the fanny and found their dogs a good home. Or at least checked news accounts of criminal cases in California where these same dogs had been used against defendants who’d been convicted -- and later exonerated. As Pulitzer Prize-winning Los Angeles Times investigative reporter David Willman detailed in his authoritative book on the case, a California judge who’d tossed out a murder conviction based on these sketchy canines called the prosecution’s dog handler “as biased as any witness that this court has ever seen.”

Instead, Mueller, who micromanaged the anthrax case and fell in love with the dubious dog evidence, personally assured Ashcroft and presumably George W. Bush that in Steven Hatfill the bureau had its man. Comey, in turn, was asked by a skeptical Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz if Hatfill was another Richard Jewell – the security guard wrongly accused of the Atlanta Olympics bombing. Comey replied that he was “absolutely certain” they weren’t making a mistake.
Such certitude seems to be Comey’s default position in his professional life. Mueller didn’t exactly distinguish himself with contrition, either. In 2008, after Ivins committed suicide as he was about to be apprehended for his crimes, and the Justice Department had formally exonerated Hatfill – and paid him $5.82 million in a legal settlement – Mueller could not be bothered to walk across the street to attend the press conference announcing the case’s resolution. When reporters did ask him about it, Mueller was graceless. “I do not apologize for any aspect of the investigation,” he said, adding that it would be erroneous “to say there were mistakes.”

Four other divisions have sent every team to the SB, but all have at least one team that hasn't won.

*Note*: I only mentioned pre-merger championships for teams that have not won the SB; however, for a team like the Vikings, it is not counted as from 1966 to 1969 the NFL Championship was effectively equivalent to the modern NFC Championship (conference championship) as opposed to the pre-Super Bowl NFL/AFL Championships (league championships).

""I don't know if that's true,"" replied Brian Windhorst.

""I mean I know they made calls to Oklahoma City for Paul George,"" Young said. ""I'm pretty sure they made calls to Minnesota for players, so I mean, like, they tried to get some bigger name players. It just wasn't happening.""

**Since this will probably get removed without discussion questions:**

- What do you think is the weirdest headline?

- Do you see any patterns; i.e. a specific figure that is consistently featured in odd headlines?

- Do you think these acts are a result of strong marketing, or can they be attributed to these acts' personalities?

- Do you think these odd events are products of harsher upbringings and a stiffer climate that is hip-hop? Do the homophobic quotes have anything to do with hip-hop's historic hyper-masculinity? 

- Do you think these events subtract or detract from the image hip-hop is portrayed as in the outside world?

- Do you have any more strange instances?

- Why are /r/hiphophead's moderators such nazis?

benchmobDC,2018-01-25 17:51:07+00:00,10 Amazing Statistics Coming Out of Overwatch League Through Last Night,"I've been combing through lots and lots of stats from Winston's Lab in an attempt to confirm some of the things I'm seeing during VOD review. Below are 10 that I found to be particularly interesting:
&amp;nbsp;

1. Over the last three matches, only the London Spitfire have a team fight win rate better than 50% using the current most popular dive composition (Tracer, Genji, Zenyatta, Mercy, Dva, Winston) at 60.67%. Yes, that even includes the Dynasty, Excelsior, and Valiant. 
&amp;nbsp;

2. Everyone has seen the clips of Pine’s insane McCree carries, but perhaps we haven’t looked into the numbers closely enough because the New York Excelsior’s statistics on Control Point maps are just flat-out looney and go against everything we know about Overwatch. As we all know, drawing first blood is a major determinant in who wins a team fight. New York are currently ranked 2nd worst in the league getting the first kill and have lost the first player in 58.14% of Control Point fights (only Shanghai is worse). However, the Excelsior are still managing to win 48% (almost HALF!) of these team fights. By comparison, the San Francisco Shock win only 6.46% of team fights when they don’t draw first blood. I’ll keep going. Despite landing the first kill in just 41.86% of Control Point team fights, New York is still winning 62.79% of team fights overall. Translation: If your team lands the first pick against New York, you’re looking at a 50/50 shot to win the fight. But if they manage to draw first blood? Good night. 
&amp;nbsp;

3. Chipshajen has the fastest first Valkyrie charge time AND the fastest average Valkyrie charge time of all qualifying Mercy players. However, Chips has the second worst team fight win percentage with Mercy (30.15%) behind only Altering despite his early and frequent access to such a powerful ultimate ability. 
&amp;nbsp;

4. In 74 team fights fought on Widowmaker, Fleta has managed to land the first kill in 29 fights – that’s the first kill in 39.19% of team fights.
&amp;nbsp;

5. Feeding is bad, and London are the league’s worst offenders. The Spitfire lose an average of 5.05 players In team fights where they lose the first player. The Excelsior on the other hand have proven to be tops in disengaging, losing just 3.82 players under the same circumstances. 
&amp;nbsp;

6. If we counted the number of times that each team won a team fight in which they used more ultimates than their opponent, and then took the average of how many more ultimates they used than their opponents in those scenarios, we’re left with something of an index to measure ultimate economy. The premise is such that, optimally, teams want to use as few ults as possible to win a team fight. And so in fights where your team uses more than the other team and wins, you would ideally hope to limit excess ult use wherever possible. Based on this formula, the three teams who have been most disciplined with ultimate economy have been the Valiant at 3, Excelsior at 2, and… the Mayhem at 1? 
&amp;nbsp;

7. The Shanghai Dragons have lost the first player in 57.45% of the 47-total team fights they’ve been involved in on Assault Maps (Temple of Anubis, Horizon Lunar Colony). They haven’t won a single one of them. 
&amp;nbsp;

8. Profit has won 59 of the 82 team fights in which he was using Tracer (71.95%). No other player has won more than Munchkin’s 59.77% (minimum 10 fights). 
&amp;nbsp;

9. The Los Angeles Valiant have won only 45.77% of team fights over their last three matches (Excelsior, Spitfire, Gladiators) when using the league’s current most popular dive composition (Tracer, Genji, Zenyatta, Mercy, Dva, Winston). However, that win percentage jumps all the way up to 68.00% just by swapping in Pharah for Genji.
&amp;nbsp;

10. Bdosin not only has the highest first-kill rate for all Zenyattas (11.46%), he is also the best Zen player in terms of NOT being picked first (just 5.21% of team fights). (taken from my Zenyatta article here: http://thebenchmob.com/all/junk-drawer/owl-stat-attack-best-zenyatta/)

&gt; ""I think it's a million things that say that's not true,"" Lillard replied. ""I think for me personally, I don't think market size matters as much as it used to because of social media and all that stuff. I have a signature shoe that does well. I got a social media following; there's a lot of people following my music. There's a lot of things that I've been able to be successful at while playing in a small market because of social media. But I still think playing in a big market, there's a difference in a big market and a small market. That's just the way it will always be. You can't look at Memphis and New York City and say, 'Oh, well, if you're a star, you're a star.'""

On the infographic:

&gt; ""I try to speak on that stuff to a minimum because I don't want to look too sensitive,"" Lillard said to ESPN. ""My issue is, when I see something is wrong, I have to [address it], so it comes off as sensitive or overly bothered. I might be a little bit bothered, but it really ain't that deep. So I try to minimize it as much as possible so people don't ever get the wrong idea. But the thing is, it just happens to be me [getting left out] a lot of the time, so I'm just like, 'Man, what's going on?' I'm like, 'Yo, what's going on?' You know? That's like something simple. There's a lot [of] records that's like your first couple years in the NBA [and you made] this amount of 3s. I hold a lot of those records. So if we're speaking of records where I'm the previous record-holder, why wouldn't I be on there? And that's something small. I didn't even think about it that long other than when I mentioned it. So, it's whatever.""

Also comments on Lonzo getting more votes:

&gt; ""He plays for the Los Angeles Lakers, one of the most, if not the most, storied franchises in that big of a market,"" Lillard explained to ESPN. ""So, so many people are going to support him throughout that, and also with his dad and all the attention that's been surrounding him since college.

spotthejerk12,2018-01-18 04:40:14+00:00,Husband (63M) refuses to let our previously heroin addicted son (28M) back into our lives. Our son has been sober for 5 years and has become very successful recently.,"Son got into a very bad crowd as a teenager. Part of it was just the neighborhood we grew up in, it was a bad neighborhood, too much nightlife and drugs and partying, at age 15-16 he was basically already a street kid. At age 17, he joined a band, and at times we didn't see him for 2-3 days at a time. He was just a lost kid basically. He was very good looking, and I think that was part of his downfall at that age, his ego and his looks/charm made it so he went crazy partying and doing drugs with models at clubs and all that stuff. He got invited to parties that we would never have gone to at that age, he was a very, very popular guy. Then, one day, when he was 17, we found needles in his room, he was doing heroin. At first we tried to get him to go to rehab, and he went, and then right when he got back he did it again. We got into a massive, massive fight, he left, stealing nearly 500 bucks from us, and left to washington DC with his band. We were heartbroken. 

He tried to come back 2 months later, and my husband was so mad that he got into a fist fight with him, and my son never came back. 

I stayed in contact as much as I could. He would call me from random phones asking how everything was throughout the years, we met up a few times without my husband, sometimes he looked alright, sometimes he very clearly had relapsed. He never quit that band, and they seemed to be doing alright for themselves. 

Then, I just lost contact, for a really long time. He said he went to Los Angeles, then Sao Paulo, and that was all I knew for years. I have 2 other kids, and at the time... well he just wasn't present in my mind all the time. I hoped the best for him, but I had no idea what he was doing with his life at all, and I figured if he wanted to let me know he would. A year went by without any contact, then another... then 5 years went by. 
  
Up until 3 months ago. He called me, and I nearly broke out in tears. We talked for a very long time. He had been sober for 4 years he said. His band had gotten huge suddenly, and they were making a ton of money off of touring. He said when his tour was over, he planned to move back to nyc, and that he wanted to see us and reconnect with us. I thought he meant dinner or something, but no, he wanted to be a part of our life and everything. 

So fast forward 2 months later, and he sort of impromptu came to the apartment. He said hello to us, and my husband was really, really clearly upset at his visit. He gave me this stink eye the entire time, like I had betrayed his trust. My son looked GREAT. Holy shit did he look good, the dragged out face he used to have was gone, he clearly was working out a lot, he didn't look well... sketchy anymore. My husband didn't care really, when my son left, my husband freaked out, asking why the fuck he came over and all this stuff. He said he knew he was coming, but he didnt want to fucking talk or see him. 

My husband doesn't like us bringing his name up at all in the apartment. So even though I DID tell him he was sober and living in NYC, he didn't care. 

So what the hell do I do? I tried having a sit down with my husband but he just dismissed everything I said. I told him to toughen up and stop acting like a baby over this, and that it was his son, and he said ""that boy is no son of mine, hes just another junkie who stole from us"". I couldn't believe him. 

So what am I supposed to do? Tell him his father still hates him? How do I get through to my husband?

Edit: I said 5 years in the title, it was more like 4 and a half years. 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Son used to be a junkie, stole from us, came back after being sober for 4 years, husband still wont accept him. ",relationships,1161

padres65,2018-01-12 21:34:26+00:00,"One year ago today, the San Diego Chargers ceased to exist","Since, the following has happened:

* Spanos released his [new logo](http://www.trbimg.com/img-588005d2/turbine/sd-goodbye-chargers-logo-20170118). After unprecedented humiliation, including ridicule from other NFL teams, the logo was scraped. 

* Although Spanos claimed the logo was never meant to have significance, [evidence showed that it was supposed to be a primary logo, as it was advertised as being the logo on the 50 yard line](https://mediaassets.10news.com/photo/2017/01/12/stubhub_center2_screenshot_1484241421039_53075171_ver1.0_640_480.jpg).

* [Chargers TE Jeff Cumberland and Spanos were in attendance for an NBA game between the LA Lakers and Clippers. The LA Chargers logo came on the screen, followed by Cumberland, both of which were booed by fans in attendance. Spanos was never shown, because they didn’t want Spanos to get bad publicity.](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/watch-los-angeles-chargers-logo-booed-mercilessly-at-clippers-lakers-game/)

* Chargers introduces coach Anthony Lynn. His first words? “I am so proud to be the head coach of the San Diego...”. 

* Chargers announces their season tickets were sold out. The problem? The majority of buyers were ticket brokers, not fans.

* Speaking of fans: the Chargers have lost significantly more fans than they’ve gained.

* [The Chargers had a 6.0 TV rating in LA this year. If you take away the Raiders games and the season opener, the rating is a 5.2. By comparison, from 2012-2016, the San Diego Chargers, amidst relocation rumors, averaged 26.7](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sports/sd-sp-chargers-rams-low-tv-ratings-in-los-angles-20180105-story.html). The lowest ratings in San Diego? 1999, after a 1-15 finish.

* Besides games against the Raiders, the Chargers often finished as the 4th-5th most viewed game in their market. 

* [The Chargers Are a Case Study in Whether an NFL Team Can Survive Without Fans](https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2017/10/4/16423520/los-angeles-chargers-owners-post-fan-experiment)

* Anti-Spanos banners flew above the LA stadium every week. Not a big deal, right? *Wrong*. [The NFL was *freaking out* about these banners](http://thebiglead.com/2017/11/14/faa-emails-show-nfl-was-freaking-out-over-anti-dean-spanos-flyover-banners/).

* [The Mayor of LA even said the “Chargers could have stayed put... because San Diego has a huge fan base”](http://thebiglead.com/2017/09/14/even-la-mayor-eric-garcetti-thinks-the-chargers-should-have-stayed-in-san-diego/). 

* Announcers and TV personalities repeatedly called them the San Diego Chargers. The best line? [An in-game score update ends with: “Back to you guys in San Diego.” Play-by-play announcer Kevin Harlan: ""**I wish we were in San Diego, but we’re in Los Angeles**”](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sports/chargers/sd-sp-chargers-timeline-2017-relocation-20180110-story.html). 

BONUS:

* The flights that were flying the fire Spanos banners over Stubhub! Spanos tried to have them banned but the FAA only allows Temporary Flight Restrictions over venues that seat 30,000+ people. StubHub Center didn't qualify, obviously. (thank you u/dj10show!)

Overall, it is apparent that the Chargers move to Los Angeles has been a colossal failure. The right, good-PR move for the NFL would be to move the Chargers back to San Diego. Sadly, it will likely never happen, and the NFL will live with its mistake.",nfl,1781

Mc_Idan,2017-12-29 21:05:54+00:00,A guide to Overwatch Streamers to watch for each hero,"I decided to put together a guide with a bunch of Overwatch Streamers that are the best for watching to learn how to play and improve your ability for every hero. This guide is aimed mainly at new players so I will also include a short introduction to each character, however I hope there is still something to learn for players who are not necessarily new to the game.

**DISCLAIMER:**

This list is not the final say in who to watch and who not to watch, this is simply a guideline to get started. I encourage you to go and explore, look at streams linked in other comments, places, posts etc etc... Go and explore twitch and see where it takes you

#**Offense:**

Generally what you will find with alot of these heroes is that most of these streamers will play several heroes that are similar (for example most tracer players also play genji/soldier/doomfist aswell). Therefore you can watch several of these streamers for several characters, however to avoid clutter I will try and avoid linking most people multiple times.

##**Doomfist:**
Doomfist is one of the latest characters to the Overwatch lineup and is a highly mobile character best suited to flank (travel behind the enemy) and pick off support characters and squishies (everyone except tanks). Doomfist has 3 abilities, a primary fire, an ultimate and a passive ability.

***Streams to watch***

* [ChipSa](https://www.twitch.tv/chipsaow) is generally regarded as the best Doomfist in the game and his movement around the map is unparalleled.

* [Effect](https://www.twitch.tv/eff2ct) is known as one of the best Tracer player's in the game but is also no slouch on Doomfist. 

* [Hydration](https://www.twitch.tv/hydration) is a genji main although he also plays some doomfist. His Doomfist only account *""BRUCEUZULUL""* peaked at top 5 NA (I think #3) 

##**Genji:**

Genji has been a major part of the game since it's release and he is similar to Doomfist in the fact he is an incredibly mobile hero who flanks to pick off enemy support heroes. Genji however is not as reliant on abilities as Doomfist and has 2 abilities, aswell as a primary and secondary fire, and an incredibly powerful ultimate.

***Streams to watch***

* [Agilities](https://www.twitch.tv/agilities) played mainly Genji for Team Canada in the Overwatch World Cup.

* [Linkzr](https://www.twitch.tv/linkzr) is a very very talented player who can play most DPS at a very high level. His widowmaker and McCree is also world class

* [Shadder2k](https://www.twitch.tv/shadder2k) is another fantastic Genji player who is well worth watching

* [Necros](https://www.twitch.tv/necros_OW) is a very fast genji known for his ridiculously fast movements and plays

* [Georgelion66](https://www.twitch.tv/georgelion66) is a very high level genji main. Hes also a very chill guy and provides very useful commentary during his gameplay. Definitely deserves more attention than he gets

##**McCree:**

McCree is a very different style of DPS from the previous 2 mentioned. He is not very mobile and is heavily reliant on good flick aiming. He has 2 abilities, a primary fire (pretty much his only source of damage), a secondary fire and an ultimate. People who come from games like Counter Strike tend to find McCree the easiest character to pick up.

***Streams to watch***

* [Calvin](https://www.twitch.tv/aimbotcalvin) is a full time streamer who plays mainly McCree and at one point had 4 accounts in the Top 10 in NA. His streams are generally just really fun to watch and I highly recommend tuning in.

* [Surefour](https://www.twitch.tv/surefour) is a DPS player for Los Angeles Gladiators and also played for Team Canada alongside Agilities in the Overwatch World Cup. He plays multiple characters very well but is probably best known for his McCree.

* [Wanted](https://www.twitch.tv/wantedow) is a very high level player who mainly plays McCree over his (I think more than) 6 accounts. He also streams pretty regularly and is generally a really chill guy to watch. 

* [AKM](https://www.twitch.tv/akm_tv) is a French DPS player who used to play for Rogue until they disbanded. He is a very good all around DPS player and well worth watching.#

* [IDDQD](https://www.twitch.tv/iddqdow) is a DPS player for San Francisco Shock and seems to be the king of PMA and general good vibes. Plus he's pretty good at aiming too.

##**Pharah:**

Pharah is a very mobile character and also the only consistently flying hero in Overwatch. She has 2 abilities, a primary fire rocket launcher and an ultimate. 

***Streams to watch***

* [Valkia](https://www.twitch.tv/valkia) is a full time Streamer who plays mainly pharah at a very high level and is generally just a really cool dude. 


* [Mangachu](https://www.twitch.tv/Mangachu) is a very talented projectile player who also plays Off-tank like D.Va alot

* [Fareeha](https://www.twitch.tv/fareeha) is a very educational Pharah player who describes everything she is doing as she does it. Well worth a watch 

##**Reaper:**

Reaper is a fairly situational DPS who's shotguns make him almost a must have against Tank heavy comps. Due to this very situational usage and a somewhat low skill ceiling he is not often played. 

***Streams to watch***

* [Spirit](https://www.twitch.tv/spiritow) is generally regarded as one of the best Reapers in the world. He mainly plays Reaper although I think he now quite often flexes off to Genji/McCree and others.

##**Soldier 76:**

Is a very simple character to pick up and he relies heavily on tracking and positioning to put in as much damage as possible. Due to this simplicity to pick up he is normally played by people alongside many other DPS so as a result almost any high level DPS player will also be a very competent Soldier. 

***Streams to watch***

* [Clockwork](https://www.twitch.tv/clockwork) is a very competent DPS player who has some of the best Helix Rocket Accuracy in the world.

* [Jake](https://www.twitch.tv/jake_overwatch) is an incredible DPS player who plays just about every character under the sun. However he is also incredibly talented at alot of them and is most well known for his soldier.

* [Zombs](https://www.twitch.tv/zombsow) is a very high level DPS and Off-tank player, well worth watching to learn a thing or two.

* [Borium](https://www.twitch.tv/boriumsworld) is a fairly well known Soldier player and one of the few players who actually mostly plays Soldier.

* [Dafran](https://www.twitch.tv/dafran) is known for having possibly the best tracking in the world and as a result is one of the best Soldier players in the game, well worth a watch.

##**Sombra**

Sombra has a very different playstyle from most other DPS and is a much more utility based character who's main job is to set up plays for the rest of her team rather than being a primary source of damage and kills. As a result very little Sombra is actually played on ladder but she is seen fairly often during tournaments. 

***Streams to watch***

* [Codey](https://www.twitch.tv/codeyniku) is normally regarded as being the best Sombra for ladder play (normal competitive mode), however does not really have much experience playing her at a pro level.

* [FitzyHere](https://www.twitch.tv/fitzyhere) is a very well practiced Sombra main who is well worth a watch 

* [Mightyy](https://www.twitch.tv/worstsombra) used to create Sombra montages on his YouTube channel and plays a very aggressive style of Sombra which is very entertaining and interesting to watch.

* Honestly the best place to watch how Sombras play is by watching tournaments which can be found at a variety of different places. Overwatch Contenders and Overwatch League will hopefully see a decent amount of Sombra play so stay tuned for those.

##**Tracer:**

Tracer is probably the best carry hero up at higher ranks but unless you can aim well she isn't that effective. She also has one of the highest skill caps in the game. She relies heavily on movement abilities due to her very low health pool (the only character with 150 hp) and has a very similar playstyle to Doomfist and Genji.

***Streams to watch***

* [Effect](https://www.twitch.tv/eff2ct) is probably one of the best Tracers in the game and plays DPS for Dallas Fuel. His stream is also very entertaining (although he is Korean so won't always be speaking English)

* [Saebyeolbe](https://www.twitch.tv/saebyeolbe) played DPS (mainly Tracer) for Team South Korea during the Overwatch World Cup and is a fantastic player.

* [Kragie](https://www.twitch.tv/kragiee) is a very talented Tracer player who is also very competent at many other DPS characters.

* [Kabaji](https://www.twitch.tv/kabajiow) is probably the best person to watch to learn about how to play. He provides fantastic live commentary on what he is doing and why he is doing it and is one of the best educational streams out there.

* [Sinatraa](https://www.twitch.tv/sinatraa) is a very high level tracer player who recently got picked up by San Francisco Shock for 150k. Beware however as he can be quite toxic

#**Defense:**

Quite often the defense heroes are seen as slightly more niche picks due to their generally limited mobility, however in the right hands they can do fantastic things (mostly). Due to their niche pick circumstances there are very few people who actually main these characters at a high level and so therefore there are not as many streamers who play them.

##**Bastion:**

Bastion is a character with a very high damage output but very low mobility. He is very reliant on teammates to help him but when played as part of a coordinated team he can absolutely shred through enemies.

***Streams to watch***

* [Kolorblind](https://www.twitch.tv/kolorblind) is the most well known bastion main and as far as I know the only person who consistently mains him at a GM/Top500 level.

* [McNootie](https://www.twitch.tv/mcnootie) is another high rated bastion player worth taking a look at 

##**Hanzo:**

Hanzo is a projectile sniper who has the ability to wallclimb and as a result a fair amount of mobility. This makes him one of the more popular defense characters and as a result there are several good streamer's to watch.

***Streams to watch***

* [Wraxu](https://www.twitch.tv/wraxu) is widely considered to be the best Hanzo in the world and he hits absolutely insane shots on a pretty regular basis. He is also well liked in the community because he flexes pretty often onto whichever character is most needed at that time.

* [Arrge](https://www.twitch.tv/arrge) is a very good Hanzo who streams fairly often and is generally just a really chill dude.

* [Ironaids](https://www.twitch.tv/ironaids) is also a very good Hanzo main although as far as I'm aware he only uses text to speech to talk. Still a very good player and well worth watching for his ability.

##**Junkrat:**

Junkrat was recently buffed and is now probably the second most powerful hero in the game (after Mercy) if played correctly. His big task is area denial and high burst damage, however he is still pretty inconsistent for getting kills since his grenades follow a fairly slow arc. Due to his recent buff alot of big DPS players will often play him as part of their hero pool but here are the big ones I can immediately think of.

* [PVP](https://www.twitch.tv/pvptwitch) is probably the best Junkrat player in the game and generally peaks around top 10 NA. 

* [Chro](https://www.twitch.tv/prolikechro) also one of the bigger Junkrat mains in the community (or at least certainly used to be).

***Other people who play Junkrat but not all the time***

* [Taimou](https://www.twitch.tv/taimoutv) plays DPS for Dallas Fuel and is a very accomplished professional player.

* [Seagull](https://www.twitch.tv/a_seagull) also plays DPS for Dallas Fuel and is very well rounded in his hero pool, however he tends to play alot more projectile heroes than hitscan.

##**Mei:**

Mei is one of the more popular Defense characters and for good reason. She can be very versatile and her ice wall ability can be used for so many purposes that she almost has no skill ceiling.

***Streams to watch***

* [Jardio](https://www.twitch.tv/jardio) is well known to be probably the best Mei player worldwide. His ability usage is incredible and he's deadly accurate with his icicles.

* [Seagull](https://www.twitch.tv/a_seagull) also sometimes plays Mei and is a very talented player although Jardio is probably the way to go in terms of Mei mains.

* [Elysion](https://www.twitch.tv/elysion) is another incredible Mei main

##**Torbjörn:**

Torbjörn is a very niche character pick reserved almost entirely for Defense on certain maps and Offense on some payload maps, however that doesn't stop some people from maining him up at high ranks. 

***Streams to watch***

* [Fuey500](https://www.twitch.tv/fuey500) is probably the torb main to watch since not many other people play him often. Watch out if you plan to play him in competitive as a main however as Fuey was banned at one point for one-tricking Torbjörn.

* [Desrow](https://www.twitch.tv/desrowfighting) is generally a pretty funny guy to watch and is also a good Torb player.

##**Widowmaker:**

Widowmaker is probably the most commonly picked Defense hero after Junkrat and is easily one of the best carry heroes in the game if played well. She is very very aim reliant (even more than McCree) and her only job is to get picks/distract the enemy. Due to her popularity there are several big streamers who play her (although most DPS mains and also Ana mains will be very competent on Widowmaker so the people who play her are not restricted to this list.

***Streams to watch***

* [Joooomla25cm](https://www.twitch.tv/j0000mla25) is one of those widowmaker mains that most people in the community like for the same reason as people like Wraxu's Hanzo. In 9 out of 10 games his widow will pop off and in the 10th he will switch off to a character that will work better.

* [Crosyph](https://www.twitch.tv/crosyph) is a very well known WidowMaker in the scene and also a really nice guy.

* [Kephrii](https://www.twitch.tv/kephrii) is a somewhat controversial streamer/player in the scene but I'm leaving him in this list because he does quite often hit some really really nice shots.

* [Zerg](https://www.twitch.tv/zerg_og) is a younger kid (14 I think although I may be wrong?) who is a very capable Widow player. Go show him some love :)

* [Beeftipsy](https://www.twitch.tv/beeftipsy) is a super chiil widow streamer who streams quite often, definitely worth a watch 

#**Tank**

Tanks are the heroes which create space for the rest of their team and help set up plays for the rest of their team (specifically the DPS) as is evident through their tools. Tanks are generally split into 2 groups, those who peel and those who block incoming damage for space. They are also sometimes split into main-tanks and off-tanks with tanks like Reinhardt and Orisa shielding lots of damage and being main-tanks, whilst tanks like Zarya and Roadhog being half-dps, half-tank being referred to as off-tanks. Similar to DPS people who play a specific tank lots tend to play most of the others since alot of them have very transferable skills, therefore alot of these players I am linking play many of these tanks and can be watched for more than one hero.

##**D.Va:**

D.Va is a very versatile Off-tank who can be played in several different playstyles. The main 2 playstyles are as a peeler tank for the back-line who focuses on using her defense matrix ability to protect her healers from harassing dps, and as a front-line diver who focuses on diving in with other dive characters (Winston, genji, tracer etc...) and focuses instead of killing the enemy team's back-line and healers. Good D.Vas will alternate between the 2 but her versatility makes a very common character (the most picked tank in the game).
 
***Streams to watch***

* [emongg](https://www.twitch.tv/emongg) is just generally a perfect example of a fantastic member of the Overwatch community. His streams are a delight to watch and he always stays positive despite the woes of high elo ranked gameplay.

* [Mickie](https://www.twitch.tv/mickiepp) is an Off-tank player for Dallas Fuel and is well known to be one of the best D.Va players in the game. He literally always stays positive and has fun and is a fantastic person to tune in to.

* [Space](https://www.twitch.tv/space_ow) is an ex flex player for Cloud9 and is currently playing flex for Los Angeles Valliant. He is a very talented player.

* [LowKeyNerd](https://www.twitch.tv/lowkeynerd_OW) is a cool and high rated D.Va player who is well worth checking out.

* [Mouffin](https://www.twitch.tv/mouffin) reached top 10 on 2 accounts in NA one-tricking D.Va and is very good to use for learning new tricks

##**Orisa:**

Orisa is a shield tank with an enourmous hitbox and high health pool. Her abilities make her great on maps with lots of areas to pull people off maps, however she can be a bit *meh* on certain maps when attacking since once you place a barrier you cant place another one for 8 seconds, making pushing up pretty difficult. 

***Streams to watch*** 

* [EvilToaster](https://www.twitch.tv/eviltoasterow) is a great Orisa player at a very high ranking. He's also a pretty chill dude.

* [xQc](https://www.twitch.tv/xqcow) is a very talented tank player currently playing main tank for Dallas Fuel. Be warned though his stream is alot to take in so he isn't for the faint of heart.

* [OhDough](https://www.twitch.tv/ohdough) is an Orisa main who peaked at 4435 in season 7. Worth tuning into :)

##**Reinhardt:**

Reinhardt has been in the game since release and was a key part of the meta for a long time. He is a great hero to learn how to tank with since his playstyle punishes you for overextending and pushing in without your team's help. Landing his ult however is probably one of the most satisfying things in the game, followed not far behind by whacking people with a huge-ass hammer.

***Streams to watch***

* [CloneMan16](https://www.twitch.tv/cloneman16) is a very talented Rein player who is also very entertaining to watch.

* [Fissure](https://www.twitch.tv/fissure_ow) plays main tank for London Spitfire in the Overwatch league and is a very entertaining Korean Reinhardt player who is also very talented.

* [Muma](https://www.twitch.tv/muma) plays mainly winston and Reinhardt at a very high level.

##**Roadhog:**

Roadhog is probably the closest thing to a DPS you can get in the tank lineup. He has the largest health pool in the game (600) but is also has a huge hitbox to make up for it. Roadhog punishes uncoordinated teams who play out of position and is a peeler off-tank.

***Streams to watch***

* [harbleu](https://www.twitch.tv/harbleu) is a very entertaining and very talented Off-tank player (mainly Roadhog, Zarya and sometimes D.Va). He always seems to keep positive and has probably the most contagious laugh in history.

* [DrRiku](https://www.twitch.tv/Drriku) is also a very talented hog main who has played him through all of his patches and still does incredibly well, well worth a watch!

* [Smex](https://www.twitch.tv/smex_ow) is also a very good flex player who was part of the UK team during the Overwatch World Cup who specialises in Roadhog and D.Va.

##**Winston:**

Winston is a Dive tank who is normally the main initiator in fights during when running a dive composition. He relies quite heavily on the rest of his team but can be an incredibly strong hero when played correctly. 

***Streams to watch***

* [xQc](https://www.twitch.tv/xqcow) is once again a very good Winston player (his best character) although as said before, his stream is a lot to handle and many people just find him really annoying. 

* [Mano](https://www.twitch.tv/manoowl) is a main tank player currently playing for New York Excelsior and is regarded as one of the best Winston/Rein players in all of Korea. 

* [iRemiix](https://www.twitch.tv/iremiixz) is the main tank player for Los Angeles Gladiators aswell as having played for teams such as Kungarna in the past. He is a very accomplished tank player and well worth watching.

* [Tryhard_Enmity](https://www.twitch.tv/tryhard_enmity) is a top teir winston/orisa main. Hes also a really chill dude and has a pretty small stream so go show him some love :)

##**Zarya:**

Zarya is a DPS-Peeler-Off-tank and uses her ""bubbles"" to gain ""charge"" through damage directed at the bubble. The higher her charge is, the more damage her gun does until her charge maxes out at 100%.

***Streams to watch***

* [Spree](https://www.twitch.tv/spree) is widely regarded as probably the best western Zarya and his tracking on her is almost next to none. He is also generally a pretty cheery chap.

* [harbleu](https://www.twitch.tv/harbleu) is also a very talented Zarya player who is generally one of the best people in the community in terms of positivity.

* [Lassiz](https://www.twitch.tv/lassiz) is a cool as fuck dude and regularly pulls off some insane plays on Zarya. Definitely worth a look at

* [CANAS1AN](https://www.twitch.tv/canas1an) is a zarya main who focuses often on being educational. His YouTube also has a lot of great videos

#**Support:**

Supports are the characters which heal or aid their team with utility (such as Symmetra's teleporter). Each support has a very different skillset from each other and requires a different playstyle.

##**Ana:**

Ana is regarded to be one of the characters with a very high skill cap and her playstyle differs depending on the situation and the player. She can be played far away in the back which works on maps with lots of open space, or she can be played as part of the main team group and generally requires a much more active player. 

***Streams to watch***

* [Gale Adelade](https://www.twitch.tv/gale_adelade) is a 17 year old Ana main who is also very competent on every other hitscan character. He has been widely regarded as a top 5 Ana almost since her release and he has played her through every patch.

* [Ryujehong](https://www.twitch.tv/wpghd321) is regarded as probably the best Ana player in all of Korea. He is currently playing Support for Seoul Dynasty in the Overwatch League. 

* [Chipshajen](https://www.twitch.tv/chipshajen) is a support player for Dallas Fuel who also played for Team Sweden in the Overwatch World Cup. He is a very accomplished Ana, Zen and Mercy player.

##**Lucio:**

Lucio is a very active secondary healer who's main job is to protect his main healer from harassers such as tracer and genji. Most support players will be able to play Lucio as he is probably the easiest character to play at a basic level, however his movement has an unlimited skill cap and as a result there are alot of very accomplished Lucio mains.

***Streams to watch***

* [Rammy](https://www.twitch.tv/rammy_ow) is a very talented professional Lucio player who is well worth watching.

* [FunnyAstro](https://www.twitch.tv/funnyastro) is also a very high rated Lucio main who streams fairly often.

* [Swimmer](https://www.twitch.tv/swimmerOW_) has been given praise by several big streamers and has some nutty wall riding skills

##**Mercy:**

Mercy is probably the best support to pick up for people who cannot aim very well or who do not enjoy the actual shooting aspect of FPS games. She relies heavily on her team and her movement abilities to survive as her pistol is almost useless against most enemies.

***Streams to watch***

* [EeveeA](https://www.twitch.tv/eeveea_) is probably one of the most well known mercy one-tricks in the game and she has one of the most lovely communities in the game. :)
* [Vale](https://www.twitch.tv/vale) is an incredibly talented mercy player who had 4 accounts in the top 4 spots for mercy on Overbuff for a while.
* [LittleMenace](https://www.twitch.tv/little_menace) streams often and pioneered certain strats with mercy, worth a watch.

##**Moira:**

Moira is the newest character to be added to Overwatch and currently one of the most picked. Her place in the meta is still being decided since she hasn't been around for very long.

***Streams to watch***

* [Fahzix](https://www.twitch.tv/fahzix) is an incredibly talented flex support player who plays pretty much all the supports at a Top 500 level. He plays alot of Moira on his alt account *""Fah2ix""*.

* [Custa](https://www.twitch.tv/custa) is an insane player who normally sticks to other supports but can bust out some incredible Moira from time to time

##**Symmetra:**

Symmetra is an incredibly niche pick who is currently very weak in this meta and she is not advised to be played, however that doesn't stop a few people from maining/one-tricking her.

***Streams to watch***

* [Hoshizora](https://www.twitch.tv/HoshizoraOW) is a fantastic example of what a Symm player should be, both in terms of attitude and ability

* [Luminum](https://www.twitch.tv/luminum1) is an Australian Symm/Mercy main who is incredibly kind to his community and well worth watching if you're into Symm gameplay.

* [Stevo](https://www.twitch.tv/just_stevo) is a pretty controversial streamer who has been the centre of lots of drama since he started streaming a while ago. Fair warning before entering his stream, whilst he is a good symmetra he is one of the worst players I've ever seen for attitude and always complains about everything when he is the one instalocking Symm and never switching.
##**Zenyatta:**

Last but not least is Zenyatta. He is a very powerful secondary healer who has the highest damage output of the Support category. There are lots of very high Zen players so this list is difficult but I will try my best.

***Streams to watch***

* [Unkoe](https://www.twitch.tv/unkoeee) is a French Support player playing for Los Angeles Valliant in the Overwatch League. He is sometimes regarded as one of the best support players in the game.

* [Rawkus](https://www.twitch.tv/itsrawkus) is a support player for Houston Outlaws in the Overwatch League and is very talented at most of the support roster aswell as heroes like Widowmaker.

* [Blinky](https://www.twitch.tv/blinky_plz) is good for explaining what he's doing as he does it.


#**Conclusion:**

I hope this helps, let me know if you think I left anyone out as this is a work in progress rather than a definitive list. 

GLHF :)

freaky_ow,2017-12-25 17:29:04+00:00,Christmas newbies guide to the Overwatch scene!,"If you got Overwatch for the holidays from friends, bought it for yourself or are eying it with some gifts of cash you received, here is what to expect when you start playing!
	
This write up is for new Overwatch players to help them gain a basic understanding of all facets of the scene, mostly about what the gameplay is like at an average level but also a small section on the professional scene. I want to emphasize that many of the things discussed here have situational exceptions at all levels of gameplay and is intended to provide a foundation for new players to discover those exceptions as they get better and better. 
	
Gameplay
	
Overwatch has a few modes where you play against AI instead of other players. You have the tutorial which will take you through the very basics of gameplay. Then there is practice range that has enemy and friendly bots that don't engage you, just hang out doing their own thing for you to try out heroes and their abilities in a free space. This is a great mode to change things like your reticle, different keybinds for specific abilities and whatever other settings you want to customize.  Finally, there is Play vs AI where it pits you and your team, consisting of other players, versus a computer controlled enemy team. Vs AI has easy, normal, and hard modes and is good for new FPS players to get an understanding of the game before you jump into the multiplayer playlists!

When you load into the multiplayer playlists for the first time and hit play you’ll see four options to choose from: Quick play, arcade, competitive and server browser. Quick play is the basic hop in and play mode with no consequences for losing or leaving games (besides reduced XP). Arcade is for fun and special game types like zero gravity, no hero limits, free-for-all and much more. The incentive for arcade is purely cosmetic, every three wins you are rewarded a loot box up to nine wins, for a total of three loot boxes every week. Server browser is for player made custom games, such as Ana paint ball, different styles of boss fights (one buffed hero vs. many normal ones) and even role-playing games if you’re into that. These game modes are all enjoyable and fun to play but only give you a taste of what Overwatch has to offer. Competitive is where you go to get the best Overwatch experience and where the game really shines.
	
Competitive is the ranked mode inside of Overwatch. Once you hit level 25 by playing the other three modes you can hop into the ranked playlist and after 10 placement matches you’ll be given a Skill Ranking (SR) ranging from 500-5000 (no rank below 500 is shown to combat people throwing games to get the lowest rank). The ranks are divided into SR groups: Bronze 1-1499, silver 1500-1999, gold 2000-2499, platinum 2500-2999, diamond 3000-3499, masters 3500-3999, grandmasters 4000+ and then the illustrious Top 500, which is given to the 500 highest ranked accounts in the region.
	
Inside the main playlists of quick play and competitive there are four different game modes to play: escort, assault, king of the hill and hybrid.
	
Escort has you push a payload from just outside your spawn to the end of the map. The map path is split into 2 checkpoints and the finish line, each checkpoint you get rewards you with extra time to keep pushing the payload to the next checkpoint until the end of the map. Dorado, Junkertown, Route 66 and Watchpoint: Gibraltar are the escort maps.
	
The ever-hated assault maps consist of two capture points the attacking team tries to capture while the defending team tries to hold them. The capture points are captured one at a time with the second one opening up only after the first one has been taken. Hanamua, Horizon Lunar Colony, Temple of Anubis and Volskaya industries are the assault maps.
	
Control maps, typically referred to as KOTH because it’s a King of the Hill mode, has one capture point in the middle of the map that both teams try to take and hold. Time holding the point ticks up until 100% and one team wins after they successfully win two points. Each KOTH map has three separate points for capture that are all individual sub-maps played in a random order until one team wins. Illios, Lijang Tower, Nepal and Oasis are the control maps.
	
Hybrid maps are, surprise, a mix of two modes: assault and escort. These maps have one capture point for the attacking team to try and take while the defenders try to hold it. Once the attackers take the point, it unlocks a payload that needs to be pushed to the end of the map with one checkpoint and then the finish line. Eichenwalde, Hollywood, King’s Row and Numbani are the hybrid maps.
	
Heroes and Teams
	
So now that we have the game modes and the game types its time to look into how those points are captured and those payloads pushed. Each team consists of 6 players each choosing one hero to play as. You’ll see the heroes divided in four categories: attack, defense, tank, and support. However, while playing and on Overwatch forums you will typically see the heroes sectioned off a bit differently into three categories instead of four: DPS (damage per second), tanks and supports. This grouping lumps the attack and defense heroes together because they largely fill the same role and are all essentially interchangeable. 
	
In a simplified explanation, DPS heroes are supposed to do damage and secure kills, tanks protect the team, absorb damage and create space, and supports keep the teams health topped off.
	
The 6 teammates each choose heroes to build a ‘team composition,’ which describes the teams hero picks as a whole. The gold standard for team comps is the 2/2/2 structure: 2 dps, 2 tanks and 2 supports. The idea behind it is fairly simple, if one person dies there is still another person within the same role to keep the fight going i.e. if one tank dies, there is the other tank still alive. It is a stable and consistent team comp that the majority of people in competitive mode want.
	
Styles of team comps are generally divided into two types: death ball and dive. 
Death ball team comps are tight groupings of less mobile heroes that hold around a shield tank like Reinhardt or Orisa. They slowly push forward hoping to get a pick or two then rush in to clean up the rest of the enemy team while staying safe behind their teams shield. Dive comps are teams with the most mobile heroes, like Winston, D.VA, Tracer, and Genji. With these heroes, the goal is to all jump and focus a single target and take them out quickly while using their high mobility to strafe out of danger and use the environment and health packs to their advantage. 
	
Individual hero play styles and what role you fit into the best will only come with playing the game. I highly encourage you to try out every hero and see which ones you find the most fun. In typical ladder play nearly everything is viable despite people who will tell you meta hero’s are the only ones that should be played.  In the words of Karen, a pokemon trainer from the Johto region, ""Strong Pokémon. Weak Pokémon. That is only the selfish perception of people. Truly skilled Trainers should try to win with the Pokémon they love best."" Play who you have fun with! If you are able to perform on that hero then no one can tell you different (they will at some point though because its an online game). However, not every hero is ideal in every environment no matter how good you are at them so not only being able to flex to other heroes but also being willing to when you recognize you’re not performing well will reward you with more wins and more happy teammates in the long run. 

Events and Cosmetics

Loot boxes. Micro transactions. EA. Luckly for us there is none of that hate in Overwatch. One of the best things, especially in the current gaming landscape, is that the micro transactions available in Overwatch have no impact on the gameplay whatsoever. Every unlockable is purely cosmetic and gives no advantage one way or another. Lootboxes can be earned with each level up or bought with real money and give you four random items with a low chance of duplicates. Duplicates will give you a small amount of in game currency. In game currency is also a random item inside the lootboxes. Currency can be used to buy the specific cosmetics you want once you have enough dough. It’s a good balance of getting random items while still being able to grab that awesome one you’ve been eyeing after enough saving. You can get every single cosmetic in the game without spending a dime!
	
Throughout the year Blizzard puts on fun events inside the game and updates the cosmetics, game modes, and maps for a limited time. The cosmetics are only available within the event window and become locked after the event ends. Typically the cosmetics cost a lot of currency and make it difficult to pick up everything the event brings so save up for ones you really want. So far we have gotten the Summer Games, Halloween Terror, Winter Wonderland (going on now), Lunar New Year, Uprising, and Anniversary. We’ve gotten Summer Games, Winter Wonderland and Halloween Terror twice so we can expect to see the other ones again as the years go on.
	
Esports and the Professional Scene

Overwatch has had a history of a professional scene going back all the way to the closed beta. Nowadays, you’ll be seeing a lot of talk about a feathery head turning bird, OWL. OWL stands for ‘Overwatch League” and is the next step for Overwatch esports. Put simply, there are 12 teams that each represent a city across the globe who will compete in a 5 month season divided into 4 parts then the top teams will end the season in the playoffs. After the playoffs will be a fun all-star weekend. For the inaugural season every team is going to be based out of L.A. and compete in the Blizzard esports arena in Burbank, California. Season begins on January 10th and runs until June 16th so there is going to be tons of games to watch and cheer on your favorite team. 
	
There is a TON of information and content to consume about the games, the teams, power ranking and more if you are interested. I’ve included below some extremely detailed team introductions by /u/shomman and /u/seagull_no1_fanboy that will give you a good idea of what each team looks like going into the first season. 
	
There are a lot of important people in the professional scene, especially with OWL just around the corner. Jeff Kaplan, our community God-Emperor/wrestler extraordinaire (don’t mess with him) is the Overwatch game lead designer. You’ll see his face a lot in developer updates where he goes through balance updates and the Overwatch teams reasoning for each change. Nate Nanzer is the Overwatch League commissioner so he is the go to guy for all official OWL happenings. The big casters who will be commentating most of the league games are: Christopher ""MonteCristo"" Mykles, Erik ""DoA"" Lonnquist, Matt ""Mr. X"" Morello, and Mitchell ""Uber"" Leslie. All OWL players can be found in the team introductions. Check out Dinoflask on youtube for some hilarious developer update parodies that get referenced quite a bit in the community.

quickonthedrawl,2017-12-20 04:38:40+00:00,"Week 16 D/ST Scoring, 2017","Hello and welcome back!

For most normal leagues, this is the final week of the 2017 season. If you're lucky enough to be competing again - and make no mistake, you must have gotten lucky to be there - then here's hoping you can keep it going one more time.

Week 15 was actually really kind for D/STs... yet again. I don't know what it is, but 2017 in general has been extremely consistent from week-to-week, with a couple of notable exceptions. And looking forward to Week 16, we have a very interesting environment with which to work.

Overall the rank correlation for Week 15 was 0.385 (ECR was 0.329).

https://imgur.com/a/0o6xT

1	12.2	Baltimore Ravens 

2	11.2	Jacksonville Jaguars

3	11.1	Los Angeles Chargers

4	10.8	Pittsburgh Steelers

5	10.6	Chicago Bears

6	10.1	Arizona Cardinals

7	9.7	Detroit Lions

8	9.5	Carolina Panthers

9	9.4	Kansas City

10	9.3	Washington

11	9.0	Philadelphia Eagles

12	8.9	Los Angeles Rams

13	8.9	New England Patriots

14	8.3	Dallas Cowboys

15	8.0	New York Giants

16	7.8	New Orleans Saints

17	~~7.7	Minnesota Vikings*~~

18	7.6	Denver Broncos

19	7.4	Cleveland Browns

Since posting these projections, the **Minnesota Vikings now project 10.5 points, fifth overall, just behind the Chicago Bears**. Aaron Rodgers will no longer be playing QB this season, so even in Lambeau, the Vikings make a killer surprise start.

Other tier one choices should be obvious by now: We have the Ravens and Jaguars, we have the Browns opponent (Chicago), and we have the Pittsburgh Steelers preying on another backup (this time, the backup to the backup) QB. We also get the Chargers, a solid D/ST on the season with a favorable road matchup against a backup QB.

If there seems to be a lot of slam dunk plays this week, you're not wrong: of the 16 games in the NFL this weekend, 10 of them have a spread of 6.5 points or larger, and there are zero games with a spread of 3 points or fewer. This creates a lopsided projection in nearly every game on the board this week and a ton of very obvious plays.

Thus, the second tier is full of some great choices too. The Cardinals have a home game against the Giants, and are a great streaming choice for anybody who wants a safe, high floor, medium ceiling game. The Panthers are big home favorites in an exploitable matchup against the Bucs. Kansas City are favored by over 10 at home. And on and on and on.

You really can't go wrong this week.

Well, you can, but it's not your fault if you do. Find the options on the highest tier you have access to and choose arbitrarily from there. If forced to rank teams along my own personal preference this week:

1. BAL
2. JAX
3. PIT
4. MIN
5. LAC
6. CHI
7. KC
8. ARI
9. WAS
10. CAR
11. DET
12. NE
13. LAR
14. PHI
15. NOS

New England feels a little low, but their opponent is hard to exploit and the scoring total is a little higher than we'd like. New Orleans feels low as well given they are such heavy favorites. Everything else feels pretty reasonable, with most other options that seem ""too low"" probably being because they are playing on the road.

Use the tiers and projections, the list above, or your own intuition - as long as you're making an educated decision, it's hard to go too wrong, and this week seems like it should be easier than usual to avoid the landmines.

...which of course means we're probably in for a rough one.

Best of luck to everybody in your championship games, and for anybody with a Week 17 finale - I'll be back next week for the last-ever issue of D/ST projections as well as a year in review and stats analyses. Will do my best to field questions tonight and then again throughout the week.",fantasyfootball,1131

The article requires a subscription but it was a pretty good read so I’ll include a few excerpts (more in comments):

**Andre Iguodala**

West told his Kobe memories from the visiting locker room in Charlotte last week. Just as he was wrapping up, Andre Iguodala returned to his nearby locker and began to listen in on the conversation. He smirked, giving off an 'Oh, you think that's bad?' vibe. Then he interjected with one of his own.

Iguodala was drafted by the 76ers in 2004. He immediately became a defensive ace, deployed by coach Mo Cheeks to guard all the league's best perimeter scorers.

In November of 2005, near the start of Iguodala's second season, he tangled with Kobe in Kobe's hometown of Philadelphia and won.

“He was 3 for 17, only had 17 points,” Iguodala said. “I was locking that s— up.”

Like any great decade-old tale, some of the statistics have been exaggerated. Kobe wasn't 3 of 17, he was 7 of 17 for those 17 points. But that's still an inefficient night mostly due to Iguodala.

“Then Phil Jackson said in the paper: 'I've never seen anyone guard Kobe as good as that,'” Iguodala said. “Then Aaron McKie has a quote, he said: 'Yeah, man, this kid grew up in the era of Kobe, he studied Kobe, so he can guard Kobe.'”

Two months later, the Sixers made the return trip to Los Angeles. Iguodala swears he'd forgotten about the first matchup. Kobe obviously hadn't.

“He came in the visiting locker room and asked my teammates: 'Yo, where's Dre,'” Iguodala said. “They're like, 'Oh, he's on the court shooting.' He just said: 'Tell him 50 tonight.' It was like he'd been waiting for that game.”

Kobe guaranteed Iguodala 50 pregame and then delivered him to the doorstep of it, making 19 of his 29 shots, hitting all seven of his 3s and scoring 48 points before subbing out of a blowout win with 4 minutes still left to go.

“(Warriors assistant Chris) DeMarco found it on — what's the system they use for old games? Synergy?” Iguodala said. “He's like, 'Yo, I'm watching it and was like, you know the Staples Center logo? He shot two 3s from the 'A' in Staples Center.' He was making some incredible shots. I remember coming back to the bench and Mo Cheeks was like: 'Young man, you did a helluva job tonight.'”

“I remember that Andre,” West said, cracking up. “I remember that.”

Iguodala didn't want to take all the fault.

“He was just putting Chris Webber in the pick-and-roll,” he said. “I was dead meat.”

*So which is it: 8 or 24?*

“8,” Iguodala said. “8 had bounce. 8 was the one who came in the locker room and told me you're getting 50 tonight.”",nba,1946

I don't care about what I did.' I seen he had a triple-double one game and they lost. He was like, 'I don't care. We lost.'

Thought it was good to see this type of attitude in a rookie be recognized by LeBron, and I'm sure other players understand this about Ball as well. 

LeBron even goes on to talk about how he might be able to relate with Lonzo's experience as a hyped rookie:

&gt;""So, can I draw any parallel to my experience? I mean, of course. I guess when you're drafted to a franchise, they want you to kind of be the savior. And it takes a while. I mean, listen, man, this guy is 20-something games into his pro career. S--- doesn't happen [that fast]. Here it goes again, it goes back to my instant oatmeal [quote]: Everybody wants it right away. Can he play ball? Absolutely. The kid can play ball. Do guys want to play with him?

quickonthedrawl,2017-12-12 14:31:19+00:00,"Week 15 D/ST Scoring, 2017","
Hello and welcome back!

Does a bad week sting any less when we see it coming? No? I didn’t think so. Defenses were predictably a disaster in Week 14, but predictions don’t score fantasy points unless you can act on them, and we had very few profitably actionable choices. It's a bit morbidly amusing that we can forecast the week to be bad, but we can't find our way out of the mess even still.

Versus consensus rankings, readers could have successfully sat Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, New England, or the Jets, who finished with a combined negative one fantasy points in MFL Standard. Unfortunately, our targets were the Cowboys (8 points), Bills (5 points), and Packers (7 points), which really is nothing to brag about, and would have caused big misses on Denver, Detroit, Kansas City, et al. Again, is it any consolation that consensus rankings missed those too? Maybe a little bit, but mostly not.

Rank correlation on the week was a dismal -0.197, suggesting that it would have been more productive to select your defense at random. FantasyPros ECR clocked in a bit worse with -0.205, so at least it was not just us!

So yeah, Week 14 sucked. Let’s hope things turn around in a hurry!

 **Week 15 D/ST Projections**

https://imgur.com/a/AUTbw

1	12.9	Jacksonville Jaguars

2	12.2	Baltimore Ravens 

3	12.0	New Orleans Saints

4	10.9	Philadelphia Eagles

5	10.0	Buffalo Bills

6	9.9	Minnesota Vikings

7	9.7	Detroit Lions

8	9.3	Washington

9	9.0	Carolina Panthers

10	8.6	Denver Broncos

11	8.3	Arizona Cardinals

12	8.2	Miami Dolphins

13	8.2	Los Angeles Chargers

14	8.1	Dallas Cowboys

15	7.9	Atlanta Falcons

16	7.9	Indianapolis Colts

17	7.7	San Francisco 49ers

18	7.7	Tennessee Titans


19	7.6	Seattle Seahawks


Jacksonville, Baltimore, and New Orleans are entirely locked in. If you have access to multiple from that group, just flip a coin. All three of them are as obvious of a D/ST play as you’ll ever get, so even if you choose the wrong one, you can rest easy knowing you didn’t make a mistake at kickoff. Save your overthinking and tinkering for the rest of your lineup if you're in this boat.

Philadelphia joins them in the top tier, but their case is a little trickier. With Carson Wentz they would probably be a slam dunk play as well, but instead we get merely “very good” – the game is on the road and the Giants have (surprisingly) avoided giving up the jackpot D/ST scores recently. Still though, they’re not good, and they have mostly allowed for a very high D/ST floor for their opponents. I would pivot away from the Eagles for one of the three teams mentioned first, but they make a solid start for anybody who was hoping to ride them through the playoffs.

The second tier is a lot more difficult to parse than the top tier. Buffalo and Miami are off the board right now, probably due to Tyrod, so I filled in the line as Buffalo -2, over/under 38. If the line differs significantly from that when it is finally hung, then adjust your expectations for both teams appropriately. Miami would jump into the second tier if Peterman starts, and Buffalo would drop down a few slots (but probably remain in the second tier anyway) in that case. I am hopeful that Tyrod will finally play.

Carolina rank as the last team in the second tier, but I suspect this will be the most volatile rank of them all for Week 15. The line currently sits at Carolina -3, and when combined with the Aaron Rodgers rumors, I think there’s a very decent chance we see him play. If so, I would yank Carolina from consideration entirely, but if not, they make a very good start. This projection here is a bit of a hedge: I fully expect it to move up or down significantly by the Saturday update this week, so make arrangements for a backup plan if you are risk averse.

Minnesota is my personal favorite on this tier. Good matchup, huge favorites, playing at home, and it’s projected to be a low-scoring environment. They check every box, and the only reason they are not a top tier option is because their YTD scoring has been a little bland. They haven’t scored 10+ points since their bye week, but this is as good a week as any for that to change.

NFC North rival Detroit also show up in the second tier once again. I have not been kind to the Lions D/ST throughout the column this season, and I think the pessimism has mostly been warranted. It’s hard to ignore a home game against the Bears though – despite pushing their opponent into the negatives in Week 15, the Bears have been a top D/ST matchup all year long. They are my second favorite play on the tier behind Minnesota (and of course, pending QB news in Carolina/Green Bay) .

The tier is rounded out with Washington. They have not been particularly good as a D/ST this season, and this game sees a scoring environment a little higher than I would normally like for a defense. However, the game will be played at home, and the Cardinals have been fairly generous to opposing D/STs. This game will have a low floor and a relatively high ceiling for Washington and it is one I would try to avoid if possible. I do not know if I would dip into the third tier instead, but if I did, the targets would be Denver, Miami (speculating on Tyrod v Peterman), and the Chargers.

All in all, the third tier feels right, in that it’s a bunch of options that make me groan when I think about starting any of them. As mentioned above, Denver is intriguing and so is Miami if things break right for them. The Chargers have been incredible, so they can be justified as a start on that basis, but the matchup is horrible and backers have probably made arrangements for this week a few weeks ago.

I think that will do it for Week 15 for now. I’ll be taking my final final exam as an undergraduate this afternoon (!), so I might need a few hours before fielding too many questions. But I tried to hit on all of the most interesting options above to make up for it, and will definitely pop in and out of the thread more often this week than I have lately. 

Best of luck!",fantasyfootball,1151

quickonthedrawl,2017-12-05 19:21:15+00:00,"Week 14 D/ST Scoring, 2017","Hello and welcome back!

I think it's playoff time in almost every league, so let's get straight to business. Week 13 was another stellar D/ST week for the projection model, with a rank correlation of 0.47 (FantasyPros ECR was 0.42). We were spot on with Washington and Dallas compared to consensus, but Kansas City ended up as a huge miss.


**Week 14 D/ST Projections:**

https://imgur.com/a/tQRjU

(text version)

1	10.7	Jacksonville Jaguars

2	10.2	Dallas Cowboys

3	10.2	Los Angeles Chargers

4	10.1	Green Bay Packers

5	9.9	Buffalo Bills

6	9.6	Cincinnati Bengals

7	9.4	New England Patriots

8	9.3	Houston Texans

9	9.3	Pittsburgh Steelers

10	9.2	Indianapolis Colts

11	8.9	Tennessee Titans

12	8.8	Minnesota Vikings

13	8.7	New York Jets

14	8.6	Seattle Seahawks

15	8.2	San Francisco 49ers

16	8.0	Chicago Bears

17	8.0	Baltimore Ravens 

18	7.9	Denver Broncos

19	7.9	Los Angeles Rams

20	7.8	Tampa Bay Buccaneers

21	7.8	Cleveland Browns

Going a little deeper than usual this week because the tiers are massive. Just a warning, the slate this week **does not** look conducive to a good D/ST week. With a low average projected score overall, massive tiers, lots of road teams... brace for impact.

* The Jaguars get a strong ranking here because they've just been so fucking good. Fire 'em up, even in a mediocre matchup. The Seahawks have been playing great lately, and Duane Brown has made a very marked impact on the offensive line. The rest of the line is trash though, so you can expect the Jaguars to fall into a few sacks by default, even if their ceiling is a little lower than it is against more mistake-prone QBs.

* The other top D/ST on the season, Baltimore, is going to put a lot of us in an awkward spot on Sunday. I clinched a playoff spot in my NarFFL league thanks in part to the Ravens, but will probably make arrangements to start either Dallas or Green Bay, or whatever else I can find off of waivers. I will not dip into the 3rd tier (the red cells on the chart above), but virtually anything in the 2nd tier looks like an upgrade to my own eyes. Indianapolis is the one I would probably pass on in favor of the Ravens, because Fuck The Colts.

* Dallas and Green Bay headline the streamers this week. Both are on the road. If this week were another episode of the McAdoo show, the Cowboys would be a lot more enticing. As it is, they're probably just decent. There's a good chance they sink a lot of playoff teams, but the matchup is too good to ignore. That said, the Giants have only been the 12th best matchup for opposing D/STs, and their cancerous coach is finally gone. This could be a real letdown game for Cowboys backers and I would much rather be on Green Bay here. Their matchup is better, their defense isn't that much better/worse, and I think their floor and ceiling are both higher.

* The Chargers are too good to ignore, and can probably be started with confidence even in a mediocre matchup. Just eat the loss if it happens.

* Buffalo/Indianapolis is off the board right now due to Tyrod's injury status. They can probably be started as a Tier 2 option regardless of the QB, but I don't want to be anywhere near this game if it's Nathan Peterman. See what I mean about this week's slate being terrible? That does mean the Colts are on the table as a possible streamer on the road, which is disgusting and disappointing. Stay tuned for updates throughout the week: I [usually post them to my Twitter feed by Saturday](https://twitter.com/dtlerch/status/937348558411517952). Tampa/Detroit is also off the board currently, so there is more volatility there than usual.

* If you have anything on this list at Pittsburgh or higher, I think you should feel good enough about your chances. Anything below Pittsburgh and you should be looking to make an improvement.

* The nature of the week otherwise is that the tier breaks are not very steep and there are a ton of choices that all kind of suck in their own ways. So to be honest, as long as you're choosing a D/ST that you're able to justify as a reasonable start, you're doing OK for yourself. Just remember: Home teams &gt; away teams, Favorites &gt; underdogs, Low-scoring environments &gt; High-scoring environments, and Good pass rushes &gt; Bad pass rushes.

After three long, cold, miserable, flaccid years, today is the day that Josh Gordon re-enters our lives and rosters.

Since the last time Josh Gordon played a professional football game, two NFL teams have moved to Los Angeles, the United States has elected a new president, the Warriors blew a 3-1 lead in the NBA Finals, and the Cleveland Browns have won 4 total games.

For fun, let's look at the top (non-PPR) fantasy performers the final week that Josh Gordon played in an NFL game:

Quarterback:

1. Russell Wilson - Seahawks - 36.36 points

2. Ryan Tannehill - Dolphins - 29.94 points

3. Colin Kaepernick - 49ers - 27.66 points

Running backs:

1. Marshawn Lynch - Seahawks - 23.30 points

2. Frank Gore - 49ers - 21.80 points

3. Matt Asiata - Vikings - 21.70 points

Wide receivers:

1. Odell Beckham - Giants - 26.80 points

2. Reuben Randle - Giants - 19.20 points

3. Emmanuel Sanders - Broncos - 19.00 points

[Full list here](http://www.nfl.com/photoessays/0ap3000000448596)

Whether Josh Gordon scores 50 points standard or 49 points PPR, it's just great to have him back.

quickonthedrawl,2017-11-28 20:10:45+00:00,"Week 13 D/ST Scoring, 2017","Hello and welcome back!

I hope everybody’s Week 12 went well. This is the home stretch for those of us in a playoff hunt; I’m still in three leagues with a playoff spot up for grabs, and I’m sure most of us still reading here today are either still in the hunt, or looking for an edge to gain in Weeks 14/15/16. That will follow after the rankings.

Week 12 itself was fairly kind, and it marks the sixth week in a row where I would consider the results to be very much in line with the projections. Rank correlation for our model was 0.396, compared to FantasyPros ECR’s result of 0.412. It was the first week since Week 4 where our model was outperformed by ECR, and it was by a fairly slim margin at that.

The biggest culprit was the Cleveland Browns, which was by far the biggest miss of Week 12 (though perhaps not the most impactful miss). The most impactful miss was probably the San Diego Chargers, who kept up their recent run and the Cowboys’ recent struggle with a dominating performance on Thursday afternoon. Otherwise, the model (barely) correctly selected Baltimore over Pittsburgh – small consolation to those who didn’t have the option and went with the Steelers anyway – and also more accurately identified Washington as a streaming option.

Like nearly every week, there were some big hits, some big misses, and a lot of garbage in between. The machine grinds on another week.

**Week 13 D/ST Scoring**

1	12.4	Jacksonville Jaguars

2	11.8	Los Angeles Chargers

3	10.8	Baltimore Ravens

16	8.1	Oakland Raiders

17	8.0	Green Bay Packers

18	7.9	Denver Broncos

19	7.9	Detroit Lions


So many options this week!

1.	Jacksonville and Baltimore remain the cream of the crop for another week. Baltimore has gotten extraordinarily lucky with their schedule, facing a not-so-murderer’s row of backup QBs and garbage offenses. This week might be a little bit tougher, but they get the Lions at home, and Stafford has some injury worries of his own in Week 12. However, I am assuming that he will be fully good to go, and that the Ravens will be a start-worthy option regardless in Week 13. The Jaguars are also at home, and they get the Colts. Both starts are exceedingly obvious for anybody with access to one or the other, with the Jaguars getting the edge if you somehow have both available.
2.	San Diego gets a crack at the Browns at home, so of course they are obvious as well. I would start them in the same order presented above with regard to Jacksonville and Baltimore.
3.	The Steelers disappointed in Week 12, and although they get the Bengals on the road this week, it’s still a slam dunk tier 1 start. I would not overthink this one too much if I had access to the Steelers. The Bengals are still a bad offense, and they should come back down to earth a bit after a romp against Cleveland.
4.	The Rams, also on the road, are probably my least favorite of the ones discussed so far, but the Cardinals are an exploitable offense. This is the kind of game where you’d really wish your D/ST were playing at home, but so it goes. The Cardinals have been the 6th best matchup for opposing D/STs on the season, have conceded eight scores of 9+, and have never conceded fewer than 6 all season long.
5.	Among the top tier, that just leaves the Tennessee Titans. The same lowly titans that are in the bottom 3rd of fantasy D/STs, and the same Titans that gave up roughly 4 million points against the Texans in Week 4. This time, the Texans are running out the inimitable Tom Savage, who has quite possibly the worst resume among current NFL starting QBs. The Titans' defense is pretty bad, the Texans' offense might be worse, and the Titans come in as 1 TD favorites at home. Streamers probably cannot do better, but let’s see what other choices they may have just in case.
6.	The Chicago Bears are probably the best pivot if you don’t trust the Titans. The 49ers have not been as kind to opposing D/STs as you might think, entering the week as just the 13th best matchup for opposing D/STs before adjusting for strength of schedule. They have not officially named a starting QB as far as I am aware, but should finalize something within the next 24 hours or so. Either way, the Bears are probably a great streamer. They are the 10th highest scoring D/ST on the season so far, with six scores of 9+ and a nice stretch of 69 points in four consecutive weeks from 5-8. The game is at home, Vegas has the scoring total low and the Bears slightly favored. Not great, but certainly good enough. We do not have enough of a sample size of Beathard and Garoppolo to accurate parse the difference between them, so I would not recommend spending too much effort in trying.
7.	Philadelphia has been lights out on both sides of the ball lately, and they should probably be considered up near Jacksonville as being too good to let go. Get away from them this week if you can due to playing on the road (as road favorites in Seattle!), but not for anything extreme. They are an every week starter for most teams that have access to them, as needed.
8.	New Orleans was the other midseason darling, but they have not really kept up their pace. Losing their top two CBs for last week made things more difficult than they probably should have been otherwise, and if that changes in Week 13, they can be started with a little more excitement. Otherwise, the matchup is OK, they are playing in the Superdome, and they should probably be started in most 12-team leagues. I would not rush to the waiver wire to grab them though. So while ""Who Dat"" has turned more into ""Whoa, Don't"" as far as their D/ST has been concerned, but they still probably have enough talent to justify a look.
9.	Washington does not make the cut for the column, but they deserve a mention here. The Cowboys have been really bad, but this is yet another case where we must separate expectation from results. Were they expected to score 8 points per game over their last three? Should they have been? My own answers are no and no, and I don’t think it’s particularly close. Again, we can ground ourselves with Vegas, which sets their team total at approximately 21 points for Week 13. If you think that Vegas is wrong by multiple TDs, well, I don’t know what to tell you. They haven’t built grand palaces in the desert by being habitually wrong by those kinds of margins. I do not see the Washington football team as being matched up well enough to exploit the Cowboys' recent deficiencies, and this is a great chance to bet on Dallas to show some amount of regression toward a healthier scoring output.
10. Interesting that Dallas themselves rank high enough to consider for streamers. I don't have the fortitude to do so with my own money, but if your waiver wire is dire enough, it might be necessary. Certainly playing at home is a nice plus, and they could be a backup plan for anyone who swings and misses on claims for Tennessee or Chicago.
11. Kansas City might be on the wire in many leagues and should be looked at on the same level as Chicago, at the very least. Their recent offensive disasters have really done a number on their floor and expectations both, and they're playing on the road against a (gasp) capable NYJ offense. Plenty of red flags, but the model likes them even still.

That’s enough for Week 13. Let’s look at future weeks. The strategy is very simple:

•	If you have an every-week starter, which at this point is probably just Jacksonville, stop reading and don’t worry about pairing them with anything. The Jaguars get three consecutive home games and then an away tilt against the 49ers.

•	The Eagles have good enough matchups in Weeks 13, 15, and 16 and only require a pair for Week 14. The Ravens have good enough matchups in Weeks 13, 15, and 16 and only require a pair for Week 14. This means you should not pair them with each other, but both can be a strong main D/ST.

•	So can the Chargers, who have strong matchups in Weeks 13, maybe 14, and 16.

•	Add to that the Steelers, who have strong matchups in Weeks 13, 14, and 16 and only require a pair for Week 15.

**Week 14**

Packers (@ CLE)

Kansas City (v OAK)

Texans  (v SF)

Bills (v IND)

Bears (@ CIN)

Cardinals (v TEN)

Patriots (@ MIA)

**Week 15**

Vikings (v CIN)

Lions (v CHI)

Panthers (v GB)

Saints (v NYJ)

Falcons (@ TB)

**Week 16**

Vikings (@ GB)

Patriots (v BUF)

Bears (v CLE)

Lions (@ CIN)

Panthers (v TB)

Washington (v DEN)

Cardinals (v NYG)

Basic strategery:

1.	Start with Week 14 and make sure you have that covered. As you can see, none of the options listed above double up in Weeks 14 and 15, so you’ll have to pair unless you have a strong multi-week option available also.
2.	Once you have Week 14 covered, cover Week 15. Forget Week 16 if you have to, or grab a 14/15 option that is usable in Week 16 in a pinch. Chicago is great for that. Minnesota is too. Panthers as well. Same with the Lions. There are a lot more 15/16 teams than there are 14/16 teams, so keep that in mind when choosing.
3.	And that’s literally it. The list above is not comprehensive, and I might have missed something obvious or sneaky. If you see an option that plays at home against a decent matchup, don’t worry if I didn’t list them. Feel confident that they’re probably a reasonable choice.

And with that, I think we can conclude Week 13’s preview. Yet again, it will be a busy week for me, and hopefully the last one for a long time. After 12 years off and on at two universities, two community colleges, and across three different states, I’m finally finishing up my last week of coursework. I'm excited to level up from math student to underemployed mathematician, but I have to get through these last few exams first.

As always, if you see users in the comments with questions you feel confident answering, please pay it forward and help out. Someone will hopefully have your own back covered when you need help as well.

Best of luck in Week 13! ",fantasyfootball,1316

Dronelisk,2017-11-22 10:43:54+00:00,Tutorial: How to set up a simple proxy server for $5 a month to bypass any internet throttling/censoring. [x-post from /r/kotakuinaction],"Greetings,

With the as of late moral panic over net neutrality, I thought it was time to share with you some tried and true tips from a foreigner living in china and how to access the entire internet at full speed under the Great Firewall.

###You will need:

* $5 a month for this example, prices may vary from provider to provider, but usually a $5 VPS grants you a monthly 1000GB of traffic.

* [Shadowsocks-R](https://github.com/shadowsocksrr/shadowsocksr-csharp/releases) proxy client

* [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/) SSH client

###STEP 1: Sign up for a VPS provider

For this example I use [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/). They provide $5 a month VPS at various locations, which should help you pick one that allows you to bypass any censoring/throttling.

Using the hostnames below, send a ping command to each server to check the latency to your location. Remember to turn off any existing VPN connections, because we want to check the latency between our ISP and the Vultr servers:

Location|Hostname
:--|:--
Tokyo, Japan|hnd-jp-ping.vultr.com
Singapore|sgp-ping.vultr.com
Silicon Valley, California|sjo-ca-us-ping.vultr.com
Los Angeles, California|lax-ca-us-ping.vultr.com
Seattle, Washington|wa-us-ping.vultr.com
Frankfurt, DE|fra-de-ping.vultr.com
Amsterdam, NL|ams-nl-ping.vultr.com
Paris, France|par-fr-ping.vultr.com
London, UK|lon-gb-ping.vultr.com
New York (NJ)|nj-us-ping.vultr.com
Chicago, Illinois|il-us-ping.vultr.com
Atlanta, Georgia|ga-us-ping.vultr.com
Miami, Florida|fl-us-ping.vultr.com
Dallas, Texas|tx-us-ping.vultr.com
Sydney, Australia|syd-au-ping.vultr.com

**Look at the packet loss and average ping time for each server and choose the best one, or choose a few of them.**

I am going try a Tokyo server (14% packet loss, 122ms average ping) and a Los Angeles server (1% packet loss, 179ms average ping).

To avoid confusion, I will just show the instructions for setting up 1 of the servers, although I am actually doing both at the same time.

The first step is to go to [Vultr and create an account](https://www.vultr.com/) if you don't already have one. You will need to fund your account with a minimum $5 deposit using PayPal or verify a valid credit card.

Once your account is funded/verified then you can deploy a new instance (VPS).

1. **Choose your location.** [Image](https://imgur.com/Oaozpdb.jpg)

2. **Choose the server type (OS). For this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu 14.04 x64.** [Image](https://imgur.com/aosJ0lc.jpg)

3. **Choose the server size** [image](https://imgur.com/Isu1FGB.jpg)

4. **Set a hostname if you want and press on deploy now** [Image](https://imgur.com/SNVMmpU.jpg)

Wait until your VPS is finished installing and the status changes to ""Running"". Then, click on the server to open the server details.

**We will need the IP address and password to log into our server by SSH.** [Image](https://imgur.com/j3i5tlH.jpg)

I am using Windows, so I have downloaded [Putty.](http://www.putty.org/)

If you are using Putty for Windows, enter the IP address of your Vultr server and press open to connect to it. Leave all of the settings as default. You can save the session so you don't need to enter the IP address next time, I saved the settings as ""Vultr Tokyo"".

[Image](https://imgur.com/0pK6Dgv.jpg)

Accept the security warning and then login as root and enter the password from the Vultr server management page.

Tip - To paste text from the clipboard using Putty, simply press the right mouse button once and whatever is in the clipboard will get pasted. When typing or pasting your password, you won't see anything on the screen. Just press enter after you have typed it or pasted it by single clicking the right mouse button.

###STEP 2: Installing shadowsocks

Now we are logged in, your screen should look like this.

[Image](https://imgur.com/P8vs1IX)

Update and upgrade the machine by entering the command below.

    sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade -y

Any time that you see highlighted text, enter it as a command. I will only show the screenshot for the first command, shown below.

[image](https://imgur.com/h8WTcv6.jpg)

After you enter the command, press enter to execute it.

When executing this first commend, you may get a message that says something like this:

""A new version of configuration file /etc/default/grub is available, but the version installed currently has been locally modified. What do you want to do about modified configuration file grub?""

You can just press enter to keep the default option of using the current one.

Now, let's install shadowsocks on the server. There are many different versions of shadowsocks and many different ways to install them. I am going to install ShadowsocksR (SSR) using an installation script from GitHub user teddysun.

Enter the following 3 commands to download the run the SSR installation script.

    wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teddysun/shadowsocks_install/master/shadowsocksR.sh

    chmod +x shadowsocksR.sh

    ./shadowsocksR.sh 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee shadowsocksR.log

Enter the parameters that you want to use for your server. Here is what I am using for this tutorial. You change these settings later if you want.

Password: testing, Port: 443 , cipher: chacha20 [IMAGE](https://imgur.com/nlTQAKt.jpg)

protocol: origin, obfs: http_simple_compatible [IMAGE](https://imgur.com/6nw4oZ0.jpg)

After you enter all of the settings, press any key to start the installation. It will take about 5 minutes.

The server is already running, you can download a shadowsocks client and try it now.

###STEP 3: Test your proxy server:

The original version is called Shadowsocks (SS). ShadowsocksR (SSR) is a newer version that supports obfuscation, which can make your shadowsocks traffic look more like regular https web traffic. This can prevent your speed from getting throttled by your network or ISP.

The server that we just made is compatible with both SS and SSR clients (if you chose the same parameters as me when creating your server).

All of the clients are a little bit different, but basically you need to enter the following settings (assuming you chose the same options as me).

Server - The IP address of your server
Port - 443
Password - whatever you specified
Encryption - chacha20
Protocol - origin (this option is only available for SSR clients)
Obfs - http_simple for obfuscation or plain for no obfuscation (this option is only available in SSR clients)

This is how my SSR client settings looks like:

[IMAGE](https://imgur.com/ojfrdxM.jpg)

**Using the SSR Windows client:**

Enable the proxy by choosing Mode --&gt; Global or Mode --&gt; PAC. Disable the proxy by choosing Mode --&gt; disable system proxy.

If you are using the original SS client:

Enable or disable the system proxy by toggling the option Enable system proxy. The mode (PAC or Global) has it's own setting under Mode --&gt; Global or Mode --&gt; PAC.

TIP - Make sure you remember to disable the system proxy before you exit the client or shut down your computer. Otherwise, you will find that you have no internet at all. To solve this problem, just open the shadowsocks client and disable the system proxy.",pcmasterrace,2380

StopSirActionGrinch,2017-11-18 15:30:06+00:00,Official announcement from the teams of Midas Mode,"We, the participating Midas Mode organizations and players of Evil Geniuses, Immortals, Mid or Feed, Na`Vi, OG, OpTic Gaming, Team Liquid, and VGJ.Storm, have come together this holiday season to take a stand against the tyrannical Grinch going by the name SirActionSlacks. We reject his philosophy of greed, we reject his corrupting mentality of more, and we most definitely reject his lackluster memes! So we are hijacking his tournament for good.

[In all seriousness, we want to thank Slacks and MoonduckTV for being so willing and excited to help us hijack their tournament and its meaning for a bunch of good causes.]

In the spirit of the holidays, the players of all eight teams have pledged to donate all of their prize winnings from Midas Mode to a charity of their team’s choice listed below.  We believe that giving back to our communities is a responsibility we all share in life, and we are inspired by other gaming communities who have long been supporting charity and uplifting others. Having the bright lights of Dota upon us, the time is long overdue that we as a Dota community come together to set an example. Gamers can be a positive force in our communities and this is one small step in the right direction.

We ask that all of our fans join with us and support these and many other great causes this holiday season. Please donate a bit of whatever you have to give to help lift someone else up: money, time, canned goods, or a beloved game gathering dust because you spend twelve hours a day grinding for badges now!

Happy holidays,

The Teams

quickonthedrawl,2017-11-14 16:38:30+00:00,"Week 11 D/ST Scoring, 2017","Hello and welcome back!

Week 10 was a little bit weird, a little bit expected, and as usual, involved a lot of randomness. If you haven't yet come to terms with fantasy football as a mixed game of skill and chance (very heavy on the chance element), well, then I'm not sure what game you've been playing all year! Rank correlation for the column was 0.396, compared to 0.279 for FantasyPros ECR. It has been a kind season overall so far.

Week 11 for me marks the home stretch. This is the final week of byes, so fantasy teams should start looking a little bit less like the walking wounded. It's still a violent sport though, so your mileage may vary. Most importantly, it means that the playoffs are on the horizon. Most leagues go from Weeks 13-16 or 14-16. Some do 15-16. Some people have told me that some fantasy leagues go into Week 17, but I'm pretty sure they're trolling. Either way, it's time to either lock up a playoff spot or play spoiler and crush some dreams. Both are noble goals.

In a bid to save time, I'm hoping this image will suffice instead of the usual chart:

https://imgur.com/a/9Ecxj

And in plain text:

1. Jacksonville Jaguars, 12.5 points (tier 1)
2. Baltimore Ravens, 10.4 (tier 1)
3. Detroit Lions, 10.3 (tier 1)
4. Kansas City Chiefs, 9.9 (tier 1.5)
5. Arizona Cardinals, 9.7 (tier 1.5)
6. New Orleans Saints, 9.5 (tier 1.5)
7. Pittsburgh Steelers, 9.3 (tier 1.5)
8. Los Angeles Chargers, 9.1 (tier 2)
9. Houston Texans, 8.9 (tier 2)
10. Denver Broncos, 8.3 (tier 3)
11. Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 8.3 (tier 3)
12. Seattle Seahawks, 8.2 (tier 3)
13. Green Bay Packers, 8.1 (tier 3)
14. Miami Dolphins, 8.1 (tier 3)
15. Minnesota Vikings, 8.1 (tier 3)
16. Cincinnati Bengals, 8.0 (tier 3)

On bye this week are San Francisco, Indianapolis, New York Jets, and Carolina. The first three are droppable in 100% of formats. The Panthers probably are not, and whether you hold on to them or not depends on your other options and your bench depth.

Please see [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/7bezhj/week_10_dst_scoring_2017/) for playoff pairing recommendations. Notably absent from the list were the LA Rams and the Philadelphia Eagles, and both make solid ROS options. The Eagles might be the best team in football, and the D/ST attached to that is almost always worth a start somewhere. The Rams can claim similarly, although their schedule might get a little tougher going forward.

**Thoughts on Week 11**

* The Broncos finally make an appearance in the startable ranks. Sad that playing the Bengals at home only expects 8.3 points. I do expect them to beat that projection, however that team is a wreck right now. As long as the QB is a liability, just like any strong defense, their D/ST will suffer - and I'm much less certain today than I was last month that the Denver Broncos are actually a strong defense. They probably are, but they have not played like it these past couple of weeks.

* The Texans project similarly, however they do open up the week as home underdogs. That means the Cardinals are road favorites. Both D/STs should have a chance to score well here, but it's definitely less likely that both score well than we get one good score and one landmine. Hope you choose correctly! I would probably lean toward Houston straight up and just start drinking a couple hours early.

* Please be encouraged to hold a second D/ST on your bench for matchups, but remember, it's still a valuable roster spot. Don't pass up a real stash or starter to game out a theorized half point of expectation. In fact, if you can't be sure that you're going to get yourself an extra 0.5-1.0 points or more by stashing your D/ST, you should probably just pass and take the RB or WR instead. I know, it's less fun to have a mid-tier D/ST starting, but really, the equity you're giving up is mostly psychological. Again, check the post last week for recommendations, and we'll probably revisit that after Week 11.

* The Seahawks have some injuries. It sucks. They'll be OK, but temper some expectations. Earl Thomas is probably more important than Richard Sherman, so as long as they get Thomas back, they're going to be a weekly D/ST starter. If not... yuck. Especially on the road. This week is a bad matchup but it's at home, so I'd fire them up across the board anyway.

* Speaking of injuries: Again, most injuries don't matter for D/ST scoring. Period. On the micro level, they're huge - but when aggregating so many players into one starting position, they don't matter. You're better off ignoring injury reports entirely vs relying on them extensively.

* The line I used for LA/Buffalo was LA Chargers -4. To me, being that the line is public and widely available and sitting at this number, it suggests Philip Rivers will clear protocol and start Sunday. If he does not, that sinks the Chargers a bit and raises the Bills a bit, perhaps into starting ranks themselves. We'll cross that bridge if/when we get there.

* Similarly, the line for Houston/Arizona is public, but not widely available. There's some uncertainty with the Cardinals' starter. I don't know that Gabbert is a huge step up/down from Stanton so not going to watch this one as carefully as the Chargers. But keep it in mind if you're considering one of these two teams. It's another reason to lean toward Houston though perhaps.

Sorry for the different format this week. The fantasy season can be a grind, and between 24 leagues and all the normal worldly commitments, this is the part of the season where things start to hit a wall. But here we go! Please continue to step up and answer other users' questions here in the comments, since I'm sure there is a ton that I left out up here and it'll be another busy week.

Thanks for reading, and best of luck in Week 11!",fantasyfootball,1848

&gt;Some people think that free-to-play games and micro-transactions are a pox on gaming. Tens of millions more are playing and loving those games.

&gt;In the past year, we have received thousands of emails and postcards protesting against EA for allowing players to create LGBT characters in our games. This week, we’re seeing posts on conservative web sites urging people to protest our LGBT policy by voting EA the Worst Company in America.

And in one of their previous PR campaigns regarding Dante's Inferno from 2009, they even **admitted** to hiring and staging fake ""religious protesters"" for PR reasons to create fake outrage and drum up some controversy: https://web.archive.org/web/20090615101132/http://www.gamepolitics.com/2009/06/11/faith-based-bloggers-slam-ea-staging-fake-religious-protest-e3
&gt;At GamePolitics reported, about 20 actors carried signs protesting Dante's Inferno on supposed religious grounds. The signs bore messages like ""EA = anti-Christ"" and ""My high score is in Heaven."" Initial coverage by the Los Angeles Times even reported (incorrectly) that the demonstrators came from a church in Ventura County, California.

Don't fall for the ""threats"" and EA being a ""victim"" narrative, it's immaterial and a distraction and used as Deflection from the actual issue, just cut through the bullshit and don't fall for it. It's also Business as Usual for EA.",StarWarsBattlefront,2948

quickonthedrawl,2017-11-07 18:08:01+00:00,"Week 10 D/ST Scoring, 2017","Hello and welcome back!

It's Week 10, which seems fucking ridiculous, doesn't it? The season has been really kind to me so far and I hope it has for you too. Week 9 was another high-scoring D/ST week and another in which rank correlation was high: 0.47 for both our model and the consensus rankings at FantasyPros. It's been a really sweet three-week stretch. Let's hope it continues.

The Bills were the big dud last week. They didn't play well, and they also got very unlucky. Bad combo. Don't beat yourself up too much over it, I think the process was fairly correct. The converse of this was the other big miss on the week was the Jets, who finished 16+ places higher than projected. Washington was the other big miss, beating their projected rank of 22nd and finishing tied for 9th.

The rest of the misses were fairly painless. In all, the average D/ST on MFL scored 8.0 points in Week 9. New Orleans in particular kept up their own torrid pace and have placed themselves squarely in contention for an every-week starter.

________


**Week 10 D/ST Scoring**

Rank | Team | Points | Tier | Notes
:--------: | :-------- | :--------: | :--------: | :--------
1 | Los Angeles Rams | 12.3 | 1 | 
2 | Detroit Lions | 11.5 | 1 | 
3 | Pittsburgh Steelers | 10.8 | 1 | 
4 | Jacksonville Jaguars | 10.7 | 1 |  
5 | Seattle Seahawks | 10.4 | 1 | 
6 | Carolina Panthers | 10.1 | 1.5 |  
7 | Tennessee Titans | 9.7 | 2 |  
8 | Chicago Bears | 9.5 | 2 | 
9 | Minnesota Vikings | 9.2 | 2 |  
10 | New Orleans Saints | 9.1 | 2.5 |  
11 | New York Jets | 9.0 | 2.5 |  
12 | Tampa Bay Buccaneers | 9.0 | 2.5 |  
13 | New England Patriots | 8.7 | 3 |  
14 | San Francisco 49ers | 8.6 | 3 | 
15 | New York Giants | 8.5 | 3 | 
16 | Buffalo Bills | 8.1 | 3.5 |  

Two weeks of byes left. For now: Baltimore, Kansas City, Oakland, Philadelphia. The Raiders can obviously be dropped in all formats. The other three can all be dropped/held depending on your situation I guess? I wouldn't want to pass up on a reasonable WR/RB for a second D/ST ever, but we'll talk playoff pairs later.


**Thoughts on Week 10**

Let's just look forward first. The best D/STs to target that might be off the wire in the next few weeks are:

**Week 11**

Steelers v Titans

Dolphins v Buccaneers

Ravens @ Packers

Saints v Washington

Broncos v Bengals

**Week 12**

Washington v NY Giants

Bengals v Browns

Panthers @ Jets

Steelers v Packers

Eagles v Bears

Falcons v Buccaneers

**Week 13**

Bears v 49ers

Steelers @ Bengals

Chargers v Browns

Saints v Panthers

Broncos @ Dolphins

Titans v Texans

**Week 14**

Texans v 49ers

Bills v Colts

Broncos v Jets

Steelers v Ravens

Bengals v Bears

Bears v Bengals

**Week 15**

Ravens @ Browns

Vikings v Bengals

Saints v Jets

Bills v Dolphins

Washington v Cardinals

**Week 16**

Ravens v Colts

Steelers @ Texans

Vikings @ Packers

Bears v Browns

Cardinals v NY Giants

Washington v Broncos

(I'm sure I missed a ton)

Whew. That's a start. That obviously exempts the true every-week starters like Jacksonville and Seattle. Judging by the above, I'd consider the most value D/STs to be:

Jacksonville, Seattle, Baltimore, and Pittsburgh. The Chiefs probably fit here too. The Vikings might. The Saints probably do. Each of them are good D/STs, have scored well YTD (especially in good matchups), and probably have enough upside to consider them a starter-quality choice in most weeks.

* Jacksonville - do not pair

* Seattle - do not pair, or target Ravens/Vikings/Washington

* Baltimore - do not pair, or target any of the Week 14 options

* Pittsburgh - target any of the Week 15 options

* Kansas City - do not pair

* Minnesota - target Steelers/Bears/Texans?

* New Orleans - target Steelers/Broncos

* Denver should probably be started in most leagues in most weeks. I just don't know that I'd want to be the one to do it. They can be ignored this week though but might make a good pairing with anything.

* Having a main D/ST (New Orleans, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, et al) and streaming your pair is also viable. Don't stress about it. Even a great choice vs a mediocre choice in a given week might only be worth 1-1.5 points of expectation. Not huge. Not enough to pass up on a strong RB/WR that could be worth easily 2-3x that much in a single week! So don't overdo it.

* Likewise, having 3+ D/STs is really never necessary. Really try and find a better plan.

* Wondering about an option I didn't mention? It's easy. Look at their schedule. Write down the weeks that make you go ""Ughhhh"" - then write down the teams that have good matchups during those weeks. Same as before - good defenses, home games, playing against worse teams, bad offenses, and/or rookie/backup QBs. See which options you have to cover for you and if any of them can cover multiple weeks.

That's it! Super easy.

Not a ton to say about Week 10 right now unfortunately otherwise. I'm going to have to defer to the projections this time, since I've spent that time I have today going over ROS and playoff options.

**Best of luck in Week 10!**

quickonthedrawl,2017-10-31 14:48:48+00:00,"Week 9 D/ST Scoring, 2017","Hello and welcome back!

It almost feels like we've gone through this all before, but Week 8 was a very strong week for D/STs once again. They averaged 10.0 points per game! The seven top tier options from last week scored an enormous 15.3 points per game, followed by
10.7 points per game from the second tier, and very few plays backfired for streamers.

The biggest misses were the Bears (projected 26th, finished 11th), New Orleans (projected 1st, finished 15th), and Miami (projected 12th, finished 24th). Overall rank correlation was 0.563, compared with 0.479 for FantasyPros' ECR. It has been a very kind season.

________


**Week 9 D/ST Scoring**

Rank | Team | Points | Tier | Notes
:--------: | :-------- | :--------: | :--------: | :--------
1 | Jacksonville Jaguars | 12.6 | 1 | v CIN
2 | Buffalo Bills | 12.0 | 1 | @ NYJ
3 | Houston Texans | 11.3 | 1 | v IND
4 | Los Angeles Rams | 10.6 | 1.5 |  @ NYG
5 | Philadelphia Eagles | 10.4 | 1.5 | v DEN
6 | Seattle Seahawks | 9.9 | 2 |  v WAS
7 | Arizona Cardinals | 9.7 | 12 |  @ SF
8 | New Orleans Saints | 9.4 | 2 | v TB
9 | San Francisco 49ers | 9.4 | 2 |  v ARI
10 | Detroit Lions | 8.9 | 3 |  @ GB
11 | Tennessee Titans | 8.7 | 3 |  v BAL (no public line yet)
12 | Green Bay Packers | 8.6 | 3 |  v DET
13 | Baltimore Ravens | 8.3 | 3 |  @ TEN (no public line yet)
14 | Dallas Cowboys | 8.0 | 3.5 | v KC
15 | Carolina Panthers | 7.7 | 3.5 | v ATL
16 | Cincinnati Bengals | 7.2 | 4 |  @ JAX

We have one more very tough week of byes: Chicago, Cleveland, Minnesota, Pittsburgh, New England, and the Chargers are all off this week. Any of these can be dropped if needed, with Minnesota and Pittsburgh having value past their byes. Minnesota is on the road at Washington next week while Pittsburgh is at Indy. The Steelers might be worth stashing but as always, ties go to the RB/WR vs the D/ST on your bench.

**Thoughts on Week 9**

* Lots of strong plays this week for streamers and otherwise. New Orleans, Arizona, and SF (!) all should be available in some number in most leagues. I don’t know that I would trust the Niners myself, but I’ve also been proven wrong multiple times this year by being too pessimistic on highly-ranked options.


* KC showed last night that they still have the upside they were drafted for, maybe Denver will be next. They have a very bad matchup this weekend and again next weekend though. I’m glad I don’t have them on any of my own teams because this might be the time to get away from them if you do. It also wouldn’t surprise me if they finished the season within the top ~8 of D/STs. That’s just how the position works. I will say that Osweiler or Lynch is reason enough to drop them if it comes to it. I still feel OK with them as long as Siemian is under center.



* Aside from Dallas (probably safe to say they're a bad start this week), the rest of this list looks really good to my eyes. As always there is a lot of room to shuffle the options around among a same/similar tier. It simple isn't worth stressing over if you find yourself in that situation. Just flip a coin if you really can't decide, otherwise, my recommendation will almost always be to follow the rankings. Look at your options' matchups for next week as a final input/tiebreaker.


* Playoff pairings recommendations will start next week.


That’ll have to be it this week, sorry! Looking like it's going to be the busiest week of the semester so far.


I’ve been updating the projection model [on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/dtlerch) every week on Saturday evening or Sunday morning. It’s also the best place to reach me for questions throughout the week. It’s going to be another busy one for me; my apologies in advance for missing as many questions as I'm sure I will. After Thursday I might be a little more accessible if I miss a question and it's still unsettled.

If you see somebody struggling in the thread and feel like you know what you’re doing, help them out please.


**Best of luck in Week 9!**",fantasyfootball,1332

2017's Week 6 is quite possibly the highest-scoring D/ST week in the last half-decade. It certainly makes the short list if not, and I'd be curious if anybody has a week they remember rivaling it! In MFL Standard scoring, every single D/ST scored 5 points or more, and the week's average was an astounding 11.4 points. For reference, going into the week, D/STs had averaged 8.3 points per game.

Overall, the projection model had a fairly average week, however compared to ECR things went very well. Tier 1 plays scored 22, 24, and 9 points (with Tier 1.5 adding in just 6 and 7 points). Tier 2 fared less well, but it was buoyed by New Orleans incredible 34 point game - 5 sacks, 3 interceptions, 2 fumbles recovered, and 3 (!) touchdowns. We will cover the Saints D/ST in a little more detail later.

The Broncos were the week's obvious disappointment. As I explained to people last week, the projection model can kind of break down on the extreme ends, and Denver was a slam dunk top play against the Giants at home. Unfortunately, sometimes double-digit favorites lose, and that's exactly what happened. Similarly, top streaming options Washington and Atlanta both fell flat.

In all, rank correlation for the projection model was a modest 0.19, compared to just 0.06 for FantasyPros ECR.

On bye this week are just Houston and Detroit. Both can be safely dropped in most/all formats.


**Thoughts on Week 7’s projections**

* Jacksonville is currently leading the league in sacks with 23, interceptions with 10, and they lag behind the lead in fumbles recovered by just 1. Perhaps more importantly, they lead the league in rushing attempts with over 33 per game. Bortles can't Bortle if he's handing off every other snap! This has been significantly mitigating his liability to the team, and it has allowed the Jaguars D/ST to really play above its preseason expectations. It's been incredible to watch. Expect regression (which is virtually always the case with the #1 D/ST through midseason), but they can be fired up without regret in all but one week going forward.

* New Orleans ranks #2. This feels high. But going into the bye, they had clocked in two strong performances with two 4-sack games, and they just throttled the Lions for 34. A word of caution: this game should not have scored that highly - the Saints were the beneficiaries of some really weird bounces, lucky plays, and some sweet, sweet touchdowns. However, this is now three straight games where the Saints have generated a sufficiently powerful pass rush, and they were just gifted with a backup QB in Week 7. Brett Hundley might be good. His weapons certainly are good. But all that said, the spread sits at New Orleans -6 and that suggests that the Packers offense can be exploited.

* The rest of the top tier should be pretty self explanatory. The Seahawks at home against the Giants, the Steelers at home against the Bengals, and the Rams at home against the Cardinals. Three home defenses, three decent defenses, and three terrible opposing offensive lines. Fire them up without regret if you have access. **Edit: as was pointed out, the Seahawks are away. The projection remains the same and this was a cosmetic error only. However, it does skew things slightly for the Seahawks D/ST, but not enough to worry. They're still a great start.**

* The other top tier choice is the Bills, and this one is a little volatile. Right now, there is no public line on the game due to Jameis Winston's uncertain status. I used Buffalo -3 with an over/under of 44 to set this projection. If that line is wrong, the projection will be wrong. [Check back on Twitter later in the week and I will update this (and every other) line to account for mid-week movement](https://twitter.com/dtlerch/status/919421549404356608), like I have the last few weeks.

* Two other games have no public line due to being involved in MNF. I used Jacksonville -3, over/under 38 and Tennessee -6.5 over/under 43 in IND/JAX and CLE/TEN, respectively. As above, check back on Twitter later in the week for updates if you end up on the fence with Tennessee. Jacksonville's line will not matter, they are a top tier play regardless. Speaking of Tennessee, they were a mixed bag against the Colts last night. They got gashed on the ground early and then stiffened up; they mostly kept big plays to a minimum. Game script was weird and I'm not sure we can read too much into the results.

* The Broncos and Chiefs are both still in the top 16, and both still have the same weekly upside that led you to take them way too early in your draft. This year has been a perfect example of why you should never draft a D/ST highly. You took them early, you can't drop them, they haven't been living up to expectations, but they're still projected well enough ROS that you're stuck. Awkward. Live and learn and invest less in your D/ST next year.

* ROS D/STs worth a look beyond the current week: Jacksonville, Denver, Kansas City, Seattle. Seattle and Denver are past their byes, which is sweet. Minnesota is close and might still be there. Baltimore can say the same. Pittsburgh might too. I'm ready to count Arizona out of consideration here until we see changes. The Rams are probably in the same boat too, but they've definitely got the better case. When in doubt, always favor the current week, then the following week, then mostly ignore everything past.

* We are still at least 2 weeks away from having D/ST pairing recommendations for playoff runs. I will not be looking at options until then since I hate encouraging folks to carry two D/STs before they really should be. Focus on bye weeks and RB/WR stashes in the interim, and if you really want to carry a second D/ST, you'll be on your own. Use the same tools as I use here to figure out the best starts - home teams with great defenses, home teams with great matchups, away teams with great defenses, away teams with great matchups, in approximately that order. Easy right? If your team doesn't have a great defense or a great matchup, you should not be stashing them now. Period.

Another week, another week where I have an exam on Tuesday afternoon. I'll be mostly absent from the discussion until later in the day but will do my best to catch up later. Anybody who feels like that have a strong grasp on D/ST scoring should feel encouraged to chime in with their thoughts and help answer questions.

chili con carne, now abbreviated as just 'chili' was was originally simply meat simmered with chili peppers. The addition of beans and tomato sauce came much later. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_con_carne

In Spanish, the word chile from the Nahuatl ""chīlli"" refers to a ""chili pepper"", and carne is Spanish for ""meat"".

A recipe dating back to the 1850s describes dried beef, suet, dried chili peppers and salt, which were pounded together, formed into bricks and left to dry, which could then be boiled in pots on the trail.[2]

The San Antonio Chili Stand, in operation at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago, helped popularize chili by allowing Americans to appreciate its taste

Beans, a staple of Tex-Mex cuisine, have been associated with chili as far back as the early 20th century.[12] The question of whether beans ""belong"" in chili has been a matter of contention among chili cooks for a long time. While it is generally accepted that the earliest chilis did not include beans, proponents of their inclusion contend that chili with beans has a long enough history so as to not be considered ""unauthentic"".

Tomatoes are another ingredient on which opinions differ. Wick Fowler, north Texas newspaperman and inventor of ""Two-Alarm Chili"" (which he later marketed as a ""kit"" of spices), insisted on adding tomato sauce to his chili — one 15-oz. can per three pounds of meat. He also believed that chili should never be eaten freshly cooked but refrigerated overnight to seal in the flavor. Matt Weinstock, a Los Angeles newspaper columnist, once remarked that Fowler's chili ""was reputed to open eighteen sinus cavities unknown to the medical profession.""[16]

quickonthedrawl,2017-10-10 15:27:27+00:00,"Week 6 D/ST Scoring, 2017","Hello and welcome back!

Week 5 was a very interesting one. For a week in which numerous cellar dwellers populated the D/ST projection rankings, the results were actually quite passable. [After accounting for line movements throughout the week](https://twitter.com/dtlerch/status/917052486858498048), the Colts, Jets, 49ers, and Browns all ended up with start-worthy projections. They finished with 3, 11, 7, and 9 points, respectively.

Top tier choices were a little less forgiving. Pittsburgh got trounced, though with the exception of a single 90 yard run by Leonard Fournette, they actually played pretty well. The Chiefs gave up 34 points, 21 of which was in the 4Q with an untouchable lead. The Bills and Eagles played well defensively but didn't pad their D/ST stats enough to satisfy. The Ravens solved that problem by piling on a D/ST TD. The only truly disappointing play at the top was the Detroit Lions, which we will cover in more depth later.

But first:

* What is a projection?

* What is a prediction?

Roughly once per year it becomes clear that the fantasy community treats two words as the exact same thing, when in reality they mean two very different things. My apologies if we end up in the weeds.

Think of a D/ST score as a random variable. In this case, let's use a 12-sided die (a D12). Our sample space consists of the 12 discrete numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12. The probability of each roll is simply 1/12. The outcomes are uniformly distributed, so it makes things super easy: if a roll of a D12 models our D/ST's score, then:

1. We're in trouble, and

2. Our expectation is 6.5 points.

We **expect** 6.5 points, but your **guess** (read: prediction) is as good as mine, or your cat's, or another D12. If you predict them to get 12 points, you will be wrong with probability 11/12. If you predict them to get 9+ points, you will be wrong with probability 2/3. This should all be fairly obvious.

D/ST scores, thankfully, aren't uniformly distributed. They’re also not normally distributed, but I don’t think that distinction matters for now.

What *does* matter is the distinction between a projection and a prediction. You can *project* a team to score X points, and you can *predict* a team to beat their projection for a variety of reasons. But when you make predictions like that, you will have to reckon with being wrong far more often than being right. Relying on predictions is a recipe for disappointment over the long term. Relying on projections is not.

And of course, not all projections are created equally. My D/ST model has had a number of successful years, and after two weeks of 2017, we appeared headed for another. In the three weeks since, it has been more of a struggle, but thankfully (I guess?) the struggle has been virtually universal. Both the column's rankings and FantasyPros rankings clocked in with a rank correlation of 0.15 in Week 5.

With yet another week of data available and 2016 entirely purged from the sample, let's see what we can expect going forward.

**Thoughts on Week 6’s projections**

1. The Jacksonville Jaguars defense is very good (not all that surprising), but their offense has been limiting its mistakes. The fewer times Blake Bortles throws, the better their D/ST will be, and Bortles has averaged just 27 attempts per game so far. This is excellent news, and it is enough to officially bump the D/ST up out of the streaming ranks if you had not already. As discussed the last couple of weeks, they have been on the cusp: clearly good enough at home and in good matchups, and sketchy on the road or in bad matchups. With a strong road showing against the Steelers (who, as it turns out, might just be bad), they deserve the benefit of our doubt. And for fun, courtesy of [Scott Barrett at PFF: opponents have been better off spiking the ball instead of targeting Ramsey and Bouye](https://twitter.com/ScottBarrettDFB/status/917205037956292608).

2. There are not many other D/STs that can claim to transcend streaming. The short list is Denver, Kansas City, Seattle, and the aforementioned Jacksonville. Denver is now past their bye, and Seattle will be next week; that is huge. As we saw in Week 5, even in mediocre matchups, these are the types of D/STs that have enough weekly upside to justify a start in every single week. I know the projection model may not agree, and in those cases, ignore it.

3. That leaves a ton of defenses that look good when they're at home, bad when they're on the road, and end up being very matchup dependent. Baltimore, Arizona, Minnesota, Houston, Detroit, Philadelphia, Buffalo, et al. In deeper leagues, these can be clung to a little more tightly. In shallower leagues (8- or 10-team), they can be dropped and streamed as needed. In a 12-team league you'll have to use your intuition and figure out when it's worth dropping them. A very loose rule of thumb: If you can drop them and expect &gt; 1 point of added value in the current week, go ahead. If you're dropping them to gain &lt; 0.5 point of added value, hold them. If it's anything in between, the decision is probably pretty marginal to begin with, so don't stress about it too much.

4. If you have a defense that's not listed above: congratulations, you're streaming. You probably already knew this. Just play the matchups every week, do your best to pick something good, and hold on for the ride. You'll make some ""mistakes"" - in quotes because, if you use a solid process to choose the best option, you can't be making a mistake. It doesn't matter how much they score.

5. This week should present a bit less variance compared to the last 2-3, given that so many more good D/STs are at home right now. In Weeks 3 and 4, the best options tended to be on the road. In Week 5, we saw the rise of the cellar dwellers and some of the top options face unpopular matchups. In Week 6, we have a goldmine of good D/STs at home against bad offenses. Baltimore, Jacksonville, Houston, Washington, Denver, Atlanta, and Tennessee are ranked one-through-seven and all are at home.

6. On Detroit: they faced a confluence of events on Sunday. Mostly, I still don't think that they're *that* good. They are a solid defense, they have a couple of stud players, but they are certainly not as good as Denver or Kansas City. Without a consistent strong pass rush, they will continue to rely on turnovers to generate D/ST scoring. Turnovers are notoriously inconsistent, notoriously unreliable, and put Lions D/ST backers in a bad spot going forward. They will not have the upside in bad matchups to justify, nor will they have enough upside in the good matchups to hold through the bad ones. I considered Week 5 a freeroll: backers lost, and so it's probably time to move on until after the bye week. Weeks 10-14 have enough value to keep them in your peripheral vision, but not enough (IMO) to hold between now and then. There is a nonzero chance that the Lions are still good enough going forward, and that Carolina is just a bad matchup now; I respect that possibility, but I would bet against it. If anything, the Panthers are good and the Lions are mediocre-but-above-average, and I would hesitate to move too far off the latter assumption.

7. The average D/ST in Week 5 scored 9.1 MFL points, which is a full point per game more than they had averaged in Weeks 1-5. Take the gifts where you can, but unfortunately, a rising tide lifts your opponents' boats too. But, while the variance in the week was higher than normal, the results were satisfactory for most folks.

8. Streamers should look at Washington, Atlanta, and Tennessee, in approximately that order. With so many home teams projecting highly in Week 6, there is a wealth of options for streamers.

9. A lot of people ask every week about which defenses pair well with each other ROS. I try not to answer that this early, because I do not like to encourage bad strategy. In most normal leagues (probably 95% of readers or more), carrying two D/STs right now is a mistake, with the notable exception of a stud D/ST on bye. Teams have bye week woes, injury woes, bad team woes, woe is me woes, etc. Use those bench spots for RBs and WRs even if your starting lineup looks stacked. Getting next week's hot wire add the week before for free is a much better strategy than eking out an extra tenth of a point of expectation per week by carrying two D/STs. Once we get closer to the end of the season, we can discuss D/ST pairs in depth.

I've got an exam to attend to early today, and then I'll do my best to clear up as many good questions as I can find afterward. Thank you all for your time, and for reading every week.

#Introduction


On October 6th, 2007, the Stanford Cardinal entered its fifth game of the season against the USC Trojans with a 1-3 record. Few people gave the Cardinal any chance against the #1 team in the country (#1 in Coaches Poll, #2 in AP Poll). They were coming off a dismal 1-11 season. In their 3 games against (ranked) Pac-10 teams so far that season they had been outscored 141-51. They had a first-year head coach. And as if the odds weren't already stack against them enough, the Sunday before the game their starting QB, TC Ostrander, suffered a seizure and would be unavailable to play; so sophomore QB Tavita Pritchard would make his first collegiate start...on the road...in the Los Angeles Coliseum...against the #1 USC Trojans. 

**Vegas pegged Stanford as a 41-point underdog.** But every dog has its day. And that day – October 6th, 2007 – belonged to the Stanford Cardinal.

#The Key Characters

Looking back on this game, you'll recognize a lot of familiar faces. Here are just a few of the key characters from that game:

**USC**

* **Pete Carroll** - USC's Head Football Coach. Entering the 2007 season (his seventh as HC), Carroll had led the Trojans to five Pac-10 titles, two national titles (2003 AP, 2004 AP/Coaches/BCS), and a national title game appearance (2005). Carroll would leave USC after the 2009 season and become the head coach of the Seattle Seahawks, eventually leading them to two Super Bowl appearances and a Super Bowl title. Carroll is now in his 8th season as head coach of the Seattle Seahawks.

* **Steve Sarkisian** - USC's Offensive Coordinator and Quarterbacks Coach. This was Sarkisian's sixth season with USC (and Pete Carroll). Sarkisian would later become the head coach of the Washington Huskies in 2009 and then return to USC as head coach in 2014. He was fired from USC midway through the 2015 season. He took over offensive coordinator duties for Alabama in the 2017 National Championship Game (which they lost to Clemson) after serving as an offensive analyst throughout the season. He is currently the Offensive Coordinator for Atlanta Falcons.

* **Todd McNair** - USC's Runningbacks Coach. This was McNair's fourth season with USC. The NCAA would later target McNair as part of its probe into the [Reggie Bush scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California_athletics_scandal). McNair has since sued the NCAA and the case is ongoing.

* **John David Booty** - Starting QB. Booty broke his finger sometime during the game (second quarter?) but remained in the game. He threw four interceptions including a pick six, one that set up Stanford's game-winning drive, and one that sealed Stanford's victory.

* **Mark Sanchez** - Backup QB. He was sitting on the sidelines while Booty was throwing interceptions with a broken finger. Sanchez would start the next three games while Booty was out with a broken finger. The following season, Sanchez led the Trojans to their sixth straight Pac-12 title and a Rose Bowl win against Penn State. Sanchez would be drafted 5th overall by the New York Jets in the 2009 NFL Draft. The ""Sanchize"" led the Jets to two AFC Championship Games. Since his 5-year stint with the Jets he has become a NFL journeyman, playing for the Eagles,  Broncos, Cowboys, and Bears.

* **USC's NFL Linebacking Corps** - USC's linebacking corps in this game featured future 1st/2nd round draft picks Clay Matthews, Rey Maualuga, Keith Rivers, and Brian Cushing.

**Stanford**

* **Jim Harbaugh** - Head Football Coach. Harbaugh completely changed the culture surrounding Stanford football and resurrected the program from the ashes of a 1-11 season. This game would be the marquee win of the Harbaugh era, leading to a huge improvement in winning recruiting battles...and, more importantly, football games. After the 2010 season (in which Stanford finished 12-1 and won the Orange Bowl), Harbaugh left to become the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers. Today, Harbaugh is the head coach of the Michigan Wolverines (because Jed York is an idiot).

* **David Shaw** - Offense Coordinator. Shaw would later succeed Harbaugh as head coach when he left after the 2010 season to become the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers.

* **TC Ostrander** - Starting QB. On Sunday, September 30th, 2007, [Ostrander suffered a seizure while out to lunch in Palo Alto with his family and WR Evan Moore's family](http://www.mercurynews.com/2007/10/02/ostrander-sidelined-for-week-after-seizure/). Due to the seizure, Ostrander would not play in the game against USC.

* **Tavita Pritchard** - Backup QB. After Ostrander's seizure, Pritchard took over the reigns at QB. He made his first collegiate start against USC...not a bad first start. Today, he is the Kevin M. Hogan Quarterbacks Coach at Stanford (yes...we endowed the title of our Quarterbacks Coach).

* **Richard Sherman** - WR. Sherman was a WR at Stanford his first three seasons (2006-2008) before transitioning to cornerback before the 2009 season. Sherman converted a 4th and 20 on the game-winning drive with a catch that went for ~20.2 yards and set Stanford up with a 1st and goal with a little over a minute left in the game. Sherman would later be drafted by Pete Carroll and the Seahawks in the 5th round of the 2010 NFL Draft. Sherman would eventually become one of the top CBs in the NFL and (at one point) was the highest paid CB.

* **Mark Bradford** - WR. Bradford did not practice with the football team for much of the week as he was in Los Angeles with his family following the death of his father. In a ""this is so unbelievable I would reject this movie script"" moment, Bradford caught the last-minute, game-winning touchdown in his hometown to defeat the #1 team in the country. [Bradford dedicated the game to his late father, Mark Sr.](http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2007/10/07/bradford-dedicates-game-to-late-father/)

#The Game

The first half saw USC put up only 9 points, while Stanford's offense put up none. But it was Stanford's defense that really kept them in the game (they recorded 5 turnovers). A goal-line stop at the end of the first half on 4th and goal from the 1 was the big momentum turn. Three minutes into the second half Austin Yancey intercepted one of Booty's passes and returned it for a TD, cutting USC's lead to 2. USC and Stanford then traded TD drives at the end of the 3rd quarter/beginning of the fourth quarter to bring the score to 16-14. With 11 minutes left, a 46-yard TD pass from Booty to Ronald Johnson put USC up 23-14.

With 5:43 left in the game, Stanford kicker Derek Belch cut USC's lead to 6. With three minutes left, Booty overthrew his receiver and the ball landed in the waiting hands of Wopamo Osaisai. Tavita Pritchard then marched Stanford down the field for the game-winning TD pass to Mark Bradford. Another Booty interception thrown to Bo McNally sealed the victory for the Cardinal.

**Key Plays**

* **USC's Blocked PAT** - The 1-point difference in the final score was due to a PAT that Stanford blocked midway through the second quarter that kept the USC lead to only 9-0. 

* **[Stanford's Goal Line Stand (start at 39:29 mark of video)](https://youtu.be/zjvNzj7TobM?t=2369)** -  With only a couple of minutes remaining in the first half, USC had a first and goal at Stanford 9-yard line, leading 9-0. USC ran the ball on second, third, and fourth downs but was unable to punch it in. The biggest moment came when Stanford stopped USC on a 4th and goal from the 1-yard line with 11 seconds left in the first half.

* **[Austin Yancy's Pick Six (start at 39:41 mark of video)](https://youtu.be/zjvNzj7TobM?t=2381)** - Three minutes into the second half, John David Booty threw the first of his four interceptions to Austin Yancy, who returned the ball 31 yards for the TD.

* **[John David Booty's Third Interception (start at 40:20 mark of video)](https://youtu.be/zjvNzj7TobM?t=2420)** - With three minutes left in the game, John David Booty throws his third interception of the game to Wopamo Osaisai, who returns it to the USC 45-yard line, setting up Stanford's game-winning TD drive.

* **[Richard Sherman's 4th and 20 Conversion (start at 7:57 mark of video)](https://youtu.be/zjvNzj7TobM?t=477)** - With 1:39 left on the clock, on 4th and 20 from the USC 29-yard line, Tavita Pritchard throws a pass directly over the middle to Richard Sherman, who completes an amazing 20-yard catch that makes it just inches across the line to gain.

* **[Mark Bradford's 4th and Goal Game-Winning TD Catch (start at 18:35 mark of video)](https://youtu.be/zjvNzj7TobM?t=1115)** - With 0:49 left on the clock, on 4th and goal from the USC 10-yard line, Tavita Pritchard lobs a fade to the left corner of the end zone (the exact same play that was run on third down to Evan Moore). Mark Bradford pulls it in, toe taps, and scores the game-winning TD. The excited Versus announcer is so surprised he screams ""Touchdown USC!""

**[The Game-Winning Drive (first 22 minutes of video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvNzj7TobM)**

Booty throws an interception that Stanford returns to the USC 45. Tavita Pritchard then marches Stanford down the field (enduring a handful of penalties and incomplete passes). Richard Sherman and Mark Bradford make two of the most icon catches in Stanford Football history. Plus, lots of peak Harbaugh.

I strongly recommend you [watch the video of the final drive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjvNzj7TobM) (it's the first 22 minutes).

#The Aftermath

**Immediate Aftermath**

How unexpected was this result? [Well, it was so surprising that a number of Stanford students held an impromptu bonfire in the Main Quad, right in front of Memorial Church.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZppBPlvyiIo) [Here is the cover of the Stanford Daily the Monday after the game.](https://imgur.com/a/POySM) [Stanford Athletics also made this t-shirt.](https://imgur.com/a/E24NP)

This was another in a series of unexpected results during the wild 2007 college football season. College football fans around the country rejoiced when they heard the news of yet another shocking upset. Per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Stanford_vs._USC_football_game#Aftermath):
&gt;The final score was announced at the Rose Bowl, where USC's two arch-rivals, UCLA and Notre Dame, were playing each other. Irish and Bruins fans cheered in unison and celebrated together briefly. At the same time, at Tiger Stadium, the #1 LSU Tigers were playing the #9 Florida Gators and the fans in the stadium celebrated when the USC score was announced there, too. The Tigers would later come from behind to beat the Gators 28–24, making them #1 in both polls with USC dropping from #1 in the coaches poll due to the loss.

USC finished the season with a Pac-10 title (shared with Arizona State) and won the 2008 Rose Bowl against an overmatched Illinois team, but this loss ultimately knocked USC out of the national title game. This shocking upset paved the way for LSU to get into the 2008 National Championship Game and beat Ohio State 38-24, becoming the only 2-loss national champion of the BCS/CFP era.

**Long-term Aftermath**

If there is one game to point to and say this is when the Stanford Football Renaissance began, this is **THAT** game. The incredible upset validated Harbaugh’s boastful claim that ”We bow to no man. We bow to no program here at Stanford University.” If not for this victory, Harbaugh may not have been able to recruit the players (e.g. Andrew Luck, David DeCastro, Coby Fleener, Zach Ertz) that would become the foundation of the unprecedented success of the last decade of Stanford football. Needless to say, we hold this game very dear to our hearts.

Here is a comparison of Stanford Football in the decade before October 6th, 2007 and the decade since:

Stat | Decade Before | Decade Since
:-: | :-: | :-:
Record | 43-69 (0.384) | 95-37 (0.720)
Record against USC | 3-7 (0.300) | 8-4 (0.666)
Record against Rivals (USC, Cal, ND) | 10-19 (0.345) | 22-10 (0.688)
Conference Record | 30-52 (0.366) | 65-25 (0.722)
10+ Win Seasons | 0 | 6
Conference Titles | 1 | 3
Bowls | 2 (0 wins) | 8 (5 wins)
Major (BCS/NY6) Bowls | 1 (0 wins) | 5 (3 wins)
Rose Bowls | 1 (0 wins) | 3 (2 wins)
Heisman Finalists | 0 | 4 (4 runners-up :/)

This game also revived the USC-Stanford rivalry (which dates back to 1905), which had become very...lopsided in recent years. Since 2007, USC-Stanford has become must-watch television, producing instant classics like 2010 (Stanford defeats USC on a walk-off FG), 2011 (Stanford defeats USC in 3OT), 2012 (Stanford defeats #2 USC 21-14), 2013 (USC defeats Stanford on last-minute FG). Stanford has always hated USC, but in the last decade Stanford has (finally) given USC a reason to hate Stanford, posting an 8-4 record against the Trojans.

#A New Record

For almost ten years, Stanford overcoming a 41-point spread stood as the largest upset in college football history. However, in week 1 of this season, [the FCS Howard Bison (led by Cam Newton's younger brother, Caylin) defeated the UNLV rebels 43-40](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dc-sports-bog/wp/2017/09/03/howard-and-caylin-newton-stun-unlv-in-one-of-the-biggest-upsets-in-college-football-history/?utm_term=.962588571655), overcoming a 45-point spread and taking over the record for the largest upset (by point spread) in college football history. 

Now, Stanford's 2007 upset of USC stands as the largest upset *between two FBS teams*.

Week 4 was a return to normalcy in the NFL, in that it was still extremely random but with some semblance of order. And to drive home that randomness, again we saw a number of Vegas underdogs win outright: Carolina, Los Angeles, Detroit, Houston, Buffalo, New York, and Philadelphia all won their games. It’s actually somewhat remarkable that D/STs did as well as they did in that context, coming through with results that are mostly par for the course. Rank correlation for the Week 4 rankings was 0.27 and lagged behind FantasyPros ECR’s 0.37.

Top tier plays in particular paid off. The Cowboys were terrible (or the Rams were good?), but Arizona, Jacksonville, Cincinnati, Seattle, and Kansas City all paid dividends. The tier as a whole averaged 11 points, even considering the negative Cowboys score. The second tier was full of landmines however. The Ravens disappointed *again*, the Titans conceded the most points in Houston Texans team history, and both New England and Tampa Bay fell way short as well.

Which of these are fit for another try, and which of them are steaming hot garbage? Let’s first look at the Week 5 projections.

________


**Week 5 D/ST Scoring**

Rank | Team | Points | Tier | Notes
:--------: | :-------- | :--------: | :--------: | :--------
1 | Pittsburgh Steelers | 10.4 | 1 |  v JAX
2 | Buffalo Bills | 10.3 | 1 |  @ CIN
3 | Philadelphia Eagles | 10.1 | 1 |  v ARI
4 | Detroit Lions | 10.0 | 1 |  v CAR
5 | Baltimore Ravens | 9.8 | 2 |  @ OAK
6 | Kansas City Chiefs | 9.8 | 2 |  @ HOU
7 | Cleveland Browns | 9.6 | 2 | v NYJ
8 | Tennessee Titans | 9.3 | 2 |  @ MIA
9 | New York Jets | 8.8 | 3 |  @ CLE
10 | Indianapolis Colts | 8.7 | 3 |  v SF
11 | Cincinnati Bengals | 8.6 | 3 |  v BUF
12 | Houston Texans | 8.3 | 3.5 |  v KC
13 | San Francisco 49ers | 8.2 | 3.5 |  @ IND
14 | Minnesota Vikings | 8.1 | 3.5 |  @ CHI
15 | Oakland Raiders | 8.1 | 3.5 |  v BAL
16 | Los Angeles Rams | 7.8 | 4 |  v SEA

On bye this week are the Saints, Falcons, Broncos, and Washington. The Broncos should be kept in virtually all formats despite being just the 15th highest-scoring D/ST to start the season. They are too good to drop and have upside in basically every week. The other three can be dropped easily.

**Thoughts on Week 5’s projections**

What. The. Fuck. Is. Going. On?

Just going down the list: The Bills? Browns? Jets? Colts? 49ers? These are not good teams. These are not good defenses, at least as we conceptualized them going into the season. Nor do I think they are particularly good defenses today, but they do have something important: They have good matchups. And for their own part, the Bills might actually be a good team (slim chance, but I’m saying there’s a chance). How do we even begin parsing all of this?

•	The Steelers are a clear top tier play, and there is no doubt about this. In choosing Baltimore over Pittsburgh last week (for both the week and going forward), I may have backed the wrong horse. I don’t think they have done enough to jump out of the streaming pool, but they have done more than enough to play at home against the Jaguars. To be fair, the Jaguars have played very, very well so far offensively. They have only conceded 3 sacks so far in 2017, best in the league (I know, right?). Bortles has thrown fewer interceptions than games played (I fucking know, *right?*). Still though, the Steelers are 8.5 point favorites at home and the game has a Vegas total of just 44. Fire up the Steelers with confidence.

•	Let’s talk briefly about that Jaguars defense then. They were bailed out last week by a D/ST TD in what should have been a great matchup. Their rushing defense is a complete liability right now, but they have a great pass rush and a great secondary. This means that they will be extremely good plays at home and against bad teams, and sketchy plays on the road going forward. Are they better than streaming? I don’t think so, at least not appreciably so, and certainly not enough to suffer through alternating bad/good matchups. It might be worth suffering through a bad one if it buys you 2-3 good ones. Luckily for their backers, they have far more good matchups remaining than bad ones, and so might end up starting by default for most GMs.

•	Trust the Ravens, nevermore? I can’t trust them but I can’t get away from them yet. Backup QBs are D/ST goldmines, and E.J. Manuel is one of the best. The game is on the road (bleh) against a good (?) offense (bleh bleh), but Manuel himself is enough to cancel out all of that. They’re not a great start, but they’re also not bad, and getting through this game gives you vs CHI, @ MIN, vs MIA, and @ TEN before they go to Lambeau. That’s probably enough to keep them out of the streaming pile for another month.

•	Defenses that right now I trust more than streaming: Kansas City, Denver, Seattle. Period. Then we still have a large group of teams that are nipping at their heels, and that are probably better than streaming but not quite matchup proof. Those are Arizona, Jacksonville, Minnesota, and then perhaps a half dozen others that will vary a ton week-to-week (as some pass great matchups or enter into terrible ones, and/or pass their bye weeks). If you do not have one of those top options – it’s simply not worth stressing over dropping your D/ST if you can pick up something you feel good about in the immediate week.

•	Seattle and LA have a Vegas total of 47, and the Seahawks are underdogs on the road. Off the top of my head, this is the highest-scoring profile I can remember in this matchup for years, and it’s a sign to avoid this game on both sides. However, backers of Seattle (as mentioned above) can probably just eat the bad matchup and start them anyway. Backers of the Rams should proceed with caution.

•	Buffalo get a road game as underdogs and still churn out a top tier ranking. I don’t know that I believe it. The Bengals are really bad, and the Vegas total is just 39; but everything else about this game profiles negatively. Streamers take notice but I would not jump off an option you can otherwise stomach in order to grab them.

•	Briefly on KC: They’re on the road. Deshaun Watson is pretty dreamy. Start them anyway.

•	There is no public line yet for Oakland/Baltimore, Chicago/Minnesota, and Miami/Tennessee due to QB injuries. Last week, [I pushed an update to the rankings to Twitter to account for line movements on the week](https://twitter.com/dtlerch/status/914326599851528192), and will do so again this week.

•	Speaking of Minnesota, they too get a backup QB. I’m less excited about this spot than I otherwise would have been, but they should still be fired up across the board. The Bears have a very good offensive line and have shown a willingness to avoid throwing the ball; I don’t know that it’s enough to cap the Vikings’ upside here, especially given that the game is at home.

•	The Lions show up well here. This is a great week for backers to take a freeroll of sorts, similar to that of Jacksonville last week. Their scoring profile has not been sustainable (4 fumble recoveries and two TDs), but they’ve also been the top-scoring D/ST in MFL Standard. To throw some cold water on that, they have games at New Orleans, then a bye, then at Green Bay in three of their next four weeks, so this might be the last time to start them for a while. They should be started in 100% of leagues this week, but also probably dropped in a majority of them afterward.

Lots of options for streamers this week, so here’s hoping you pick correctly. Make good choices and that’s all that counts. As always, I’ll do my best this week to field the most interesting, difficult, and common questions in the thread below.

Thank you, as always, for reading. And I would like to extend my sincerest gratitude for the response last week. There were some disappointing reads, and some foul garbage in my PMs, but the kind and thoughtful words easily outnumbered them 10 to 1. Thank you.

Many of us also care about the story, which is why we beseech you to insert the Grimoire. You know this to be true, because you know many of us are only here *for* the story. You've said it yourself.

Because of this, your focus on trying to balance the PvP meta and push the team mindset, has only served to harm the things we appreciated about Destiny 1; things like the varied weapon perks that made replaying the same material over and over, somewhat exciting. 

Even so, the RNG grind, just to meet the standards of PvP, only serves to alienate your player base. You want us to have a competitive mode? Fine. I love Survival. But give us that choice. Bring back 6 player match making. Make e-sports an *option* if you want it so badly, but don't force it on those of us who don't want it at all.

EDIT: To clarify, I never said PvP *is* an E-Sport. I said Bungie *wants* it to be. To elaborate on that, you can see interviews like this (this is just one example), https://youtu.be/H7a1iKiWHGs?t=811 , where Mark Noseworthy clearly states Bungie wants PvP to be both watchable and competitive; two key components for a coherent and easy to comprehend match, which is obviously what you want for those who watch E-Sports

EDIT 2: I keep seeing this mention of lack of no private matches or no dedicated servers and no 60fps as a reason to say E-Sports would never happen, but this is the first month of Destiny. The player base numbers are inflated. Game Developers don't implement that sort of thing until they know the real stats, because you know, it costs money. Not to mention, all of that stuff can be done on their new platform, PC. I mean really, why do you think they partnered with Blizzard, who are intending to open their own esports stadium in LA?

&gt; FOREWORD 
&gt; 
&gt; BY HUGH M. HEFNER 
&gt; 
&gt; Shel Silverstein was one of the most creative individuals I've ever known. 
&gt; His contributions to Playboy are legendary — and, as you can see in this book, 
&gt; his work stands the test of time. Shel was a true Renaissance man. He was 
&gt; a person of multiple talents that went beyond the art and humor I initially 
&gt; saw in him. Shel began his career as a cartoonist, but he went on to greater 
&gt; glory. He became an author of bestselling children's books, a songwriter, 
&gt; poet and playwright. He became our house humorist. And, most important 
&gt; to me, he became a confidant and one of my closest friends. 
&gt; 
&gt; I remember well the first time I met him. It was in Chicago in 1956. A 
&gt; veteran who had just returned to the States from military duty in Japan, 
&gt; he had heard word about a new, upstart magazine named Playboy. He 
&gt; decided to take his drawings to the Playboy office at 11 East Superior. He 
&gt; left a portfolio of his drawings with my secretary, but I didn't get around 
&gt; to looking at it right away. After a couple of weeks Shel came back to the 
&gt; office and demanded his cartoons back. He didn't think we were going 
&gt; to buy any of them. I asked him to wait while I looked them over. I went 
&gt; through his portfolio — there were maybe fifteen drawings in it — and I took 
&gt; out eight and put them on my desk. ""Let's see, what's that?"" I asked him. 
&gt; ""Five hundred, six hundred dollars?"" Shel nodded his head. ""I suppose you 
&gt; could use it now,"" I said. ""Yeah,"" he said. So I took out a checkbook from my 
&gt; desk and wrote Shel a check. I sensed some uncertainty on his part. Maybe 
&gt; it was because I needed a shave and was wearing my pajamas. Shel didn't 
&gt; think the magazine was going to last or that the check would even clear. It 
&gt; was quarter to five on a Friday afternoon and the banks were closed. Shel 
&gt; took off in disbelief, found a currency exchange someplace, and cashed 
&gt; the check right away. We always got a kick about that in later years. How 
&gt; implausible it all seems now. 
&gt; 
&gt; Everything begins with Shel's travels. I think it was through the work 
&gt; you'll see in this volume that he started to define himself. He wasn't sure 
&gt; about what he wanted to do with his life. He knew he wanted to revisit 
&gt; Japan, and I asked him to send back drawings from the trip, and to include 
&gt; himself as a character in them. I envisioned something along the lines of the 
&gt; travel letters Ernest Hemingway submitted to Esquire — a sort of personal diary 
&gt; that would be dispatched from around the globe. Shel was uncomfortable in 
&gt; that role. He didn't want to include himself, but I persisted. And I'm glad I 
&gt; did. What we got back in those drawings was narrative storytelling of a very 
&gt; personal manner. We saw Shel establish himself as a character. 
&gt; 
&gt; What is clear in those cartoons is Shel's humanity. During the Cold War, 
&gt; he went into the belly of the beast, traveling to Red Square in Moscow. 
&gt; Right from the beginning Shel established a rapport with people wherever 
&gt; he went. 
&gt; 
&gt; In some cases, what artists do on paper has nothing to do with their 
&gt; personal lives. But that's not the case with Shel. He was Uncle Shelby. He 
&gt; was the dreamer. He was his work. What comes through in the drawings 
&gt; is from the heart. What you'll see here is the expression of a great talent 
&gt; and a great friend.

Sweggeh,2017-09-28 08:32:11+00:00,"WON: The WWE the next day after the BC Invasion parody sent a threatening legal action for intellectual property violations, with damages of up to $150,000 per item, any profits made on those items as well as legal fees.","Full article:

A Bullet Club parody of the 1998 DX invasion of Nitro, done on 9/25 before the Raw tapings in Ontario, CA, at first seemed like a harmless publicity stunt, but someone wasn’t laughing.

After producing an episode of “Being the Elite,” built around the segment, in an amazing irony, the WWE fired off a legal letter claiming that the Young Bucks were using their intellectual property, in particular the “too sweet” hand gesture, and sent off a cease and desist letter.

Since then, the Young Bucks have removed all references to “too sweet” from T-shirts that they are selling through their own YoungBucksMerch.com site and the ProWrestlingTees.com. The shirts that were being sold at Hot Topic, which make up the majority of their sales, didn’t include any references to “too sweet” or drawings of the hand gesture that WWE is claiming ownership of based on purchasing the intellectual property of WCW, where the NWO first used it in 1996.

Interestingly the WWE never registered ownership of the drawing of the “Kliq hand gesture” (which they actually took from the NWO and rival WCW, which did it first, but that’s the term used when registering it), until 2015. WWE had never used it for years and it had become a regular part of New Japan Pro Wrestling with the Bullet Club years ago, when Prince Devitt (Finn Balor) started the club with his heel turn before he came to WWE. The Young Bucks started marketing it in 2013. However, getting into a legal fight over it would be costly.

The story behind this was The Young Bucks, Hangman Page, Marty Scurll, Cody and Brandi Rhodes were all in Southern California after working weekend shows in Las Vegas.

They decided to do a public signing at a Hot Topic store in a mall in Ontario which was near the Citizens Bank Arena, where Raw was being filmed. It wasn’t even teased until the night before, and never advertised, but through social media they brought it up that day so there was a fan base that showed up, and ended up coming to the arena with them, with the idea of filming it for their “Being the Elite” YouTube show.

The funny part of this is they had been doing a storyline for weeks, spurred on by two things, the first being that Cody is not allowed to use the name Rhodes since the WWE claims it as their property (in reality he has tried to keep good relations with WWE since his goal is to write a book about his father and WWE owns the marketing rights to the Dusty Rhodes name), but more The Young Bucks had gotten a cease &amp; desist letter recently from the owners of the Rick &amp; Morty show on Comedy Central since they had produced a Rick &amp; Morty parody T-shirt, based on the idea that Rick &amp; Morty were the hottest selling T-shirt at Hot Topic and they were No. 2.

In recent weeks, on their YouTube show, they basically did the Kevin Sullivan/Chris Benoit thing where they came up with a storyline that turned into reality. In their fictitious world, there was a mysterious WWE stooge who would contact Cody and suddenly through magic, reference to terms like “Too Sweet” and “Fuck the Revival” which they had used regularly were mysteriously edited off the show and when they tried to say them, mysteriously they couldn’t. That haunted them to the point where this expanded to the idea that Marty Scurll couldn’t use the umbrella gimmick he popularized with the idea that Jack Gallagher had stolen the idea. More recently, the storyline was that while they were all together, suddenly Page was gone with the idea that WWE had kidnapped Page. In the final show that aired before the Death Before Dishonor PPV, Page was shown having been kidnapped with his mouth duct taped shut, his hands duct taped together and his eyes duct taped open while being forced to watch WWE programming.

So the idea is they were going to Raw to demand that Cody got his name back, that Scurll got his umbrella back and the Young Bucks got their catch phrases back, while Page was looking for retribution for being kidnapped.

Nick Jackson used a loud speaker to say they were coming to get their friends, Luke Gallows, Karl Anderson and Finn Balor (the same thing DX did in the skit WWE has played over-and-over for 19 years), saying they had come to rescue them, which was a parody of what Sean Waltman did regarding Kevin Nash and Scott Hall in the original skit. They even did the thing where they asked fans who were there if they were there to see WWE or Bullet Club like Scott Hall would do, and everyone booed WWE and cheered Bullet Club, which made WWE seem uncool. They even had a fan say he was only there because he got free tickets for the show (WWE doesn’t heavily paper shows these days, and instead just tarps off areas to make it appear full no matter what the attendance is; however at every TV taping, they hire people as seat fillers to make sure seats look full if people don’t come who have tickets or leave seats visible on camera). They made fun of WWE for having to paper the house, which was the one thing on the show that I thought WWE wouldn’t be happy about, because it would be a Raw nerve since they drew 6,000 fans for a major market show, but WWE has also run the market a lot in recent weeks with a PPV the night before in Los Angeles and a Raw two weeks ago at the Honda Center.

The storyline ended when the Young Bucks’ father found the WWE stooge and put him in the trunk of the car. The idea is that the identity shocked and freaked all of them out like it was a friend who had turned on them. The story ended with no identification of the guy, and Scurll, who has secret powers on the show to pause time, then paused time so everyone else was frozen and shot the guy dead saying “Hasta la vista, baby” with a toy gun.

The WWE the next day sent a letter claiming intellectual property violations for their “Too Sweet Journey” DVD, “Too Sweet T-shirts,” photos of The Young Bucks with the “Too sweet symbol” and their “Too Sweet women’s leggings.”

The letter threatened legal action for damages of up to $150,000 per item, any profits made on those items as well as legal fees.",SquaredCircle,1297

For three days we have given you all the opportunity to freely talk about the events of the past week. We appreciate the help that many of you have given to police the community and keep it as decent as possible when considering the topics at hand.

The mod team has agreed that midnight EDT is officially the end of the weekend, and so the end of the threads. We will leave them up as is, and we ask that everyone look at them, honestly and objectively read them, and see as many sides that you can so we can all understand each other a little better, even if we can not or will not agree.

The r/NFL community is a strong mix of people from all walks of life, of every race, creed, gender, orientation; from over 100 countries around the globe. That is what makes us so much more than some random message board. We are a tight night group of fanatics who love football, and love to talk about it.

We will all have a discussion on this, and the other issues of politics and football that we had planned on talking about later this week, even before this situation began to unfold.

Thanks everyone, sincerely. You're our guys (and gals), we are are your guys (and gal).

Cheers,

Over the last 48 hours we have had two previous megathreads after the comments made by President Trump at a rally in Alabama on Friday night.

The first was immediate reaction to the statement. [**It can be found here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/71vp3n/megathread_presidents_comments_on_kneeling_nfl/).

The second was player, owner, NFL League Office and NFL Player's Association reactions to the statement, as well as additional tweets from President Trump. [**It can be found here.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/71ytmn/league_response_megathread/)

At this time, both of those threads are locked, and we ask that continuing discussion be kept here. This includes any highlights of the protests, further player/team/league reactions, your own feelings on the matter, etc.

We all understand that there will be a strong desire to talk about the protests in the individual game threads, but the r/NFL mod team asks everyone here today, and we mean everyone, to respect that fact that there are hundreds -if not thousands- of users who just want to talk about and react to the game on the field. For that reason, we ask all of you to report any comments within the game and postgame threads that are outside of the rules of this subreddit as they stood before this took place.

As we've said the previous two days, this is a huge area where the NFL and politics intersect and this discussion will be allowed to the fullest extent possible. However, we implore you to keep conversation with other users civil, even if you disagree.

We need a canon version of what finally became of those guys. A ruin with corpses would be super lame, and unrealistic. For a breath of fresh air in terms of factions and maximum fun, I firmly believe that they should be one of the major factions.

The way I envision it in my imagination, the high brass of Vault-Tec have mostly survived themselves to this day [through the military ""Leap-X"" life prolonging technology seen in the Nuka-World expansion by Bradberton, for those of you who have played it, except they have been successful in meeting the power demands through their powerful reactors and technological knowledge to preserve more than just the head, possibly even the fully body as originally intended. Or maybe only half successful and their health is failing, and there could be some kind of story about that](/spoiler).

As you explore whichever massive facility they might currently be inhabiting, terminals and logs show the events in all vaults thus far from the perspective of Vault-Tec HQ, still holding back on sending the all-clear instructions for some reason. Maybe they don't think their experiments have run their full course, maybe even communications have been cut off or they're distracted by something else.

At any rate the player throughout the line ends up steering the live progress of Vaults which are still active across the US in the direction he deems fit, whether with approval or behind Vault-Tec's back ( Somewhat reminding of Vault-Tec Workshop DLC, but obviously hopefully much more complex and meaningful in the Fallout 1/2 style ), and in the end, as befitting an area with a magnitude such as the West Coast, having some sort of major impact on the future of the whole Vault project. Something that will resonate in upcoming Fallout games even and create more unique beginnings depending on which ending is canon. Either giving the ""All-clear"" instruction to the Overseers to integrate the Vault Dwellers with the world above, continuing/finalizing the experiments, informing the Overseers that the world above is a mess and enforcing a full administrative lockdown of the doors to preserve life underground, or siding with some kind of ethical insurgency within Vault-Tec itself to tell the Vault Dwellers about the experiments/overthrow the Overseers and let them decide what's next for themselves.

But whatever happens, I think that if anywhere on the West Coast is on the map, then it's definitely the right time to put the National HQ in Los Angeles on the map as well, in Main or Expansion or otherwise, along with the major story arc it deserves. I will also say that the ""Vault Beginnings"" have probably outlived their interest by now, and that to conclude the story of Vault-Tec with a West Coast game, while still retaining the Vaults but with a fresh and different atmosphere in future Fallout games, will probably be the best thing to do.",Fallout,1660

quickonthedrawl,2017-09-19 14:57:26+00:00,"Week 3 D/ST Scoring, 2017","Hello and welcome back!

Last week, with just 15 NFL games total in our 2017 sample, the theme for everybody’s Week 2 preparation should have been “Temper your goddamn expectation!” Sometimes, a great team plays poorly and looks terrible. Sometimes, a terrible team plays well and looks great. Sometimes they both happen in the same game!

And just to muddle the mixture even more, sometimes a good team can become bad (and vice versa). Be honest, who among us had the Jacksonville Jaguars as D/ST stud going into Week 1? But then after they demolished the Houston Texans, who among us had them as a top option? Followers of this column would have been skeptical before Week 1 and skeptical again before Week 2, and before having run the numbers for Week 3, I would expect that to continue.

This brings us back to a key point with D/ST projections, and with fantasy football projections in general. If you have a prior expectation, and you have a good reason to anchor that expectation at a certain point, it should necessarily take a decent amount of data before you're willing to come too far off of that prior expectation (in either direction, both higher and lower). Did you have the Jaguars as the 24th best D/ST before the season started? Then you probably shouldn’t have had them as the 2nd best D/ST before Week 2 started.

Unfortunately, that means we are going to miss out on some options that we would have gotten had we jumped the gun and bought in early. Conversely, we will be paying far less when we swing and miss on the remainder of them. It evens out, and in the end, I think we come out ahead.

Overall, Week 2 was very kind to D/ST scoring. In fact, with a correlation coefficient of 0.49, the results were about as good as a D/ST projection model can expect. For reference, FantasyPros’ ECR scored 0.38, suggesting that it was just a good week in general for the position. Last week’s Tier 1/1.5 plays – seven in all – averaged 11.9 points.

That means we’ve gotten two strong weeks in a row, and while there’s no such thing as being “due” for a letdown, don’t be surprised when it finally comes.

Please refer back [to Week 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/6y0l2c/week_1_dst_scoring_2017/) if you have questions about the scoring settings or the methodology.

**2017 Week 3!**


Rank | Team | Points | Tier | Notes
:--------: | :-------- | :--------: | :--------: | :--------
1 | Baltimore Ravens | 11.8 | 1 |  @ JAX
2 | New England Patriots | 10.4 | 1 |  v HOU
3 | Miami Dolphins | 9.7 | 1.5 |  @ NYJ
4 | Tampa Bay Buccaneers | 9.7 | 1.5 |  @ MIN (assumes Bradford OUT)
5 | Green Bay Packers | 9.7 | 1.5 |  v CIN
6 | Philadelphia Eagles | 9.5 | 1.5 |  v NYG
7 | Pittsburgh Steelers | 9.4 | 1.5 | @ CHI
8 | Indianapolis Colts | 9.3 | 2 |  v CLE
9 | Los Angeles Rams | 9.1 | 2 |  @ SF
10 | Denver Broncos | 9.0 | 2 |  @ BUF
11 | Kansas City Chiefs | 8.9 | 2 |  @ LAC
12 | San Francisco 49ers | 8.8 | 2 |  v LAR
13 | Carolina Panthers | 8.8 | 2 |  v NO
14 | Dallas Cowboys | 8.7 | 2 |  @ ARI
15 | Cleveland Browns | 8.7 | 2 |  @ IND
16 | Tennessee Titans | 8.2 | 3 |  v SEA
17 | Buffalo Bills | 8.2 | 3 |  v DEN

Everything below can be considered unstartable in Week 2 except in very deep leagues. That includes the Seattle Seahawks (6.9), Jacksonville Jaguars (7.8), Minnesota Vikings (6.7), Arizona Cardinals (6.5) and others. When in doubt, it's almost always safe to drop a D/ST instead of a position player to stream or stash something more important. When dealing with a D/ST like Seattle with significant residual value expected past the current week, it is always viable to start them in a bad matchup.

**Brief thoughts**

* Can we dispense with the “Jacksonville is a top tier D/ST” trope for now? D/STs attached to a bad offense are rarely worth chasing, and turnover-prone offenses are somehow even worse. If Bortles and the Jaguars ever figure that part out, then I’ll pay attention.

* The Ravens, however, continue to look the part of a top tier D/ST. I personally think they’re for real, but their schedule also has (potentially) masked some of their deficiencies. Real tests await them but not this week. Temper expectations slightly, however. With 8 interceptions through 2 games, their pace is skewing the projection model slightly. 2016 still makes up a significant part of the sample, but the Ravens are certainly not *that* good. They’re very good though.

* So much for the Cleveland Browns “improved” pass blocking. Through two games, the Browns have conceded 10 sacks, worse even than last year’s 4.1 per game. The only team worse through two games has been the Houston Texans who, after allowing 10 sacks in their one game against Jacksonville, allowed just 3 at Cincinnati.

* The Seahawks, Cardinals, and Vikings are on notice. They have gone from “probably better than streaming” to “maybe better than streaming” and all three need to get their offenses under control before they can be started with confidence. Whether to drop them or not has more to do with your league and available options than any hard and fast rule.

* That would leave just the Broncos, Ravens, and Chiefs as 100% holds through bad matchups, at least for now (along with some # of the aforementioned SEA/ARI/MIN trio). The Panthers, Rams, and Buccaneers are probably capable of getting into the conversation, but they’re not quite there yet.

* For streamers, look toward New England, Miami, or Green Bay before digging deeper. Indianapolis rates highly enough but I worry it’s a small sample size trap (cute DFS play though?).

* Note that the Tampa/Minnesota game has not been made public with sportsbooks due to Bradford’s status. This projection can change in a hurry through the week and I will update the post to reflect it when it does.

* Lots of road games this week. Of 15 games with public lines, 10 of them have a road favorite. My instinct suggests we’ll have a very frustrating week in general with D/ST scoring.

I think that’s enough for now. We’re now more than 12% of the way through the fantasy season, and perhaps 15% of the way through most regular season schedules. Blink and you’ll miss it.

Best of luck in Week 3! As always, I’ll do my best to address the most interesting and most common questions in the thread below. If your question does not get answered, please ctrl+F and see if it’s answered elsewhere. If something does seem to get buried, I’m always happy to field questions and talk football [on Twitter here](http://www.twitter.com/dtlerch/).

They met in college four years ago and my husband disapproved from the beginning.

My husband had never thought of himself as a racist. However, through dialogue, I was able to reach him and point out his flaws when it comes to race. After my husband admitted to his clandestine bigotry, he promised to work on it and said he would do his utmost do repair the relationship with our daughter, and her fiance. 

Gosh, they are now inseperable. They have so many things in common. A weekend doesn't go by without meeting just the two of them, doing ""guy stuff"" (going as far as my daughter's fiance teaching my husband how to play videogames). They place wagers on who will win a match on a basketball or soccer videogame. They're always laughing and mocking one another.

My future SIL parents' died when he was 7.  He grew up all alone as an orphan. He had such an horrific childhood and his strength and resilience never ceases to amaze me. With that, I feel it's important for myself and my husband to be his older generation support. I'm so proud of the strides my husband has made. I really am - in the last four years, I couldn't envisage him bonding with our daughter's fiance in this manner. They are inseparable these days.

And our daughter is now beginning to trust him again. They have always been close and it broke my heart to see how they drifted apart in the last few years. My daughter now jokes that her father is trying to steal her fiance from her. 

Just wanted to write that racism is dumb - the only thing that stopped my husband from reaching out to our daughter's fiance was because he has more melanin in his skin. 

Oh and I'm going to be a grandmother by this time next year!!!! I am so happy and am counting the seconds. My husband and my daughter's fiance both love basketball. My husband is a Boston Celtics fan. My future SIL is a Los Angeles Lakers fan. Two teams that really hate one another. When we found out they were pregnant, my husband bought a baby Celtics uniform. The look on my future SIL's face was hilarious.",Parenting,1268

I sent a picture to my property manager and she said she was concerned it might be termites. She said she'd call a terminator to set up an inspection.

She then called me back and told me I had to be at my apartment during a three hour window she set up with the terminator in order to let them in the apartment and she would not be present for the inspection. I told her I can't just miss a three hour window of work to wait around for a terminator. She said the terminator can't give any less than a three hour window and they are only available during business hours during the week -- so there would be no time we would be able to reschedule when I am not at work. She finally agreed to meet the terminator this time, but she made it clear that in the future if there are any repairs or anything needed to the apartment that I have to make myself available to let the individual into my apartment. 

My question: is it legal to require me to be present for repairs? I'm especially wondering if this termite inspection indicates there are in fact termites, and there are follow up visits from the terminator required , am I going to have to be present for those visits?

Football in Week 1 was strange. It was a strong week for some folks and disastrous for others; after all, football is a violent sport, and violent sports lead to violent injuries. If you found yourself on the receiving end of one of more painful ones, it's time to dig deep and do your best to recover. Sometimes there will be nothing you can do, and that's just how it goes.

D/STs are more forgiving. While individual defensive players can be injured throughout the season (and very often do!), D/ST scoring typically moves right along past each of them. The position aggregates the performance of 11 players at a time, and so very few players actually matter when it comes to D/ST scoring. The stud interior lineman? Irrelevant. The middle linebacker? Irrelevant. The shutdown corner? Irrelevant.

Mostly.

While each player lost does have some effect, it tends to be marginal enough to ignore. Would the Rams have scored more points with Aaron Donald? Maybe, but clearly they were still OK without him. Would the Jaguars have notched fewer than 10 sacks if Duane Brown had played? Probably, but he alone can't have been to blame. The lesson here is to focus on the matchup and the defense in aggregate, not look too hard for specifics. It actually makes things easier!

In Week 1, multiple strong projections came through with strong scores. My favorite play for the week, the LA Rams, finished with 28 MFL points. Across the top two tiers, the six teams averaged a stellar 12.7 points, although backers of Houston and Denver probably regret their choices. Unfortunately, that's part of the position.

Overall, rank correlation for Week 1 was 0.33 - relatively average overall compared to the last couple of seasons, but extraordinarily good for Week 1. Unfortunately, FantasyPros changed their site such that I cannot find a full list of their Week 1 D/ST ECR; if anybody has it, I'd be happy to run te correlation for them as well. I would expect it to be similarly strong.

Please refer back [to Week 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/6y0l2c/week_1_dst_scoring_2017/) if you have questions about the scoring settings or the methodology.

**Edit: The Giants/Lions line is public, and it's much lower than I thought it would be. The NYG D/ST now projects to score 8.6 points and jumps to #11 overall. The Lions D/ST jumps to 6.9 points and 18th overall.**

Everything below can be considered unstartable in Week 2 except in very deep leagues. That includes the New England Patriots (6.5), Jacksonville Jaguars (6.9), and others. When in doubt, it's almost always safe to drop a D/ST instead of a position player to stream or stash something more important.

**Brief thoughts**

* Many more home teams than road teams at the top of the list this week. This is by design, and should be expected to continue more often than not. Again, favor home teams over road teams when all else is equal (just as you should favor favorites over underdogs when all else is equal).

* I try my best to control for sample size issues in the early weeks, but somethings will be difficult. Jacksonville got 10 sacks in Week 1. Pittsburgh got 7 sacks. Conversely, Houston and Cleveland conceded 10 and 7 sacks, respectively. These extreme performances will taint the sample slightly for perhaps 4-6 weeks. Use extra caution when backing a team (or fading a team) with an extreme performance in their recent history.

* Indianapolis might not start Tolzien in Week 2. Sad day. But the roster is still putrid, and they're still a fade going forward.

* New England looked terrible and that is concerning. But they're still a good team until proven otherwise, so do not panic. Similarly with Seattle and Denver in particular, their D/STs should be fine going forward. Both passed the eye test this weekend. While New England is rated as unstartable, they probably should be kept and started anyway (yeah, awkward, I know).

* Houston is concerning. Their offense was a huge liability on Sunday, and it was one of the worst games of ""professional"" football I've ever seen. If you're going to get away from them this season, the time is now. Two consecutive road games at Cincinnati and then at New England, and their next start-worthy game might not be until they host Cleveland in Week 6. No gracias.

* Tier 1 and 1.5 extend fairly far this week. Lots of good choices. Don't stress yourself out too much if you have multiple options within the same tier; chances are, the decision matters a lot less than you think it might. Focus your waiver attention on other positions if you find yourself in that boat.

* Oakland, Seattle, and Baltimore are my favorite options this week otherwise, in no particular order.

* The Rams are worth holding onto this week for an OK matchup at home, but temper expectations and do not shy away from continuing to stream if you are so inclined. Much more difficult to back the Jaguars going forward but they can be similarly justified. Theirs is a slightly worse matchup, but also (tentatively?) at home.

* As of early Tuesday morning, the public line on Denver/Dallas is not sharp enough to rely on, and there is no public total for the Giants/Lions. Tread carefully with both until we get better data.

As always, I'll do my best to field questions all week long. If you worry something got lost in the muck here, a reminder that I do try to keep a close on [my Twitter page](http://www.twitter.com/dtlerch) for fantasy questions also. The Reddit inbox does not handle these threads particularly well on Tuesdays or Wednesdays.

There is a lot of material here and reading through it will take you a bit of time. If your boss catches you it could get you in trouble, as it's hard to imagine that this won't be a distraction from you job. 

Besides the reading factor alone however, there is a substantive amount to contrast between each individual, and much to meditate on. These differences extend beyond merely career, education, upbringing, etc and broach upon the very Weltanschauung of these men. If you operate heavy machinery, you may find yourself distracted when pondering said differences somewhat extensively, and this could be diverting enough to actually put you in danger if your mind begins to wander at work. Please for your own safety, leave this thread until you get home. It's an absorbing topic, but your wellbeing is of higher priority. 

A basic cursory outlook at the mini bios of these two immediately presents us with 187 distinct differences, however, these may be simply ""cosmetic"" so to speak, and appear as the same differences that either individual would have with any other person. I believe upon further investigation and inquiry, many more will become apparent. 

From Armstrong's Wikipedia:

For other people named Neil Armstrong, see Neil Armstrong (disambiguation).
Neil Alden Armstrong (August 5, 1930 – August 25, 2012) was an American astronaut, engineer, and the first person to walk on the Moon. He was also an aerospace engineer, naval aviator, test pilot, and university professor. Before becoming an astronaut, Armstrong was an officer in the U.S. Navy and served in the Korean War. After the war, he earned his bachelor's degree at Purdue University and served as a test pilot at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station, where he logged over 900 flights. He later completed graduate studies at the University of Southern California.

A participant in the U.S. Air Force's Man in Space Soonest and X-20 Dyna-Soar human spaceflight programs, Armstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in 1962. He made his first space flight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966, becoming NASA's first civilian astronaut to fly in space. He performed the first docking of two spacecraft, with pilot David Scott. This mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his reentry control fuel to prevent a dangerous spin caused by a stuck thruster, in the first in-flight space emergency.

Armstrong's second and last spaceflight was as commander of Apollo 11, the first manned Moon landing mission in July 1969. Armstrong and Lunar Module pilot Buzz Aldrin descended to the lunar surface and spent two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command/Service Module. Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon. President Jimmy Carter presented Armstrong the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978. Armstrong and his former crewmates received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2009.

Armstrong died in Cincinnati, Ohio on August 25, 2012, at the age of 82, after complications from coronary artery bypass surgery.

Armstrong was born on August 5, 1930 near Wapakoneta, Ohio, the son of Stephen Koenig Armstrong and Viola Louise Engel. He was of German, Irish, and Scottish ancestry, and had a younger sister, June, and a younger brother, Dean. His father worked as an auditor for the Ohio state government; the family moved around the state repeatedly after Armstrong's birth, living in 20 towns. Armstrong's love for flying grew during this time, having gotten off to an early start when his father took his two-year-old son to the Cleveland Air Races. When he was five, he experienced his first airplane flight in Warren, Ohio on July 20, 1936 when he and his father took a ride in a Ford Trimotor, also known as the ""Tin Goose"".

His father's last move was in 1944, back to Wapakoneta. Armstrong attended Blume High School and took flying lessons at the grassy Wapakoneta airfield. He earned a student flight certificate on his 16th birthday, then soloed later in August; all before he had a driver's license.Armstrong was active in the Boy Scouts and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. As an adult, he was recognized by the Boy Scouts of America with its Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and Silver Buffalo Award. On July 18, 1969, while flying toward the Moon inside the Columbia, Armstrong greeted the Scouts: ""I'd like to say hello to all my fellow Scouts and Scouters at Farragut State Park in Idaho having a National Jamboree there this week; and Apollo 11 would like to send them best wishes"". Houston replied: ""Thank you, Apollo 11. I'm sure that, if they didn't hear that, they'll get the word through the news. Certainly appreciate that."" Among the very few personal items that Neil Armstrong carried with him to the Moon and back was a World Scout Badge.

In 1947, at age 17, Armstrong began studying aeronautical engineering at Purdue University. He was the second person in his family to attend college. He was also accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The only engineer he knew (who had attended MIT) dissuaded him from attending, telling Armstrong that it was not necessary to go all the way to Cambridge, Massachusetts, for a good education.

His college tuition was paid for under the Holloway Plan. Successful applicants committed to two years of study, followed by two years of flight training and one year of service in the U.S. Navy as an aviator, then completion of the final two years of their bachelor's degree. Candidates had to promise to not marry until graduation, signed the ""Aviation Guarantee"" to serve on Active Duty for at least four years, and would not receive a promotion to Ensign until two years after they received their Midshipman's warrant.

From Jackson's Wikipedia:

""The eighth child of the Jackson family, Michael made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson He began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records. In the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music. His music videos, including those of ""Beat It"", ""Billie Jean"", and ""Thriller"" from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. The popularity of these videos helped bring the television channel MTV to fame. Jackson's 1987 album Bad spawned the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"", ""Bad"", ""The Way You Make Me Feel"", ""Man in the Mirror"", and ""Dirty Diana"", becoming the first album to have five number-one singles in the nation. He continued to innovate with videos such as ""Black or White"" and ""Scream"" throughout the 1990s, and forged a reputation as a touring solo artist. Through stage and video performances, Jackson popularized a number of complicated dance techniques, such as the robot and the moonwalk, to which he gave the name. His distinctive sound and style has influenced numerous artists of various music genres.

Thriller is the best-selling album of all time, with estimated sales of 65 million copies worldwide. Jackson's other albums, including Off the Wall (1979), Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), and HIStory (1995), also rank among the world's best-selling albums. He is one of the few artists to have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, and was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Dance Hall of Fame as the only dancer from pop and rock music. His other achievements include multiple Guinness World Records including the Most Successful Entertainer of All Time,13 Grammy Awards, the Grammy Legend Award, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, 26 American Music Awards—more than any other artist—including the ""Artist of the Century"" and ""Artist of the 1980s"", 13 number-one singles in the United States during his solo career—more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era—and estimated sales of over 350 million records worldwide.""Jackson won hundreds of awards, making him the most awarded recording artist in the history of popular music.He became the first artist in history to have a top ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades when ""Love Never Felt So Good"" reached number nine on May 21, 2014.Jackson traveled the world attending events honoring his humanitarianism, and, in 2000, the Guinness World Records recognized him for supporting 39 charities, more than any other entertainer.

Aspects of Jackson's personal life, including his changing appearance, personal relationships, and behavior, generated controversy. In 1993, he was accused of child sexual abuse, but the civil case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount and no formal charges were brought. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges after the jury found him not guilty on all counts. While preparing for his comeback concert series, This Is It, Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest. The Los Angeles County Coroner ruled his death a homicide, and his personal physician, Conrad Murray, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Jackson's death triggered a global outpouring of grief, and a live broadcast of his public memorial service was viewed around the world. Forbes ranks Jackson the top-earning dead celebrity, with earnings of $825 million in 2016, the highest yearly amount ever recorded by the publication.Jackson is also remembered for his generous philanthropy and his pioneering efforts in charitable fundraising within the entertainment industry.

I look forward to the discussion.

I love in Los Angeles, which is (I'm gonna guess) one of the larger cities for dreamers. Some of my best friends are dreamers. Both my ex, and my current SO are dreamers (though they're not both from Mexico). They are legitimately some of the best people I've ever had the pleasure to meet and hang out with, and are also some of the most patriotic people I've ever met.

So fuck Trump. Fuck this whole anti DACA thing. I guarantee you these people have never even met an immigrant, much less an illegal one. 

For Christs sake, most of these people are *younger than 17*! To argue that it's somehow their fault that their parents immigrated illegally - when they were *FIVE* - is fucking bullshit.

LAFD,2017-09-05 01:37:52+00:00,Can Firefighters Ask You a La Tuna Fire Favor?,"/r/LosAngeles, 

Can we ask a huge La Tuna Fire favor?

There are rumors that Los Angeles Firefighters are in need of donated food or supplies, such as blankets, toothpaste or soap following recent wildfires.

Nothing could be further from the truth.

We're honored to be your Fire Department, and plan extensively to support those who proudly protect you, making sure they always have or can easily get all they need to remain battle ready.

You trust the men and women of LAFD to protect you at life's most difficult times. Please also trust us when we say that should we ever have a functional need, we would never hesitate to ask!

We deeply sense your appreciation, and want you to know that nothing could mean more to us than seeing you and your family safely in front of your undamaged home. Your smile, a friendly wave or a simple hand-scrawled ""Thank You"" sign means more than words could ever describe.

Sadly, we're not only emotionally overwhelmed with your profound kindness following the La Tuna Fire, but logistically as well.

Your LAFD crews purposely prepare for extended deployment, and to return to their stations to find 600 unsolicited gallons of bottled water (that's a 5,000 lbs surprise we have to move and cannot safely store on site), or 200 cubic feet of perishable food we can't refrigerate, is something that touches our heart, but quickly becomes an unmanageable task that takes us away from caring for you - or each other.

So... if you encounter someone telling you to bring badly needed items to a Los Angeles Fire Station, please direct them to this message. We're touched to the point of tears by your kindness, but truly are not in need of anything more than a wave or a smile. If that should change, we pledge to let you know.

Thank you for allowing us to serve!

Respectfully Yours in Safety and Service,

Brian Humphrey
Firefighter/Specialist
Public Service Officer
Los Angeles Fire Department

NOTE: If giving is part of your DNA and truly unavoidable (we do understand), please consider a random act of kindness to a stranger in our honor, or a small donation to any well established and highly accountable non-profit that touches your heart.

FramedDig50,2017-08-20 21:22:14+00:00,20 steps the Thunder must take to beat the Warriors.,"Step 1: Russell Westbrook signs his super-max extension before the season. 

Step 2: You (the GM of the Thunder in this situation) tell Russ your master plan, which involves not passing to Paul George as much as possible. The only reason you traded for him was to get rid of Oladipo’s contract and use him as a trade piece. 

Step 3: Russell Westbrook literally never passes to George for the first two months. George requests a trade and is eligible since it’s now December.

Step 4: The only team interested in a 5 month rental for George is the Toronto Raptors. They offer you Serge Ibaka and a 2019 first round pick. Deal. (Ibaka is expendable because Valanciunas has expanded his range and now shoots 40% from three)

Step 5: With a cluster of big men, you decide to trade Patrick Patterson for Thabo Sefolosha and a future second round pick. 

Step 6: You play out the season without making any more moves, getting the ninth seed. Surprisingly to the media, Westbrook doesn’t seem to care very much. You enter the lottery with the 14th best odds. Doing this means you get to keep your pick that was previously in possession of Utah.

Step 7: The Warriors win another title. Golden State is happy, Curry is happy, Durant is happy. He just won two rings and two finals MVP.

Step 8: You kidnap Daryl Morey and ship him in a crate to Madagascar. After a few weeks of investigation the conclusion is made that he has taken a secret vacation to the rainforests of the Amazon to research a new advanced stat he developed in the playoff. Nobody knows when he will return.

Step 9: Rockets ownership decides to lay off Morey and hire a new GM. The best candidate? Sam Hinkie. That’s right. What ownership doesn’t know is that Hinkie is still set on showing the world the process can be done. The only way to do this is if he blows up the team and starts fresh. The process is back, and it’s in Houston.

Step 10: Remember those picks you received from your mid-season trades? They’re valuable to someone: Sam Hinkie. He calls you to offer a trade. James Harden for the 2019 Raptors first round pick, 2021 Wizards second round pick (from Jazz), your 2020 first round pick, your 2022 second round pick, and Steven Adams. 

Step 11: Now we enter free agency. In a star studded class with the likes of LeBron James, Chris Paul, Isaiah Thomas, and DeAndre Jordan, you have your eyes set on one player: Kevin Durant. 

Step 12: You go all out for Durant. You make billboards, shirts, everything. You even make Westbrook and Harden publicly promise they’ll wake up at 8:30 to workout with Kevin if he comes back. The fans, intrigued by the thought of a Westbrook-Harden-Durant-Ibaka lineup, are willing to push aside the hate to have him back. 

Step 13: After a crazy week, where Durant visited D.C, Golden State, San Antonio, and Los Angeles, you’re up. As he walks into the office, you get quick to the facts. “Look, Kevin. You’ve been here before. I don’t need to sell you the stadium, fans, or area. Put the ink on the paper and we can win a title.” Durant says he’s close to signing but wants to see that you are here to compete. So you drop the news. “I kidnapped Daryl Morey to have the chance to sign you, Kevin.” After hearing this, Durant is persuaded. He signs with you and hosts a TV show on ESPN where he announces he’s ‘coming home’. He later has to apologize to Wizards fans as he meant he was coming back to his second home in Oklahoma City, and not, in fact, his hometown of Maryland. 

Step 14: You pretty much have everything you need at this point, but you’re missing something. Boom. It hits you. Raymond Felton isn’t good enough to be the backup on a championship contender. You need someone who plays like Westbrook. Someone who doesn’t play defense, doesn’t pass well, and spams pick and rolls as if it’s a 2 on 2 game. Reggie Jackson! 

Step 15: You call the Pistons, offering Enes Kanter and Trevon Duval (who you drafted with the 14th Pick) for Reggie Jackson. The Pistons happily oblige, as they had a hole at Center after trading Andre Drummond to the New York Knicks for the 8th pick in the draft. 

Step 16: A quick trade of Andre Roberson for Jeremy Lamb gives you the scoring you’d like off the bench alongside Jackson. This team is looking scary. 

Step 17: After talking to coach Billy Donovan, you both agree the best option for Serge Ibaka is to play at Center. Your starting lineup for the season is Westbrook-Harden-Durant-Grant-Ibaka. Jeremy Lamb, Reggie Jackson, Doug McDermott, and Kyle Singler come off the bench. 

Step 18: This team obliterates pretty much every team in the NBA except for a few teams: the Warriors and the Spurs (who signed LeBron). 

Step 19: After an epic playoff series, your Thunder down the Warriors in seven games. They play the Knicks in the Finals (they managed to keep Melo and sign CP3 and Wade #squadup) but win in five. 

Step 20: This team wins a few more titles as they age and are remembered as one of the best teams in NBA history.

#^Recent ^declarations: 




Donald Trump has repeatedly denounced the KKK over a *long* period of time.

What really makes me mad and angers me is how much attention and publicity David Duke is getting. Why would the Media attend his press conferences? The only thing that David Duke wants to do is divide us and screw over America, why is the Media giving him what he wants? 




#Trump doesn't ""embolden"" these hate groups. Character Assassination and Media Campaigns do, though. 



Fuck the KKK scumbags. Meanwhile, the Media says ""oh, Donald Trump is automatically a racist only because he wasn't specific enough1111111111111twelve"". 



If CNN [reported in November of 2016](https://archive.is/2LnPx#selection-375.136-375.174) that Trump disavowed and tried to distance himself from the KKK scumbags, why would they report [on Saturday, August 12th](https://archive.is/X8EvL#selection-181.9-181.19) that he ""once again"" somehow ""refuses"" to condemn them? He's *been* condemning them for *years*. 



Why? 



Fake fucking News. That's why. 



The *Chicago Tribune* [reported in November, as well, saying that Trump has disavowed the ""alt right"" and established myths about them](https://archive.is/PMJb0#selection-469.2-473.79), of course, the *Chicago Tribune* is saying different things today. 




------------------------------------------------------------ 




##Most of the reports about the [Press Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGKbFA7HW-U) at Trump Tower were steered toward the left, basically saying that ""Trump defends the 'alt right'"", but in reality, he didn't. Even the Cuckpublicans in the House and in the Senate condemned Trump for this, even though I doubt any of them actually watched the Press Conference. He *never* condoned the Neo-Nazis. 





What I gathered from the Press Conference:

Every day it becomes more and more clear that Republican Politicians alike are great friends with Israel. They stand with Israel. Nobody has been more of an ally than Donald Trump, maybe even more than Ted Cruz. 



During the Obama Administration, Benjamin Netanyahu addressed congress. Many people ignored his remarks or scoffed at him. This is more of a prime example of us *not* standing with Israel. None of this has or will ever happen with Trump as the President. 



#Deconstructing Narratives 



#[*^This ^bogus ^article ^by ^HuffPo*](https://archive.is/b4O08) 



#^Mainly ^what's ^up ^with ^this ^article: 



&gt; the Trump administration revoked a grant to Life After Hate, a group that works to de-radicalize neo-Nazis..... The Department of Homeland Security had awarded the group $400,000 as part of its Countering Violent Extremism program **in January, just days before former President Barack Obama left office**. 



Okay, so they were given money to investigate something. Usually the DOH doesn't do that, ever since 9/11, the DOH usually doesn't outsource their materials, **especially pertaining to Counterterrorism**, this is a very unusual move. 



&gt; including Katharine Gorka, a controversial national security analyst known for her **anti-Muslim rhetoric** 



Okay, even if this *did* happen, **Radical Islamic Terrorism** is *way* more of a threat than White Supremacy has been in recent years, this is completely justified. I'm surprised the DOH even outsourced to this group anyway. 



&gt; what the president has described as “radical Islamic terrorism.” 




They won't even call it for what it is. 



Radical. Islamic. Terrorism. It's real, it's growing, and it's dangerous. We shouldn't be afraid to call it for what it is. 



&gt; Gorka told Selim and Gersten she didn’t agree with the Obama administration’s approach to countering violent extremism 



This comment was completely based on assumption with no reference to said interview. 



&gt; Gorka told Selim and Gersten she didn’t agree with the Obama administration’s approach to countering violent extremism 



Also assumption, the article is trying to associate her with an intent to deny that White Extremism is extremism. It's a clear projection tactic by the article. 



&gt; The Trump administration has repeatedly criticized the previous administration for avoiding terms like “radical Islam”  



This is true. 



&gt; “Katharine Gorka has been integral in helping the Department broaden efforts to focus on all forms of extremism. Her work includes efforts to address everything from global jihadists threats to domestic terrorists,”  



Good, that means if she identifies ridiculous or unnecessary funding, she should fix it. That's her job. 



&gt; mainstream national security experts are either unfamiliar with or critical of their work 



Well of course they would be. They're Trump aids, everyone would be critical of their work. The article is trying to put Media ""experts"" over government officials. 



&gt; the office of then-DHS Secretary John Kelly ordered a full review of the Countering Violent Extremism program. Kelly’s office wanted to re-vet the groups receiving a portion of the $10 million Congress had appropriated for the program 



Good. We've had *way* more threats of Radical Islam than we've had of White Nationalism. 



&gt; even though DHS had already publicly announced the grant recipients 



The DHS would announce this with the GPO first. These public reviews could take weeks to process. The fact that the article doesn't reference to the GPO only attributes to my doubt of the article's truthful integrity. 



&gt; Staffers in the Countering Violent Extremism program have long pushed for it to address threats from domestic terrorists, including white supremacists 



I understand this. I support this, but as far as I'm concerned, White Nationalism isn't invading Baghdad right now and stealing a shit ton of oil. Palestinian Nationalism poses much more of an international threat. **Domestic efforts are already conducted by the FBI, so funding to an external source at this point would be unnecessary**. 



&gt; But when DHS published a new list of award recipients on June 23, there was no mention of Life After Hate. 



However, the [published report](https://archive.is/Sw1Vo) **did** include [a shit ton of funding to cops](https://i.imgur.com/FWhULyg.png) and other Counter-Terrorist organisations on a domestic level, thus making obsolete any further funds to this ""Life After Hate"" group. The previous funds were allocated unusually to that group by the Obama Administration, further and much better efforts can be directed toward more efficient government programs, rather than private programs. 



&gt; DHS also revoked funding from the Muslim Public Affairs Council, an American Muslim advocacy organization that was told in January it would receive a $393,800 grant to create community resource centers throughout the country. 



I'm not sure what to say about this but no source is given. 



&gt; After publishing its new list of grantees, DHS told Muslim Public Affairs Council that it was now prioritizing organizations that worked with law enforcement. The money that was initially set aside for community-based groups like Muslim Public Affairs Council and Life After Hate will now go to several law enforcement agencies. 



I can tell, obviously, according to the report, it shows that. What Rudy Giuliani did in 1994 for increased police funding helped clean up the city, imagine how much better our country would be when that happens. So, I support this decision to cut programs that previously went to private Counter-Extremist groups only if the funding goes to Police. I'm all for this. I don't see anything racist or anti-Muslim about this. 



&gt; “Is this really just a front for targeting the Muslim community?” asked Omar Noureldin, Muslim Public Affairs Council’s vice president. 




Lol what the heck, that came out of nowhere. 



&gt; Noureldin is now looking into whether the Trump administration’s use of the Countering Violent Extremism program’s funds violates congressional appropriation intent. 



The Kek it wouldn't. Not in a million years would prioritising a government agency over a private one be a violation of Congressional Appropriations. Even the Senate Appropriations Committee would agree on this, hell, even the Democrats would agree on this. 




&gt; Less than two months after DHS announced it was pulling funding from Life After Hate, James Alex Fields Jr., a 20-year-old Ohioan, traveled to Charlottesville, Virginia, to join white supremacists armed with long guns, waving Nazi and Confederate flags and protesting the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a local park. 



The article is trying to make a connection here, where there is no connection. How would fields know about this report? Most people like him are so closed minded, they don't even know what's happening beyond a 20-yard radius of their front porch. Even if this ""Life After Hate"" program still had its funding, it couldn't do shit to stop what happened from happening. 



&gt; Life After Hate was founded by former white supremacists who have renounced the racist ideology and who now help others transition out of hate groups and re-assimilate into society. 



Good. I'm glad there are programs like this. I really am, I really am happy that some of these KKK scumbags can have their sins washed away. I just don't think that funding should go toward them when other government agencies are capable of much more than they are. I do believe, however, they could have used their expertise to inform Government Agencies about what was going on, but the article makes no mention of that. They had 3 days to contact the police and say: ""hey, we worked for you guys until January, we have expertise in combating the KKK and White Extremism, do you need our help?"" The police would be happy to receive their help. 



&gt; The white supremacy movement “has been growing, but it’s also been shape-shifting,” Piccolini said. “It’s gone from what we would have considered very open neo-Nazis and skinheads and KKK marching, to now people that look like our neighbors, our doctors, our teachers, our mechanics.” 



This is false. Those shaved-head freaks don't assimilate into our society. We've changed to exclude them, they *deserve* to be excluded because of their Hitler-Worshiping filth. 




&gt; a lot of the rhetoric that’s coming out of the White House today is so similar to what we preached 



Also false. Trump hasn't pandered to them in **any** way. 



Just the fact that somebody with expertise in the field of violent White Extremism would go to the lengths and say that a Republican Candidate is similar to them only baffles me. I wouldn't appropriate funding to this guy in a million years if he said that to me. 



That's literally just like saying: ""Hey, would you help me stop the KKK? I think you're the KKK, so do you want me to help you stop them? I still think you're the KKK and you like them, if you refuse my help, I'll be forced to say that you support them. What do you think""? 



No government agency would support someone who would sell out to the media that easily, either. 



&gt; The president ignored several calls to specifically denounce white supremacists and neo-Nazis 



He specifically denounced them on multiple different occasions. 




&gt; It wasn’t until Monday, two days after the violent rally, that Trump specifically denounced “the [Ku Klux Klan], neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups.” 



[Fucking liar](https://archive.is/iO1AF). He denounced it **25 minutes later**. And even then, it took Obama **5 years** to denounce Homophobia. 




&gt; Trump’s hesitancy to disavow white supremacists echoes his practice of repeatedly dodging questions about David Duke 




He hasn't dodged questions. When he was asked, he denounced them. Even dating back to 1991. 





&gt; Trump eventually distanced himself from the infamous white supremacist 



The use of the word ""eventually"" only proves they're lying. He has a **long** history of denouncing David Duke and those White Supremacist scumbags. They are **against** the Constitution. 



&gt; He argued days before the Charlottesville attack that white supremacy is not “the problem” facing the country. 



He **never** said that. He was mainly talking about making the Middle East a priority. Gosh they like to put words in people's mouths sometimes..... 



&gt; DHS did not directly respond to a questions about why it cut funding for de-radicalizing neo-Nazis, and whether it views white supremacy as an extremist threat. 



Of course they wouldn't. They wouldn't sell out to the Media only to have their words twisted into an entirely different context. 




&gt; Sixteen of the 26 groups that received DHS funding “have applicability to all forms of violent extremism and as such will address the threat of domestic terrorism,” Franko, the DHS spokeswoman, wrote. 



See, I told you. :)

99.99% of Trump supporters absolutely hate the alt-right fascists with all of their guts. The KKK is **against** the Constitution and everything that Trump supporters stand for. They are an embarrassment. 



There is also the violent alt-left. Anything that doesn't please them short term, they whine about. They claim to exhibit ""social justice"", but in reality, they **poorly** display Doctor King's principles of peace.

[Will Trump backlash make American socialists great again](https://archive.is/ICHsk)? | 1712 GMT | *CNN* | In an attempt to degrade America, this new propaganda campaign by none other than *CNN* stands for ""the common man"" in defense of socialism.

Also, they cite a poll that says 53% of Registered Voters are now pessimistic about Trump, and cite this beforehand as a ""majority"", in order for people not to check too much into the stats.

[Trump promised a trade war. Here’s what he’s doing instead](https://archive.is/P3XpM). | Not listed | *The Washington Post* | The article is critical of every move by the President between Canada and Mexico. Instead of explaining what *they* could be doing, the article is too busy explaining what Trump is doing to make him look panic-ey. 
[Trump admin still seeks cooperation with Russia despite new sanctions and retaliation](https://archive.is/KxVhX) | 2:16 P.M. | *ABC* | Toward the end of the article, after it's explanation of events, the article says that Trump has a favour of Putin, even that over Congress. Such a ""favour"" does not exist. Congress is much closer to Trump than Putin is. 
[Trump: 'Fake news' ignoring successes](https://archive.is/Pj1tr) | 9:41 P.M. | *Politico* | The article tries to identify irony within Trump's tweets. They say that a day after he tweeted a Washington Post article, he then explained how the Fake News was ignoring him, this is to identify confusion and irony within Trump, basically to sneakingly make him look like an idiot.

Article (archived) | Time | Outlet | Why it's fake 
:---------------------------------------|:-----------:|:-----------------|:----------------------------- 
[REPUBLICANS HAVE REACHED A TIPPING POINT WITH TRUMP](https://archive.is/oAL7z) | 5:37 P.M. | *Vanity Fair* | The article establishes itself as being more correct with its polls than the President's statements himself. This is clear narcissism. The article also identifies every single possible division between the Senate and Trump, and then says: ""As the president finds himself increasingly isolated"", which basically means the article has drawn its own borders and blamed the government from not being within them. 
[Who’s worse for the nation — Trump or Pence](https://archive.is/cziM3)? | Not listed | *The Washington Post* | The article begins by being in fantasy land, saying ""if, for some reason, Donald Trump falls by the wayside or decides that one term is enough"". Then, the article **blames** Pence, saying that his statements were over-the-top when he regarded the Media's outcry for Trump's resignation. This is clear narcissism, it's diverting the attention away from the Media's Fake News about Pence running for President and instead, blaming Pence for reacting to it. The article draws bogus conclusions, saying ""he has made a hash of our foreign policy, set back efforts to contain global warming, exploited public land and depopulated the State Department"", when no such thing has happened. ""normalize lying as an ordinary tool"" is something that the Media does. Then, the article accuses Trump of being Mentally Insane and accusing Pence of being Overly Religious, citing things that date back to 2000. 
[Donald Trump's 'successes' after 6 months, rated](https://archive.is/hvd9V) | 2235 GMT | *CNN* | The media claims to have already reported the successes of Trump on the Supreme Court, the economy and jobs, border and military security and ISIS and MS-13, when in fact, each of those listed were critical of his decisions on that matter, and did not proclaim the many successes he had even in border Security. The Media is desperately trying to shield itself. 
[Trump’s big win at the United Nations](https://archive.is/Mb2rm) | Not listed | *The Washington Post* | The article is in fantasy land, saying that Trump's tweets durinig the UN conference were a diversion tactic, when he literally tweeted about the UN and North Korea. The article also blames Trump for problems in China's sanctions that don't even exist on Trump's behalf, citing **only Trump critics who hate him** in the process. This is clearly established Fake and Fraud news, living in fantasy land, and ""hypothetically reporting"" what's never going on. 
[Trump says his political base is ‘stronger than ever’ despite polling to the contrary](https://archive.is/O7vqO) | 8:02 A.M. | *The Washington Post* | While the article switches topics ever so quickly to avoid accountability, it cites a fake poll (which it then says isn't fake, with only quotation marks as its ""sources"") over the President's actual statements. That's pretty sad, how the Media forces you to believe its polls over the President himself. Then, the media slams Trump for ""lying"" about a matter that the **media** created. The article also stereotypes all Trump supporters as White Men without a college degree. Anyone who disagrees with *The Washington Post*, no matter on what platform, is immediately marked as a ""lunatic patheological liar"", that's some pretty sad shielding. ""He has no public events scheduled on Monday"" is also FAKE NEWS with no sources. 
[Will Trump's hardball tactics work on China and North Korea](https://archive.is/Z3mEJ)? | 1510 GMT | *CNN* | The article takes two of the President's tweets and reports them out of order. It first reports Trump's good tweets on Xi and China, then it reports a tweet done on July 29th, where Trump slammed Xi and China, to identify a ""disagreeing conterargument"", instead of actually reporting the News, which is that Trump first slammed Xi and China, then praised Xi and China, not the other way around. The article then cites a bogus ""Korean demographic probelm in China"", such a problem would be handled in a timely manner, but it is cited as a real problem by *CNN*. 



The second one by *The Washington Post* has to be one of the most sick, disgusting articles I have ever read. Whenever Trump criticises the Media, it calls it a ""ghettoized truth"", to shield itself from its own misrepresentation. Sick and disgusting.

Article (archived) | Time | Outlet | Why it's fake 
:---------------------------------------|:-----------:|:-----------------|:----------------------------- 
[Trump just set his own, uncrossable 'red line' — and North Korea crossed it instantly](https://archive.is/j4M4x) | Not listed | *CNBC* | The article states that Trump has threatened to attack North Korea, when no such threats were made. The only declarations that were made were warnings, and responses to the Kim's disgusting regime. The article is too busy criticising Trump rather than talking about how another fucking nation just threatened to bomb our shores, something that hasn't happened in a *long* time. 
[Trump threatens ‘fire and fury’ in response to North Korean threats](https://archive.is/jACIN) | Not listed | *The Washington Post* | The article only references critiques of Trump's responses instead of actually reporting on what can be done to stop North Korea from bombing Guam, they're too busy promoting their propaganda by selling out Senate seats rather than actually reporting the News. 
[Trump's reckless rhetoric on North Korea](https://archive.is/JdW79) | Not listed | *Boston Globe* | The article responds to Trump's flaming in a way that makes it look like it came out of nowhere. These remarks were literally in response to a threat of open attack on Guam. The article also peskingly weaves critiques upon the State Department in the middle (betwixt) the article. 
[is Trump losing his base](https://archive.is/9TWyc)? | Not listed | *Boston Globe* | The article identifies Trump's base as ""the only thing he's got"", when he literally has the Presidency of the United States of America, not just Trump Supporters. He has the military, other armed forces, the Supreme Court, the Executive Branch, and the codes to Nuclear Weapons. The article only identifies Trump's base as being the only support to falsely establish flaws within the base, to indirectly establish flaws in the Presidency. It's clear that a link between the two is being falsely established right now, by *The Boston Globe*. 
[Disturbing signs for Trump in new CNN poll](https://archive.is/zxgXy) | 1722 GMT | *CNN* | CNN desperately tries to shield itself, and to persist that it's the greatest thing in the world by saying its own poll is ""a credibility crisis for Trump"". These borders were established by CNN, yet they continue to claim that Trump's base is falling, from their own sources. It's narcissistic, disgusting, dishonest, and awful. They proclaim to the public that their own ""polls"" are better than what the President says himself. 
[This brutal new poll shows that Trump’s safe space is shrinking](https://archive.is/MlWae) | Not listed | *The Washington Post* | The article calls Trump's accurate response to the dishonest media: ""in an increasingly frantic effort to carve out a kind of safe space that cannot be penetrated by accountability or factual reality"", which is a gaslighting tactic to get any of the readers of this article off the fence and believe their narrative, **no matter what happens**, they will feed Trump to the sharks for their ratings. The lies that they have reported are **ALL** being shielded in this article, which changes the subject rapidly to avoid accountability. ""Few Americans believe this"" actually means ""only the Americans that we 'asked' believe this"". Their constant selfishness and self-promotion is pathetic, yet it's **so believeable**. 
[Trump's confidence belies dwindling base](https://archive.is/bfGQ5) | 6:58 A.M. | *ABC* | The article critiques Trump's ""boasting"" of his Base getting stronger (which it is), yet cites the ever so glorious bogus poll to denounce that in an effort to force the American People to believe **THEM, and NOT the President**. These polls actually mean ""hey, hey America! YOU BELONG TO US NOW!"". Instead of criticising Blumenthal for being a phony Vietnam con artist, like the President himself said he was, the Media moves on like it's no big deal..... and then criticises Trump for even saying that. It's clear shielding, they must be recieving **bookoo** bucks from the DNC. The article continues its false propaganda machine by saying about McConnell ""fun to be pointed at and blamed for everything going wrong"", and then identifying rifts between McConnell and Trump. 
[Donald Trump doesn't think much of climate change, in 20 quotes](https://archive.is/kTe6Z) | 1517 GMT | *CNN* | The article establishes its establishment upon *The New York Times*'s article regarding ""scientists concerns about Trump"". Climate Change arguments against Republicans were established by CNN in order to force the government to act on their behalf, and whenever someone disagrees, they're marked. The article goes out of its way to list Trump's quotes **when he wasn't even the President** about ""global warming"". 
[Trump should be worried about Mike Pence](https://archive.is/QwAc0) | Not listed | *Chicago Tribune* | The article praises *The New York Times* for their new conspiracy theory on how Mike Pence is ""going to run against Trump"", when clearly no rewards have been established instead of its ""awesome"" critique of Pence being 'in panic over this'. This is clearly more propaganda aimed at Mike Pence to ""knock him off of his feet"".

[What Donald Trump's 'fire and fury' on North Korea might signify](https://archive.is/8Rhxv) | 0010 GMT | *CNN* | Once again, CNN pushes the narrative that Trump's comments were out of order, but he was responding to a NATIONAL threat on Guam. 
[Trump’s base is drifting away — and may never return](https://archive.is/BTVRS) | 1:15 P.M. | *The Washington Post* | The article uses the bogus counter-counterargument to presume its ""credibility"" with: ""While the president waves any bad polling off as “fake,” the numbers are alarming in a number of respects."" This is in a clear effort to shield themselves from any criticism. Nobody knows how ""accurate"" these polls really are, and frankly, Trump's base doesn't seem to be crumbling to me. 
[Nuke Threats show Donald Trump's inability to govern](https://archive.is/wnTJ3) | Not listed | *Prospect* | Guam was threatened to be attacked, what are you going to do, stay silent about it? Donald Trump is the fucking President, what else would he say? This is a clear, disgusting propaganda notion to get rid of any faith in our own President. 
[Blumenthal: ‘No question’ evidence connects Manafort with criminal wrongdoing](https://archive.is/1Xm10) | 7:26 P.M. | *The Hill* | The article talks briefly about Blumenthal, then suddenly changes subjects when Trump ""attacked"" him, discussing **none** of Blumenthal's lies regarding Vietnam. They clearly change the subject **right in the MIDDLE of everything**, as if thye are **trying** to avoid accountability in almost **every** way.

**[So much for Christian charity: Evangelicals blame the poor for poverty, which makes them a lot like other Republicans](https://archive.is/63io3)** | 4:59 A.M. | *Salon* | This is probably the second most disgusting headline I've ever read. How can *Salon* claim to have ""religious tolerance"" after this? It literally cites a *Washington Post* poll over an entire religion, this is clearly discriminatory in almost every level. It **even puts Conservatism to ""a science""**: ""Researchers have repeatedly shown that conservatism is a type of motivated social cognition that de-emphasizes (or actively resists) the reality that individuals and their life chances are heavily determined by social forces that are generally outside any given person’s control."" This is fucking heresy and frankly, this is what's dividing America. It's nothing different from Hitler's Media explanation on ""how Jews actually think about life"", they're marking us as animals. 
[Pent-up Trump lets it rip on vacation](https://archive.is/M5RqA) | 8:11 P.M. | *Politico* | The article uses hypothetical reporting to assume Trump's intentions behind his actions. This method of reporting is so established, the reader is compelled to believe it. 
[Trump is wrong: Obama wasn't weak on missile defense](https://archive.is/dLQQD) | 2321 GMT | *CNN* | The article states its thesis but changes subjects before it can even describe it. The article blatantly refuses to acknowledge the Iranian Nuclear Deal, and only lists the positive nuclear legislation on behalf of President Obama. 
[Trump threatened ‘fire and fury.’ Here’s why to some that’s perfectly God-like](https://archive.is/1ZQEE). | Not listed | *The Washington Post* | The article uses the bible and evangelical leaders to make its sarcastic thesis, but its thesis holds no ground because it critiques the evangelicals and the bible itself. The article is mocking every element that makes up Trump's statements in only a hypothetical way, **this isn't even news, it's literally just bullshit**. 
[Trump has been making ominous threats his whole life](https://archive.is/rDa30) | Not listed | *The Washington Post* | The article exaggerates North Korea's nuclear capacity and then blames Trump for exaggerating. The article says that Trump ""went the furthest"" than Kim, even though Kim threatened to attack Guam, this is unacceptable and the *Compost* refuses to point out that context. Trump also **never** implied that he had tapes of Comey, all he said was ""you'd better hope there aren't any tapes"", which means Trump didn't know if there were or if there weren't any tapes. 
[Old Man On Golf Course Complains About Other People Not Working](https://archive.is/qViEY) | 6:15 P.M. | *The Huffington Post* | HuffPo twists the goalposts into their favour by saying that Republicans generally don't like to work, even though Republicans are painted by the Media today as being at odds with Trump. Saying that he's a Republican because he doesn't like to work and then saying that he isn't Republican because they disagree with him doesn't add up. The way the article reports the Opioid Crisis is also innacurate because it twists things (quotes) out of cronological order to make it seem like they disagree with each-other, but in reality, they fall into perfect sense. 



The Media is running out of ways to project ""Russiagate"".

:---------------------------------------|:-----------:|:-----------------|:-----------------------------
[Trump is torturing Mitch McConnell for sport. Here’s how McConnell can get revenge](https://archive.is/MuphS) | Not listed | *The Washington Post* |  The article begins by over-exaggerating Trump's continuous remarks against McConnell as ""public torment"", this is not torment, this is constructive encouragement. The Amazon SLOSHington Compost really has a way of turning things the other way. The article also states that Trump's demands on McConnell and the Senate Republicans are an ""impossible"" request, this is **entirely** possible, they just **need** to work together. The article also uses hypothetical reporting in fantasy land in ""reaction"" to Trump's tweet about North Korea and that Kim Jong Un should find another path, clearly this was ""wrong"", even though it's *literally the best thing he could have said*. 
[Why Does Trump Still Refuse to Criticize Putin](https://archive.is/d3jmQ)? | 12:44 P.M. | *TheAtlantic* | The article cuts and pastes different contexts into random order to create ""suspicious"" hyptohetical reporting around Vladamir Putin. Trump's ""attack"" on North Korea wasn't even an attack, it was a warning. The ""conclusion"" that Trump ""colluded with Russia"" also hasn't been proved by any Intelligence Agencies (with the exception of 3 who failed to prove it) and the article is wrong about that. The article's increased speculation on this even adds to the context that it sounds like a crazy bogus conspiracy theory, they're running out of things to talk about..... 
[Donald Trump Is Giving North Korea Exactly What It Wants](https://archive.is/uHxWq) | Not listed | *The New York Times* | The article does a wonderful job of describing North Korea's attitude, but it puts Trump into a context of helping or aiding North Korea, something that would never happen. Trump's remarks were appropriate and should be considered by North Korea. Donald Trump has **not given ANY justifications** toward Kim Jong Un to continue his nuclear program. 
[Why a petulant, erratic Trump may succeed with North Korea](https://archive.is/Wa5st) | Not listed | *Los Angeles Times* | The article opens up with the awful, liberal comment of ""Donald Trump is a narcissistic, short-tempered, uninformed, unpredictable bully. In almost every context, this combination of traits is exactly what you would not want in a president of the United States"". This moves to ""justify"" any further comments made by the *Los Angeles Times* in the public eye. The article continues its hypothetical reporting with a quote from Twitter by a liberal, saying that China might refuse their assistance with the United States of America on this matter. 
[GOP senators blast President Trump for not rebuking white supremacists in Charlottesville speech](https://archive.is/ZKhmx) | 10:00 P.M. | *New York Daily News* | Trump actually **DID** rebuke the very protests that happened that day, the article only makes reference to one thing that Trump said, Trump later rebuked everything, the Counter-Protest and the KKK rally. 
[When Lady Liberty Triggers Trump Supporters](https://archive.is/XEXk9) | Not listed | *The New York Times* | The article nitpicks this one example of a bigoted idiot to mark 100% of Trump supporters as such, this is innacurate. Many immigrants passed by the Statue of Liberty when they arrived at Ellis Island. 
[These are your people, President Trump](https://archive.is/lcXI7) | 7:55 P.M. | *The Washington Post* | The article knows that Trump denounced the KKK, they are so mad about that (because they lost their ""racist"" example) that they gaslight Trump himself by saying: ""are worthy of the hypocrite and instigator of hate that he has proved himself to be"". The article takes **every** opportunity possible to mark 100% of Trump Supporters as automatically being part of the KKK (the KKK are **Democrats**), and even said the KKK was ""the force helping him get to the White House"", when this is **clearly** wrong, bigoted, stereotypical, racist, and innacurate. This disgusting portrait that the *Post* is trying to make is definitely not accurate in the **least** possible way. 
[Report: the Trump administration is having secret talks with North Korea](https://archive.is/UctLC) | 4:24 P.M. | *Vox* | The article twists the truth from other sourcs in **every** possible way. It draws conclusions where none need to be drawn, and makes connections at totally disconnected points. It's living in fantasy land, just read it for yourself, I can't even **begin** to describe how fake this is. 
[Trump financial records could come back to haunt him in probe](https://archive.is/UWpHX) | Not listed | *MSNBC* | The stupid Bitch Rachael Maddow forgets to include the **fact** that Trump released **ALL** of his financial reports to Mueller, this *includes* his tax returns.

[Global Christian group: Trump’s North Korea threats ‘almost indistinguishable’ from Kim Jong-un’s](https://archive.is/fzMvr) | Not listed | *ThinkProgress* | The article makes it seem like Kim Jong Un's awful regime is similar to the Presidency of Donald Trump. Donald Trump doesn't imprison the grandkid of a starving bread-stealer in a concentration camp for experimental torture. 
[You Can Thank Trump For The White Nationalist Rampage](https://archive.is/oD1np) | 7:16 P.M. | *The Huffington Post* | This post denounces all of history. The Republican Party **established** the Civil Rights Movement, the very first [Civil Rights Act, in 1866](http://legisworks.org/sal/14/stats/STATUTE-14-Pg27.pdf), was sponsored and introduced by a [Republican Senator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_Trumbull). In fact, this Senator **literally wrote the 13th Amendment**. The Republicans then went on to produce [more civil rights acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1866) to legislate in favour of African Americans. The Democratic Party is a party that disgustingly promotes chattel slavery and segregation, it's *impossible* to deny it. It's sick and disgusting the way that *The Huffington Post* manipulates historical truths in their favour. **Even the very effort by Trump HIMSELF that he tweeted AGAINST HATE was marked as ""hilarious"" by The Huffington Post**, which means **ANYTHING** that disagrees with them is *immediately* marked as ""hilarious"". 
[Trump turns on Republican leadership](https://archive.is/YOkGn) | Not listed | *BBC* | Donald Trump's critiques of McConnell were that of constructive thought, getting the job done. *BBC* twists that as something negative, almost like an **attack**, but in reality, it was constructive critique. 
[North Korea: China urges Trump not to worsen situation](https://archive.is/BiBKi) | Not listed | *BBC* | It's pretty sad when *BBC* reports more of what North Korea, our enemy, says rather than the President himself. 
[Congress could get rid of Trump and get Pence as president](https://archive.is/6Ar46) | 7:46 P.M. | *The Salt Lake Tribune* | Anti-Mormon literature comes out with a new scheme, now they're using this clickbait title to describe Trump? The article's content includes hyperboles, fantasy land quotes, and gaslighting of every Republican who could ever possibly read this. 
[Donald Trump is loyal -- until he's not](https://archive.is/IsAAA) | 1656 GMT | *CNN* | The article begins with no sources, building Trump on loyalty, and then knocking it down saying ""it's at least half true"" to gaslight anyone who reads this on the loyalty standpoint. The article makes assumptions, much of them are out of the blue, like: ""But it's a telling line mostly because of the subtext"", the article completely makes up and coins a brand new ""subtext"" behind this, going in-depth about what really isn't anything to go in-depth about. ""which suggests Trump is indeed willing to repay subordinates who advance his interests with loyalty -- but only up to a point"", Trump's quote makes **NO** indication to this absurd suggestion. 
[Trump’s Remarks on Charlottesville Violence Are Criticized as Insufficient](https://archive.is/WGW7G) | Not listed | *The New York Times* | This is clearly a **PERFECT** example of [Number 14 from Narcissism](https://archive.is/OANR5), which is called ""Triangulation"", it's basically saying your belief, but instead of saying the belief is yours, you say ""oh, well these other people believe it too! *Clearly* they must be right"", when this isn't even anyone else's belief beyond their *own*. This is a classic, perfect example of Triangulating Narcissism, it isn't anyone else who is forced to believe it, but now you are because *The New York Times* has told you what to believe. 
[White House issues series of anonymous statements justifying Trump's refusal to explicitly condemn white supremacists](https://archive.is/XPm2O) | Not listed | *Business Insider* | Trump HAS condemned (even if not **explicitly**) all racial violence, this includes those on both sides, how is this **not** good enough? Why are you condemning the President for not holding up to **YOUR** standards? Just because he might do a poor job representing your **HARSH** and ridiculous standards, that **doesn't mean that he ""refuses to represent ANYONE""**. 




I'm so **FUCKING** sick of this, we are *not* the KKK, in fact, the KKK was **established by DEMOCRATS**, the KKK has absolutely *nothing* to do with Trump, and even when Trump tries to denounce the White Nationalist movement, the Fake Media says ""OH, THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH!"" to make him look like even **MORE** of a ""racist"".

[Time for Republicans to Leap From the Boat](https://archive.is/kIGp5) | 11:18 A.M. | *Salon* | The article's thesis isn't even outlined in the article's body, let alone answered to. The article beings by saying that each decision made by Trump has ""been proven a disater"" when in fact, it **hasn't been proven by ANYONE**, just speculated by the Media. The article continues its pathetic propaganda reign by gaslighting anyone who thinks anything that Trump does happens to be a good idea.

The article neglects to mention that demographic hate, slandering, and racial-media campaigns happen on **both** sides. Donald Trump has also **never** made any indication toward the contrary on this article, the article is setting up a Fake ""resistance"" campaign against something that Donald Trump hasn't even ever said.

Donald Trump is simply the President and he is looking for representation of EVERYONE, [he even said in 1980 ""statues aren't worth anything""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-w47wgdhso), which means he **doesn't give a shit about some Robert E.

[White House: Trump’s condemnation includes ‘white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi and all extremist groups’](https://archive.is/Pt4Xg) | 1:05 P.M. | *The Washington Post* | The article comes to the conclusion that Ivanka Trump's Anti-KKK statement on Twtter ""broke with her father’s messaging"", when this isn't true. I personally like how the article **DID** explain both sides to the White House's statements regarding the terrorist attack; however, it also says that ""Trump and some members of his staff have long been accused of quietly pandering to white nationalists"", this is **NOT** true in any way, Trump has worked to distance himself from them.

[We need to stop acting like Trump isn’t pandering to white supremacists](https://archive.is/e9QbB) | 3:21 P.M. | *Vox* | Once again, Trump has not made **ANY** indication of support for these groups, this article is **so** fucking false in *every* possible way. Trump has not pandered to them, nor has he acted like he has pandered to them.

#We are NOT associated with the KKK or any White Nationalist, NazzionalSocialische movement out there, we are simply Republicans with a President. The Media has continued to use the worst examples of racists in an effort to mark us and stereotype us. I assure you that we are FOR diversity, equality, justice, peace, love, immigration, and liberty. This nation was FOUNDED on diversity and immigration, we are simply against Illegal Immigration. Our policies are NOT racist, nor do they ""appeal"" to the KKK. What the media is saying is FALSE.

likeafox,2017-08-02 17:19:39+00:00,Announcement: r/Politics is moving to a whitelist domain submission model - please read,"As discussed in [July's meta thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/whitelist), the mod team has been discussing a move to a whitelist model for submission domains. After much discussion and planning, we are opting to move ahead with that change in several days. As part of this change, we have added a new rule referred to as 'domain notability' which we will use as a rubric by which we will approve or reject domains. I know it's really tempting to jump straight to the list, but we beg that you finish reading this entire post before jumping in to the comments. Note that this change will not be taking place until this post is at least 72 hours old. 

**Q: What exactly does a 'whitelist model' mean?**

**A:** Previously, if domains were deemed to be rule breaking or unsuitable for r/politics, the moderators would discuss and add domains one by one to a 'blacklist' of domains to be filtered. After this change is complete, we will match all submissions against [this whitelist](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/whitelist) and remove all submission not originating from one of these domains. 

**Q: Why are you doing this?**

**A:** There are several reasons that we're opting to make this change. One major factor is that the reddit administrators have [depreciated the spam reporting system](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6bj5de/state_of_spam/) that we previously relied on to remove and discourage spammers from the site. But even when r/spam was available to us, we had issues with the domains being submitted to r/politics/new. Moving to a whitelist system will be a bullet proof method of preventing genuine spammers from abusing our sub. Beyond dealing with bona fide spam this system will also have the following benefits:

* Increasing the quality of submissions in r/politics/new by limiting the number of amateur and irrelevant domains submitted to us.
* Decreasing moderator burden - with better vetted domains, the amount of time moderators need to spend handling reported posts should decrease.
* Better standardization - with a tracked white list, we should be able to reduce moderator inconsistency wherein one moderator has approved a submission source, and another has rejected it.

**Q: What does the domain notability requirement entail?**

**A:** Domain notability is a new rubric by which the mod team will evaluate domains as acceptable for r/politics. It is **not** a method of excluding disliked or controversial domains. What it **will** exclude are domains that are irrelevant (not containing content useful to r/politics readers), amateur (not containing content written by professional or noteworthy authors), or spam-like. Our notability requirements are modeled after the guidelines that other large online communities have used to successfully evaluate content. 

In order for a domain to be notable enough for whitelisting, at least **one** of the following must apply:

1. The source is a major **print media publication**, **television network** or **radio broadcaster**. 
2. The source is a web news or media organization **regularly cited** by or **affiliated with** other notable or reliable sources. (Vox Media, Politico, Politifact and Defense One)
3. The source is recognized as influential or noteworthy within their **political sphere of influence** by other notable organizations (The American Conservative - recognized by The New York Times, Democracy Now - recognized by the Los Angeles Times)
4. The source is recognized as influential or important within their **regional sphere of influence** by other notable organizations (The Birmingham News - AL)
5. The source has been **historically noteworthy** (example: The Hartford Courant, operating since 1764).
6. The source has produced work that was **award winning** or given official acknowledgement by an authoritative organization in their field (The New York Daily News and ProPublica for their 2017 Pulitzer Prize in public service reporting, The Marshall Project for their 2016 George Polk Award)
7. The source is recognized as a noteworthy or influential **research organization**, **policy think tank** or **political advocacy group** by an authoritative source (examples: The Heritage Foundation, Pew Research, ACLU and AARP)
8. The source is part of a **government agency or body**
9. The source is or is directly affiliated with a **recognized political party**. (Republican National Committee, The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee)

**Q: I don't see a source I'm interested in on the whitelist. How can I get it added?**

**A:** The current list is to be continuously updated and improved upon, like our existing whitelist for Youtube channels. In the indicated places within the thread below, we will solicit suggestions and discuss them with the community. After this thread is unstickied, submissions may be submitted via a web form. If a submission is submitted and filtered by our whitelist, the removal reason will include a link to the suggestion form with instructions. If you do not need an immediate response, or would like us to queue your suggestion for later, you can use the web form today at this link.

**Q: I see a source on the list that I don't think should be whitelisted. Why is it on there?**

**A:** The whitelist is **not** a moderator endorsement of the sources within. We don't want to judge sources on metrics that can be overly subjective. The sources that we permit are meant to be as reflective as possible of how Americans consume political news and opinions, which means not limiting ourselves to only sources that are *popular* within r/politics. We think that users should be able to find and engage with ideas that are controversial or maybe sometimes even flat out untruthful. Even if those submissions don't make it to the front page, they will still be found on r/politics/controversial for users that favor browsing via that method. The sources on this list will exist and publish, with or without us. It's better that we allow users to see and engage with those ideas than to shut them off completely. The front page will as always, be left to user voting. 

**Q: In the previous announcement, you indicated that the whitelist might allow special flair for editorial content. Will that be part of this change?**

**A:** No not immediately but it has already made our work towards this feature more manageable. For evidence that we're not just stringing you along, see the links demonstrating our progress on this below. No promises, but we hope to have an announcement on this subject for you very soon.

**EDIT Whitelist Update 1.01 | 2017-8-3 1.01 11:38 AM ET** 

We're getting ready to process other additions shortly but first up is a[ list of local TV affiliates that will be whitelisted](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/whitelist-affiliates) 

**EDIT Whitelist Update 1.1. | 2017-8-4 1:43 PM ET**

A first pass of additions has been done with mod team consensus, pushing the primary whitelist up by 61 entries. Many more suggestions need to be processed. Updates will continue to go into this space until we go live. 

**EDIT Whitelist Update 1.1.1 | 2017-8-6 12:18 PM ET** 

Okay, we're behind schedule but the list has been updated further and is now LIVE. Note that we're still debugging a little, if you see any problems... raise the alarm. Either in this thread or messaging us via modmail. Bear with us!",politics,2625

And it's not just the US, during the Pride Week in Madrid last month there were several aggresions by some nazi groups.

On the other hand, it takes people together. LGBT groups help people feel they belong, because feeling like you don't belong is another big problem. Many people feel they're not represented on media, like TV, movies or music.

On TV, the success of some shows like Sense8 or the already finished Please Like Me have shown that there's room for overtly gay series. Maybe it's not that much, but it's about representation.

Movies are another thing. There you have Moonlight, a movie about growing as gay and black and facing homophobia, and it has been named by many as movie of the year and on top of that, it has won an Oscar for Best Picture.

Music? You even have an specific genre, queer-core. But what about hip-hop? I made a [post about it some months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/5kmbrj/hiphop_and_the_lgbt_community_a_look_back_and_a/), I don't know if you remember it. In short: the situation is still bad, but acceptation and coming out has been getting better. I mean, look at Tyler and Flower Boy. But today I want to talk about a special album that I think had some big importance during this decade: Frank Ocean's Channel ORANGE.

5 years of it already. Time has flown by. What happened 5 years ago, that made this album so legendary? It's not just about the music, it's also about the importance it had over the relationship between hip-hop and the LGBT community.

Let's start: the music. Channel Orange evokes the 90's R&amp;B, that one that has overtly sexual lyrics and flows between electric guitars, orchestration and those early programmed drums. It's done fantastically; by listening to it you could mention his references: D'Angelo, Lauryn Hill, Janet Jackson, Maxwell, maybe even Mariah Carey in the poppier songs. Hell, it has André 3000 on it. The albums switches between Frank's singing and the guests rappers like Earl Sweatshirt, the mentioned André 3000 and Tyler the Creator. The lyrics are beautiful, evoking nostalgia and love. Because Channel Orange breathes nostalgia in its production. Frank specifically wanted it to be recorded on analogue systems, and it gave it a characteristic sound: one dry, but that oozed. It sounds mutually exclusive, but it isn't: that's how summer is. Dry and hot, but oozing and juicy.

Because summer is a important part in Frank's life, or that's what it looks like:

* Novacane, his first single, was released at the end of May.
* Pyramids, the second single of Channel Orange, was released in early June.
* Channel Orange was released in July 2012.
* Boys Don't Cry was announced to be released in July 2015.
* Endless started in August 2016.
* Blonde was finally released at the end of August 2016.

And not only in releases, but also in his life. After the first listening party Frank did, premiering Channel Orange for some given people like music journalists in June, people started to make questions: did Frank Ocean mention male pronouns on his songs?

It made headlines and rumours about his sexuality. Apart from the promotion given by Def Jam itself with the two singles, some buzz was starting to get created around Frank. There's this spanish refrain, *silence is consent*, and this is a example of it. If it's a rumour, then why saying yes or no.

Until he did.

July 4th, Frank Ocean posted [this](http://68.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6me6uSdO81qdrz3yo1_1280.png) on his Tumblr blog. An open letter about his first love with a man: *'4 summers ago, I met somebody. I was 19 years old. He was too. We spent that summer, and the summer after, together. Everyday almost. And on the days we were together, time would glide. Most of the day I’d see him, and his smile.' [...] 'By the time I realized I was in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless. There was no escaping, no negotiating with the feeling. No choice. It was my first love, it changed my life.' [...] 'Imagine being thrown from a plane. I wasn’t in a plane though. I was in a Nissan Maxima, the same car I packed up with bags and drove to Los Angeles in. I sat there and told my friend how I felt. I wept as the words left my mouth. I grieved for them, knowing I could never take them back for myself. He patted my back. He said kind things. He did his best, but he wouldn’t admit the same. He had to go back inside soon, it was late and his girlfriend was waiting for him upstairs.'* He was openly admitting his bisexuality. If the rumours made headlines, the confirmation made even more. But it didn't matter. More promo. Let the music speak for itself, and all that jazz.

---

The days before the release were kinda calmed. He released Sweet Life as a third single, performed Bad Religion in Fallon, and surprise released Channel Orange a week before to avoid leaks.

Now, let's go back to a concrete song, Bad Religion. This is one of the most important songs in the album because of it's double entendre: it talks about an unrequited love, and an unrequited love with a straight man. Frank makes a comparison, in the outro: 

*It's a, it's a bad religion   
To be in love with someone   
Who could never love you*

At the same time, it compares a loved person with a god. He worships her. But also, the bad religion it refers is an homophobic religion, like some die-hard christians and muslims. Given some parts of the lyrics, like

*And you say, Allahu Akbar*

we could guess it's a muslim religion. It's not that obvious at first, but once you read the lyrics, it's easy to see what he could be meaning: a muslim friend, who Frank is in love with, doesn't reciprocate his love.

It's all reading into it, but now let's go to a song that is obviously gay it'll make you want to watch RPDR: Forrest Gump.

*My fingertips and my lips   
They burn from the cigarettes   
Forrest Gump you run my mind, boy   
Running on my mind boy   
Forrest Gump*

It's a great hook. Vocally excellent, and with a great instrumentation behind. But what stands out the most it's that Frank continues the story that he shared on his open letter, making an analogy between the characters in Forrest Gump and them. Frank is Jenny, and the unknown lover is Forrest. It's overtly gay, and that's the only thing that it needs.

---

Blonde sometimes feels like an extension of Channel Orange. Not in sound, but more like lyrically matured. You can see that in the imaginary used in Nikes and Seigfried.

*I'm not him but I'll mean something to you   
I'll mean something to you   
I'll mean something to you   
You got a roommate he'll hear what we do   
It's only awkward if you're fucking him too*

Nikes, in its video, feels also queer. The constant mentions of glitter, the figures of both men and women, the eye liner in Frank's eyes. But at the same time, it's kind of an ode to masculinity, with the racing cars. It's an ode to bisexuality.

---

5 years later, has something changed? Kind of. Months after the release of Channel Orange, [T-Pain](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/11/frank-ocean-t-pain-rappers-homophobia) said, regarding Frank: *“I know niggas that will not do a song with Frank Ocean just because he gay, but they need him on the fucking song and that’s so terrible to me, man... What I do ain’t going to affect nothing that you got going on”*. It's interesting to theorize, would have something changed in his career if Frank Ocean wasn't bi? If he was just a soft guy, would he have had a career path closer to the rest of rappers and singers, like Rocky? Maybe. But Frank has worked with other rappers and popstars, like Kanye, Jay Z, Beyoncé, Calvin Harris, A$AP Rocky... and apparently he had worked with James Blake and Kendrick Lamar. 

Of course T-Pain said that 3 years ago, but his point still stands. Of course many rappers are still homophobic, but things have gotten better. Kevin Abstract is openly gay and could be the next big popstar in hip-hop. Tyler just came out and he ignited discussion around many topics, like the use of some slurs and the internalized homophobia. And even tho he isn't at the levels of Frank or Tyler, Steve Lacy said he was bi a few days ago and nobody even cared. Have things changed in 5 years? I guess so.",hiphopheads,1141

ultimatemanan97,2017-07-27 09:03:11+00:00,[Serious] Please help us r/Overwatch,"**Edit 2:** Heroes of the Storm has a server selector in-game that you can see in [this image](http://i.imgur.com/gWaM9Tn.jpg) just adding this thing would solve everything. I won't mind having to wait longer for fairer matches if it means that I can play them at decent pings. 

---

Since the past week all the players of the  Southeast Asia and Oceanic region have been experiencing horrible ping. This is because these regions are bundled together in the ""Americas"" region by Blizzard. Normally this isn't so much of an issue, however since the past week all of us are being placed in US servers which is messing up everything.

It has gotten to the point that every few minutes there is a post on the forums regarding this issue but Blizzard has not even acknowledged that this is happening.

This has plagued me and my friends from barely playing any Overwatch this week. It simply isn't possible to enjoy the game at such high pings. Please Blizzard at least communicate that you are aware of this issue and are trying to fix it if you are. I really love this game Blizzard, please fix the servers.

You can see the forums here: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/22813880/

**TL;DR:** Southeast Asia servers have been fucked for a week, Blizzard has been silent.

**Edit:** Some people have pointed out [this](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20758315638?page=17#post-335) link which is a reply by a Blizzard rep from an hour ago. My concern is that the reply is in regards to high latency and not incorrect server matching which is the issue here. Because if you connect players in servers halfway across the world they are going to get shit latency. However there is also the mention of the incorrect server issue in this thread so I'm hoping that they are working on it.

DevinBookerGOAT,2017-07-22 21:50:13+00:00,A requiem for the Miami LeBron era,"I'm sitting in the airport bored right now, so I started watching some old NBA highlights and a wave of nostalgia hit me. I couldn't stop thinking about how much I liked basketball back then. The league was just more fun the the Heatles were together. Plain and simple. I didn’t start seriously following the sport until around 10 years ago, so there’s a lot I didn’t experience. But I miss the days when LeBron was in Miami. The league was just better. I reminisce fondly, and I'm sure a lot of you guys do too.


-----------------------------------------


Now, for a trip down memory lane.


What I miss the most about the Heatles era was the unique storyline that every season seemed to have. It felt like each team was competing against each other rather than everyone competing against the Warriors or Cavs. It wasn't one big arms race to take down the top- it was a fight to get to the top. Each season had something different in store. Sometimes it really is about the journey I guess.


Yet I digress. Some crazy shit happened in this time period that we may never see again. To kick it off, we had The Decision. One of the worst PR moves in the history of professional sports besides Donald Sterling ramming his head up his ass repeatedly. The jersey burnings, the Gilbert letter, dearing down the poster. It was a sight to see. Sorry KD, but LeBron did it better.


The Heat instantly became the most hated team in the NBA. I hated them. I bet you did too. And that’s great. Because they embraced that villain role.  It was fun to hate the Heat. That’s just what you did. In my opinion, it made the league that much more exciting. Warriors hate is alright, but none of them other than Draymond can really play that villain role. Wouldn’t that be awesome? 


Instead, we get an overly dominant dynasty led by baby-faced assassain Steph Curry. I'm sorry, but the guy is just not meant to be a villain. Always the underdog, he's vividly remembered for Davidson's Cinderella run back in '08 or whenever. He's too nice for me to hate in the same way I hated LeBron in Miami.


As for KD, this is where vitriol for him fades into a grey area. It's popular to hate him after leaving OKC. Speaking as a Suns fan, I don't hate him like thunder fans do. It's not an enemy kind of hate. It's more of a feeling of disappointment and disgust. He tipped the scales too far in the league. Simply put, I'm just sad about his choice.


Draymond is a popular candidate to hate. His loud-mouthed, energetic, and naturally moving style of play is polarizing. However, it's just not the same. Draymond is a great player, a Swiss Army knife on the court. At the end of the day though, he doesn't lead the team to victory. That's Steph and KD. With that in mind, I just can't hate Draymond in the same way that one would hate Steph, LeBron, Kobe, etc. He's not enough of an independent star to be the face of a team and carry them to victory.


------------------------------------------


October 2011. The Heat arrived, ready to win. However, Derrick Rose stole the show in 2011, winning the MVP and leading the Bulls to the one seed. Meanwhile out west, it was more of the same with San Antonio and the Lakers winning the top two seeds. The regular season was all Heat in terms of scrutiny and coverage. You might also remember this season for the trades. The Jazz dealt Deron Williams to the Nets shortly after he ran Jerry Sloan out of town. Also, the Knicks gutted their team landed Carmelo Anthony in a blockbuster deal which saw the Nuggets become Knicks lite for a few years.


The playoffs got a little spicy. Memphis knocked off a banged-up San Antonio in six to start the postseason off. Questions abounded about the Spurs demise. Hilarious in hindsight, I know. This blew the west wide open. The Thunder made quick work of Memphis and clinched their spot in the WCF. The Mavericks, fresh off a scare against Portland, sweeps defending champion Los Angeles and starts them down a tailspin. Dirk ascends into one of the all time greats with clutch performance after clutch performance, beating a young and promising OKC in 5. Meanwhile, LeBron and co. run through the east, including that same Bulls team who beat them out for the top seed. Miami looked unstoppable. The were heavily favored against the Mavs and rightfully so. On paper, the Heat were overwhelmingly talented. However, Dallas did not back down. After falling down 2-1, they stormed back behind Dirk’s otherworldly scoring and upset Miami. LeBron was crucified after this loss for being a choker. He did shrink on the biggest stage, probably the most profound black eye on his legacy. The Mavericks got sweet, sweet revenge for 2006 and Dirk his ring. This was one of the best title runs of all time and a great series to watch as a fan and an outsider.


Unfortunately, the joy was simply a distraction for the upcoming labor dispute. There was a real possibility that there wasn’t going to be a next season. Wouldn’t that have sucked? Anyways, the league barely got the deal done in time. They had to cancel six weeks, pushing the start back to Christmas Day. You might remember the offseason for the Chris Paul saga. The league denied a trade sending Chris Paul to the Lakers citing “basketball reasons.” Instead, he got dealt to the Clippers. As a Suns fan, this was hilarious. Well, until next year. But anyways, this was crazy at the time and still is.


The shortened regular season began with all eyes on the Heat once again. This year, LeBron won MVP again and led the Heat to the second seed behind the Bulls. The Celtics and Pacers both quietly put up great seasons in the shadows of Miami and Chicago. And who could forget Linsanity? Jeremy Lin exploded, stealing the spotlight from Carmelo which was a big no-no. He salvaged their season in Melo’s absence, but the magic eventually wore off. Mike D’Antoni resigned mid-season after feuding with Melo. Across the Mississippi, the new-look Clippers are fun to watch but still a flawed team. San Antonio continued to dominate with OKC not far behind. Sadly, Brandon Roy had to bring his career to a close. We missed out on a good one. The Mavericks, fresh off of their magical title run, let Tyson Chandler walk, beginning the end of their perennial top four seed.


Playoff time in 2012 was thrilling as an outsider (again). For the involved fans, emotions ranged from ecstasy to crippling depression. For the second year in a row, an eight seed knocked off a one when Philadelphia beat Chicago in six. To add insult to injury, Chicago's young star Derrick Rose tore his ACL, sidelining him for all of next year. He will be remembered as an all-time great ""What if?"" Elsewhere, San Antonio steamrolled the Jazz and Clippers only to be shocked by OKC in the conference finals. The Spurs won ten straight before dropping four in a row to Durant, Westbrook, Harden, and Ibaka. The Clippers and Grizzlies faced off for the first time with LA outlasting Memphis in 7. Extremely underrated series between these two. 


However, the east stole the show this postseason. Philly beating Chicago opened the door for a Celtics vs. Heat conference finals (after Boston beat the Sixers in 7). And what a conference finals that was. The last hurrah for the Celtics' big three, LeBron battling the choker label, and that otherworldly game 6 from the king. With his back against the wall, LeBron dropped 45 and 15. And this was a man who got crucified for shying away on the big stage! This cemented him as a ruthless killer. Remember those ""KD is not nice"" commercials? This was his ""LeBron is not human"" announcement. The underdog Celtics did a great job battling an overwhelming Heat team but ultimately fell. 


The Finals seemed so anticlimactic. LeBron had just exorcise his demons against the Celtics and arrived as possibly the most complete basketball player of all time. Miami made quick work of Oklahoma City, winning in five. Harden notoriously laid an egg while LeBron put up a triple double in game five on his way to finals MVP. It was all good though. The Thunder were bound to make it back with their incredibly young and promising stars.


Well, sometimes things are just too perfect. Someone had to pay Harden, KD, Westbrook, and Ibaka. And it sure as hell wasn't going to be Clay Bennett. To avoid the tax, Presti had to deal Harden to Houston for cents on the dollar. Eventually this turned into Steven Adams, so the Thunder got something out of it. Enough on that though. I'm not Simmons. In fact, this wasn't even the biggest trade of the offseason. That would be the end of the Dwightmare in Orlando. In a wild four team trade, the Lakers got Dwight, Philly got Andrew Bynum (process alert), Denver got Iguodala, and the Magic got a shitload of picks/prospects. The Lakers had their star center once again. Pairing him with Kobe seemed like a ticket to the finals. But what is this? LA made another trade? That's right, they sent a shitload of picks to God's favorite team, the Suns of Phoenix for franchise icon and two time MVP Steve Nash. As a fan, this was the end of our greatest era. It was sad. My favorite player got traded to the Lakers of all teams. I was resigned to having some kind of bastardized happiness when he got his ring. They even brought in D'antoni too! What the fuck was that?


Anyways, this Lakers team was the next superteam on paper. It was too perfect. After a 1-4 start, they fired Mike Brown and hired Mike D'Antoni. My motherfucking coach! Nash was constantly injured, Dwight was unhappy, and Kobe looked like Shaq broke into his house and shit all over his carpet. They got it together and actually resembled a good team by the end of the year. However, Kobe tore his Achilles right before the playoffs, punching the city of LA right in the collective dick.

And now for the rest of the league. The 2012-13 season was another great one. Without Harden, the Thunder got the top seed and put up a 60 win season. Not to be outdone, Miami won 66 and nearly set the record for longest winning streak in a season. IMO, this was LeBron's peak as an all around player. He's probably smarter now, and was more athletic in Cleveland, but he was so balanced and versatile that you really didn't have a weakness you could even point to. I mean god damn, the man shot 40% from three! Imagine that today. 

I remember this year for the one-hit wonders, namely the Nuggets and Knicks. Largely forgotten, those two teams were seriously fun to watch. The Nugs were fast paced, high flying, and full of hustle. Iggy, Gallo, and the manimal. Ty Lawson prior to his career imploding too. They beat out some good teams for the three seed. Their Eastern counterpart was the New York  Knickerbockers. This team was before their time. Bombing threes at a record pace, giving Steve Novak serious minutes, young JR in the city. Now that was fun. Definitely Melo's finest season in New York, but it was really Jason Kidd that made that team go in my opinion. 


Meanwhile, the Pacers came to play behind the leadership of emerging star Paul George and fearsome big man Roy Hibbert. San Antonio continued to win, Atlanta kept their playoff streak going, the Grizz and Clips were neck and neck all year, Bucks in 6 was born, and some team from Oakland made the playoffs for the first time in a while. Even the Nets did well with the play of the highest payed man in the NBA, Joe Johnson.


The postseason started with the Heat and Thunder, last year's finals teams, slotted with the one seed in their respective conferences. A rematches seemed likely, but it was not meant to be. Russell Westbrook was injured in a collision with Patrick Beverly, knocking him out of the playoffs. They got by Houston but fell to the Grizz in 5 next round.


Speaking of the Grizz, this was perhaps their finest season ever. They came back from down 2-0 to beat the Clippers and later advanced to the conference finals. Great job Memphis.


Injuries didn't just derail Oklahoma City. Denver lost Danilo Gallinari to a torn ACL while the rest of the team suffered a spinal laceration at the hands of Andre Iguodala. The fast-paced and fun Nugs lost to Golden State in six.


All in all, the Spurs ran through the western conference. Fuck me, right?


The East was far more exciting this postseason. Unfortunately, the Bucks fell in 4, falling short of their prophecy. The Rose-less Bulls won an oddly entertaining series against Brooklyn, the Pacers made quick work of Atlanta, and New York exorcisms their demons and beat the Celtics in six. 


Against Indiana, the Fighting Dolans did not fare as well. JR Smith absolutely vanished after playing so well all year. Amar'e's corpse was useless. The dream had died in New York.


This set up a Miami-Indiana conference finals, an oft-overlook classic. A lot of us forget how close this series really was. Hibbert, George, Hill, and West played out of their minds. Unfortunately, they ran into the best LeBron to ever play IMO. The man shot 51-44-78 on 29 points a game while being the leader in assists and rebounds on the Heat against the best defensive team in the league. Unreal. The series went the full seven, but the Pacers fell just short of doing the impossible.


Part of the reason we forget that conference finals was the epic that followed. Round one of Spurs-Heat showed it's not how you start, it's how you finish. The first five games, save for the initial bout, were not particularly close. That served to set up 6 and 7 as instant classics. With their backs against the wall, LeBron ditched the headband, Bosh made the most important offensive rebound in the history of basketball, and Jesus hit that infamous three to send it to OT. 


We tend to forget game seven in favor of six which is a complete disservice to ourselves in my opinion. Game seven may not have had the high-strung suspense of its predecessor, but it was a classic in its own right. (Quick tidbit- Only five guys on Miami scored in game seven and Birdman only added three. So essentially, LeBron, Wade, Battier, and… Mario Chalmers outscored the Spurs.) I remember Tim Duncan missing an easy layup and slapping the floor just as well as Allen hitting the three. LeBron turning the corner, NOT PASSING THE BALL, and hitting the series clinching midrange shouldn't be forgotten so easily. What a way to end the season.


Well boys, it happened this offseason. The single worst trade in NBA history. After trading Doc to the Clippers, the Celtics were in a full rebuild mode. Meanwhile, the Brooklyn Nets were buyers looking to win. So they sent KG, PP, Jet, and DJ White in exchange for (brace yourselves): Gerald Wallace (who they just traded a first- Damian Lillard- for), Kris Humphries, MarShon Brooks, Kris Joseph, Keith Bogans, three first round picks and the right to swap in 2017. 


Jesus Christ on the cross. The Nets mortgaged their future for three guys above 35. Not only did they trade three first round picks, they even went out of their way to use a pick-swap loophole to give the Celtics another one. I know we love to be armchair GMs but I really think any knowledgeable NBA fan would never have made that trade. Not in a million years.


In all honesty the rest of the offseason pales in comparison to the trade. Damn near half the league fired their coach, even Memphis who had made the conference finals. Phil Jackson made his return to basketball. Masai Ujiri left for Toronto. The Knicks traded a first for Andrea Bargnani, the Warriors got Iggy in a sign and trade, and the Sixers shipped Jrue Holiday to Nawlins for Nerlens Noel and a pick. 


Shameless plug here- the Suns had a lowkey great offseason. We got Gerald Green (good for us), Miles Plumlee (good for us for one year), and a first for Luis Scola. We also dumped a shitload of money to the Wizards for Emeka Okafor and a first. Best of all, we got Eric Bledsoe for Jared Dudley. We got younger, better, and opened up cap space.


When I think of the 2013-14 season, the team that sticks out to me the most is the Clippers. Not the Thunder, Heat, or my beloved Suns. The Clips had the strangest season I've ever seen. IMO this was their best team- Collison as backup PG, Big Baby Davis getting minutes, Matt Barnes starting- and could've won it all. 


They breezed to the third seed to face the Warriors of all teams. Easily favored, the Clips were all but set to move on.


Well, until Donald Sterling ran his racist, senile mouth. He told V. Stiviano not to bring black people to his games and not to associate with them. On a related note, he didn't get his second lifetime award from the NAACP he was supposed to in May. Life comes at you fast.


Subsequently, Sterling received a lifetime ban from the NBA. There was no place for him in the modern league. All the while, his team was casually playing in the postseason. The Clippers were pissed and distracted. Why wouldn't they be? Their fucking owner wouldn't want to associate with all but two and a half of them. LA got by in seven regardless.


The next round was a forgotten classic against MVP Kevin Durant. The Clippers orchestrated one of the greatest comebacks of all time to tie the series at 2 to set up a pivotal game five. I'll never forget the sequence of events at the end. Less than a minute left, Clips up 104-97, KD hits a three. Jamal misses his layup, KD makes his. Two point game. Right off the inbound, Westbrook rips CP3 and passes it to Reggie Jackson who seemingly loses it out of bounds. After a lengthy review, the officials incorrectly rule possession for OKC. On the ensuing play, CP3 (debatably) fouls Westbrook's 3 point attempt. He hits all three giving OKC a one point lead. LA calls timeout with 6 seconds left. On the other end, Paul loses the handle, sealing OKC's win. A crusher. The Thunder take game six and move on. 


I'd like to take a moment to remember how LA got screwed that game five. And it wasn't just against Houston that they seemed cursed.


The 2013-14 season as a whole was probably my favorite since I started watching. The Pacers starting hot and sputtering at the end, Kawhi's emergence as a star, Dallas, Memphis, and Phoenix vying for the last two spots in the west, the Bobcats making the playoffs, the Raptors winning a comically bad Atlantic Division, Damian and LaMarcus bringing Portland back to the playoffs, and on and on. 


I admittedly think back fondly to this season because of our unexpected success. I remember Bill Simmons saying his life would be a failure if he watching five of our games. And you know what? He was right at the time. We sucked.


But sometimes you catch lightning in a bottle. Goran Dragic, God bless that man, came home and led the offense like Nash and Kidd before him. PJ Tucker was hitting corner threes, Miles Plumlee was hitting hook shots, and the Morris brothers weren't being fat dickheads. Dragic played valiantly, earring third team all-NBA, but we feel one game short of the postseason. Such is life.


Speaking of postseason, 2013-14's first round was the best ever. San Antonio was pushed to 7 by the eight-seed Mavericks, powered by old man Carter's iconic buzzer beater. Oddly enough, Dallas was San Antonio's biggest challenge. OKC with MVP Durant faced Memphis and promptly went into overtime four times before blowing them out the last two. Shoutout to Zbo for getting suspended for game seven. The Clips beat GS in seven (quite the series). In fact, the only western series that don't go to seven was Houston vs Portland. LaMarcus and Dwight killed it all series. Troy Daniels was the Hero of the Day for Houston once. However, one play defined that whole series- Dame's buzzer beater. Iconic as fuck.


Across the Mississip' was another classic first round. Top seeded Indiana needed seven games to beat 38 win Atlanta. To this day Indiana's implosion is a mystery. Miami laughed Charlotte off the court. Toronto and Brooklyn went to seven as well. I irrationally got really into this series. I was really rooting for Lowry and co to pull this one out. That very last play in game seven couldn't have been more telegraphed. Fuck you Casey. Lastly, the Wall Star made his playoff debut, knocking off Chicago behind the expert tactician Playoff Wittman's leadership.


In the semis OKC beat LA (see above) and San Antonio ran through a bench-less Portland. The Wizards kept it close, but collapsed in game 4, blowing a shot to tie the series. Indiana survives. Miami made quick work of Brooklyn even though Brooklyn swept them in the regular season. Who knew?


This set up a pair of rematches in the conference finals. The Spurs had lost to the Thunder in 2012 but had a new weapon- Kawhi Leonard. To make matters worse for OKC, Serge Ibaka was out for the first two games. Subsequently, San Antonio took the first two quite easily. In game three, Ibaka made his triumphant return. His defensive versatility led OKC to wins in games three and four with a rematch with Miami looming. San Antonio surprisingly responded by eviscerating OKC in game five and later edging them out in OT. Old man Duncan rode again.


Meanwhile, Indiana may have been running on fumes but were ready to put up a fight. They came out swinging in game one but fell in the next three. Indy came back from a double digit deficit to force a game six but it was all for naught. Miami advanced once again, crippling Roy Hibbert's career in the process.


The Finals, well, were not so good. You remember game one for the AC going this the LeCramp debacle. Game two actually was close with Miami evening it up. Then it got ugly. The Spurs' team ball and use of dribble handoffs stymied the Heat's hyper aggressive switching. Kawhi became the guy while Wade fossilized on court. The Heat were simply too thin, slow, and old for San Antonio.


This, coupled with some fortuitous lottery luck, made coming home an appealing option for LeBron. On July 11th, 2014, he made his choice. The rest is history.


-----------------------------------------


The past three years, we’ve known the finals matchup far beyond the playoffs started (and even the champion in the preseason last year). I recognize the greatness of the Warriors. They were arguably the best team of all time and will continue to dominate the league. That’s impressive. Likewise, LeBron made the finals for the seventh straight year. What a testament that is to his legacy. I doubt we’ll see such an extreme dominance of a conference by one man in a long time. 


But the playoffs, especially pre-finals, just aren’t as exciting as they used to be. Have we had any pre-finals moments like 2014 when like half the first round series went to game seven? The Pacers pushing the Heat to the brink in 2013 behind Paul George’s emergence as a star? The upstart Warriors shocking the Nuggets? The Grizz knocking off the 1 seed Spurs? The inexplicably thrilling Nets vs Bulls first round matchup? Chris Paul and the Clippers getting hosed by the refs against OKC (loved that Clips team)? The Knicks looking like contenders for a year? These are some of my fondest memories of the NBA- but they were also meaningful. We just haven't had anything like that recently.


Sure, LeBron’s Heat was nearly lock for the finals. But those Pacers gave them a run for their money twice. And the Celtics didn’t go down without a fight. Miami couldn’t coast their way to the finals back then. They had to work for it, and without fail, they always kept it exciting. You could always bet on the East giving the Heat one challenger.


Then there’s the West. What more do I need to say? Even though my team got drilled these years, it was always a blast following the West throughout the season. Things always seemed to shake out differently. The Mavericks went on their legendary title run and promptly dismantled the team. OKC’s young, promising core made their first (and last) finals, an all-time great what-could-have-been. San Antonio’s revival spurred by beautiful team ball and Kawhi’s breakthrough. 


The competition wasn’t just the the top; Every team always came to play. Has there ever been such competitive play from the 8 seed? Let’s reminisce. The Grizz knocked off the top seeded Spurs in 2011. The Mavericks pushed San Antonio to the brink. (Vince Carter buzzer beater anyone?) The new-look Rockets with their freshly acquired James Harden made it a series against his old team.


Competition doesn’t just mean the postseason though. The regular seasons meant more for two reasons: more teams had a legitimate shot at the Finals and the advent of The Process™ had not yet reached the league.


I’ve gotten used to the Warriors vs Cavs finals. 2015 was a surprise for Golden State, but the past two years, we’ve pretty much known they were both going back. To make it worse, the much-beleaguered KD defection worsened the talent disparity. In other words, get ready for more Cavs vs Warriors.


Back then, you had to fight during the regular season because seeding mattered. You didn’t want to slip up towards the end and get matched up with the Grizz. San Antonio, OKC, LA Clippers, Memphis, and Dallas all were serious contenders at least once during this era. The little things during the season could change the course of the playoffs, be it one trade (looking at you Danny Granger), injury, etc. You never knew how things were going to shake out.


I will admit out east it was top heavy. Generally, there was the Heat and one or two other challengers. And in all honesty, that’s better than what we have now. It was fun watching the Bulls and Pacers steal the one seed from the Heat. Old man Garnett making his last stand against a pissed off LeBron. PG force feeding Birdman his shit. Other than that though, it wasn’t nearly as wild as the west. 


------------------------------------------


In a trade that will live in infamy, Philadelphia swapped all-star Jrue Holiday for Nerlens Noel and a top-five protected pick in 2014. This was newly-acquired GM Sam Hinkie’s first big move in Philly. A collective feeling of ""what the fuck?"" filled the air; Holiday was Philly's best player and supposed second banana to Andrew Bynum. Maybe I was just a stupid kid at the time, but it made no sense to me. This is what we can look back to as the start of the process. Hinkie became the first GM to outright say the league is flawed. You need a superstar, and realistically one or two more, to win the finals. The Sixers were nowhere near the bottom or the top. But shit, they had just recently beat the top-seeded Bulls in round one and took the Celtics to seven. This was not a bad team. But that's not what the NBA was about, Hinkie asserted. GMs and coaches can usually keep their jobs by being not bad. Why wouldn't they? Only one team wins. 29 lose. Not one owner could expect to win every year, and cleaning house after each season is definitely not the way to succeed.


But Hinkie didn't want to settle. Complacency was the enemy. He knew the only reliable way to land a superstar was in the draft. Specifically, the top of the draft. 


So the Sixers got bad. And I mean real bad. They lost and lost and lost, but they got their top picks. Just as importantly, they got their assets too. By taking on bad contracts, vets, and exploiting Sacramento, Philly had a treasure trove of picks down the line. They used a lot of their ammo to acquire Markelle Fultz- one of those franchise changing superstars.


Controversial as it may be, tanking has become widespread in the NBA. Since Golden State and Cleveland seem unbeatable, many teams, including my beloved Suns, have decided to start a “youth movement” in the meantime. (Sidenote: Props to Minnesota, Denver, Boston, Toronto, and all the other teams who aren’t rolling over. Godspeed to all of you)


What we have now is an extremely polarized sense of championship or bust. What was about 10 total contenders between 2011-2014 has been whittled down to 3. As a result, tanking has become an epidemic. The Sixers have their well-documented process. Mark Cuban admitted to tanking. My Suns sat veterans who could’ve added a few wins. The Hawks just blew it up. The Knicks are expressing interest in a “youth movement”. Orlando is doing something. 


Can you blame them though? Winning any time soon seems like an impossibility. The west looks like a meat grinder this year, but the Warriors are just too good. And when you know who’s going to win from day one, the entertainment value just isn’t the same.

I used to work for Equinox Fitness Clubs. For those of you unfamiliar, they are some of the most posh fitness clubs and spas in the US, and cater to the wealthy and famous...especially in Los Angeles.

Chris Martin, the lead singer from Coldplay, was a member of ours. He was an incredibly down-to-earth guy who just wanted to get his swim in and get on his way. And since he looked a little like an IT guy, he often goes under the radar.

One day I am giving a tour by the pool, and Chris is drying off after his laps. A woman, late 40s early 50s, is sitting on the ledge and sees Chris...

""Oh excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me!""

(Here we go, I think to myself. Don't mess with him, hes just getting a workout in.)

Chris looks up knowingly, and is getting ready to politely deal with this obvious fan.

""Will you....go get me that noodle over there? Thank you young man.""

He looks at her, takes a second, smiles, humbly fetches her the water noodle, and goes on his way.

thebenolivas,2017-07-19 20:57:36+00:00,Went to a Vic Mensa listening party for The Autobiography last Monday,"[Invite](http://i.imgur.com/mFchYR9.jpg). [Signed lyric booklet](http://i.imgur.com/0mfBtpI.jpg).

It was sick, even liked it more than some concerts I've been to. It was held last Monday at The Last Bookstore in Los Angeles - definitely recommend visiting this place, anytime you're in LA.

Small group, *maybe* 50 people. It was supposedly invite-only, but they didn't check mine. The format itself was like a silent listening party, where everyone had their own wireless headphones (which was a great format for the album, which I can go into later).

Vic was spinning while people filed in. He was right in the middle of the floor, with people crowding around on the couches or heading to the open bar in back. Didn't know a ton on his music taste, but he played some Queen and MIA, and something from Kendrick too.

Then he started his album. He spoke a briefly on the album and the process, and he introduced most songs. He encouraged everyone to walk around while listening to the album, which the headphones really helped with - you could set your own volume and walk around without missing anything. Vic even went around a bit browsing the books, he didn't want people to just crowd him the whole time, and was just a totally different vibe than most types of shows I've been to.

Back to the headphones - they helped with some of the tracks. The first track (and I think the last track) off the album had binaural audio - like '3d' sound that put you in a different place. Just little scenes that put you in Vic's childhood, worked really well. It wasn't used just as a gimmick either, and the little acoustic vignettes were also tied into the songs well.

In terms of the songs themselves, really liked them. Least favorite was actually ""Wings"" (the one that's already out as a single), but I'm not a music critic so I can't really speak well on all the songs. The whole album is really just about Vic's life (*the title of the album*), and it wasn't like hardcore gangster shit, but relatable, everyday shit. Of course there's also stuff about how he's a young millionaire rapper now, and it's not like he grew up like a white kid in the suburbs going to a private school, but it felt real. First and last songs were great, but favorite song might have been ""Heaven on Earth"" - had almost Crystal Castles vibe with the sample. Liked ""Rollin' Like a Stoner"" too (Kid Cudi vibes).

Wasn't even a massive Vic Mensa fan before, but it was really sick. Sick venue, sick event, and sick album - so definitely check out The Last Bookstore, go to a silent listening party, and listen Vic's new album when it drops, even if it's not all three at once.

ALSO - this is a stretch, but if you were there, and you're a short, cute, brown-haired girl with a black (leather?) jacket that was by herself, and smiled at a guy with glasses near the info desk, DM me.",hiphopheads,1221

broadercity,2017-07-17 23:00:28+00:00,Michelle Visage Saved My Life (Seriously),"**EDIT**: Just now realizing how dramatic this title is omfg, but really, she did help me start my journey.

**EDIT^2**: Thank you all for your overwhelmingly sweet comments. This is such a great community. Share your story if you have one!! I'd love to hear it.

**EDIT^Infinity**: *Gold?????* Thank you so much. I was just sharing my story! I promise to update you all with another memoir post-Drag Con LOL!

I've been thinking about writing this story out for awhile now--I plan on meeting Michelle again at NYC Drag Con and I'm not sure quite how to approach telling her this without sounding trite and immature--so I figured I'd test it on you shady bitches first.

So, yes, Michelle Visage really did save me from myself. In summer 2015 my family (mom, dad &amp; me) took a vacation to Los Angeles. I had heard that the RuPaul Pop Up Shop inside that candy store was having a ""Drag Race Meet &amp; Greet"" one of the days my family was there. They had not announced who was going to ""meet and greet"", so I figured it was a local WeHo queen like Raven or Morgan. I wasn't too psyched but still, I was happy to find something draggy to do on my vacation--drag was my escape in small town PA. That and food. I would binge on ice cream and watch drag race every single day. I was a large and in charge, 250 pound, high school weirdo. My doctors were legitimately concerned for my health, and I had frequent blood tests to monitor how close I was to diabetes. I was so excited to be able to get away from the judging eyes that seem to follow people of a certain weight all around LA for a hot sec and meet someone from drag race.

Now, I didn't tell my father all of this. My dad had never been fully supportive of my sexuality or my love of drag. I would spend money to go to shows all across the tristate area and he felt like it was a waste. He had seen the show in his peripheral before but never bothered looking at it for more than a few seconds. Combine that with his brothers and my grandfather trying to convince him to disown me and ignore my identity and I was in a very vulnerable place. I didn't know what was going to happen to our relationship or my future.

I just told him we were going to a cool candy store. Lmao.

We arrive at the store and I make a beeline for the pop up store. He has no idea and decides to take his time looking at all of the candy art inside Sweet LA. 

My jaw dropped when I approached the empty pop up shop. There was Michelle, just standing there, talking to the owner. She had a stack of head shots, but nobody was there to get one signed just yet. Being the excitable tweeny little gay I was, I shrieked and ran over to hug her.

She was so sweet. We talked for 20 minutes, one on one--it felt like my own little personal What's the Tea episode! I told her about my life, my struggles with weight, loneliness, bullying, my hopes and dreams in the television business--EVERYTHING. She was sympathetic, but gave me tough love, like a mother would. She gave me advice on everything, just the two of us, in the back of this tourist trap candy store in Hollywood. I teared up about 25 minutes in, she teared up--it was so heartwarming.

Then, my dad found me. I was scared to see how he would react. He recognized her immediately.

Before he could say anything, Michelle gave him a hug and said ""Hi there! You must be his dad!"" in the most welcoming voice. She told him what a great son he had, how ambitious I am, how she knows how we've struggled and she's gone through the same stuff with her kids. My dad began to tear up. We HAD been through a lot, especially that year. And she connected with my family and gave us a really timeless piece of advice, that while cliche, saved us: ""Do you. Anytime, anywhere. Let him do him, dad. Anytime, anywhere. He'll thrive if you do."" I'll never forget it.

This moment marked a shift in my dad's attitude towards me and my identity--he found Michelle to be so eloquent and asked me if they talked about this stuff on drag race. He was intrigued. So my mom, my dad, and I all started watching together every single week. We've been to shows together now.

[Now for her advice to me--on fitness, health, bullying: I started listening intently to her advice on the podcast about health. While some might roll their eyes, I listened and adapted her admittedly manic eating habits to my lifestyle. **In the past two years I've dropped down to 175 pounds!**](https://www.instagram.com/p/BVX4UcAAbkf/?taken-by=brdans). I was so motivated by her advice. 

As for her advice on ""doing me"" and my future, I decided to stop being scared of not following in my father's shadow and I applied to NYU Stern for business--and got in. Now, I'll be embarking on my freshman year in just about 6 weeks. One week after moving into my new home in NYC (where Michelle encouraged me to flock to) I'll be going to Drag Con. And I want to tell Michelle this story. 

No matter how cliche it sounds, she really was a beacon of hope for me over the past couple years. She motivated me to pursue my dreams and broke open my dad's rough exterior. 

So, what do you guys think? I'll attach some pics too.

wordblender,2017-07-15 20:32:50+00:00,"The 'American Dyatlov Pass'. Five young men abandon a warm, safe car and disappear into the night.","This mystery was brought up in another thread thanks to /u/lavenderfloyd. 

/u/anabundanceofsheep called it 'A suburban American Dyatlov Pass'. And I have to agree. This mystery is heartbreaking, full of twists and turns, and many unanswered questions. 

Four of the five young men were found deceased. One of the deceased was found in a cabin. That cabin contained food and enough fuel to last for months- yet the fuel was never used and the man found there had lost almost 100 lbs and died of exposure. Three of the men were found deceased in various areas outside the cabin. 

There were some possible signs of the fifth man in another cabin nearby- yet his remains have never been found and he is presumed deceased with his body yet to be discovered. What drove these young men to abandon their still operable car? Why were they all found in different spots? Why wasn't the fuel in the cabin used and why didn't they all stay in that cabin since it had plenty of food and fuel?

[Here's an article on the case. Since it's so well written, I've used it below to help explain the details.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1978/07/06/5-boys-who-never-come-back/f8b30b11-baeb-4351-89f3-26456a76a4fb/?utm_term=.58f78a45df43)

There was a half moon that night, a winter moon in a cloudless sky. Up in the mountains above the Feather River, the snow-drifts sometimes rose to 15 feet.

""You need a coat,"" Ted Weiher's grandmother had said, watching him go.

""Oh, Grandma, I won't need a coat,"" Weiher had said. ""Not tonight.""

Two hours before midnight last Feb. 24, when the basketball game ended at the California State University at Chico, five young men from the flatlands 50 miles to the south climbed into a turquoise and white 1969 Mercury Montego and drove out of the parking lot. They were fans of the visiting team, which had won. They stopped three blocks away at Behr's Market, mildly annoying the clerk (who was trying to close up), and bought one Hostess cherry pie, one Langendorf lemon pie, one Snickers bar, one Marathon bar, two Pepsis and a quart and a half of milk.

Then they walked out of the store, got back in their car, drove south out of Chico and disappeared.

Ted Weiher's woke up afraid, at 5 the next morning. She cannot say what woke her up, except that maybe the Lord decided it was time to end her one last night of solid sleep. Ted's bed was empty.

The house was still and it was not quite light and this is how the horror began, as it often does: no crash, no wailling, just a dim morning chill in a small house on what ought to be an ordinary day.

Imogene Weiher got on the phone and called Bill sterling's mother as fast as she could.

Juanita Sterling had been up since 2 a.m. ""Bill didn't come home either,"" she said.

Mrs. Sterling had already called Jack Madruga's mother. Jack also had not come home. Mrs. Weiher called Jackie Huett's mother and Mrs. Weiher's daughter-in-law walked down the street to talk to Gary Mathias' stepfather. All five friends had vanished. At 8 that evening, Mrs. Madruga called the police.

The boys had never done such a thing before.

They were men, really, not boys - Huett was the youngest, at 24, and Weiher was 32 - but their families called them boys, our boys. They lived at home. Three of the five had been diagnosed retarded; Madruga, although undiagnosed, according to his mother, was generally thought of as slow, and Mathias was under drug treatment for schizophrenia, a psychotic depression that first appeared five years ago and that his doctor says had not resurfaced for the past two years.

They were supposed to play a basketball game of their own on Feb. 25, part of a tournament, with a free week in Los Angeles if they won. Their clothes had been laid out the evening of the 24th, before they left for Chico - each had a beige T-shirt, the words ""Gateway Gators"" emblazoned across the chest, from the Yuba City vocational rehabilitation center for the handicapped where they all played basketball. Weiher had asked his mother to wash his new white high-topped sneakers for the tournament (he had scuffed them while trying them out); Mathias had just about driven his mother crazy with the game. ""We got a big game Saturday,"" Mathias kept saying. ""Don't you let me oversleep.""

Saturday came and went and no word came. The police began to take interest. On Tuesday, Feb. 28, they found Madruga's Mercury, and from that day on nothing they found, nothing anybody told them, seemed to make any sense.

The car was 70 miles from Chico, on a deserted and rut-ravaged mountain road. It had stopped at the snow line, and although its tires had apparently spun, the car was not really stuck; five men easily could have pushed it free. The gas tank was a quarter full. Four maps, including one of California, lay neatly folded in the glove compartment. The keys were gone, but when police hot-wired the car the engine started immediately.

Both seats were littered with the wrappers of the food bought at Behr's. Everything had been eaten except the Marathon bar, which was half gone.

And the car's underside was undamaged. This heavy American car, with a low-hanging muffler and presumably with five full-grown men inside, had wound up a stretch of tortuously bumpy mountain road - apparently in total darkness - without a gouge or dent or thick mudstain to show for it. The driver had either used astonishing care and precision, the investigators figured, or else he knew the road well enough to anticipate every rut.

The families say only Madruga drove that car, ever. And the families say Madruga, who disliked camping and hated the cold, did not know that road.

None of the boys knew the road, as far as anybody could tell. Once about eight years earlier, Bill Sterling had gone fishing with his father at a cabin not far away, but he had not enjoyed himself and had stayed home the few times the Sterlings went back. Three years ago Weiher had hunted deer with friends in the Feather River country, but it was quite a way west of the area where the car was found, and his family says he was not keen on the forest either. With the exception of Mathias, who occasionally stayed out all night with friends, each of the lost men led mostly stay-at-home lives of such scheduled predictability that no one could fathom what - or who - might have taken them up that lonely road in mountains. 

A storm whistled in the day the car was found, dropping nine inches of snow on the upper mountain. The search teams nearly lost men themselves two days later, as their Snow-cats struggled through the drifts. Nobody found anything, not so much as a shoe, unti lafter the spring thaw, when on June 4 a small group of Sunday motorcyclists wandered into a deserted forest service trailer camp at the end of the road and inhaled a nau-seating smell.

It was Ted Weiher, stretched out on a bed inside the main 60-foot trailer, frozen to death. Eight sheets had been pulled over his body and tucked around his head. His leather shoes were off, and missing. A table by the bed held his nickel ring with ""Ted"" engraved on it, his gold necklace, his wallet (with cash inside.) and a gold Waltham watch, its crystal missing, which the families say had not belonged to any of the five men.

Weiher had been a tall, heavy-set follow back in February - 5 feet 11, 200 pounds. By the time his body was found he had lost from 80 to 100 pounds.His feet were badly frostbitten. The growth of beard on his face showed that he had lived apparently, in starving agony inside that trailer, for anywhere from eight to 13 weeks.

He was 19.4 miles from the car, Weiher, wearing a striped velour shirt and lightweight green pants, had walked or run, or been somehow taken in the moonlight through almost 20 miles of 4-to-6-foot snowdrifts to reach the locked trailer where he died.

The trailer had been broken into through a window. No fire had been built although matches were lying around and there were paperback novels and wood furniture that would have burned easily. More than a dozen C-ration cans from an outside storage shed had been opened and emptied - one had been opened with an Army P38 can opener, which only Madruga and Mathias who had served in the Army, probably knew how to use - but no one had opened a locker in the same shed containing enough dehydrated Mexican dinners and fruit cocktails and assorted other meals to keep all five alive for a year.

No one had touched the propane tank in another shed outside, either. ""All they had to do was turn that gas on,"" says Yuba County Lt. Lance Ayers, ""and they'd have had gas to the trailer, and heat.""

All though the spring, the search for the boys had practically consumed Ayers. He had gone to Marysville High School with Weiher and his brothers, although he had not known them well, and there was something about this silent disappearance of five strong men that haunted him like nothing he had ever investigated. Leads were drifting in from all parts of the country. The boys had been seen in Ontario; the boys had been seen in Tampa; the boys had been seen entering a movie theater in Sacramento accompanied by an older man. Ayers could punch holes in all of them. Skeptical but desperate, the consulted psychics: One told him the boys had been kidnapped to Arizona and Nevada; another said the boys had been murdered in Oroville, in a two-story red house, brick or stained wood, with a gravel driveway and the number 4723 or 4753.

For two solid days Ayers drove every street in Oroville, looking for that house. It did not exist.

Before long he could rattle off their names and vital statistics almost automatically. Theodore Earl Weiher, brown eyes, curly brown hair, handsome beer-bellied, friendly in a trusting child's way (he waved at strangers and brooded for hours if they did not waveback); got a good chuckle out of phoning Bill Sterling and reading from newspaper items or oddball names from the telephone book; employed for a while as a janitor and snack bar clerk but quit at the urging of his family, who thought Weiher's slowness was causing problems. Jackie Charles Huett, 24, 5 feet 9, 160 pounds, slight droop to the head, slow to respond, a loving shadow to Weiher, who looked after Huett in a protective sort of way and would dial the phone for him when Hyett had to make a call. Jack Antone Madruga, 5 feet 11, 190 pounds, high school graduate and Army veteran, brown eyes, brown hair, heavy-set, laid off in November from his job as a busboy for Sunsweet growers. William Lee Sterling, 5 feet 10, 170 pounds, dark brown hair, blue eyes, Madruga's special friend, deeply religious, would spend hours at the library reading literature to help bring Jesus to patients in mental hospitals. Gary Dale Mathias, 5 feet 10, 170 pounds, brown hair, hazal eyes, 25, assistant in his stepfather's gardening business. Army veteran with psychiatric discharge after drug problems that developed in Germany five years ago.

By late spring Ayers was dreaming about the boys at night. Once he woke in the darkness, arms outstretched: He had almost embraced all five.

""You do a lot of handshaking."" Ayers says. ""And a lot of drinking."" 

Then there was the man who saw lights on the road. Joseph Shones, 55, told police he drove his Volkswagen bug up that same road sometime after 5:30 the evening the boys disappeared. He said he was checking the snow line, because he wanted to bring his wife and daughter up that weekend. His car got stuck in the snow just above the snow line - about 50 yards beyond the place where the Mercury would be found - and as Shones was trying to free his car, he said, he had a heart attack. (Doctors later confirmed to investigators that Shones had indeed suffered a mild heart attack.)

Shones lay in the car with engine on and the car heater going, he said. Sometime in the night, he heard what he described as whistling noises a little way down the road, and he got out of his car. What he saw looked like a group of men and a woman with a baby, he said, walking in the glare of a vehicle's headlights. He thought he heard them talking. Shones said he yelled for help, but the headlights went out, and the talking stopped.

Shones got back into his car and lay down again, he said. Sometime later, maybe a couple of hours, he saw lights outside his car window - flashlight beams, he said. Again he called for help.The lights went out and whoever was out there went away. Shones said he lay in the car until it ran out of gas, and then while it was still dark he walked back eight miles to the lodge called Mountain House, where he had stopped for a drink before heading up the road. Just below his Volkswagen, in the place where he had heard the voices, he passed the Mercury Montego sitting empty in the middle of the road.

The day after Weiher's body was discovered, searchers found the remains of Madruga and Sterling. They lay on opposite sides of the road to the trailer, 11.4 miles from the car. Madruga had been partially eaten by animals and dragged about 10 feet to a stream: he lay face up, his right hand curled around his watch. Sterling was in a wooded area, scattered over about 50 feet. There was nothing left of him but bones.

Two days later, just off the same road but much closer to the trailer, Jackie Huett's father found his son's backbone. Ayers had tried to talk him out of joing the search, fearing something like that might happen, but Huett, whose first name is Jack, had insisted on going. There were a few other bones around, along with Jackie's Levis and ripple-soled ""Get Theres"" shoes. An assistant sheriff from Plumas County found a skull the next day, about 100 yards downhill from the rest of the bones. The family dentist identified the teeth as those of Jackie Huett.

Huett's remains had lain northeast of the trailer, like Sterling's and Madruga's. Northwest of the trailer, about a quarter mile away, searchers found three wool forest service blankets and a two-cell flashlight lying by the side of the road. The flashlight was slightly rusted and had been turned off. It was impossible to tell just how long it had been there.

They found no sign of Gary Mathias.

His tennis shoes were inside the forest service trailer, which suggested to investigators that he might have taken them off to put on Weiher's leather shoes - particularly since Weiher had bigger feet, and Mathias' feet might have swollen with frosbite. But that was pure conjecture, which was all they had.

State mental institutions have received a description of Mathias - slender, dark-haired, double vision without his glasses. He was not carrying his billfold when he left the house for the Chico basketball game, so he had no identification on him, and if he is still alive he has been without the drugs he needs for the last four months.

Mathias took his medicine weekly, as he had for at least three years - stellazine and cogentin, both used in the treatment of schizophrenia. His family says the illness appeared five years ago, while he was in the Army in Germany. Police records show he had become violent on occasion - he was charged with assault twice - and there was a difficult period, after his return from Germany, when Mathias would fail to take his drugs and lapse into a disoriented psychosis that usually landed him in a Veterans Administration hospital. ""Went haywire,"" is how Bob, his stepfather, puts it.

For the last two years, though, Mathias had been working steadily in his stepfather's business and was taking his medication so faithfully that a local doctor who knows Mathias well calls him ""one of our sterling success cases."" He collected Army psychiatric disability pay, was enormously attached to his family, loved the basketball games he shared with the other four men and listened to the Rolling Stones and Oilvia Newton-John on the record player in the living room. Klopf says his stepson took his medicine the week he disappeared. But he and the doctor say Mathias had not ""gone haywire"" in two years.

""What I looked for all the time I was up there were his glasses,"" says Klopf. ""I didn't think the bear would eat that.""

He is sitting at his dining room table. His voice is gruff. He is tired of reporters and tired of the pain and tired of not understanding what happened to the boy. Ida Klopf, across the table from him, says she had not turned on her television in weeks because she does not want to find out that way. She says she is going back up there on the weekend, back up to see if she can find something the searchers missed.

""There's no place to look, Ida,"" says Klopf.

""I'll find someplace,"" Mrs. Klopf says, turning her face away. A Thousand Leads

""Bizarre,"" says John Thompson, the special agent from the California Department of Justice who has joined Ayers on the investigation. ""And no explanations. And a thousand leads. Every day you've got a thousand leads.""

They learned that a forest service Snowcat ran up the road to the trailer on Feb. 23, leaving a packed path in the snow that the boys might have followed.

They took on a water witcher from the town up north called Paradise, who said the he had fixed it so his divining rod would pick up traces of human minerals and then led the searchers to a deserted cabin near the abandoned car.

They found a gray cigarette lighter, the disposable plastic kind, about three-quarters of a mile northwest of the trailer. The families said none of the boys carried lighter.

They found that gold watch beside Weiher's body.

They discovered that Gary Mathias knew people in Forbestown, which is about halfway between Chico and Yuba cities, on a road with a turnoff so easy to miss that anybody driving it late at night might have ended up heading north, toward the mountains, and lost.

But none of it helped. The cabin-found by the water witcher was empty, the cigarette lighter might have been dropped by a hiker, the watch might have belonged to a forest ranger in the trailer mouths earlier, and Mathias' friends in Forbestown said they had not seen him for a year.

And suppose they followed the Snowcats' tracks. Suppose that was how Weiher made it through 20 miles of deep snow. Why?

Why abandon a perfectly operable car to strike out into the forest at midnight?

Why press on through 20 miles of snowdrifts and darkness to break into a lock, unheated trailer and die?

Why drive all the way up there in the first place? And how? If someone chased them, why was the car undamaged? What were the whistling noises and the voices Shones heard on the road?

It doesn't add up.

""There was some force that made em go up there."" Jack Madruga's mother Mabel says firmly. ""They wouldn't have fled off in the wood like a bunch of quail. We know good and well that somebody made them do it. We can't visualize someone getting the upper hand on those five men, but we know it must have been.""

""They seen something at that game, at the parking lot,"" says Ted Weiher's sister-in-law. ""They might have seen it and didn't even realize they seen it.""

""I can't understand why Gary would have been that scared,"" says Klops.

Even a fire, he says, ""All those paperbacks and they didn't even build a lousy fire. I can't understand why they didn't do that unless they were afraid.""

But he cannot imagine what they were afraid of. Neither can the investigators. They can't prove there was foul play and they can't explain it if there wasn't.

They don't even know if Gary Mathias is deadd. They think he is. They think his body probably lay on the snow until the spring thaw came and eased him down, deep inside some thick green patch of mountain manzanita.

There was an incident on the tour bus when the talent was traveling together several weeks ago. We haven’t been able to confirm the details as to why this happened although it had to do with the business and it upset many to the point that Reigns kicked Enzo off the bus and for a time he was given “Miz treatment” in that he wasn’t allowed to dress in the locker room. The line where he talked about his real life being better than his fantasy life was something of a shoot in the sense he’s now based in Los Angeles and having a great time in his non-wrestling life. He was also legit not happy at the breakup of the team, because in reality, it’s hard to see what his prospects are on his own given the way he’s been portrayed as a guy who is a joke when facing real competition

Cass has some heat, particularly with his views on politics as he’s a strong Trump supporter in a locker room where many don’t share those views, but management is super high on him and unlike with Enzo, the reaction of the wrestlers to him will not affect his push, at least right now. But the reaction to him is pale compared to that of Enzo

Vito_The_Dogfather,2017-07-10 17:53:14+00:00,NBA teams as Kanye West songs (OC),"As a huge fan of both the NBA and Kanye West, I wondered how I could combine the two into a OC project. So after a long car trip and listening to all of Kanye's albums, this is what I came up with. 

Atlanta Hawks: Mercy- Not only does the song feature Hawks fanatic 2 Chainz but the Hawks ""let the suicide doors up"" this summer by letting Paul Millsap walk without an offer and embracing the rebuild.

Boston Celtics: Champion- The Celtics boast the most championships in NBA history at 17 but the song also contains the line ""Every summer he'd get some brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from"" which is actually the motto of Celtics GM Danny Ainge.

Brooklyn Nets: Only One- Both make me cry.

Charlotte Hornets: I am a God- Fun fact, Cody Zeller listens to this song before every home game and always shouts the line ""In a French-ass restaurant hurry up with my damn croissant"" at an uncomfortable Nic Batum.

Chicago Bulls: N/A- Kanye never talks about anything that could relate to Chicago.

Cleveland Cavaliers: New God Flow- ""Went from most hated to champion God flow, I guess that's a feeling only me and LeBron know"" Perfect.

Dallas Mavericks: Bad News- Shams reported that after DeAndre agreed to resign with the Clippers last summer, Mark Cuban was heard sitting in his office blaring this song on repeat.

Denver Nuggets: Gorgeous- Denver Nuggets fans Trey Parker and Matt Stone were confirmed unwavy when creating the song ""Gay Fish"" which prompted Ye to write the line ""Choke a South Park writer with a fish stick."" Gorgeous could also refer though to the passing ability of Nikola Jokic.

Detroit Pistons: Everything I Am- I could have gone with quite a few car puns here but instead the ""Everything I'm not, made me everything I am"" struck me as very Piston-y. The Pistons are not contenders and haven't been for awhile, but their refusal to tank makes them who they are. A consistent close to .500 team.

Golden State Warriors: Stronger- This team just won the NBA Championship and they actually improved by adding Omri Cassipi and the legend himself, Swaggy P. Also ""Stronger"" was Kanye's 3rd single to hit Number #1 in the U.S. and I'm not sure if it's well known but the Warriors hit lots of 3's. C O R R E L A T I O N.

Houston Rockets: Facts- ""James Harden running up the budget"" Congrats on the contract extension James.

Indiana Pacers: Heard Em Say- Paul George leaving was their ""Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today"" moment.

LA Clippers: Family Business- ""How's your son? He made the team this year?"" Welcome to the year of Austin Rivers, starting Point Guard, Clippers fans.

LA Lakers: All Falls Down- From being one of the best run franchises in sports to the Jim Buss era, the mighty sure have fallen on hard times but there is a potential savior. ""Shawty holla where the ballers at"" Los Angeles that's where the ballers at, the big ballers.

Memphis Grizzlies: Clique- Name 4 guys on a team you'd want to get in a fight with less than Mike Conley, Tony Allen, Zach Randolph, and Marc Gasol. Ain't nobody fucking with their clique.

Miami Heat: Diamonds from Sierra Leone- Pat Riley has definitely extorted a third world country for profit at one time or anoter. He looks so much like a Wall Street villain that the Movie ""Wall Street"" actually based the look of villain Gordon Gekko on Pat Riley.

Milwaukee Bucks: Flashing Lights- ""Don't believe in shooting stars"" Giannis shot 28% from 3 last season. Also, do Greeks believe in shoes and cars??

Minnesota Timberwolves: Runaway- If you watch the full length film it's 34 minutes, or 14 minutes less than Thibs plans on playing his starters this season. 

New Orleans Pelicans: Monster- Anthony Davis and Demarcus Cousins are monsters when paired side by side. ""Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?"" Demarcus has, in this rumor that I'm hoping that will eventually be confirmed in a Woj bomb.

New York Knicks: POWER- ""No one man should have all that power"" How is James Dolan still in control of an NBA franchise? If there were a series of Survivor: NBA Owners edition, James Dolan would be the first voted off the island.

Oklahoma City Thunder: Love Lockdown/Real Friends- Listen to this song and imagine Kevin Durant singing this song to Westbrook. Seriously, it works perfectly. Real Freinds as Westbrook's rebuttal to Durant.

Orlando Magic: FML- They tried to turn one of the most athletic bigs in the game who shoots 28% from 3 into a corner specialist. FML.

Philadelphia 76ers: Saint Pablo- ""People tryna say I'm going crazy on Twitter"" If you're not following Joel Embiid on twitter what are you doing? ""This generations closest thing to Einstein"" Hinkie died for your sins Sixer fans.

Phoenix Suns: School Spirit- The Suns roster current roster has 4 Kentucky Wildcats but eventually will be made up entirely of Coach Cal students causing him to come to Phoenix to finally prove Kentucky is better by itself than most NBA franchises.

Portland Trail Blazers: Get Em High- ""Why you think me and Dame cool? We assholes"" 

Sacramento Kings: Pick any sad, depressing Kanye song and it fits here

San Antonio Spurs: RoboCop- Kawhi's alter ego??

Toronto Raptors: Two Words- Lowry and Derozan will combine to make just over 60 million so they're living by two words, ""fuck you, pay me""

Utah Jazz: Slow Jamz- The Jazz played at the slowest pace in the league this past NBA season and Ricky Rubio looks like if you came over to his house he would definitely throw on some Marvin Gaye and some Luther Vandross.

They're the guys who entertain us during extensive video reviews, make our team's social media not suck, and are what EA Sports think are the most important part of an NHL video game. But have you ever thought to yourself ""I wonder how much each mascot weights, based on the species it represents?"" I have, I have a lot of free time.

The chart below shows the weight of each NHL mascot based on what it is. The source for this crucial information is whatever came up easily on google. Teams that hate fun and have no mascot are the Rangers and Flyers.

Mascot|What is it?|Team|Approx. weight in pounds

Will De'Aaron eat ass? Is Lonzo gonna be a big baller? Should be our first good look at these highly lauded prospects going head to head.

In case you didn't know, this is their third matchup in the past year. Here are highlights from their [first meeting in December](https://youtu.be/nBQWXqMxoHU). I couldn't really find any head-to-head highlights of their Sweet 16 game in March, but here's [extended game highlights](https://youtu.be/w87X02yTZok) from the whole thing. 


Through 2 SL games:

Lonzo- 8 PPG, 7.5 RPG, 8.0 APG, 25% FG

De'Aaron- 17.5 PPG, 4.0 RPG, 4.0 APG 42.9% FG 

Should be a very interesting game tonight.

clipstep,2017-07-07 19:08:07+00:00,I'm an architect in LA specializing in multifamily residential. I'd like to do my best to explain a little understood reason why all new large development in LA seems to be luxury development.,"Top edit: thank you very much for the gold, its a first for me.  **And thanks to all the contractors, developers, GCs and finance side folks who have come into the comments with their own knowledge!**  Ill try to reply where I can to comments today.


A big part of my job is to ""spec and mass"" potential new large scale developments for developers who are considering building in LA at a particular site.  Understanding the code and limitations makes it pretty easy to understand why no developers in the city seem to be making the lower cost units everyone wants. 

EVERYTHING built in LA is defined by parking, whether we like it or not. More specifically, everything is defined by our parking code. Los Angeles, unlike, say, New York, has extremely strict parking code for all residential occupancies. For all buildings in an R4 zone (AKA condos and rental units with more than 3 units) each unit is required to have 1 full size dedicated parking space. Compact spaces are not allowed, nor tandem spaces. In making our assessments as to required space for parking, the typical calculation is that each full parking stall will require 375sf of space (after considering not just the space itself but also the required drive aisle, egress, out of the structure, etc. **So that 800sf apartment is actually 1175 sf to build.**

 

But wait, there’s more! That parking space for each unit either has to be at ground level (which is the most valuable real estate on the whole project), or it has to be above or below ground. Going underground is astronomically expensive, primarily due to removing all that dirt, and the fact that earthquake zones such as LA have expensive requirements for structure below grade. Even going up above grade is problematic, given that the required dead load of vechile parking makes for expensive structure. **So not only is 32% of your apartment just for your car and otherwise useless, but its also by far the most expensive part of that apartment to build.**

 

Now we have to consider the required open space. **Unlike most major urban cities such as New York or Chicago, Los Angeles has a requirement for each unit to have at minimum 100sf of planted open space on site.** At least 50% of that open space must be “common open space”. What that means in real terms is that you are required, by code, to have a rooftop or podium garden on your building. As a developer you want as many balconies as possible, since you can charge more for a balcony and typically not so much for a nice communal garden / roofdeck. But even if you give every single unit a balcony, you STILL are required to have that stupid garden to a size of 50sf per unit. At least 25% of that garden must be planted with heavy plants / planter boxes that jack up your dead load and thus jack up the cost of the building’s structure. 

 

**So now that 800sf apartment you are building is actually a 1275sf apartment, with a garden and a large parking space.**

 

*Can we take at 800sf and divide it into smaller rooms? So a low income family could live there?*

No we can’t. The required parking and open space are defined by the “number of habitable rooms” in the unit. Take that 1 bed room unit and make it a 3 bed room unit and now you have a requirement of 1.25 parking spaces (which rounds up) and 175sf of open space instead of just 100sf. 

 

*What if my apartment is right next to the metro? Do I still need all that parking?*

In January 2013, LA enacted its first major parking reduction, essentially giving developers the option of replacing up to 15% of their required residential parking with bike parking if they are within 1500ft of a major light rail or metro station. However, these bike spaces must be “long term” spaces, which require locked cages, a dedicated bike servicing area. Also, each removed parking stall requires 4 bike spaces and all spaces must be at ground level, the most valuable real estate on the project. **All this means that the trade is barely less costly than the parking spaces it replaces.**

 

Another thing to consider with building near the metro is something called “street dedication”. A street dedication is the area between the existing street and the area on a building site that you are allowed to build on. Essentially its space the city is reserving for future expanding of the streets (for wider sidewalks, more lanes, etc. Because the city expects more traffic near these new metro stations, they have altered their plans to have much larger street dedications near the metro stations, squeezing the neighboring lots and raising the cost per square foot of each of these lots. Understandable, but it does not help the issue at hand. 

 

*OK, fine. So how affordable can I make my new rentals / condos??*

All developers consider this as a cost per square foot (CSF). While all the parking and open space requirements make the CSF grow, lets just assume that its all the same. A modest, relatively affordable development might be $130 per sellable square foot to build and sold at $165 (these numbers are VERY oversimplified). If we built our tower in New York code, our cost to build would be $15,600,000. **The same tower in Los Angeles would be $24,862,500** after the premium for shakeproofing and higher dead loading. Now we price both buildings at $165 per square foot, and sell all units. We get 19,800,000. That New York building makes us 4.2million. The Los Angeles building? **You LOSE over 5 million dollars.**

 

This is why you will never again see a new skyscraper in Los Angeles with condos selling for the lower middle class. They literally can’t build a legal building to code and charge acceptably without destroying their own business. 

 

**Just to break even, our developer for this project would need to charge $207 per square foot.**  Now consider the cost of land (all time high), cost of tower capable contractors in Los Angeles (at an all time high due to demand), as well as marketing, and paying your employees, architects, surveyors, required consultants over the course of multiple years. $300 per foot would be little more than break even. What if something goes wrong? A delay? What do you pay yourself and your investors?

 

**TLDR: Los Angeles, right now, is simply incapable of building affordable rental and condo towers. The only way to make a new highrise building cost effective is to make luxury units, because what would be luxury amenities in New York or Chicago are required in Los Angeles by the building code, not optional. That was OK back when LA had cheap land and cheap construction, but our land and labor costs have caught up to other cities.**








edit: adding this from something I wrote in the comments because I completely forgot to mention:

**Traditionally, contracting was the best paying ""blue collar"" job out there**, and to a certain extent it still is. If you were smart, hardworking, but didn't go to college, you started hauling bricks on a construction site and then worked your way up to general contractor over the course of years. Lots of the best GCs out there did this. **But, as less and less of super capable kids DON'T go to college, there are less super capable 18 yearolds hauling bricks and 10 years later, less super capable GCs.**



**All that was manageable to an extent before the crash of 2008.** Architecture (my job) was hit VERY hard, but it was the construction industry that was hit the hardest. A massive portion of the best (older and experienced) contractors left job sites, either to retire or go into consulting. Now that development has exploded and we need as many GCs as possible, we architects have to deal with less and less experienced contractors, who charge more and more.



**While there are LOTs of guys and gals out there who can swing a hammer and go a good job on site, being the GC of a major project we are talking about is one of the hardest, most underappreciated jobs out there.**



**Its like conducting an orchestra where, for every missed note, thousands and sometimes millions of dollars are lost.** Everything is timed down to the day, sometimes the hour. Hundreds of people, from suppliers to subs are involved. Any mistake will gouge you. Safety must be watched like a hawk or OSHA will eat you. Its a rare breed of construction worker who can handle this job, and they've never been in higher demand or shorter supply in Los Angeles. In 10 years this problem won't exist (we may have a surplus of good GCs actually), but right now its a dog fight getting the good ones to work with you. They have all the power and charge accordingly.",LosAngeles,2334
Scarment,2017-07-07 16:50:24+00:00,[OC] Ranking all NBA teams by how cool their players names are,"EDIT: Just want to say thank you to this subreddit for making my karma increase by 6x. I know some people may disagree, but these are my rankings. Have Fun! Also, this is definitely a shit post

In honor of the Off-Season, we are gonna be looking at ranking all 30 NBA teams by player…NAMES.
The only criteria is that there is no criteria and I’m just going off of coolest names in my opinion. (Nicknames will also apply). I’m looking for names that flow well, sound like fun to say, however, if it’s a pretty generic name, but it flows well and just goes with the team or is just cool, it gets points. 
These names are names you want on the back of that jersey you bought on clearance from the NBA store cause the player just got traded at the deadline (R.I.P my DeMarcus Cousins Jersey) and also have to be fun to have NBA commentators say. So Bonus points to starters too!
Names that are good also resonate HYPE. We gotta get HYPED in the off-season, and the best players have these names. 

EDIT: FIXED THE FORMATTING. SORRY IM NEW TO SHITPOSTS

30) Utah Jazz

Poor Utah, they lost Free agency and they lost in these rankings. Although their back-ups can compete with “Shelvin Mack and Raul Neto”, none of their starters have cool names. Sure, “Gobert” and “Hood” are alright, but they ain’t cool. Especially on a legendary team that has boasted “The Mailman” and “Stockton” 

29) Cleveland Cavaliers

The Beast in the East is a mouse compared to these other teams. The names “LeBron” and “Love” put this team above Utah, but not much else. “Kyrie” is kinda cool, so there is that and “Tristan” is a name I like, so props to them, but it ain’t cool. The nickname “The King” is actually pretty cool. But what they lose points for is the fact that “Kyrie” doesn’t have a nickname yet, so he’s like a ghost or a phantom that doesn’t exist in the cool world. 

28) Memphis Grizzlies

Da Bears would be much higher on this list if they didn’t lose so many good named players in Free-Agency. The Power Forward position is stacked with cool names like “Ivan”, “JaMychal Green”, “Deyonta Davis” and “Jarell Martin” but every other position is generic like “Mike Conley” and “Tony Allen” and “Chandler Parsons”. God I hate the name Chandler. But I’m Russian so a name like “Ivan” and “Marc Gasol” gets some respect from me.

27) Oklahoma City Thunder

As opposed to the Utah Jazz, who got last place because they lost star players, the Thunder drop spots because they added a star player. “Russell Westbrook”, “Semaj Christon”, and “Dakari Johnson” elevate this team, but “Paul George” sounds like an old American general who served Washington. And as much as I respect the god-damn US of A, we talking bout basketball. Thunder boast a lot of American general sounding names like “Steven Adams” and “Doug McDermott” (McBuckets ain’t gonna score here.). So the 27th spot for you.  

26) Los Angeles Lakers

BIG BALLER BRAND.
BIG BALLER WAY
BIG BALLER ONLY ONE 

25) San Antonio Spurs

The San Antonio Spurs have been a staple of the NBA for a while. They have also played non-exciting, very methodical, and very boring basketball…Just like their player’s names. With the exception of “LaMarcus aldridge” and “Kawhi Leonard”, everyone else is meh. “Tony Parker” sounds too much like Peter Parker and that is just okay. Overall, Not too strong, but has some hope. 

24) Orlando Magic

Bismack Biyombo and Nikola Vucevic help, but this ranking is solely because Mario Henzonja plays here. I’m surprised they don’t play the Mario theme or play “It’s a Me, Mario” as his opening. So for that, they get 24. Everyone else has an average name. “Elfrid Payton” and “Evan Fournier” sound kinda cool. But kinda cool doesn’t get you higher than 24

23) Washington Wizards

“John Wall”, “Bradley Beal”, and “Otto Porter” and pretty decent names, especially because Wall rhymes with Ball like Ball is life. And you can’t go wrong with “Markeiff Morris” and “Marcin Gortat”. Overall average. Also, a name like Jason Smith, which is super American, belongs in the Capital. So they have that appeal to them. 

22) Boston Celtics

If you are a fan of the letter J, Boston is your team. “Jae Crowder, “Jaylen Brown”, “Jayson Tatum”, “Jabari Bird” and “Jonas Jerebko” are all solid names. Also, the name “Guerschon Yabusele” is hype AF, so got to give it credit there. Everyone else is pretty average, like “Smart”, “Horford”, but they do alright. 

21) Brooklyn Nets

Hey! The Nets aren’t last in something! With names like “D’angelo” and “LeVert” and “Rondae Hollis-Jefferson”, Nets fans have something to be hyped for. “Sean Kilpatrick”, “Timofey Mozgov”, and “Aleksander Vezenkov” round out a solid outing of names. Sadly, “Trevor Booker”, “Spencer Dinwiddie” and “Joe Harris” are not hype. 

20) Houston Rockets

Chris Paul and James Harden might be some of the best players in the NBA, but names like “Chris”, “Paul” and “James” ain’t hype. “The Beard” is a cool nickname, so bonus points for that. The starting lineup does not provide that much hype, but the bench does. Names like “Nene Hilario”, “George De Paula”, “Bobby Brown” (sounds like a rapper), “Jared Uthoff” and “Chinanu Onuaku” and “Zhou Qi” are definitely cool. But, minus points because half these players will play for .0001 minutes per game

19) Dallas Mavericks

When you have a player whose name is “Yogi”, you get some love. Every NBA fan loves Yogi Bear, so that’s pretty cool. “J.J Barea”, “Dorian Finney-Smith” and “Dirk Nowitzki” are all pretty fun and definitely worth some points. “Dennis Smith Jr.”, may not sound like a cool name to most, but the combination of the first and last name are pretty chill and can really come off well.


18) Indiana Pacers

Golf player sounding names like  “Glenn Robinson the Third” and “Lance Stephenson” are not hype. But “Victor Oladipo”, “Domantas sabonis”, “Myles Turner” (with a “Y”), “Ike Anigbogu” are all pretty cool with a mix of unique last names, but also great first names like “Victor” (another Russian sounding name). “Thaddeus Young” is a great name though. “Thaddeus” is a great name that should spur legends of hype all through Indiana.

17) Denver Nuggets

“Nikola “the Joker” Jokic” is a pretty hype name and sounds cool all the same. But the main man in Mile High is supported by some great first names such as “Emmanuel”, “Jameer”, “Malik”, “Vlatko”, and “Alozno”. “Juan Hernangomez” is also pretty hype, but it took too many tries to spell out. So Meh. 


16) Chicago bulls

Names like “Lauri Markkanen” (WITH TWO K’S) and “Joffrey Lauvergne” are pretty cool, along with “Robin Lopez” and “Paul Zisper”. But this team is formed with players straight out of a hype action movie. Like a movie about an awesome kick-ass character named “Denzel Valentine” and his buddy “Zach LaVine” who work with this guy named “Dwayne Wade” ( Kinda rhymes?) to take down “Cameron “The Pain” Payne”. Also “Bobby Portis” is the Comedic Relief. 

15) Toronto Raptors

Look, the 6 is here because the entire city of Toronto is cool and is filled with hype. From the Raptors logo, to Drake, Toronto has it all, but it only receives half bonus points because a Velociraptor isn’t going to be beating LeBron James in the Eastern Conference Finals next year. (Even then, I’m pretty sure James would dunk that extinct bird back to the ground). The Raptors have some respectable cool names though. In the starting lineup, “DeMar DeRozan”, “Jonas Valanciunas”, “Serge Ibaka”, and “Kyle Lowry” all have pretty good names that just go so well. The backups also back up the names too. “Fred VanVleet” and “OG Anunoby” and great names so the Raptors get points for that.

14) New York Knicks

It’s hard putting the Knicks so high on this list because of the dumpster fire they have been this off-season, but the player’s names are also pretty fire. “Kristap Porzingis”, “Mindaugas Kuzminskas”, “Willy Hernangomez”, “Joakim Noah” “ Sasha Vujacic”, “Ognken Jaramaz” and “Frank Ntilikina” are all very cool names. But they are very hard to pronounce, so that’s not cool. Overall, fire, like their front office, but not super cool. Bonus points for “Carmelo” being a cool name.

13) Philadelphia 76ers

76ers might be on the rise in these rankings. “J.J Redick”, “Markelle Fultz”, “Melo Trimble” “Joel Embiid” and “Dario Saric” are all pretty cool. Even “Ben Simmons” is a pretty good name. But Nik “SAUCE CASTILLO” Stauskas” is a god damn national treasure. They even made special sauce after him. That alone is amazing and cool and I envy this man who has his face on the side of hot sauce siracha.

12)  Atlanta Hawks

The Hawks definitely have some fly names (hehe puns). But the overall cast is lacking. That being said, names like “DeAndre Bembry” and a guy whose last name is “Prince” are pretty cool. But this team is carried by two reserves “Alpha Kaba” and “DIAMOND STONE!!!”. I mean Alpha is number 1 and “Diamond Stone” is a generational name that is amazing. Sadly, both are pretty buried on the depth chart, so they only take the team so far, but they do it for the Culture. 

11) Miami Heat

“Goran “The Dragon” Dragic” carries this team, but he has some help. “Justice”, “Hassan”, and “Udonis” are great names, and “Dion Waiters” is a hype name. These names have style and personality. They get bonus points because these players play prominent roles in the team so commentators love saying “The Dragon” and “Justice” so props to them.

10) Minnesota Timberwolves

Some people might think this is too high for this team. But like Reservoir Dogs, The Timberwolves are Suave. “Karl-Anthony Towns” and “Jimmy butler” are suave and fashionable names that bring mystique. “Taj Gibson”, “Gorgui Dieng”, “VJ Beachum”, and “Shabazz Muhammad” are also incredibly chill and just sound awesome. These first names belong in a Fast and Furious movie and that gets them points. “Andrew Wiggins” isn’t the greatest name, so they lose points for a name that sounds like a rugrats ripoff. 

9) Golden State Warriors

The Dubs are here solely on nicknames alone. Between “Slim Reaper”, “Iggy” “Chef Curry”, “Swaggy P”, Matt “The Champion” Barnes, this team is very cool. Names like “ZaZa” add flavor, but the nicknames are the real reason the Warriors are competing here. Sadly, not much else is going on for this team. Names like “Kevin” and “Klay” and “David West” and just meh. So they can’t really advance higher than this. 

8) Milwaukee Bucks

“Giannis “The Greak Freak” Antetokounmpo” carries this team here like he did in the regular season, but this time he has help! “Thon Maker”, “Jabari Parker”, “Matthew Dellavedova” and Rashad Vaughn” are great names that can definitely get someone hypes. These combinations of first and last names make an All-Star name squad. Unfortunately, “Gary Payton”, “Greg Monroe”, and “John Henson” are meh. But they aren’t starting so bonus to them.

7.)Portland Trailblazers

The Trailblazers have some swag to them. “Damian “Dolla Dame” Lillard” is an aspiring rapper and that resonates with Hype savants. Names like “Moe Harkless”, “Al-Farouq Aminu”, “Jusuf Nurkic” and “Caleb Swanigan” are all names that make you nod your head and go “Yeah, that’s pretty chill”. This names are fun to pronounce, look good on jerseys, and just exude swag. The team is very balanced, even generic names like “Evan Turner”, “Jake Layman” and “Zach Collins” flow well and sound like pretty hyped players. So points for them.

6) Detroit Pistons

Teams in the Top 7 need to have really cool names that when you see them, you need to be thinking that these are really cool players. But they can’t have ridiculous names that are just crazy. Those are hard to pronounce and lose points. The Pistons are right there. Players like “Ish Smith”, “Tobias Harris”, “Stanley Johnson” and “Luke Kennard” are simple yet elegant names that make you wanna watch this player. But “Andre Drummond” is a great name. “Drummond” is an elegant and beautiful name. “Andre” reminds you of greats like Dr.Dre and Andre the Giant. The whole team is a great source of these kind of names, thus they are very cool. Motor City is also the epitome of cool. The team has always had suave and elegant player names like “Ben Wallace” and “Chauncey Billups”. So the tradition lives on. 

5) Phoenix Suns

No team has been carried more by one player than the Phoenix Suns. “Dragan Bender” is the greatest name in the NBA. But sadly, this is a team effort, thus they lose points. “Eric Bledsoe” and “Marquese Chriss” are cool names, but “Devin Booker”, “Josh Jackson”, and “Tyson Chandler” are meh. BUT GOD DAMN THIS GUYS NAME IS DRAGAN BENDER. LIKE THAT IS AN OP LAST AIRBENDER TYPE AVATAR-****.  

4) Charlotte Hornets.

Sometimes names come up and you just gotta say, damn, that’s pretty cool. “Michael Kidd-Gilchrist” and “Michael Carter-Williams” rock the double last name and you just gotta say that is pretty cool. These jerseys look cool and the names are just overall cool. But these guys are supported by “Cody Zeller”, “Malik Monk” and “Kemba Walker”. All these names are incredibly cool and you just oogle at these guys. Names like “Dwight “Superman” Howard” and “Johnny O’Bryant” may make some people think that these are generic names, but flow is incredibly important in these rankings, and these two names are very chill. Also, they have a guy named “Dwayne Bacon”. Yep. 

3) Los Angeles Clippers

The Clippers may not have a star player (a star name of course), but as a team have incredible balance on the cool scale. Last names like “Griffin”, “Thornwell”,”Gallinari” “Mbah a Moute” and “Beverley” are all incredibly cool last names that just make you want jerseys of them. Even the first names, ranging from an ever-lasting cool “Blake” to “Sindarius” to “ Danilo”, you’ve got  great combination of names.  

2) New Orleans Pelicans

Clean, Cool, and Calm. The three things that are emphasized on the Pelicans. Names like “Solomon”, “Holiday”, and “Anthony Davis” just ooze a clean cluster of coolness that you only find in fancy parties in the movies. Names like “Chieck Diallo”, “Donatas Montiejunas”, “E’Twuan Moore” and “Omer Asik” are fun and exotic. And of course, “DeMarcus “Boogie” Cousins” has one of the best nicknames in the NBA. The Brow and Boogie make a great team, and the supporting cast does an excellent job of creating an atmosphere that just states coolness. 

	
1)	Sacramento Kings

I mean, who else really. This team boasts quality names with  “Skal Labissiere”, “Georgios Papagiannis”, “Buddy Hield”, “De’Aaron Fox” “Kosta Koufos” and “Malachi Richardson”. But wait, there’s more! With free agency, they got “Vince Carter” (which is an awesome name) and “Zach “Z-Bo” Randolph”, so that is completely epic for a stacked team already. And how can we forget “Willie Trill Cauley-Stein” who LEGALLY changed his name to have Trill in it. I mean this team is completely dominant and destroys the competition. So many great names, and so much hype around this team. This is confirmed…that the Sacramento Kings are the greatest team in the NBA.

raisesuccess69,2017-07-04 03:05:42+00:00,"I just got a 25% raise (58k to 72k)! Thanks to this sub for the great advice, details inside!","Hi r/personalfinance. I’d like to share my success story about recently asking for and receiving a raise.

I currently work in an account executive/outside sales position in a medium size, international company (1,500+ people). I was hired and trained straight out of college, which is extremely out of the ordinary for my type of position (most similar outside sales entry level positions are 5+ years experience). During my final interview, I was asked to name my salary expectations. I asked for 50k (which to 22 year old kid, sounded like a lot at the time) and they happily obliged. I received a 3k increase after successfully completing training and another 5k of the course of the next 3.5 years or so. I should also note that I get reimbursed fully on all gas receipts, cell phone, and a 6k per year taxable auto allowance. I also receive a yearly bonus that has usually been about 1 month of salary. My W2 showed 72k in taxable income last year.

I have been extremely successful and have worked very hard to build my own account base in my job the past 4 years. My company and direct managers are very pleased with my progress, they think I’m a hard worker, and I always get great reviews. The real problem is my salary or bonus is not based on commission. I’m salaried with a profit sharing bonus that is based on how well the company (not the individual salesperson) does. 

This past year I did very well based on all measurable metrics. I knew that if I really wanted a raise, the time to strike was now. The past 1 or 2 years, I had been approach by several headhunters. I’m not really looking for a change of scenery as my current industry is consolidating, there are financial woes, and I’m well liked and really like my current work/life balance. However, I couldn’t ignore the numbers they were throwing out. The last recruiter to contact me told me the salary was up to 90k + benefits depending on experience (with a min of 3-5 years experience in my current role). 58k vs 90k is quite the discrepancy.

During my last review I mentioned to my direct manager that I was unhappy that our bonuses/salary is not based on how we do as individual sales people. I also mentioned the fact that I had been approached several times by headhunters. I reiterated that I really enjoy my job and want to stay but asked if there any way to have a review. He said that he would get the message over to HR but wouldn’t promise anything. All salary decision must be reported to HQ in Asia for their decision. 
	
Less than a week later I was told that the president of the US would be in town for unrelated business and he would like to talk to me. We met and had an hour long discussion. I was able to really get him to relate to me, I shared with him the cost of living in Los Angeles, how I really enjoyed working with the company and would like to continue to grow there, and how I felt my number were incredible good. He just was put into his position about a year ago, so he had no idea how much we all made.

He told me that there should be no problem getting an increase for me. All my managers think I’m very hard working, I get very good result, and I always get very high marks on my appraisals. He asked me to name a range and I asked for a bump to the 70-75k range (12-17k) increase. He told me he would send a request ASAP to the global VP who could decide on these matters.

Less than a week later (!!) HR called and informed me that they had agreed to a 14k increase to 72k per year (25% of base!). In return, I gave them a commitment to stay for 3 years. As I mentioned before, there’s a lot of turmoil and consolidation in the industry, so it’s a good time to stay put and ride this out. I felt great that my managers went up to bat so fast for me and my company likes me so much they gave me a huge increase and wants to tie me up for 3 years. I’m also eligible for all future scheduled raises and I’m in a higher bracket for the year profit sharing bonus.

All in all I went from 58k salary to 72k salary effective this month! On top of the other benefits and bonus, I’ll be making at least 90k per year which I’m so excited about! I was very hesitant and nervous to ask but I thought that I deserved it. I lurked this sub for good advice constantly so I wanted to share my story of good fortune! Thanks to everyone for reading, let me know if you have any questions!

Airforce987,2017-06-25 05:50:52+00:00,Which teams have fewer fans than their namesake? (Inspired by post on /r/NFL),"Inspired by the post on r/nfl by /u/TwentyThreeEightyOne

read it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/6jarda/ocwhich_teams_have_fewer_fans_than_their_namesake/) it’s quality offseason ~~shitposting~~ content

Which teams have fewer fans than their namesake? Are there more actual panthers in the world than Florida panthers fans? Lets find out. 

First we have to figure out how many fans of the NHL there are. According to [statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/229021/people-who-are-very-interested-in-the-national-hockey-league-nhl-usa/), there are roughly 13.5 million people who are very interested in the NHL. (Surprisingly, the number was closer to 14 in 2015 but has since dropped somewhat).  However, a [2006 poll](http://jesgolbez.blogspot.com/2008/02/just-how-many-fans-does-nhl-have.html) conducted by the NHL itself claims there are roughly 50 million people at least somewhat interested in hockey. Since this number I think more accurately includes the many casual fans of the sport, lets use that one. 

Next we have to figure out how many fans there are for each team. From statista.com again, we can [see](https://www.statista.com/statistics/243087/facebook-fans-of-national-hockey-league-teams/) the number of likes on each team’s Facebook page (the winnipeg jets were listed as the thrashers and had 0 fans, but the numbers were correct for everyone else, I checked. I also included Vegas’s numbers). There are a total of 26,706,000 fans of hockey teams on Facebook (every team’s number of likes combined). We can then use our two numbers as a ratio to figure out the ‘true’ size of each team’s fandom. 50,000,000 / 26,706,000 gives us a 1.872 multiplier. Each team’s number of Facebook likes multiplied by 1.872 will give us a rough estimate of the total number of fans for each team. 

Lets get down to business. (Disclaimer: most of my research was done simply searching “how many ___ are in the world” and taking the top answer, so take that with a grain of salt.)

**Anaheim Ducks:**

* 419,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 784,368 total Ducks Fans
* Estimates place the current global duck population at 48.4 million ducks

*More Ducks than Ducks Fans*

**Arizona Coyotes:** 

* 305,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 570,960 total Coyotes Fans
* No clear estimate but at least 400,000 are killed in the US per year due to overpopulation so I think it is safe to say there are more than 600,000 coyotes living currently

*More Coyotes than Coyotes Fans*

**Boston Bruins:**

* 2,232,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 4,178,304 total Bruins Fans
* Bruins are bears. There are 8 species of bears, of which the most populous, the Brown bear, only has 200,000 worldwide. 

*More Bruins Fans than Bruins*

**Buffalo Sabres:**

* 500,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 936,000 total Sabres Fans
* There was no information on the total number of sabres in existence, sabres are still used by the US marines for decorative uniforms and are also one of the main weapons used in fencing. Given that the USFA (US Fencing Association) estimated a total of 100,000 members, we can expect the worldwide figure to be quite higher, and thus, the use of sabres to be quite prominent. Also considering their use as art pieces, collectors pieces, and historical sabres kept in museums or armories, there are probably much more than 1,000,000 sabres actually existing to this day.

*More Sabres than Sabres Fans*

**Calgary Flames:**

* 372,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 696,384 total Flames Fans
* I have no idea what a singular flame is defined as, but considering wildfires can burn [millions of acres](http://www.ranker.com/list/the-worst-wildfires-in-us-history/drake-bird)... Granted, there might not be any major wildfires occurring right now, but given than a single flame could be a lit candle, match or fireplace, I'm guessing there are over 700,000 flames lit worldwide.

*More Flames than Flames Fans*

**Carolina Hurricanes:**

* 261,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 488,592 total Hurricanes Fans
* Currently there are 3 active tropical storms in the Atlantic, and there are only an average of 6 hurricanes per season. However, if you consider that hurricanes have been forming since the ocean formed around 3.8 billion years ago, thats an average of 22.8 billion hurricanes. Granted, this list only considers active entities for comparison, so once they die, they don’t count.

*More Hurricanes Fans than Hurricanes*

**Chicago Blackhawks:**

* 2,982,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 5,582,304 total Blackhawks Fans
* Black Hawk was a leader of the Sauk tribe of which there are currently 3,794 members today. Granted, Black Hawk himself is dead, therefore there are 0 Blackhawks

*More Blackhawks Fans than Blackhawks*

**Colorado Avalanche:**

* 766,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 1,433,952 total Avalanche Fans
* It is impossible to know how many avalanches occur per year, given than we only know of the ones that humans have logged. They also vary on scale and size. However, 150 people per year worldwide die from avalanches, of which 90% of incidents are caused by the victim or victim’s party. This information assumes that avalanches are unlikely unless triggered by outside interference and probably do not occur that often, at least not enough to be more than 1.4 million avalanche fans. And obviously, even if there were more than that per year, they wouldn’t all be happening at the same time. 

*More Avalanche Fans than Avalanches*

**Columbus Blue Jackets:**

* 296,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 554,112 total Blue Jackets fans
* Blue Jackets can be in reference to either the uniforms worn by Union soldiers during the civil war, or the Union soldiers themselves, of which there are none left alive. While some authentic uniforms may still exist, they most certainly number less than 500,000. Reproductions don’t count since the namesake refers to a specific historical piece, rather than say, the Sabres’ generic namesake.

*More Blue Jackets Fans than Blue Jackets*

**Dallas Stars:**

* 479,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 896,688 total Stars Fans
* There are roughly 1 septillion stars in the universe (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000). 

*More Stars than Stars Fans*

**Detroit Red Wings:**

* 2,090,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 3,912,480 total Red Wings Fans
* A red wing is not a real thing. Yes there is a tire in the logo and Detroit has its auto industry, but the team is not called the Detroit Tires.  

*More Red Wings Fans than Red Wings*

**Edmonton Oilers:** 

* 517,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 967,824 total Oilers Fans
* Estimates claim there are 500,000 workers employed in the oil and gas industry in the US alone, and somewhere between 3-5 million worldwide. 

*More Oilers than Oilers Fans*

**Florida Panthers:**

* 197,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 368,784 total Panthers Fans
* There are currently less than 250 Florida panthers left in the wild, however “panther” also refers to pretty much any large wildcat. This includes tigers, lions, jaguars, and leopards. Even with all cats considered though, there are less than 300,000.

*More Panthers Fans than Panthers*

**Los Angeles Kings:**

* 994,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 1,860,768 total Kings Fans
* There are currently 28 male monarchs left in the world (30, if you include female monarchs)

*More Kings Fans than Kings*

**Minnesota Wild:**

* 632,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 1,183,104 total Wild Fans
* Technically, there is only one wild, as it refers to any land not yet settled, hence *the* wild.

*More Wild Fans than Wild*

**Montreal Canadiens:**

* 1,706,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 3,193,632 total Canadiens Fans
* There are currently an estimate of 15 million Quebecois living worldwide and 8.3 million in Quebec alone. 

*There are more Canadiens than Canadiens Fans*

**Nashville Predators:**

* 265,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 496,080 total Predators Fans
* Predators, while generic, refers specifically to the saber tooth tiger remains found in Tennessee. Saber tooth tigers are extinct. 

*More Predators Fans than Predators*

**New Jersey Devils:**

* 478,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 894,816 total Devils Fans
* While the logo references the Devil of biblical nature, the name actually refers to the fabled Jersey Devil (or Leeds Devil) creature said to roam Southern New Jersey. Neither actually exist, however (at least not on this Earth).

*More Devils Fans than Devils*

**New York Islanders:**

* 306,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 572,832 total Islanders Fans
* Islanders refers to Long Island, where the team played before moving to Brooklyn. This is tricky, because islanders could mean either the island itself, of which there is only 1, or the people of the island, of which there are 7.5 million. I can’t decide so take it as you will.

*Who Knows?*

**New York Rangers:**

* 1,585,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 2,967,120 total Rangers Fans
* The Rangers were named after the Texas Rangers law enforcement agency. There are currently only 150 Rangers in service. 

*More Rangers Fans than Rangers*

**Ottawa Senators:**

* 322,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 602,784 total Senators Fans
* There are 105 Senators of the Canadian Senate

*More Senators Fans than Senators*

**Philadelphia Flyers:**

* 1,201,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 2,248,272 total Flyers Fans
* Flyers are not a real thing.

*More Flyers Fans than Flyers*

**Pittsburgh Penguins:**

* 2,026,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 3,792,672 total Penguins Fans
* Estimates put global penguin population (all 17+ species) at 42 million penguins.

*More Penguins than Penguins Fans*

**St. Louis Blues:**

* 668,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 1,250,496 total Blues Fans
* It is hard to tell how many Blues songs have been written but there are over 600 million recorded songs written in human history with a new one being written every two minutes. Not many are Blues songs but music does not die, so more than likely there are more than 1 or 2 million Blues songs.

*More Blues than Blues Fans*

**San Jose Sharks:**

* 976,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 1,827,072 total Sharks Fans
* Unknown total shark population but at least 100 million are killed each year. Thats a lot of sharks.

*More Sharks than Sharks Fans*

**Tampa Bay Lightning:**

* 533,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 997,776 total Lightning Fans
* There are on average 25 million lightning strikes per day, which equates to about 290 strikes per second. Lightning bolts however only last a split second so not enough to beat out the fans.

*More Lightning Fans than Lightning*

**Toronto Maple Leafs:**

* 1,333,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 2,495,376 total Maples Leafs Fans
* There is no figure to say how many maple trees there are but estimates say there are 3 trillion trees on earth, and over 100 different species of maple alone. Depending on species, age and health, the average tree has over 200,000 leaves, putting the number of leaves in the world at 600 quadrillion. 

Or you can say Maple “Leafs” don’t exist, but I think that’s cheating. 

*More Maple Leaves than Maple Leafs Fans*

**Vancouver Canucks:** 

* 1,065,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 1,993,680 total Canucks Fans
* A Canuck refers to any Canadian, of which there are almost 36 million. The Canucks, however, also use an Orca as a mascot, of which there are only 50,000. But, the name is Canucks, not Orcas.

*More Canucks than Canucks Fans*

**Vegas Golden Knights:**

* 105,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 196,560 total Golden Knights Fans
* There are no “knights” of medieval era left today, nor are they any specifically golden. Although there are a few hundred to a thousand people who have been “knighted” there are not enough to beat out the fans, even if they were golden knights. 

*More Golden Knights Fans than Golden Knights*

**Washington Capitals:**

* 731,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 1,368,432 total Capitals Fans
* There are 196 countries in the world, however 15 have multiple capitals, which total to 212 Capitals worldwide. 

*More Capitals Fans than Capitals*

**Winnipeg Jets:**

* 363,000 Facebook likes x 1.872 = 679,536 total Jets Fans
* There are roughly 200,000 commercial aircraft worldwide, not all of which are jets. Private and military jets number less than 10,000 worldwide.

*More Jets Fans than Jets*

**Teams with fewer fans than their namesake:**

* Anaheim
* Arizona
* Buffalo
* Calgary
* Dallas
* Edmonton
* Montreal
* Pittsburgh
* St. Louis
* San Jose
* Toronto
* Vancouver
* *Possibly New York Islanders*

Do with this information as you will",hockey,2506
kirikiriki,2017-06-25 03:07:01+00:00,Which Teams Have Fewer Fans Than Their Namesake?,"To shamelessly rip off this r/NFL thread: https://np.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/6jarda/ocwhich_teams_have_fewer_fans_than_their_namesake/ I took a look at which teams have fewer fans than their namesake. I found that there are roughly 400 million NBA fans in the world and about 150 million likes for every NBA team. I took 400 million/150 million and multiplied by each team’s likes to get as realistic as possible of an estimate at each teams’ fan bases then started to research how many of their namesake there were in the world. Brace yourself for many wild assumptions.
 
 &amp;nbsp;

76ers:
 
Fans: 3,961,197
 
What an actual 76er is: 1776, the year the Declaration of Independence was signed. Whether this means the actual year, anyone born in 1776, anyone in alive in 1776, or the signers of the Declaration is unclear
 
Actual 76ers: Actual people that were born or were alive in 1776 are all dead now and there is only one year of 1776 so either 0 or 1
 
More 76ers fans than 76ers
 
 &amp;nbsp;

Pelicans

Fans:
4,241,700
 
What an actual pelican is:
Genus of large water birds characterized by a long beak and a large throat poach
 
Actual pelicans:
Estimated at 650,000
 
More Pelicans fans than pelicans
 
 &amp;nbsp;

Bucks
 
Fans: 4,270,717
 
What an actual buck is:
A male antlered animal: deer, reindeer, antelope, caribou, goat, sheep
 
Actual bucks:
There are over a billion goats worldwide and assuming half of them are male, plus the male populations of the other animals, there are a lot of bucks.
 
*More bucks than Bucks fans*

 &amp;nbsp;

Bulls
 
Fans:
48,980,735
 
What an actual bull is:
Adult male non-castrated cow
 
Actual bulls:
There are over 1.3 billion cows in the world and I assume at least the 1/27 of that figure, which would be 48 million, are adult, male, and non-castrated
 
*More bulls than Bulls fans*
 
 &amp;nbsp;

Cavaliers
 
Fans:
23,315,744
 
What an actual cavalier is:
 
There are several definitions:
 
* A supporter of King Charles I
 
* A mounted soldier
 
* A small spaniel
 
Actual cavaliers:
 
I’d say the modern day supporters of King Charles I are closer to 0 than 23,315,744
 
The US Army says they only have 176 horses and I doubt the rest of the world has the other 23 million needed
 
Only 4,259 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels were born in 2014 so I’d say their population is significantly smaller than 23 million

More Cavaliers fans than cavaliers
 
 &amp;nbsp;

Celtics
 
Fans:
22,975,028
 
What an actual Celtic is:
The six Celtic nations are Scotland, Ireland, the Isle of Man, Wales, Cornwall, and Brittany
 
Actual Celtics:
Adding up the populations of those six nations I came up with 20,030,471 Celtics
 
More Celtics fans than Celtics
 
 &amp;nbsp;

Clippers
 
Fans:
9,982,912
 
What an actual clipper is:
A very fast sailing ship used in the middle third of 19th century.  They were fast, yacht-like vessels, with three masts and a square rig. They were generally narrow for their length, could carry limited bulk freight, small by later 19th century standards, and had a large total sail area. Clipper ships were mostly constructed in British and American shipyards, though France, Brazil, the Netherlands and other nations also produced some. Clippers sailed all over the world, primarily on the trade routes between the United Kingdom and its colonies in the east, in trans-Atlantic trade, and the New York-to-San Francisco route round Cape Horn during the California Gold Rush. Dutch clippers were built beginning in the 1850s for the tea trade and passenger service to Java. The boom years of the clipper ship era began in 1843 as a result of a growing demand for a more rapid delivery of tea from China. It continued under the stimulating influence of the discovery of gold in California and Australia in 1848 and 1851, and ended with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869.
 
 
Actual clippers:
The *Cutty Sark* is the last surviving clipper, so 1
 
More Clippers fans than clippers
 
 &amp;nbsp;

Grizzlies
 
Fans:
4,698,574

A large subspecies of brown bear in North America
 
Actual grizzlies:

More Grizzlies fans than grizzlies
 
 &amp;nbsp;

Hawks
 
Fans:
4,155,186
 
What an actual hawk is:
A very broad term for a subfamily of birds
 
Actual hawks:
Just adding up 3 of the many, many hawk species, the red-tailed hawk, northern goshawk, and Eurasian sparrowhawk, comes to more than 4.2 million
 
*More hawks than Hawks fans*
 
 &amp;nbsp;

Heat
 
Fans:
41,475,974
 
What an actual heat is:
The form of energy that flows between two samples of matter due to their difference in temperature
 
Actual heat:
Heat fans all produce 1 person’s worth of heat so even if the world consisted of only Heat fans and some other guy who was a fan of the Knicks or whatever there would be more heat than Heat fans worth of heat. I am not a physics major though so don’t quote me on that
 
*More heat than Heat fans*
 
 &amp;nbsp;

Hornets
 
Fans:
4,501,373
 
What an actual hornet is:
A genus of wasp
 
Actual hornets:
Lots
 
*More hornets than Hornets fans*
 
 &amp;nbsp;

Jazz
 
Fans:
3,036,791
 
What actual jazz is:
We can have a big debate as to what defines actual, proper jazz vs. all the new wave, free jazz crap but I’ll define jazz as a music genre originating in African American communities in New Orleans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries developed from blues and ragtime. 
 
Actual jazz:
1 true jazz, but an argument could be made that jazz lives within us all
 
*Debatable*
 
 &amp;nbsp;

Kings
 
Fans:
4,563,675
 
What an actual king is:
The title given to a male monarch
 
Actual kings:
Unfortunately most countries have moved to other forms of government and the brilliance of the monarchy has been left in the past and only 26 nations have monarchies now 
 
More Kings fans than kings
 
 &amp;nbsp;

Knicks
 
Fans:
15,881,544 (again these are estimates)
 
What an actual knick is:
Either a descendant of a Dutch settler or underwear
 
Actual knicks:
Assuming everyone in the world has at least one pair of underwear there are more knickerbockers than Knicks fans. Also there are 4,500,000 people of Dutch descent in the US
 
*More knickerbockers than Knicks fans*

More Knicks fans than Knicks
 
 &amp;nbsp;

Lakers
 
Fans:
56,571,850
 
What an actual laker is:
A person associated with a lake
 
Actual lakers:
That is a very broad definition I know. There are 117 million lakes in the world and if just 1 person was associated with every lake there would be 117 million lakers.
 
*More lakers than Lakers fans*
 
 &amp;nbsp;

Magic
 
Fans:
7,168,252
 
What actual magic is:
The power of apparently influencing the course of events by using mysterious or supernatural forces.
 
Actual magic:
If you are a little turd you’ll say there’s no magic but I’ll counter there is more magic than Magic fans just in Orlando. The average daily visitor to Disney World’s Magic Kingdom is 52,964 for an average of 19,332,000 yearly. If even half of those visitors have their hearts imbued with magic that's over 9 million magic coming from the Magic Kingdom alone. 
 
*Debatable*
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Mavericks
 
Fans:
11,728,324
 
What an actual maverick is:
An unorthodox or independent-minded person
An unbranded calf or yearling
 
Actual mavericks:
As stated above there are over 1 billion cows so it's safe to assume there are at least 11.7 million unbranded calves and unorthodox or independent-minded people
 
*More mavericks than Mavericks fans*
 
 &amp;nbsp;

Nets
 
Fans:
7,258,299
 
What an actual net is:
an open-meshed fabric twisted, knotted, or woven together at regular intervals
 
Actual nets:
It’s near impossible to calculate the amount of nets in the world because they are such a versatile substance that I have to imagine everyone uses regularly as I know I do
 
*More nets than Nets fans*
 
 &amp;nbsp;

Nuggets
 
Fans:
5,075,452
 
What an actual nugget is:
a lump of something
 
Actual nuggets:
McDonald’s operates 36,899 restaurants and at any given time the average McDonald’s has 1440 nuggets on reserve giving 53,134,560 nuggets in McDonald’s alone
 
*More nuggets than Nuggets fans*

 &amp;nbsp;
 
Pacers
 
Fans:
8,604,044
 
What an actual pacer is:
a horse bred or trained to have a distinctive lateral gait in which both legs on the same side are lifted together, used in some types of racing.
 
Actual pacers:
From what I am understanding from briefly looking at horse racing pacers are rare type of racehorse so I don’t think there are 8.6 million of them 
 
More Pacers fans than pacers

 &amp;nbsp;
 
Pistons
 
Fans:
4,828,479
 
*(Disclaimer I know nothing about cars)*
 
What an actual piston is:
A part of a car?
 
Actual pistons:
I guess every car has at least one? There are over 1 billion cars in the world
 
*More pistons than Pistons fans*

 &amp;nbsp;

Raptors
 
Fans:
5,663,017
 
What an actual raptor is:
a bird of prey, e.g., an eagle, hawk, falcon, or owl
Informal term for a dromaeosaurid dinosaur, especially velociraptor or utahraptor.
 
Actual raptors:
As stated above there are a lot of hawks so adding in eagles, falcons, and owls makes even more of a lot. We could call this one debatable because the actual namesake is the dinosaur of which there are 0
 
*Debatable*
 
 &amp;nbsp;

Rockets
 
Fans:
9,900,717
 
What an actual rocket is:
A missile, spacecraft, aircraft or other vehicle that obtains thrust from a rocket engine.
 
Actual rockets:
I’m really sorry guys but I can’t find even an inaccurate estimate of how many rockets are in the world, but just from my own intuition I’ll say there aren’t 9 million rockets
 
More Rockets fans than rockets
 
 &amp;nbsp;

Spurs
 
Fans:
18,867,789
 
What an actual Spur is:

What an actual thunder is:
The sound caused by lightning. Depending on the distance and nature of the lightning, thunder can range from a sharp, loud crack to a long, low rumble (brontide). The sudden increase in pressure and temperature from lightning produces rapid expansion of the air surrounding and within a bolt of lightning. In turn, this expansion of air creates a sonic shock wave, similar to a sonic boom, which produces the sound of thunder, often referred to as a clap, crack, peal of thunder, or boom. Some might even say the sound is ""supersonic.""
 
Actual thunder:
About 100 lightning bolts strike the Earth every second and assuming 1 lightning= 1 thunder there’s a shit ton of thunder

rickyrockwell,2017-06-25 00:13:09+00:00,WWE Working On Lavar Ball Appearance For Raw Next Week In Los Angeles,,nba,3223
TwentyThreeEightyOne,2017-06-24 21:52:03+00:00,[OC]Which teams have fewer fans than their namesake? A study,"In the Chicago Bears roast thread, 69memelordharambe420 posted ""There are more Bears than Bears fans."" That got me thinking: Is that true? And more generally, which teams have fewer fans than there exist whatever they're named after?

To start, I needed a rough estimate of the number of NFL fans in the world. This turned out to be difficult to find. I found several reasonable estimates that ranged from 200,000,000 to 400,000,000, but the average estimate seems to be about 300,000,000, so I decided to go with that. If you prefer a different estimate, you can easily scale all of the final numbers up or down as needed.

Of those 300,000,000, about [90%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/660525/most-popular-nfl-teams-in-us/), or 270,000,000, consider themselves fans of one team in particular. To find out how these 270,000,000 fans apportion themselves among the 32 teams, I used [this page](http://www.trackalytics.com/the-most-liked-nfl-teams-on-facebook/page/1/), which lists how many likes each team has on Facebook (it lists the St. Louis Rams and the San Diego Chargers but still has accurate numbers for the Facebook likes, I checked), and calculated the total number of likes across the 32 teams: 91,712,968. Then, I took the number of likes for each team and multiplied it by 270,000,000/91,712,968 (then rounded to the nearest whole number) to get the best estimate that I was realistically going to be able to get for the total number of fans that each team has. Here are my results:

Bears: There are roughly 12,092,476 Bears fans. There are [eight species of bear, plus the grizzly-polar hybrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bears). I won't go through all of my calculations, but I came up with a final number of 1,148,364. There are more Bears fans than bears.

Lions: There are roughly 5,642,181 Lions fans. The worldwide lion population is somewhere around [20,000](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/big-cats-initiative/lion-decline-map/). There are more Lions fans than lions.

Packers: There are roughly 16,024,215 Packers fans. I don't really feel like doing extensive research on the worldwide meatpacking industry, but the U.S. meatpacking industry employs about 148,100 and there is no way that there are a hundred times that number outside of the country. There are more Packers fans than packers.

Vikings: There are roughly 6,200,740 Vikings fans. The Viking Age ended nearly a millennium ago. There are more Vikings fans than Vikings.

Cowboys: There are roughly 25,758,315 Cowboys fans. There are currently [less than 9,730](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy#Modern_working_cowboys) cowboys in the United States. Again, there's no way there are over a thousand times more cowboys elsewhere. There are more Cowboys fans than cowboys.

Eagles: There are roughly 8,888,974 Eagles fans. This one was a lot harder than I was anticipating, but there are 60 different species of eagle. Two of the most common are the bald eagle (70,000 in the world) and the most common eagle in Europe, the [spotted eagle](http://www.kotkas.ee/species/spotted-eagles) (40,000 in the world). Based on this, I highly doubt that the average eagle species has a worldwide population of more than 100,000, an estimate which would yield a total eagle population across all species of 6,000,000 (remember, this is most likely a wild overestimate). There are almost certainly more Eagles fans than eagles.

Giants: There are roughly 11,690,931 Giants fans. Giants are mythological creatures. There are more Giants fans than giants.

Redskins: I'm not touching this one.

Buccaneers: There are roughly 2,779,276 Buccaneers fans. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buccaneer), the term ""buccaneer"" refers specifically to Caribbean pirates of the 17th and 18th century. They're all dead. There are more Buccaneers fans than buccaneers.

Falcons: There are roughly 6,009,462 Falcons fans. The common kestrel (5,000,000 worldwide) and Merlin (1,300,000 worldwide) alone cover this number, according to [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falconiformes_by_population). There are more falcons than Falcons fans.

Panthers: There are roughly 7,034,101 Panthers fans. ""Panther"" is kind of a loosely defined term, but the genus *Panthera* includes tigers (3,890 worldwide), lions (20,000), jaguars (15,000), leopards (250,000), and snow leopards (6,000). That adds up to 294,890. There are more Panthers fans than panthers.

Saints: There are roughly 11,930,352 Saints fans. For this study, I've only been counting living things, and you have to die to become a saint. Not that it really matters, since the Catholic Church has only canonized about 10,000 people anyway. There are more Saints fans than saints.

49ers: There are roughly 12,383,284 49ers fans. ""49ers"" refers to people who partook in the 1849 California gold rush. The oldest living person was born in 1900. All of the 49ers are dead. There are more 49ers fans than 49ers.

Cardinals: There are roughly 4,279,156 Cardinals fans. There are about 120,000,000 [northern cardinals alone](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Northern_Cardinal/lifehistory). There are more cardinals than Cardinals fans.

Rams: There are roughly 2,327,583 Rams fans. A ram can refer to either a male sheep or a male goat (note to all of the Patriots fans about to make what they think is a super clever comment: just stop). There are over a billion sheep in the world and nearly as many goats. This isn't even close. There are more rams than Rams fans.

Seahawks: There are roughly 11,993,609 Seahawks fans. A seahawk is another name for an osprey, of which there are fewer than 100,000 in the world. There are more Seahawks fans than seahawks.

Bengals: There are roughly 3,517,293 Bengals fans. There are 2,500 Bengal tigers left (to be honest I'm just going to stop posting sources when the information is a single search away because I'm already tired of this and I still have half the league to go). There are more Bengals fans than Bengals.

Browns: There are roughly 3,738,429 Browns fans for some reason. The Browns are named after someone whose last name was Brown. In the United States, there are about [1,552,500 people](http://www.namestatistics.com/lastname/brown) with that last name. The majority of the people who speak English as a first language live in the United States, so it's very likely that the majority of Browns do as well. There are probably more Browns fans than Browns.

Ravens: There are roughly 6,927,791 Ravens fans. [There are 20,000,000 common ravens alone.](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Common_Raven/lifehistory). There are more ravens than Ravens fans.

Steelers: There are roughly 19,179,380 Steelers fans. There are only about 87,000 or so steel workers in the United States, and I'm just once again going to extrapolate and say that there aren't several hundred times more than that outside of the USA. There are probably more Steelers fans than steelers.

Bills: There are roughly 2,533,838 Bills fans. The Buffalo Bills were named after Buffalo Bill, so it makes sense to use the number of people named Bill. There are about [3,002,475](http://www.namestatistics.com/firstname/male/william) people in the United States named William. Using the same logic as we did with the Browns suggests that there are roughly twice as many Williams in the world as Bills fans, so we'd need at least half of all Williams to go by Bill. Especially considering how many common nicknames for William there are, this seems unlikely. There are probably more Bills fans than Bills.

Dolphins: There are roughly 6,637,669 Dolphins fans. I was somewhat surprised to learn this, but we don't really have much of an idea how many dolphins there are in the world (the ocean is, like, really big). My standards for reputable sources have fallen so far at this point in this regrettable project that I'm just going to use [Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-many-dolphins-are-there-in-the-world-1), where ""Patricia Barquin, Enthusiast"" believes that there are well over seven million. So there are probably more dolphins than Dolphins fans. Whatever.

Jets: There are roughly 5,824,758 Jets fans. Apparently, there are about 20,000 commercial airplanes in the world. A lot of those are not jets, but there are also a bunch of private jets. Either way, there's no way the number of jets is in the millions. There are more Jets fans than jets.

Patriots: There are roughly 20,653,722 Patriots fans. A [Gallup poll from last July](http://www.gallup.com/poll/193379/new-low-extremely-proud-americans.aspx) found that 52% of Americans are proud to be Americans, so there are way more than twenty million people in the U.S. who consider themselves patriots, which is good enough for me. Yeah, we've had an ugly election since then but considering that the president still has an approval rating in the 30s, there's zero chance that the percentage of Americans who are patriots is less than 10%. There are more patriots than Patriots fans.

Colts: There are roughly 6,689,254 Colts fans. A [Colt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)) is a male horse under the age of four. There are 58,000,000 horses in the world. The lifespan of a horse in the wild is about 15-20 years (we'll take an average of 17.5 years) and I do not feel like doing in-depth research into the horse industry so I'm just going to assume that the 58,000,000 horses are distributed evenly by sex and age. That would mean 29,000,000 male horses, of which about 6,628,571 would be under the age of four. This is ridiculously close, but using my obviously extremely accurate numbers it looks like there are more Colts fans than colts!

Jaguars: There are roughly 1,748,475 Jaguars fans, significantly higher than my initial guess of 87. As I said earlier, there are about 15,000 jaguars in the world. There are more Jaguars fans than jaguars.

Texans: There are roughly 6,484,945 Texans fans. Texas has a population of about 27,470,000. There are more Texans than Texans fans.

Titans: There are roughly 2,737,981 Titans fans. Titans are mythological creatures. There are only 26 of them anyway. There are more Titans fans than Titans.

Broncos: There are roughly 13,082,453 Broncos fans. A bronco is apparently just a name for an untrained horse. The vast majority of the world's 58,000,000 horses are domestic horses, and I'm just going to assume that most of those are trained because I don't know why they wouldn't be and also I am extremely sick of looking all of this stuff up. It would be convenient if Reddit had an option to save drafts of posts but it doesn't appear to. Anyway, the vast majority of horses are not broncos, so that means that there are probably more Broncos fans than broncos.

Chargers: There are roughly 4,700,430 Chargers fans. The Los Angeles Chargers [don't seem to have been named after an actual thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers#1960.E2.80.931970:_the_AFL_years), so I'll improvise. I own several chargers. So does everyone I know. Considering how ubiquitous electronic devices are, there have to be billions of chargers. There are more chargers than Chargers fans.

Chiefs: There are roughly 4,568,973 Chiefs fans. [Chief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief) is an honorary title used by a lot or organizations, but do they combine to account for one out of every 2000 people or so in the world? I doubt it. There are probably more Chiefs fans than Chiefs.

Raiders: There are roughly 10,099,869 Raiders fans. Meanwhile, a ""raider"" isn't really an actual thing. It's pretty much only used for sports teams. There are more Raiders fans than raiders, I guess.

**Summary**: So the teams with fewer fans than their namesakes are:

Atlanta Falcons  
Arizona Cardinals  
Los Angeles Rams  
Baltimore Ravens  
Miami Dolphins  
New England Patriots  
Houston Texans  
Los Angeles Chargers  

Make of that what you will.

**Conclusion**: Turns out that there are a lot of birds in the world.",nfl,22078

The (Las) Vegas Golden Knights **[VGK]** [](/r/goldenknights) is the newest franchise in the National Hockey League (NHL). The team will become the 31st team in the league, joining the Pacific Division of the Western Conference, alongside the Anaheim Ducks, Arizona Coyotes, Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, Los Angeles Kings, San Jose Sharks, and Vancouver Canucks - for the 2017-2018 NHL Season. Led by majority owner Bill Foley, General Manager George McPhee, Head Coach Gerard Gallant (most recently of taxi fame with the Florida Panthers), and inaugural player ***Reid Duke***, they will seek to use the expansion draft to spearhead a successful opening season at the T-Mobile Arena. 

The Rules for the Expansion Draft can be found [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCm2KNDUMAEBrTq.jpg). In short, each existing NHL franchise was able to protect a number of players (either a combination of 7 Forwards, 3 Defensemen, and 1 Goaltender or 8 skaters and 1 Goaltender). Those players unprotected are now available to be selected in the expansion draft by VGK [](/r/goldenknights). Vegas is able to select one player from each team's available list.

The draft will be televised on NBCSN, or you may find streams at /r/puckstreams or /r/nhlstreams.

Isuckatthesethings1,2017-06-19 19:01:07+00:00,r/NFL Roast of: The New England Patriots (27/32),"**Guidelines**

1.	Let’s try to be more creative than “lul cowboys” or “no rings” jokes. These jokes are unfunny and unimaginative and we all know we are better than that.

2.	This is a roast thread, please take all jokes as well…..a joke. I saw a few cases of retaliation and arguing. Jokes are Jokes, don’t like it? Move on.

3.	NO OTHER TEAM BASHING, save that precious ammo for when that teams time to be roasted comes.


4.	No malicious posts, trolling, or over the top comments attacking r/nfl users. As i said before this is supposed to be light hearted and fun, lets keep it that way.

5.	The next team up will be posted in the thread the day before, so you guys will have time to come up with material and decent jokes referring to the team.


6.	Have fun! This is meant to be lighthearted thread and they are to be taken as such. The off season can be long and hopefully this series will provide some fun to pass the time. So roast away!!






Please be sure to PM me any jokes you think would be good enough to make it into the “Best of” series!

-	Be sure to send me the permalink to the comment, please do not copy and paste jokes into the PM

-	Also please label the message in the PM something along the lines of Best of Roast of “Team name being roasted” It just makes things easier for me as I will be compiling it all.

And as always feel free to reach out with any questions you may have about the series.

Investigation proved the involvement of organized crime in human trafficking, as well as the fact that British, Israeli and Soviet intelligence agencies were purchasing blackmail material
If you guys check out the addresses listed where kids were being prosecuted you will find that they had some interesting (and powerful) neighbors
So part of that FOIA reads -


""Detectives found that organized crime did play a role in the distribution of child pornography, but that the day-to-day activity in regards to child prostitution appeared to be run by a group of collectors who would, “trade material and trade male prostitutes back and forth.” The investigation revealed that young male and female minors were being transported between California and D.C. along a route known as the “California Connection.” The route was part of a circuit which encompassed Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New Orleans, New York, D.C., and Florida. According to detectives, clients could call a phone number in Houston from Washington and have a young boy delivered directly to their location. These purchases were incredibly streamlined and could even be made with credit cards which were charged to front companies under various guises such as photography studios, book stores, models, and model agencies.

Minors were also prostituted out of bars. In some cases, there would be as many as 50 to 75 minors at a single bar. Detectives found that minors were from different sections of the country and were generally runaways, some leaving from various organizations they had been placed into by the state. The investigation also noted that the younger children would be placed on narcotics in order to keep them under control, and were told not to talk to the police, and that if they did, they would receive bodily harm or be killed.""

2.	This is a roast thread, please take all jokes as well…..a joke. I saw a few cases of retaliation and arguing. Jokes are Jokes, don’t like it? Move on.

4.	No malicious posts, trolling, or over the top comments attacking r/nfl users. As i said before this is supposed to be light hearted and fun, lets keep it that way.

5.	The next team up will be posted in the thread the day before, so you guys will have time to come up with material and decent jokes referring to the team.


6.	Have fun! This is meant to be lighthearted thread and they are to be taken as such. The off season can be long and hopefully this series will provide some fun to pass the time. So roast away!!

We are happy to announce Red Bull Smash Gods and Gatekeepers!

Red Bull Smash Gods and Gatekeepers is an all-new two-day Super Smash Brothers Melee major where fans have the opportunity to team up and compete with their favorite renowned Smash athletes. The event will take place in Los Angeles  on September 2-3, 2017.

The event’s roster features:

In this premiere two-day event, two formats will be used leading up to a final competition: a double elimination tournament leading into Crew battles that will culminate in Judgement Day--a battle captained by the Gods themselves!

Day 1 will feature a standard double elimination competition for participants to qualify as the Chosen: those who are ranked in the top 32 will be placed in a draft for the final 2 open slots in the Captains’ Crew. Those not chosen from the top 32 will play in a stand alone Godforsaken Tournament. 

Day 2 will feature the final Judgement Day battles to see which Crew will be victorious and crowned champions.

CranberryMoonwalk,2017-06-07 13:32:40+00:00,50 great albums that you probably missed from the first half of 2017.,"Edit: Thanks for the gold, stranger!

With so much music coming at us at such a constant rate, it’s easy for really great projects to slip through the cracks. 

Here are some of the amazing projects that you have probably overlooked. I hope you find some new things to enjoy on this list. These won’t be in any particular order, but I will say that the first two are my favorite underground projects so far this year.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**James Lindsey - Same Sky EP**

Check out [Rainbows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIbz0BFpA9Q)

I’ve been a big James Lindsey fan for years (he used to go by the rap name Jalin Roze). It’s tough to categorize him, but if I have to compare him to anyone, it feels like a touch of Wale over Chance the Rapper style beats. It’s only 8 tracks, so it’s a breeze to listen to. [Here’s the full project.](https://soundcloud.com/sonablast/sets/james-lindsey-same-sky)

*Other songs to check out:*

Wanna Shine feat. Otis Junior

Apples to Oranges feat. House Ghost

In early ’16, he retired the Roze name (I always thought it was pretty corny being named after a basketball player, but his actual reasoning was “JaLin” is a combination of the beginning syllables of his first and last name. “I also wanted to carry on the torch of my mother’s maiden name. And her maiden name was Rose.”), but his new sound isn’t all that different from his old sound. Don’t sleep on his older stuff - [Ladies &amp; Gentlemen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQszbdlPGlU) off of Grand National Dreams is fantastic. His old Bandcamp can be found [here](https://jalinroze.bandcamp.com/).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Awon &amp; Dephlow - Sleep is the Cousin of Death EP**

Check out [Real Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gVeLeQflwo)

This entire thing (much like most of Awon &amp; Dephlow’s work) is produced by one of my favorite producers in the game right now, Phoniks. This is old school beats and smooth as hell lyrics. Dephlow has more of a presence on the mic with a deeper, more commanding voice, but Awon compliments him perfectly with a smoother flow. Personally, I lean more towards Awon’s style. [Here’s the full project.](https://awonanddephlow.bandcamp.com/album/sleep-is-the-cousin-of-death-prod-phoniks)

*Other songs to check out:*

The Realest

State of the Art feat. Halfcut

If you like what you hear from these guys together, they have a full length album called Dephacation that came out in 2014 (The track [Step Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QmPfvXAg2I) is a personal favorite). Awon also has a really great discography - if you like what you hear from him, my advice is to check out his Return to the Golden Era, which is also produced by Phoniks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Ray West &amp; Dave Dar - The Sun Don’t Chill EP**

Check out [Home feat. Percee P, Prince Po, &amp; AG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V9bnuIEIJc)

Ray West is a top tier producer who has worked with people like OC, AG, Roc Marciano, and more. This time he teamed up with Dave Dar from Harlem, who has a ton of great credits of his own (exec produced the Talib Kweli classic ‘A Beautiful Struggle’). Both of these guys are part of the LUVNY collective (and it was released from AG &amp; West’s Red Apple .45 label), so there’s plenty of work for you to check out. If you like what you heard from Dave Dar, check out his work as half of the Bamboo Brothers. This is a *very* short project at under 15 minutes long, but it’s a really beautiful listen while you’re doing some chores, walking the dog, or driving to the store. [Here’s the full project.](https://redapples45.bandcamp.com/album/the-sun-dont-chill)

*Other songs to check out:*

Art of Diggin’ feat. AG

We Prevail

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Q-Ball &amp; Curt Cazel - My Kinda Moves**

Check out [My Kinda Moves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPgmRs08QQM)

These Long Island rappers have been around forever (you may also know them as QNC), but rarely do I run into someone who’s heard of them. I remember hearing them on Mama Mystique’s Tremendous in 1997 (although they’ve been recording together since 1994, but their careers track back to the late 80’s with JVCFORCE). Most of these tracks have been out for a long time - like years in some cases (My Kinda Moves was released as a single in 1995!) - but in terms of a full project, this is the first time many of these tracks have been found together (Chopped Herring Records did the honors).  You can definitely hear their influences (Jay Z, Nas) in their music.

*Other songs to check out:*

War Out Here

Makin’ Moves

**Pawz One - Pick Your Poison**

Check out [Flipside feat. Masta Ace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDyivXGzrcQ)

I don’t know a whole lot about LA’s Pawz One - he came to my attention because of a remix he did with Masta Ace a few years ago - but he raps alongside good company. Along with Ace, he’s teamed with Ras Kass, Sean Price, Madchild, etc. This release has some great tracks and has features from Mykill Miers, King Magnetic, El Da Sensei, Talib Kweli, and Main Flow. He’s flows with ease and has a pretty solid message in each song - for example, in Paint the City, he talks about the violence in Los Angeles. “Paint the city with your teardrops, and bloodshed.” [Here’s the full project.](https://pawzone.bandcamp.com/album/pick-your-poison)

**Krafty Kuts &amp; Dynamite MC - All 4 Corners**

Check out [It Ain’t My Fault feat. Chali 2na](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9HQGDCfLO0)

Krafty Kuts has been around for a long time - he originally helped to pioneer the breakbeat and bass movement in the UK. He’s fairly decorated, winning Breakspoll 8 times and was honored with the Outstanding Contribution to Breakbeat award at the Breakspoll awards. Here he teams with another UK MC, Dynamite MC - he’s also been around forever, releasing his first album in 2004 or so (but he had singles as far back as 1994 with Full Cycle). The Chali 2na feature (from Jurassic 5) is great on this track (let’s be honest, Chali has the best voice in rap). It’s upbeat, fun music.

*Other songs to check out:*

[The War is Over feat. Harry Shotta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmiFFBcFAFk)

FYI, if you’ve never heard Harry Shotta spit, watch that video. He raps extremely quickly and at last check, had the world record of 1,771 words on one track (Animal, beating out Eminem’s Rap God total of 1,560).

If you like the production on this, [here’s a link to Krafty Kuts soundcloud - tons of stuff here.](https://soundcloud.com/kraftykuts/sets)

**Nocando - Severed**

Check out [Severed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAOSkxYgrOY)

Nocando was the founder of the Hellfyre Club (Open Mike Eagle, Busdriver, milo). Severed isn’t necessarily a fun listen - the theme here is dealing with being broke and his split with the mother of his three children - but it’s worth the trip. It’s much different than his two Jimmy albums, but it’s also more powerful and personal. [Here’s the full project.](https://hellfyreclub.bandcamp.com/album/severed)

In his words: “I made ‘Severed’ at a time when my relationship with my wife — my high school sweetheart and the mother of my three children — was coming to an end,. This was right around the time the rap crew side of my record Label Hellfyre Club began to disband and when I split from my business partners at Low End Theory of more than a decade. Plus, I was broke as fuck. The songs on ‘Severed’ are more personal, more vulnerable than anything I’d made before. The battle rap braggadocio that I held dear for so many years melted away. Every piece of my personal life was ripped apart and rearranged. I had no choice but to rebuild from the ground up.”

**Molecules &amp; Showbiz - A Bronx Tale EP**

Check out [Hardcore feat. Dres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G31m8aAJJo8)

Showbiz from D.I.T.C. has been busy in 2017 (he also has an EP with AG called Take it Back and a few random features as well). Here he links up with Molecules (from The Legion, who were once signed to Dres’ record label back in the early 90’s when he was one half of Black Sheep). This carries a very “DITC” sound, so if you’re into that, you should dig this. Great beats. It’s another short listen, ringing in at only 6 tracks (it also contains the instrumentals afterwards). [Here’s the full project.](https://soundcloud.com/diamondmedia360/sets/a-bronx-tale)

*Other songs to check out:*

Bad Guy feat. Money Ray

Methadone Rap feat. The Legion

If you like Showbiz’s production style, he and AG have a bunch of projects together. If you like Molecules, the Legion only had one album come out (Theme + Echo = Krill) and it’s tough to find in the flesh.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Ran Reed - Still Commanding Respect**

Check out [Still Commanding Respect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BHJf91RrGA)

Ran Reed has been in the game since the early 90’s. He also produced a large portion of this 20 track project, which features UG (on The Crew, which is basically a Cella Dwellas reunion), Kool G Rap, Bumpy Knuckles, Sadat X, and M.O.P. This is truly a time machine to the 90’s, with gritty, head knocking beats and gravelly, rough lyricism. It’s also one of the longest projects on my list. If you like Bumpy Knuckles, Nick Wiz, Rakim, I think you’ll like Ran Reed.

*Other songs to check out:*

Timeless

The Crew feat. UG

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Jay Worthy &amp; The Alchemist - Fantasy Island EP**

Check out [Stepping Out feat. $ha Hef](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBHnrZINm0w)

These beats are smooth as fuck. The production is immaculate, and the features here are crazy - we have Conway, Mayhem Lauren, Big Body Bes. It’s not as funky as some of the tracks I’ve heard Jay Worthy on, but it’s a good different. He holds his own on the beats, but his lyrics are nothing to write home about. Jay Worthy isn’t really why I love this project though…it’s the production. Alchemist is obviously a legendary producer who has joint projects with Curren$y, Action Bronson, Fashion, and more. [A few more tracks from the EP can be found on Alchemist’s Soundcloud.](https://soundcloud.com/alan-the-chemist)

*Other songs to check out:*

Four Fifteens feat. Mayhem Lauren &amp; Big Body Bes

Rising Sun feat. Rugotti

If you happen to like Jay Worthy, he’s got a dope project called LNDN DRGS with Sean House. The track [Burnout 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGOkQlOY7hk) was one of my favorite tracks in 2016. I think he fits much more easily onto tracks like this.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Propo ’88 - Astronomic Delight**

Check out [The Anticipated feat. Wildelux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnBNUPq2-LY)

Propo ’88 is an amazing producer from Da Shogunz. My first experience with his music was his production for Blabbermouf, and he’s been on my radar ever since. We’ve got some old school samples and a bit of scratching here (a sort of fusion of 70’s jazz rock/fusion mixed with a 90’s boombap vibe), along with some great guest stars (Hex One, Shogunz affiliates Corto Maltez &amp; Blabbermouf, among others). [Here’s the full project.](https://propo88.bandcamp.com/releases)

*Other songs to check out:*

Amped Up feat. Ten-Nition

My Type Style feat. Blabbermouf

If you like what you hear from that last track, Blabbermouf &amp; Propo ’88 have a tape together called Top of the Stack which is fantastic. The whole Shogunz crew is very talented.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Doz Funky Baztardz - Get Down to My Dungeon**

Check out [Clowns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQATp4mM5Rc)

This isn’t new music, but it was a compilation put out this year featuring the Baztardz (DJ Taz, Melo, and Class) loose singles &amp; EP cuts over the years. They were active from 1993-1995, so that’s the time period that these tracks came from. The sound is very traditional early 90’s NY, but they actually came from Miami, so they didn’t get much local play (everything was bass music back then, and Miami radio wasn’t friendly to things going against the grain). This is an extension of the 6 track EP that was released a few years ago called What’s Going On In A Baztardz Mind. Interesting note, the back cover lists Gun Bizness as being on the album, but it’s not included. I honestly think that if they were in NY instead of Miami, they could have blown up.

**DJ Format &amp; Abdominal - Still Hungry**

Check out [Behind the Scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SldhdVG808Q)

These guys remind me of Ugly Duckling - playful boom-bap, a little corny, but definitely fun. Again, these guys (Format from the UK and Abdominal from Canada) have been in the game for a long time, they just don’t get much exposure over in the US. Behind the Scenes deals with what it’s actually like being a self-made rapper, from telling people what you do to worrying about finances. [Here’s the full project.](https://abdominal.bandcamp.com/album/still-hungry)

*Other songs to check out:*

Reflective Meditation Rhymes

Diamond Hammer

DJ Format has been making music since 2003 and has supported Jurassic 5 on a European tour. He’s also a part of The Simonsound with Simon James. If you enjoy Abdominal, I highly recommend his project Sitting Music, which is all done over live instruments.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Phat Kat &amp; DJ Dister - The S.O.S. Project**

Check out [S.O.S.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiG79rs373A)

Phat Kat is a legend - he was part of the group 1st Down with J. Dilla and is a Slum Village affiliate (don’t get him started on T3 though). DJ Dister is a German producer who I don’t know a whole lot about, but he laces some great old school sounding tracks here for Phat Kat to go over (fitting, as S.O.S. stands for So Old School). Topics on here range from crime in Detroit to personal triumphs. [Here’s the whole project.](https://soundcloud.com/below-system/sets/phat-kat-dj-dister-the-sos-project)

*Other songs to check out:*

Revolt for Change

The Monument feat. DJ Dez

If you like Phat Kat’s rapping style, please go back and listen to early Slum Village and his stuff on Dilla’s Welcome to Detroit. Most recently, he could be found teaming up with Hiero’s Casual as Ron Bon Jovi.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**K.A.A.N. &amp; Klaus Layer - Abstractions EP**

Check out [My Nigga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93371ES7-w4)

K.A.A.N. is an amazingly talented rapper from Maryland who has been on my radar since [KAANCEPTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mG6ROHmgc80). He’s got a machine gun flow, but unlike some rappers who go so fast, you can understand every word. He’s clever and mature for his age. Klaus Layer is a German producer who I hadn’t heard of before, but he has quite a few projects out (also under the name Captain Crook). As far as I can tell, this is the first time that a rapper is joining him for an entire project. [Here’s the whole project.](https://kaan.bandcamp.com/album/abstractions-ep-instrumental-versions)

*Other tracks to check out:*

Toonami

King Solomon

K.A.A.N. has been releasing a flurry of singles over the past few weeks, so I’m guessing he’s got a project coming soon.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**MC² - Native Sons EP (Bonus Pick)**

Check out [Reign Dance](https://play.spotify.com/album/4QArGkwJsZk6GG8fKWH56l)

This project isn’t out yet - it’ll be releasing on June 17th. I’m throwing the song Reign Dance on here only because I created the album art for it. It’s also a really good track, theme being that there’s a drought in the rap game when it comes to good *rappers* vs. personalities. I’ve heard the EP, and it’s pretty good. If you like the other stuff on my list, keep and eye out for this. They’re pretty talented MC’s out of San Antonio.

If you like their style, check out their free mixtape [Graduates of Soul](https://mc2vibes.com/music), which is dedicated to Lauryn Hill, ATCQ, and Little Brother. It’s very good.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you don’t see something on this list, it’s for three possible reasons:

1. I’ve never heard of it.

2. I felt that it got enough attention here on HHH (I was on the fence with Brother Ali, but his album got a decent amount of talk here).

3. I didn’t like it.

So, what did I miss? What other great projects are out there that people probably haven’t heard? What did you check out on my list that you liked or disliked?

Additional info/tidbits
 
* 16 of the 54 people (or 30%) researched still work at Bethesda. If I take away people who were credited only for ""additional"" work (since most of them left Bethesda during the development of Morrowind) 13 out of 26 (or 50%) still work at Bethesda. 

* It seems like some of the people credited for additional work on the game were doing internships at Bethesda in 2001/2002.
 
* Multiple people left Bethesda in September 2001. This was due to a lack of funding from investors. Because of this the Los Angeles offices were closed.

[deleted],2017-06-04 11:47:10+00:00,"Fun Fact: With one obvious exception, a San Antonio Spur has made an All-NBA Team every year since 1989, nearly 30 years","The exception being the 1996-1997 season, when David Robinson's year-long injury resulted in the Spurs landing the top pick in the 1997 NBA draft. That year, they selected Tim Duncan with the first overall pick.


Incidentally, since the All NBA team honors expanded to three teams, the Spurs have only missed it one other time: the year 1987-1988, which led to them drafting David Robinson.

If Kawhi Leonard stays healthy, the Spurs will likely reach 30 consecutive seasons of having an All-NBA winner when healthy. Of course, the Spurs have drafted an all-time great big each time they've failed to have an All-NBA player in the three-team era ... so maybe it wouldn't be the worst thing ever.

With that said, no other franchise has a comparable streak in the three-team era. The Lakers had an All-NBA player from 1996-2013, albeit this solely consists of Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, and Pau Gasol. The Bulls had a 12-year streak from 1986-1998, featuring Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan.

In the two team era, the Boston Celtics had an All-NBA player all but two seasons (1977-1979) from 1955-1988. This is impressive despite the smaller size of the league at the time; with only two All-NBA teams, even the Los Angeles Lakers missed All-NBA honors within the first decade of the award's creation, whereas it took Boston over 20 years.

Boku_no_PicoandChico,2017-05-31 22:13:49+00:00,TIFU by absentmindedly throwing my phone into the garbage and having to hitch hike outside a state prison. [Medium],"Early this morning, 1 A.M. ish, I boarded a Greyhound bus headed to Los Angeles. Along the way one of the stops is in Blythe, California. When the bus pulls into Blythe, I'm tired as fuck because I didn't get any sleep. But it's 6 A.M. and I'm hungry. Across the street is a Burger King. I buy some pancakes and a breakfast burrito, and then sit down a little ways away from the bus, on the curb, to eat my food. 

Clearly, I misjudged how much time I had because next thing I know I see the driver marching up the steps of the bus. In the rush to not get left behind, I throw whatever trash I had into a nearby bin, and stuffed my wallet/phone/headphones into my pocket, or so I thought.

20 minutes into the bus ride, I reach into my pocket for my phone, only to grab a handful of breakfast burrito wrapper. ffffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuccccccccccckkkkkkkkkkkkkk. My phone is $300, and is housed in a wallet case (with all my ID, cards and cash). The bus ticket was $40. No brainer. I tell the driver to let me off the bus and he drops me off at the next exit. By the time we get there, I'm about 30 minutes from Blythe.

So I'm out there in the middle of nowhere, with all my bags, no phone or ID. The only way back is to hitch hike. Many many cars go by, a couple honk, none stop. Eventually, a big fat semi truck decides to pick me up. It's pretty beat up, looks kinda old, and has cardboard covering up the sun roof. I'm not sure, I think he was Eastern European, ~50ish guy.

Trucker: ""You need ride?""

Me: ""Yea, I need to get to Blythe, just down the road.""

Trucker: ""Okay, come on.""

Me: ""Thanks for stopping, a lot of people went by before you.""

Trucker: ""Well, you are next to prison. It is illegal to pick up hitch hikers here, but you don't look like the criminal type. I can tell.""

Me: ""What.""

He takes me back to Blythe, and he's honestly one of the friendliest men I've ever met. Sure enough, after a little digging, I found my phone in the garbage. I bought a new ticket to get to LA from Blythe, and I'm chilling at Burger King right now.

Thank you trucker guy! Saved me many miles of walking in the desert with heavy bags and no water!

tl;dr Threw my phone in the garbage. Had to go back and get it. Friendly trucker guy saved me excruciating walk in the desert.",tifu,4292

JaguarGator9,2017-05-31 13:25:35+00:00,[OC] JaguarGator9's Weird Stat Thread- NBA Finals Edition,"For the most part, I’ve done the Weird Stat Threads in the NFL subreddit and once or twice in the college football subreddit. But I figure now that it’s the NBA Finals, and since [everyone](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6e4cbm/since_2011_when_rihanna_is_in_the_top_13_during/?st=j3awoz3t&amp;sh=6ca9da62) is now [jumping](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6e41o9/there_is_a_prized_bird_award_in_a_county_fair_in/?st=j3awpglt&amp;sh=8546d2cb) on the [weird stat](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6e26ne/lebron_james_has_never_won_a_championship_if/?st=j3awpvdq&amp;sh=5bd2d967) bandwagon, I figured I might as well bring this over to /r/nba for the finals (and maybe some stuff in the offseason).

Basically, this is the thread where I point out completely unrelated things and how that will translate to the upcoming event, which in this case, is the NBA Finals. [Here’s one I did comparing the NFL to the Eurovision Song Contest](https://np.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/6ar0b0/oc_jaguargator9s_weird_stat_thread_eurovision/?st=j3awsiw9&amp;sh=75273700). This one is [a week 1 prediction with weird stats](https://np.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/5251bo/jaguargator9s_weird_stat_thread_week_1_part_i_100/?st=j3awtoy6&amp;sh=e25d0254). And this one [is my most recent one](https://np.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/6dhlpg/oc_jaguargator9s_weird_stat_thread_stanley_cup/?st=j3awujdo&amp;sh=d8c15ac4), comparing the NFL to the Stanley Cup. I’m doing one of these threads every Friday on /r/NFL, so check that out if you’re interested.

With that being said, let’s dive right into the weird stats.

- The #2 seed in the Eastern Conference has won the NBA Finals six times (1966 and 1968 when the Boston Celtics did it, 1973 when the New York Knicks did it, 1993 when the Chicago Bulls did it, and 2006 and 2012 when the Miami Heat did it). All six times, in the most recent NFL Draft, the Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts chose an offensive player with their first round selection.

Year | Pick | Position
--- | --- | ---
1966 | Sam Ball | Tackle
1968 | John Williams | Tackle
1973 | Bert Jones | Quarterback
1993 | Sean Dawkins | Wide Receiver
2006 | Joseph Addai | Halfback
2012 | Andrew Luck | Quarterback

This year, the Colts chose Malik Hooker with their first round pick, a safety from Ohio State. Since that is a defensive player, the advantage goes to the Warriors.

- After winning their first ever NBA Finals, a team has repeated as champion four times. After winning their first title in 1949, the Minneapolis Lakers won again in 1950, and after winning for the first time in 1991, the Chicago Bulls won again in 1992. After winning their first title in 1989, the Detroit Pistons won again in 1990, and after winning for the first time in 1994, the Houston Rockets won again in 1995. All four times that the team has repeated (1950, 1990, 1992, 1995), the most recent Winter Olympic silver medalist in the men’s slalom had exactly 5 different English letters in their last name. This might be the weirdest stat I have ever come up with.

Year | Most Recent Winter Olympics | Silver Medalist | English Letters in Last Name | Number of Letters
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1950 | 1948 Winter Olympics (St. Moritz) | James Couttet | C, O, U, T (x3), E | 5
1990 | 1988 Winter Olympics (Calgary) | Frank Wörndl | W, R, N, D, L | 5
1992 | 1992 Winter Olympics (Albertville) | Alberto Tomba | T, O, M, B, A | 5
1995 | 1994 Winter Olympics (Lillehammer) | Alberto Tomba | T, O, M, B, A | 5

The most recent Winter Olympics was in 2014 at Sochi. The silver medalist was Austrian skier Marcel Hirscher. He has 6 different English letters in his last name (H, I, R, S, C, E), so advantage to the Warriors here.

- After winning their first ever NBA Finals, a team has repeated as champion four times (1950, 1990, 1992, 1995). All four times that the team has repeated, the most recent Winter Olympic gold medalist in the women’s slalom had a last name that ended in the letter “R”.

Year | Most Recent Winter Olympics | Gold Medalist | Final Letter of Last Name
--- | --- | --- | ---
1950 | 1948 Winter Olympics (St. Moritz) | Gretchen Fraser | R
1990 | 1988 Winter Olympics (Calgary) | Vreni Schneider | R
1992 | 1992 Winter Olympics (Albertville) | Petra Kronberger | R
1995 | 1994 Winter Olympics (Lillehammer) | Vreni Schneider | R

Good news for America? The gold medalist in the 2014 Winter Olympics was Mikaele Shiffrin of the USA, the first winner in this event for the USA since Barbara Cochran won it in 1972. Bad news (depending on what part of America you live in)? Her last name does not end in R, so advantage to the Warriors here.

- After winning their first ever NBA Finals, a team has repeated as champion four times (1950, 1990, 1992, 1995). All four times that the team has repeated, in the pairs figure skating competition at the most recent Winter Olympics, the gold and silver medalists were from Europe, while the bronze medalists were from North America.

Year | Most Recent Winter Olympics | Gold | Silver | Bronze
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1950 | 1948 Winter Olympics (St. Moritz) | Belgium (Lannoy &amp; Bauginet) | Hungary (Kekesy &amp; Kiraly) | Canada (Morrow &amp; Diestelmeyer)
1990 | 1988 Winter Olympics (Calgary) | USSR (Gordeeva &amp; Grinkov) | USSR (Valova &amp; Vasiliev) | USA (Watson &amp; Oppegard)
1992 | 1992 Winter Olympics (Albertville) | Europe (Mishkutenok &amp; Dmitriev) | Europe (Bechke &amp; Petrov) | Canada (Brasseur &amp; Eisler)
1995 | 1994 Winter Olympics (Lillehammer) | Russia (Gordeeva &amp; Grinkov) | Russia (Mishkutenok &amp; Dmitriev) | Canada (Brasseur &amp; Eisler)

At the 2014 Winter Olympics, Russia won the gold and silver medals, but Germany won the bronze medal. Since Germany is not in North America, this stat goes against the Cavs, and is in favor of the Warriors.

- The Warriors have won the NBA Finals four times (1947, 1956, 1975, 2015). All four times, the winning league of the previous MLB All Star Game was the home team.

Year | Most Recent All Star Game Winner | Venue | Home Team
--- | --- | --- | ---
1947 | American League | Fenway Park (Boston Red Sox) | AL
1956 | National League | County Stadium (Milwaukee Braves) | NL
1975 | National League | Three Rivers Stadium (Pittsburgh Pirates) | NL
2015 | American League | Target Field (Minnesota Twins) | AL

The most recent MLB All Star Game was held at Petco Park in San Diego, and was won by the American League. This is not good for the Warriors.

- The Warriors have won the NBA Finals four times (1947, 1956, 1975, 2015). All four times, in the most recent NRL Grand Final (rugby in Australia), exactly one team ending in the letter “N” ended up playing in the Grand Final.

Year | Most Recent Grand Final Teams
--- | ---
1947 | **Balmain** &amp; St. George (1)
1956 | South Sydney &amp; **Newtown** (1)
1975 | Eastern Suburbs &amp; **Canterbury-Bankstown** (1)
2015 | South Sydney &amp; **Canterbury-Bankstown** (1)

This is not a common occurrence; since the 2005 NRL season, this has only happened twice (2012 and 2014), and since 1999, this has only happened three times. Last year’s NRL Grand Final was between Cronulla-Sutherland and Melbourne, so advantage to the Cavaliers with this one. Note that last year, the 2 teams were North Queensland and Brisbane, so the Cavs had the advantage with that weird stat last year.

- LeBron James has played in the NBA Finals seven times prior to this year. When the Golden Boot winner in La Liga (the person that scores the most goals in Spain’s top soccer league) has a first name starting with the letter “L,” then LeBron’s team wins the NBA Finals. When he does not have a first name starting with the letter “L,” then LeBron’s team loses the NBA Finals.

Year | Golden Boot Winner | First Letter of First Name | NBA Finals Result
--- | --- | --- | ---
2006/07 | Ruud van Nistelrooy | R | Cavaliers lose to Spurs
2010/11 | Cristiano Ronaldo | C | Heat lose to Mavericks
2011/12 | Lionel Messi | L | Heat defeat Thunder
2012/13 | Lionel Messi | L | Heat defeat Spurs
2013/14 | Cristiano Ronaldo | C | Heat lose to Spurs
2014/15 | Cristiano Ronaldo | C | Cavaliers lose to Warriors
2015/16 | Luis Suarez | L | Cavaliers defeat Warriors

This year, the Golden Boot winner was Lionel Messi, so advantage to the Cavaliers.

- LeBron James has played in the NBA Finals seven times prior to this year. When the Golden Boot winner in La Liga played on FC Barcelona, then LeBron’s team wins the NBA Finals. When he plays on any other team, then LeBron’s team loses the NBA Finals.

Year | Golden Boot Winner | Team | NBA Finals Result
--- | --- | --- | ---
2006/07 | Ruud van Nistelrooy | Real Madrid | Cavaliers lose to Spurs
2010/11 | Cristiano Ronaldo | Real Madrid | Heat lose to Mavericks
2011/12 | Lionel Messi | FC Barcelona | Heat defeat Thunder
2012/13 | Lionel Messi | FC Barcelona | Heat defeat Spurs
2013/14 | Cristiano Ronaldo | Real Madrid | Heat lose to Spurs
2014/15 | Cristiano Ronaldo | Real Madrid | Cavaliers lose to Warriors
2015/16 | Luis Suarez | FC Barcelona | Cavaliers defeat Warriors

Lionel Messi plays on FC Barcelona. Once again, advantage to the Cavaliers.

- LeBron James has played in the NBA Finals seven times prior to this year. When the Houston Texans’ first round draft pick had exactly seven letters in their full first name, then LeBron’s team wins the NBA Finals. Any other letter combination, and LeBron’s team loses.

Year | Texans’ First Round Pick | Letters in First Name | NBA Finals Result
--- | --- | --- | ---
2007 | Amobi Okoye | 5 | Cavaliers lose to Spurs
2011 | JJ (Justin James) Watt | 2/6/10 | Heat lose to Mavericks
2012 | Whitney Mercilus | 7 | Heat defeat Thunder
2013 | DeAndre Hopkins | 7 | Heat defeat Spurs
2014 | Jadeveon Clowney | 8 | Heat lose to Spurs
2015 | Kevin Johnson | 5 | Cavaliers lose to Warriors
2016 | William Fuller | 7 | Cavaliers defeat Warriors

Will Fuller’s full first name is William, so that counts for last year. This year, the Texans chose quarterback Deshaun Watson out of Clemson. There are 7 letters in Deshaun’s first name. Advantage to the Cavaliers.

- LeBron James has played in the NBA Finals seven times prior to this year. If the previous US Open Cup Final finished with exactly 2 goals scored prior to penalty kicks, then LeBron’s team won the NBA Finals. Any other number, and LeBron’s team lost. 

Year | Most Recent US Open Cup Final Teams | Score Before PKs | Number of Goals | NBA Finals Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2007 | Chicago Fire &amp; Los Angeles Galaxy | 3-1 | 4 | Cavaliers lose to Spurs
2011 | Seattle Sounders FC &amp; Columbus Crew | 2-1 | 3 | Heat lose to Mavericks
2012 | Seattle Sounders FC &amp; Chicago Fire | 2-0 | 2 | Heat defeat Thunder
2013 | Sporting Kansas City &amp; Seattle Sounders | 1-1 | 2 | Heat defeat Spurs
2014 | DC United &amp; Real Salt Lake | 1-0 | 1 | Heat lose to Spurs
2015 | Seattle Sounders FC &amp; Philadelphia Union | 3-1 | 4 | Cavaliers lose to Warriors
2016 | Sporting Kansas City &amp; Philadelphia Union | 1-1 | 2 | Cavaliers defeat Warriors

The most recent US Open Cup Final was between FC Dallas and the New England Revolution. FC Dallas won the game 4-2. Since 6 goals were scored, that’s an advantage for the Warriors.

- LeBron James has played in the NBA Finals seven times prior to this year. When the Green Bay Packers lost in the divisional round of the playoffs in the most recent NFL season, then LeBron’s team won the NBA Finals. Any other result, and LeBron’s team lost.

Year | Green Bay Packers Result | NBA Finals Result
--- | --- | ---
2007 | Didn’t make playoffs (8-8) | Cavaliers lose to Spurs
2011 | Won Super Bowl XLV | Heat lose to Mavericks
2012 | Lose in divisional round to NY Giants | Heat defeat Thunder
2013 | Lose in divisional round to San Francisco | Heat defeat Spurs
2014 | Lose in wild card round to San Francisco | Heat lose to Spurs
2015 | Lose in conference championship to Seattle | Cavaliers lose to Warriors
2016 | Lose in divisional round to Arizona | Cavaliers defeat Warriors

This season, the Packers lost to the Falcons in the conference championship. They got past the divisional round with their dramatic last-second victory over the Dallas Cowboys, so because of this, advantage goes to the Warriors.

- A team has represented the Western Conference in the NBA Finals three straight years in a row 6 times before (1954 with the Minneapolis Lakers, and then 1970, 1984, 1989, 2002, and 2010 with the Los Angeles Lakers). All six times during the three-peat year, the outcome of the series was determined by the most recent Summer Olympics and the 200m dash. If the gold medalist in the men’s 200m dash at the most recent Summer Olympics had a first name containing the letter “N”, then the Western Conference team in their third straight Finals appearance won. If he did not, then the Western Conference team in their third straight Finals appearance lost.

Year | Most Recent Olympics | Men’s 200m Dash Winner | Letter N in First Name? | NBA Finals Result

2010 | 2008 Olympics (Beijing) | Usain Bolt | Yes | Los Angeles Lakers win (def. Boston Celtics)

In the most recent Summer Olympics down in Rio de Janeiro, Usain Bolt won. Since he has a letter “n” in his first name, this bodes well for the Golden State Warriors.

- A team has represented the Western Conference in the NBA Finals three straight years in a row 6 times before (1954, 1970, 1984, 1989, 2002, 2010). All six times during the three-peat year, the outcome of the series was determined by the most recent Summer Olympics and the men’s 5000m run. If the silver medalist at the most recent Summer Olympics had a first name starting with an English vowel, then the Western Conference team in their third straight Finals appearance won. If he did not, then the Western Conference team in their third straight Finals appearance lost.

2010 | 2008 Olympics (Beijing) | Eliud Kipchoge | Yes (E) | Los Angeles Lakers win (def. Boston Celtics)

The silver medalist at the 2016 Olympics was American runner Paul Kipkemoi Chelimo. Since his name starts with the letter “P,” and “P” is not a vowel, the advantage goes to the Cavaliers here.

- A team has represented the Western Conference in the NBA Finals three straight years in a row 6 times before (1954, 1970, 1984, 1989, 2002, 2010). All six times during the three-peat year, the outcome of the series was determined by the most recent Summer Olympics and the winner of the men’s 400m hurdles at the most recent Summer Olympics. If the gold medalist’s number of letters in the first and last name add up to exactly 12, then the Western Conference team in their third straight Finals appearance won. Any other number, and the Western Conference team in their third straight Finals appearance lost.

Year | Most Recent Olympics | Men’s 400m Hurdles Gold Medalist | Letters in Name (First + Last) | NBA Finals Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1954 | 1952 Olympics (Helsinki) | Charles Moore | 12 (7 + 5) | Minneapolis Lakers win (def. New York Knicks)
1970 | 1968 Olympics (Mexico City) | David Hemery | 11 (5 + 6) | Los Angeles Lakers lose (Boston Celtics win)
1984 | 1980 Olympics (Moscow) | Volker Beck | 10 (6 + 4) | Los Angeles Lakers lose (Boston Celtics win)
1989 | 1988 Olympics (Seoul) | Andre Phillips | 13 (5 + 8) | Los Angeles Lakers lose (Detroit Pistons win)
2002 | 2000 Olympics (Sydney) | Angelo Taylor | 12 (6 + 6) | Los Angeles Lakers win (def. New Jersey Nets)
2010 | 2008 Olympics (Beijing) | Angelo Taylor | 12 (6 + 6) | Los Angeles Lakers win (def. Boston Celtics)

This past Olympics, an American by the name of Kerron Clement won the men’s 400m hurdles. Unfortunately for the Warriors, he has 6 letters in his first name and 7 in his last name, meaning that the total adds up to 13.

- A team has represented the Western Conference in the NBA Finals three straight years in a row 6 times before (1954, 1970, 1984, 1989, 2002, 2010). All six times during the three-peat year, the outcome of the series was determined by the most recent Summer Olympics and the winner of the men’s road race individual event in cycling. If the gold medalist had exactly 7 letters in their last name, then the Western Conference team in their third straight Finals appearance won. Any other number, and the Western Conference team in their third straight Finals appearance lost.

Year | Most Recent Olympics | Men’s Road Cycling Gold Medalist | Letters in Last Name | NBA Finals Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1954 | 1952 Olympics (Helsinki) | Andre Noyelle | 7 | Minneapolis Lakers win (def. New York Knicks)
1970 | 1968 Olympics (Mexico City) | Pierfranco Vianelli | 8 | Los Angeles Lakers lose (Boston Celtics win)
1984 | 1980 Olympics (Moscow) | Sergei Sukhoruchenkov | 14 | Los Angeles Lakers lose (Boston Celtics win)
1989 | 1988 Olympics (Seoul) | Olaf Ludwig | 6 | Los Angeles Lakers lose (Detroit Pistons win)
2002 | 2000 Olympics (Sydney) | Jan Ullrich | 7 | Los Angeles Lakers win (def. New Jersey Nets)
2010 | 2008 Olympics (Beijing) | Samuel Sanchez | 7 | Los Angeles Lakers win (def. Boston Celtics)

In the 2016 Summer Olympics, the winning cyclist was a Belgian named Greg van Avermaet. Whether you count it as 8 letters or 11 letters, it still is not 7, so the advantage goes to the Cavaliers here.

- Prior to this season, a Western Conference team with at least 67 wins in the regular season has happened six times; the Warriors did it last year at 73-9, the Lakers did it in 1972 at 69-13, the Lakers did it in 2000 at 67-15, the Spurs did it last year at 67-15, the Mavericks did it in 2007 at 67-15, and the Warriors did it in 2015 at 67-15. All six times, the outcome was determined by the MLB All Star Game. If the most recent edition of the Midsummer Classic was held in an American League ballpark, then the Western Conference team with 67+ wins won the NBA Finals. If it was held in a National League ballpark, then the Western Conference team with 67+ wins did not win the NBA Finals.

Year | Most Recent All Star Game Stadium | League | Team | Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1972 | Tiger Stadium (Detroit Tigers) | American | Los Angeles Lakers (69-13) | Win NBA Finals (def. New York Knicks)
2000 | Fenway Park (Boston Red Sox) | American | Los Angeles Lakers (67-15) | Win NBA Finals (def. Indiana Pacers)
2007 | PNC Park (Pittsburgh Pirates) | National | Dallas Mavericks (67-15) | Lose in first round to Golden State Warriors
2015 | Target Field (Minnesota Twins) | American | Golden State Warriors (67-15) | Win NBA Finals (def. Cleveland Cavaliers)
2016 | Great American Ballpark (Cincinnati Reds) | National | San Antonio Spurs (67-15) | Lose in second round to Oklahoma City Thunder
2016 | Great American Ballpark (Cincinnati Reds) | National | Golden State Warriors (73-9) | Lose in NBA Finals to Cleveland Cavaliers

This year, the Golden State Warriors went 67-15. However, the most recent MLB All Star Game was held at Petco Park, home of the San Diego Padres. The Padres are a National League team. Advantage to Cleveland here.

- Prior to this season, a Western Conference team with at least 67 wins in the regular season has happened six times (1972, 2000, 2007, 2015, 2016). All six times, the outcome was determined by the most recent gold medalist in the men’s 100m freestyle at the Pan American Games. If the winning swimmer was from Argentina, then the Western Conference team did not win the NBA Finals. However, if the winning swimmer hailed from any other country, then the Western Conference team won the NBA Finals.

Year | Most Recent Pan American Games | Gold Medalist | Country | Team | Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1972 | 1971 Pan American Games (Cali) | Frank Heckl | USA | Los Angeles Lakers (69-13) | Win NBA Finals (def. New York Knicks)
2000 | 1999 Pan American Games (Winnipeg) | Fernando Scherer | Brazil | Los Angeles Lakers (67-15) | Win NBA Finals (def. Indiana Pacers)
2007 | 2003 Pan American Games (Santo Domingo) | Jose Martin Meolans | Argentina | Dallas Mavericks (67-15) | Lose in first round to Golden State Warriors
2015 | 2011 Pan American Games (Guadalajara) | Cesar Cielo | Brazil | Golden State Warriors (67-15) | Win NBA Finals (def. Cleveland Cavaliers)
2016 | 2015 Pan American Games (Toronto) | Federico Grabich | Argentina | San Antonio Spurs (67-15) | Lose in second round to Oklahoma City Thunder
2016 | 2015 Pan American Games (Toronto) | Federico Grabich | Argentina | Golden State Wariors (73-9) | Lose in NBA Finals to Cleveland Cavaliers

Seeing as the Pan American Games happen once every four years in the summer and the next one isn’t until 2019 in Lima, Peru, Federico Grabich is still the most recent gold medalist at this event. Advantage to the Cavaliers here.

- Prior to this season, a Western Conference team with at least 67 wins in the regular season has happened six times (1972, 2000, 2007, 2015, 2016). All six times, the outcome was determined by what the Chicago Bulls did in the season prior. If the Bulls played in a playoff series in the previous year that ended 4-2, then the Western Conference team did not win the NBA Finals. However, if the Bulls did not do this, then the Western Conference team won the NBA Finals.

Year | Previous Chicago Bulls Season | 4-2 Series? | Team | Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1972 | 51-31 (1970/71) | No (lost 4-3 in conference semifinals vs. Lakers) | Los Angeles Lakers (69-13) | Win NBA Finals (def. New York Knicks)
2000 | 13-37 (1998/99) | No (did not make playoffs) | Los Angeles Lakers (67-15) | Win NBA Finals (def. Indiana Pacers)
2007 | 41-41 (2005/06) | Yes (lost 4-2 in first round vs. Heat) | Dallas Mavericks (67-15) | Lose in first round to Golden State Warriors
2015 | 48-34 (2013/14) | No (lost 4-1 in first round vs. Wizards) | Golden State Warriors (67-15) | Win NBA Finals (def. Cleveland Cavaliers)
2016 | 50-32 (2014/15) | Yes (won 4-2 in first round vs. Bucks; lost 4-2 in second round vs. Cavaliers) | San Antonio Spurs (67-15) | Lose in second round to Oklahoma City Thunder
2016 | 50-32 (2014/15) | Yes (won 4-2 in first round vs. Bucks; lost 4-2 in second round vs. Cavaliers) | Golden State Warriors (73-9) | Lose in NBA Finals to Cleveland Cavaliers

Last year, the Bulls missed the playoffs and did not play a series that ended 4-2, so advantage to the Warriors. However, next year, if a Western Conference team finishes with 67+ wins, this stat will work against them, as in this year’s playoffs, the Bulls lost 4-2 to the Celtics in the first round. But for this year, the Warriors get the edge.

- And finally, prior to this season, a Western Conference team with at least 67 wins in the regular season has happened six times (1972, 2000, 2007, 2015, 2016). All six times, the outcome was determined by the Milwaukee Bucks. If the Bucks made the playoffs, then the Western Conference team won the NBA Finals. If the Bucks missed the playoffs, then the Western Conference team did not win the NBA Finals.

Year | Milwaukee Bucks Record | Playoffs? | Team | Result
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1972 | 63-19 | Yes | Los Angeles Lakers (69-13) | Win NBA Finals (def. New York Knicks)
2000 | 42-40 | Yes | Los Angeles Lakers (67-15) | Win NBA Finals (def. Indiana Pacers)
2007 | 28-54 | No | Dallas Mavericks (67-15) | Lose in first round to Golden State Warriors
2015 | 41-41 | Yes | Golden State Warriors (67-15) | Win NBA Finals (def. Cleveland Cavaliers)
2016 | 33-49 | No | San Antonio Spurs (67-15) | Lose in second round to Oklahoma City Thunder
2016 | 33-49 | No | Golden State Warriors (73-9) | Lose in NBA Finals to Cleveland Cavaliers

This year, the Milwaukee Bucks finished 42-40, making the playoffs. Advantage goes to the Warriors here.

After these 19 weird stats, there are 10 in favor of the Cavaliers, and 9 in favor of the Warriors. Assuming all the weird stats cancel each other out, the weird stats pick the Cavaliers to win the NBA Finals.",nba,1290

RiseOfBacon,2017-05-26 14:46:59+00:00,Destiny 2 – Everything we know so far,"Good Afternoon Guardians,

As you may or may not have noticed, Hype is literally peaking and with it, rivers of questions, curiosity, ideas and even some salt have been ever present since last weeks reveal

It’s great to see so much wonder and concern over the future of this great game, so here I’ve tried to compile a list of everything we know so far and also try to answer some FAQs in between

As ever, if you have any questions to add / believe to be important, please feel free to let me know and I can add them in

---

**New Legends will Rise**

Starting where our journey begins -

**When does Destiny 2 release?**

&gt;Friday, September 8th 2017 – Prior to this, we will have a BETA

&gt; No info on whether this will be a midnight launch for some / regular reset launch as of yet

&gt; Any pre-load will be done between 7-10 days before release, as it usually is with other new releases.

&gt; FYI - PC currently has NO confirmed release date, it's not necessarily delayed but so far it has no definitive date of release - Further info below

**When does the BETA release?**

&gt;No confirmation – PLEASE NOTE – The beta is OPEN from a certain point, you DO NOT have to pre-order to get access. Pre-ordering does however, grant you early access to the BETA when that is released. How much / long the early access and/or BETA will last is also, unknown

**What content can we play in the BETA?**

&gt;No Confirmation

**What Platform can I play this on?**

&gt; Destiny 2 will be released on Xbox One, Playstation 4 &amp; PC (PC version will potentially be released AFTER Console versions - PC awaiting confirmation)

**When will PC be released and why is it still TBA?**

&gt;No confirmation of either. PC is a new platform for Destiny to be played on, hopefully this  is in PCs best interests to make sure the game is ready to meet its new friends on PC and will hit the ground running - all goes well, it will release the same date as Console 

**Can I Pre-Order now?**

&gt;Yes you can from most well known retailers or digitally through your consoles. PC can be purchased as a disc but as there is no solid release date so some don’t offer the digital download just yet

&gt;FYI – When you do this DIGITALLY through Xbox / PS4 – You have access to the BETA on release, there is no code to input – If you purchase online / through stores, your code will either be given to you on receipt, email or email closer to the BETA is released. Any problems with these transactions, please contact your retailer

**Whats the differences between standard / collectors etc?**

&gt; [Destiny 2](https://www.destinythegame.com/buy) - Follow this link, it shows you all different versions of Destiny 2 and what comes with it for all platforms - You know what to do, Guardian

---

**A World Without Light**

The [Destiny 2 reveal]( https://www.twitch.tv/bungie) was broadcast on May 18th from Hawthorne, Los Angeles showcasing new features coming with Destiny 2 and also showed us for the first time, D2 Gameplay.
The attendees were given access to 1 new story mission, ‘Homecoming’, 1 new Strike ‘The inverted Spire’ and 1 new PVP gamemode, Countdown (Showcased on 1 new map)

**What new features / changes are coming with D2?**

Changes / Features split into further categories for easier perusal

**General**

- NO GEAR will be transferring over from D1 to D2. No guns / ships / armour / items of any kind.  Hints at a special emblem to say 'we were here' in D1 but nothing solid as of yet. 

- The Cabal assault and successfully destroy the Tower, take over the last City and push the Guardians to the brink. The Cabal deploy a six-armed claw device that shields the Traveller and cuts us from its Light and with this destroy the Tower. Which is why we ‘start again’

- ""Recover the Vanguard"" is one of our goals. Zavala and Ikora have left in existential crises, and Cayde vanishes on the battlefield trying to be a hero. We have to bring them all back.

- New Story / Strikes / Public Events / Activities / Raid

- Vex / Fallen / Hive / Cabal enemies confirmed. New variations of the enemies shown within the reveal.

- Exploration has ""big improvements"" coming. In Destiny 2, you can launch any new activity without going to Orbit

- Choosable landing zones implied but no confirmations on how these could work.

- NPCs within the world – No further confirmations on this or how it would work

- Public Events confirmed and timers will be shown on the map. Heroic difficulties applicable (No confirmation how to access these)

- Hidden dungeons called ""Lost Sectors"". These will be Sections on the map (Shown with a special symbol) where you will adventure to. There will be Loot guarded by a Boss, defeat the boss to get the Key to the Loot. These will vary in difficulty and be very engaging and fun. No confirmation if these will be random bosses / How often loot is obtainable from them / allow random players in them like a Public Event if you go in Solo

- Map system that works like the Director. You can go from one planet to another from the map without the need to go to Orbit and back

- 3 new planets confirmed. Nessus, IO, Titan but also mentioned of travel to fight the Cabal so may be leaving our Solar System too (Unconfirmed)

- European Deadzone confirmed for Earth – Believe this will replace Cosmodrome / Old Russia for now - Twice as large as ANY other zone in Destiny.

- Better Clan integration in Destiny 2. In-game rosters, in-Clan LFG, custom Clan banners. Shared reward system for Clans.

- **Guided Games** - Where solo players can queue up with a Clan that has open slots. Basically an in-game LFG system, but with groups from clans instead of randoms all around. In summary - MATCHMAKING OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED FOR ALL ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING TRIALS, RAIDS, AND NIGHTFALL STRIKES!

- More information required on Guardian Games i.e do you need to be in a clan / can all Solo players meet up together / Can you set requirements for groups – No confirmation on any of these. So far, you can read a Clan bio and YOU decide whether to join their team or not

- Guardian shown driving a Tank – New Vehicles to be used in the game world but not much more information on that

- New Emotes.

- New Orbit UI.

- New Ships / Shaders / Sparrows

- New Weapon Foundry - Veist

- Hawthorne (New NPC) lives at ""The Farm"" on Earth. (Possible new, 'homebase')

- The Farm was also shown to have a football pitch with goals and fireworks if someone scored. GAME ON

- Consoles will run at 30FPS

- There will be NO Dedicated Servers for D2. However, Bungie have released information regarding this and how they have their OWN versions of DS and how that effects P2P - For details, [Read Here - TWAB May 26th 2017](https://redd.it/6dd5co)

**Weapons / Abilities**

- Intellect / Discipline &amp; Strength did not appear on the Loadout screen - At this point, the game looks to be balancing itself by giving each subclass the SAME cooldown time / cooldowns are directly effected by selected abilties / different armour set ups on our Guardians

- Subclass perks have been 'simplified' and split into 'sections' rather than an assortment of selected perks. Each section has 4 abilites in for you to choose and in the reveal it was shown (With what looked liked) an Exotic Shard was needed to unlock each ability but this could be something new altogether or just a placeholder 

- Alongside grenade and melee abilities, each class also has a third special ability. Note, these are NOT supers.

- Grenade launchers and SMGs added - Heavy MGs not shown (Reports they have been removed)

- Swords returning but multiple reports of Sword 'Archtypes' so may not necesarily be dedicated to the Heavy Slot

- Weapons are getting a revamp, the three new slots are now ""Kinetic"", ""Energy"" and ""Power"" weapons. 

- Two primary weapons and 1 Heavy – We will be given a standard Primary, an elemental primary (In the special slot) and a Heavy Weapon. Primaries – Pulse / Auto / Scout / Hand Cannon. Secondary – Pulse / Auto / Scout / Hand Cannon / SMG / Sidearm. Heavy – Sniper / Rockets / Fusion Rifle / Shotgun / Grenade Launcher / Sword

- Supers – Gunslinger / Striker / Voidwalker to remain and be re-worked

- All Supers now appear to be ‘Roaming’ – Only Voidwalker wasn’t really shown as playable within the reveal but Striker was confirmed as roaming – Basically, multiple slams. 

- In the reveal, only Gunslinger, Striker &amp; Dawnblade were playable classes

- New Supers – Hunter – Arcstrider / Titan – Sentinel / Warlock – Dawnblade. These Supers look to replace Bladedancer / Defender / Sunsinger respectively

- Nightstalker / Sunbreaker / Stormcaller were **NOT** shown or discussed at any point. No confirmation these will be returning

- Abilities are seperate from Supers and were used by Holding O. Gunslinger showcased a new form of 'Shadestep' with 2 variants - 1 was to reload your weapon instantly afterwards, the other recharged your melee. Striker Titans deployed 1 of 2 walls - High version and a low version of which you can crouch behind and reload immediatley after popping over to fire. Dawnblade Warlocks had 2 'Buffs', 1 to weapon damage (Can be used by the Full Team - Only Buffed when IN the aura itself) and one that immediatley recharges shields (Can be used by the Full Team)


**PVP**

- All Crucible gametypes going down to 4v4. 

- New PVP gametypes. An attack/defend gametype called ""Countdown"" was showcased to attendees at the reveal

- 3 melees will now be required to kill a Full Health Guardian (Cannot confirm any abilities / combinations to lower this until we get more info) 

- New HUD shows enemies with Super Energy and Power Slot Ammo in PVP.

**The Last Word**

I know there's mixed feeling and reactions on this reveal but trust me, this game is something to be really excited about.

Some will have seen my meandering around the Sub recently sprinkling information about it because I was there in LA on reveal day and honestly, playing D1 is already feeling like I'm missing out

I can't wait for the BETA to drop so we can ALL get hands on with it to forge some real opinions of what's ahead (I've said that a few times but can't stress it enough)

I understand why people are sceptics and good, so you should be, it's going to be awesome when the BETA finally arrives

BoomRoasted18,2017-05-17 16:08:02+00:00,"The lottery order was set last night, so I made a mock draft with short descriptions for the first 14 picks. Enjoy.","     1. Boston Celtics - Markelle Fultz - PG, Washington

Oh to be a Celtics fan. #1 seed in the Eastern Conference, playing in the Eastern Conference Finals AND the #1 pick for 2017? My god. There's been trade speculation about this pick for a while now, but Boston would be wise to hold on to it. They have the Nets pick for 2018 as well, and along with a squad of solid young players, they have enough pieces to acquire a big name if they see fit. Markelle Fultz is just too big of a talent to pass on. One of the best point guard prospects we've seen in a while, and could end up being the face of the franchise. 


      2. LA Lakers - Lonzo Ball - PG, UCLA

The prophecy has been fulfilled - Lonzo Ball will be a Los Angeles Laker. You've probably heard a lot about Lonzo already, so I'll keep this short and sweet. He's a great shooter (even with the weird shot form), an even better playmaker, and he'll be the centerpiece of a talented young core in LA for years to come. 



      3. Philadelphia 76ers - Malik Monk - SG, Kentucky

The Sixers are in an awkward position. Their young core (Simmons, Embiid, Saric...) doesn't exactly include any elite three-point shooters, and the next best prospects on the board are De'Aaron Fox and Josh Jackson, who also struggle to shoot the three. 
So, the smart move here is to grab Malik Monk. He may not be *the* best player available, but he's still one of the best shooters in the country, an amazing athlete, and he fills a need. Besides, the Sixers have been taking the BPA for the last four years now, and they're still in the lottery....



      4. Phoenix Suns - Josh Jackson - SF, Kansas

Suns fans may have been disappointed to see their team fall out of the top three, but in this guard-heavy draft, that may not be the worst thing for Phoenix. They're loaded with young backcourt talent featuring Devin Booker, Tyler Ulis, Eric Bledsoe (edit: I've been told he's actually 27. Still relatively young though), and even Brandon Knight. What they don't have, however, is a small forward. Enter Josh Jackson. He's long, a freak athlete, an exceptional defender, and a good scorer. His only weakness really is his three-point shooting, but playing with guys like Devin Booker, that won't be a problem. He'll be a great fit in Phoenix. 



      5. Sacramento Kings - De'Aaron Fox - PG, Kentucky

Kings get a steal here with the #5 pick. Like Jackson, Fox is also a freak athlete. He's incredibly fast, a good defender, great at getting to the basket, and a fantastic playmaker. Also like Jackson, his one main weakness is his three-point shooting, but he'll pair nicely with Buddy ""the next Steph Curry"" Hield in what could be a very exciting Sacramento Kings backcourt for years to come. 



      6. Orlando Magic - Jayson Tatum - SF, Duke

The Magic don't really have much going for them at this point, so the smartest option here is to take the best player available. Jayson Tatum is going to be a solid NBA player. He's not really great at one particular thing, but he's a very balanced player that does everything well. He doesn't have *superstar* potential, but could definitely be an all-star, and will likely be the first (or second, depending on how you feel about Aaron Gordon) piece in what should be a long rebuilding process for Orlando. 



      7. Minnesota Timberwolves - Jonathan Isaac - PF, Florida State

One of the more intriguing prospects in this draft is Jonathan Isaac. He's 6'10 and has 7-foot-plus wingspan, but he's also very coordinated given his Antetokounmpo-esque length. He shoots the ball well, can score inside, and is a great rebounder. He has tremendous upside, so if he reaches his full potential (and puts on some weight), a Timberwolves lineup featuring him, KAT, Wiggins, and LaVine would be.... SPOOKY....



      8. New York Knicks - Dennis Smith Jr. - PG, NC State

Knicks fans were upset (what's new) when they found out their team would be picking a little lower than they had hoped. But fear not, the player you need should still be on the board at 8. Dennis Smith Jr. is yet another incredible athlete, a great scorer and passer, and has the potential to be an elite point guard. The brief Derrick Rose renaissance was nice, but with him leaving this summer, look for the Knicks to take their point guard of the future with this pick.



      9. Dallas Mavericks - Frank Ntilikina - PG, France

Here we see Dallas take a chance on the mysterious international point guard Frank Ntilikina. He's a fantastic perimeter defender with a pass-first mentality. He hasn't really played against elite competition, but he definitely passes the eye test. He's still 18, so Dallas *might* need to stash him in Europe for another year, but he has the potential to develop into a great player. 



      10. Sacramento Kings - Lauri Markkanen - PF, Arizona

Sacramento gets New Orleans' pick, so they're back again for their second top-ten pick. Kings fans may cringe seeing their team take yet another big man in the first round, but I think they'll make an exception for this one. A 7'0 power forward who can also shoot the three, Markkanen will be another NBA ""unicorn"", like Kristaps Porzingis. His size gives him the potential to excel at rebounding and scoring inside, and combined his ability to shoot from distance, he could be a star at the next level. Another steal for the Kings. 



      11. Charlotte Hornets - Harry Giles - PF, Duke

The Hornets have a solid backcourt with Kemba and Batum, but not much else. Lucky for them, there's a ton of frontcourt talent in the middle of the first round. They could play it safe and take someone like Zach Collins (which they'll probably end up doing), OR they could swing for the fences and take Harry Giles. Giles is probably the biggest ""boom-or-bust"" prospect in this draft, and most of that is dependent upon his health. He was a highly anticipated prospect heading into Duke, but had multiple major knee injuries in high school. This, coupled with an underwhelming freshman season, caused his stock to plummet, but if he stays healthy and plays to his potential, he could end up being one of the best players in this draft. The franchise has been pretty stagnant for the last 15 years, so why not take a chance on Giles?



      12. Detroit Pistons - Terrance Ferguson - SG, USA

The Pistons were among the worst three-point shooting teams in the league this year, so taking the sharp-shooting Terrance Ferguson here seems like the right move. Ferguson decided to forego college and play a year in Australia, so he didn't get a ton of exposure in the United States. He's still a raw talent, but he's got the potential to be an elite 3-point shooter in the NBA.   



      13. Denver Nuggets - OG Anunoby - F, Indiana

OG has been shooting up draft boards lately, and for good reason. He's a physical specimen - strong, athletic, huge wingspan, and one of the best defenders in this draft class. He's still pretty raw, especially on offense, and he's coming off an ACL injury, but if he stays healthy and continues to develop, he may live up to all those Kawhi Leonard comparisons. 



      14. Miami Heat -  TJ Leaf - PF, UCLA

And rounding out the lottery is UCLA's TJ Leaf. With Chris Bosh all but gone, Leaf would fill an immediate need for Miami. He's a great three-point shooter, and will probably develop into a very reliable stretch-four. He doesn't really have star potential, but he works hard has a high basketball IQ. ",nba,1595

Ask us anything!,"**Our short bio**: We’re Lisa Gartner and Zack Sampson, reporters at the Tampa Bay Times. We just published several stories about how [children who steal cars have become one of the biggest crime problems in our Florida county](http://s3.amazonaws.com/ledejs/resized/s2017-kids-cars/480/infrared.jpg). Police here made almost 500 arrests for grand theft auto in one year, more than just about anywhere in America, including Miami and Los Angeles. The kids were as young as 10. They were too small to ride all the rides at the amusement park. But they sped 100+ mph, the wrong way on bridges, and crashed a lot. Some died. The kids told us their reasoning was simple: to have fun. [One boy we wrote about, just 13, was considered the most dangerous kid on the street](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2017/investigations/florida-pinellas-auto-theft-kids-hot-wheels/videos/the-chase-auto-theft-t-man/). Cops thought he had an AK-47. He was barely 100 pounds.

Similar to last year, [I won the /r/Dota2 Best of 2016 award for ""Most Valuable Subredditor""](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5ln4i0/rdota2_best_of_2016_subreddit_winners/) next to SirBelvedere and promptly did an AMA after some interest - decided to do it again this year. Since then, this year has exploded with public acknowledgements from so many admirable names within gaming and live-streaming community and as of last month, I've started being very active on Twitch chat where I received a lot of support, appreciation and questions about myself and the project. I figured I'd do another AMA before things get too hectic for me again soon.

My name is Michael 'Torte de Lini' Cohen, I have been doing a project called the Standard Hero Builds Project, a catalog of hero builds for new players to rely on directly in the game. Recently this year, the hero builds reached 200 million and as of today, the guides have over 222,137,649 total subscriptions. I maintain about 155 hero builds with 12 dual item-builds within equally 167 builds in total. [You can view the entire Hero Builds Statistical Data here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WxtBkc006bOCHc7ZIraY1Vh_QdE6uuOmh1nYaKTj5_w/edit#gid=1804496006). At the moment, [the Sven guide is nearing 3 million unique subscribers](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=129079469), a first for the hero builds database

##**I would like to promote my subreddit /r/HeroBuilds if you have any criticisms about any hero build**
## **or [consider financially supporting the project via Patreon.com/torte](https://www.patreon.com/Torte)**

All feedback is usually answered and financial support goes directly towards the project, I do NOT keep or use any funding for personal interests.

-----

The Dota 2 Standard Hero Builds are a project I do in my spare time and without compensation. To survive, I have been working in esports for the past 7 years:

* I started in StarCraft II managing pro-gaming teams ranging from the original VT Gaming, Team Dynamic, Quantic Gaming, Infinity Seven and ROOT Gaming
* I went on to work in a lot of community events, LAN ETS, BarCraft Montreal, Special Tactics with White-Ra and the NASL Season 3: Finals [Toronto] and more
* In my spare time during college doing the above two jobs, I also wrote for many news organizations such as ESFI World, Definitve Esports and ESEA
* After graduating, I moved around the world to be involved in many start-up companies (some not so reputable):
 * I was first involved in a competing ESEA matchmaking client called PlayIGL as a Communications Director
 * I moved to Berlin, Germany to do business development for a studio making esports web-shows: ESGN
 * Later, I moved to Copenhagen, Denmark to create a digital magazine called 1337 Magazine at Aller Media
 * Last year, I arrived in Los Angeles to do business development for a live-streaming service named Azubu TV
 * and now I travel regularly to Moscow and reside in Berlin preparing to launch a media esports brand.

**I will try to answer as many questions as possible, I didn't get any sleep last night so I need to stay awake until it's officially bedtime**. I answer questions very extensively, so be prepared for very long and elaborate answers.

TVsRobLowe,2017-04-21 02:26:27+00:00,I noticed a bizarre reference to The Crow (1994) in Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers (1995),"While working from home tonight, I put on the 1995 Power Rangers movie for my kids to watch.  When Ivan Ooze creates the Tengu warriors, the instrumental playing caught my ear.  It sounded like a WCW-style knockoff of The Cure's ""Burn"" from The Crow Soundtrack.  ""Oh because they're crows.  That's a bizarre joke to put in there.""

So I went deeper.  I needed to find the song.  I went through the score for Power Rangers track by track, but came up with nothing.  So I went track by track on the soundtrack and hit paydirt: ""Firebird"" by Graeme Revell.

So googling that, the song was only released on the soundtrack for Power Rangers.  Then I searched for ""graeme revell firebird the cure"", hoping to find that someone else might have found the similarity.  The wiki for The Crow Soundtrack was in the first results, with this blurb of note:

""The other music in the film which is not included in the soundtrack is instead on The Crow: Original Motion Picture Score of original, mostly orchestral music, with some electronic and guitar elements, written for the film by Graeme Revell.""

Checking out Revell himself, he also scored Power Rangers.  Okay, so that's why they sound the same.  Pretty cool, right?  So I looked at The Crow's score, hoping to find ""Firebird"" on there, thinking it was just reused for Power Rangers.

NOPE! ""Firebird"" is only on Power Rangers.  Hearing its obvious similarity to ""Burn"", I can only assume that Revell composed this track for two possible reasons: As a joke/reference to the Tengu being crows, or it's an unused piece of music from The Crow.

""Firebird"" - https://youtu.be/1u00za1TwSM

""Burn"" - https://youtu.be/mfTkL-ZHDCY


Edit:  After listening to more of ""Firebird"" after 45 seconds it starts to sound like Nine Inch Nails' ""Dead Souls"" also from The Crow Soundtrack.
Dead Souls: https://youtu.be/sDHqywS6un0

Edit 2:  The reason ""Firebird"" is not on the Power Rangers score is because it was not originally composed for the film.  It's currently almost midnight and I fear this will consume me.  I am currently in pursuit of the liner notes to see which label ""Firebird"" was licensed from.  If you don't get an update from me by the morning, it means I have gone too far into this conspiracy and I may have met the consequences of revealing this information.  Please continue my life's work, if only for my children to grow up knowing that their father's sacrifice was not in vain.

Edit 3:  I found the credits for ""Firebird"", but it has lead me to a dead end.  Dead end.  Dead.  Like Brandon Lee.  Is this the end?

Woujo,2017-04-20 17:20:56+00:00,How to be confident,"The internet is full of articles and videos that supposedly teach how to be confident. Most of this shit is useless because confidence is an incredibly complex subject and takes sustained work to develop and maintain. There is no magic formula for confidence, and it can easily be lost. This article is my attempt, but don’t rely on it. 

Confidence is a complex mixture of positive thoughts and emotions. Actions create emotions, emotions create thoughts, and emotions and thoughts together create action. The emotions-thoughts-actions axis can either be a virtuous cycle, each improving the others, or it can be a negative cycle, each making the next thing shittier. I seek here to explain how to create a virtuous cycle of confidence. 

The first part of this article discusses confidence in general, and the second part discusses confidence in the context of getting laid. 

I can summarize the main points of this essay as follows: 

1) Confidence is faith that you will succeed at whatever you do. To have faith, you must see reality as governed by rationality and logic, and that all you need to do is use this rationality to achieve your goals. You must not see as reality as “out to get you.” 

2) To become confident you must re-wire your brain’s reward pathways such that you feel excited when you see a new challenge, rather than anxious and despairing. 

3) To re-wire your brain’s reward pathways you must continually undertake new challenges outside your comfort zone and succeed at them. 

4) To power through challenges, you must feel joy. 

5) To feel confident, you must not feel controlled by anybody, especially people your mind perceives as “alpha males.” 

**Confidence is faith**

The word confidence comes from the Latin con (with) + fidens (faith) (literally “with faith”). In other words, confidence is faith you will succeed in whatever you try to do. Faith is a belief that something is true even if you don’t have “hard” information confirming its truth. If I knew for a fact that a girl liked me, and I approached her, that’s not confidence. If I approach a girl I already know likes me, I’m no more confident than a guy eating a doughnut because he knows it will taste good. 

Obviously, it is easier to have confidence and faith when you have information to base it on. Everyone is confident the sun will rise tomorrow because it has risen every day of their life. But if you only base your confidence on things you are sure of you will live in a narrow comfort zone like most people do. Most people only feel “confident” if they already know they will succeed or if they’ve seen somebody else overcome that challenge. There are doctors who can do brain surgery but are deathly afraid to approach a woman in a bar. There are rock stars who can play a show in front of thousands of people but break a sweat trying to do their taxes. 

But why have faith? Why should you believe you will succeed at getting rich, getting laid, and being happy if most people fail at those things and you’ve never succeeded at them? 

Here’s why: Just having faith, by itself, makes you more likely to succeed. And the more faith you have, the more likely you are to succeed. If that sounds like the plot of that dumbass book “The Secret,” it is. It’s also the foundation of many religions and philosophies. But there is a rational reason why this is true that doesn’t depend on God or magic.

Faith helps you succeed because the main thing that stops you from achieving your goals is your own emotions. Most shit is a lot easier than you think it is. Getting hot girls to fuck you? Becoming a billionaire? Brain surgery? That stuff is hard, but how hard is it really? For almost anything you want to do, there is a stupid, fat, douchebag somewhere that is awesome at that thing. There are literally millions of people that are dumber and lazier than you that easily do the thing that you think is so hard. Most of the time, the challenge is in your own mind. 

A famous entrepreneur once told me that you can learn almost any business in 4 months. Malcolm Gladwell says you can become “world class” in any field if you do it for 10,000 hours, which is only about 4 years of working a full time job – not really that long to become the best in the world. As far as anybody can tell, the world is governed by rational rules that predictably operate based on logic. To succeed at anything, all you need to do is learn these rules and use them to succeed. Viewed this way, the only challenge is our own emotions: we get bored, afraid, distracted, impatient, anxious, intimidated, depressed, overworked, stressed out, sleepy, obsessed with the wrong details, lazy, angry, frustrated, etc… I call these the “despairing emotions.” 

You can take any task, break it up into a series of little parts, put one foot in front of the other, and eventually succeed. All you need to do is be rational, be prepared, and put the time and effort in. Everything in the world works like this – there is no “magic.” Even “luck” is very limited compared to what we make happen. Usually when we think something is “too hard” for us, our despair is hijacking our rational brain and making us think thoughts that we believe are “rational” but are really just justifications and expressions of our despair. When a heroin addict makes excuses to start doing heroin again, or when an entrepreneur decides to quit their business because it’s “too hard,” they think they are being influenced by rational thoughts, but really they are just being influenced by despair. 

Faith and confidence overcome our weak emotions. We power through challenges because our “motivated” emotions outweigh our despair, or at the very least, our intellectual thoughts manage and control our despairing emotions so that they do not cripple us. Successful people feel excitement and pleasure at doing their work whereas unsuccessful people feel fear, anxiety, dread, boredom, etc… And humans are wired to seek good feelings, so when we feel depressed and anxious we quickly run to “fix” is our shitty feelings – drugs, alcohol, porn, and other distractions.

Every time you encounter a challenge, your brain subconsciously does a complex cost-benefit analysis. You calculate the chance of success and the good feelings that come with it, and weigh that against the chance of failure and the bad feelings that come from failure. If your brain feels like you are more likely to feel bad, your despairing emotions will cripple you and make you not want to do it. Of course, this is bullshit. Your brain usually has no idea what the actual chances of success and failure are, nor does it know how you will actually feel after you succeed or fail, so it’s complex calculation is based on feelings from the past.  

Confidence requires rewiring your brain so that when it does the cost-benefit analysis, the “excited” emotions outweigh the despairing emotions. The easiest way to rewire your reward system is to succeed at things, so that, going forward, your brain feels like it will succeed again. But like I said, if you base your confidence on past successes you will never grow. True, ultimate, confidence is when you have faith that you will succeed at ANYTHING you try, even if you’ve never done it and it is something most people would think is insanely difficult. 

I’m not selling magic. There are some things you will never accomplish, no matter how confident you are. You can’t build a perpetual motion machine because it is probably impossible under the rules of physics. Most of you will never fuck Kate Upton, no matter how much you think you can. There is nothing wrong with thinking that something is impossible, or not worth the effort, or not the right thing for you at that time, but you must make that determination based on a rational calculation rather than your feelings. Most of what we think is impossible is actually very doable, we have just been tricked by our despair. 

Sometimes we just do not have enough information to make a rational calculation, and we must leap into the darkness. My dad had a theory that stupid people were often more successful than smart people, because smart people did intelligent cost-benefit calculations whenever they decided to take a life risk, whereas stupid people just jumped ahead and took the risk. When we leap into the darkness we must have faith that we will succeed. We also need faith that if we fail we will be fine and that failure helps us because it lightens the darkness and gives us guidance for the next try. We also need a plan to land on our feet if we fail. 

The rest of this article is dedicated to trying to teach you how to rewire your brain to feel excited about new challenges rather than scared. You can try to grit your teeth and fight your emotions 24/7, but you should also work to transform your emotions. 

**Faith and reality**

Your goal is to re-wire your reward system so that you feel excited tackling any new challenge, even if it is outside your comfort zone. You need faith because you have no way of knowing for sure that you will succeed at any new challenge and without faith you will be crippled with uncertainty, anxiety and existential despair. 

Faith is tied to your view of reality. Philosophers and psychologists have long understood that people have a tendency to subconsciously feel like reality has intentions like a person. People will feel like the world is out to get them, a small group of elders control everything, life hates them, they have “bad luck,” or they have “demons”, etc… It’s obviously stupid to say “I think reality has thoughts and feelings and hates me,” but that’s how a lot of people subconsciously think. I call this the “anthromorphization fallacy.”

I believe this fallacy comes from our ape mind. Apes evolved to obey the alpha male, because it is better for the tribe to have one leader rather than everybody doing their own thing. To enforce this obedience, evolution produced anxiety, which we feel whenever we feel like we are disobeying or upsetting the alpha male. Anxiety and depression are designed to “keep us in line” and make us feel powerless, paralyzed and weak whenever we want to do something that might offend the alpha male. 

Human are apes with rational brains that magnify and distort our ape feelings. We can subconsciously see the entire “world” as an alpha male, and feel a generalized anxiety about everything. This is why some people are negative about everything, scared of simple tasks like driving, randomly freak out at small things, and just generally have dark thoughts. 

Religion tries to fight the anthromorphization fallacy by pretending like “reality” is governed by God, which is essentially an alpha male that controls everything in reality and will be “nice” to you if you do some easy, meaningless rituals. I believe in God and I think it helps my anxiety. If you don’t want to believe in God, that’s fine, but at the very least you have to stop yourself from thinking that reality has a mind and it wants you to fail. At most, you can rationally say that, aside from ascertainable laws (the law of gravity, E=mc2, etc…), reality is basically random and chaotic and is neutral towards you. And if you are currently alive and breathing, you have to admit that reality has been at least somewhat good to you. 

Once you accept that reality is not your enemy, and may even be your friend, you can have faith that you will succeed at anything. Your despairing emotions will try to trick you into thinking you will fail, but they are irrational, often caused by the fear of some mental alpha male that may not even exist. How would your weak, human brain know anything about the nature of reality anyway? Many people, including myself, have realized the falsity of our despairing emotions after using psychedelic drugs, which chemically turn off our despairing emotions and make us feel like the universe loves us. 

I’m not saying that you can simply turn off your despairing emotions by simply believing that reality is your friend. You can’t turn off any emotion that is rooted in your biology, any more than you can turn off your sex drive. But the first step in controlling a demon is realizing that it’s there and that’s it a demon. If you practice mindfulness, you will catch yourself being lied to by your despairing emotions and you will realize your thoughts are irrational. 

I don’t want to overstate my case here. A subconscious cosmic alpha male is not the only source of despair. A lot of things can create anxiety and depression, and science has not even completely figured out those emotions. Anxiety can be caused by chemical balances, living in a dirty house, post-traumatic stress, bad life experiences, etc... But I believe that fear of alpha males, real and imagined, is a big source of despair for many people. 

**Real alpha males**

People have a subconscious fear of the cosmic alpha male that controls the world partly because actual alpha males bullied them, made them feel inferior, and induced subconscious “beta” emotions. These guys include your father, your teachers, your coach, your pastor, the cool kids at your high school, the President of the United States, the Federal Reserve bank, the media, society, Brad Pitt, and famous celebrities whose art and persona is designed to make regular guys feel inferior. These are just regular guys trying to make it through life just like you, but their ego, selfishness, stupidity, negligence, and bad judgment has scarred your self-esteem. 

These guys aren’t necessarily alpha males, but they felt like it to you, at least when they affected you. Their combined efforts have congealed in your brain to give you a fear of alpha males and reality in general. Women may have also made you feel emasculated, not because they wanted to emasculate you but because they were “testing” you to see if you were worthy of their delicious pussy. 

All men fear some alpha male. The head of the Crips gang in Los Angeles is the “alpha male” of the thug/gangster world, but he subconsciously sees a nerdy banker as the alpha male because the nerdy banker makes much more money and lives a better life than him, and the Crip leader is too scared to go to school and try to compete with the nerdy banker. The nerdy banker, in turn, sees another group of men as alpha to him, etc… 

A key to becoming confident is releasing yourself from the control that both real and imagined alpha males have over you. To do this, you must not give a single fuck what anybody thinks about you. Your actions should be governed by truth and a rational analysis of what is best for you, not your need to feel validated and accepted. The moment you care what others think of you, you constrain your behavior to gain their approval and feel despair when they deny it. And when you constrain your behavior, you show to yourself, them and the world that you can be perturbed and thrown off of your mission. And if you can be thrown off of your mission, then you no longer have the ability to succeed at anything. 

Many men link confidence to their tangible existence. A lot of guys say to me: “I’m not confident because I’m fat, or I don’t have enough money, or I’m awkward, etc…” That’s the wrong way to look at it. Your confidence should not be based on any tangible thing you have, but rather your inability to be controlled, because a man who cannot be controlled and can also obtain anything. If a woman said to you that she only feels confident when she’s wearing make-up, you wouldn’t think that that woman was confident: you would think that she is deeply insecure. A truly confident woman would be confident even if she was in a disfiguring accident that made her face look like ground beef. 

True confidence is the intellectual belief and the emotional feeling that you are awesome just because you are you, and that you will succeed because you don’t care what anybody thinks, you can’t be controlled, and will not fall victim to despair. Confidence has its own intrinsic value: I feel confident because I know I am confident. I know I am confident because I don’t care what other people think, and therefore nobody can perturb me from my mission, and if nobody can perturb me from my mission, I am guaranteed to succeed. 

**Happiness**

Happiness is both a result and cause of confidence. 

As I said earlier, humans are wired to seek good feelings, so if you are unhappy your brain will get distracted and chase sources of cheap happiness (TV, women, drugs, trashy internet, etc...). Your goal is to get your “happiness” from accomplishing your goals and defeating challenges, rather than cheap happiness. If you face every challenge with joy, you will be more motivated. 

You may be a fundamentally unhappy person. Maybe you’re depressed, or anxious, or have had a hard life. But there must have been at least one time in your life when you felt joy. If you can induce that feeling in yourself when you are pursuing your goals, or at least fake it, you will do better. One of my favorite quotes is from a rabbi who said that “how can I feel joy when my house has burnt down? I feel sad for a little, and then when I start rebuilding it, I feel joy with every brick I lay.” 

The upshot of this is that you should always be having fun. No matter how hard your life is, or what bad thing just happened to you, you need to have a social schedule where you are going out, doing things that make you feel good, fucking girls, hanging out with friends, etc... Obviously, you shouldn’t let your fun times take over your life or do anything self-destructive, but I disagree with the idea that success requires sustained misery. Being happy also requires eating well, getting enough sleep, and eliminating sources of negativity and distraction from your life. If you have a friend who consistently makes you feel like shit, or a woman who brings you more pain than happiness, cut them out. They are bad for you. 

Happiness is a result of confidence because confident people are more successful, and your confidence proves to you that you can succeed at anything. 

Getting rid of your fear of the alpha male also makes you happy because you no longer need to rely on anybody else for happiness. Human beings are actually very simple beings. All we need is a little bit of food, decent shelter, one vagina to put your dick in (you should reject the societal notion that you can’t be happy unless you fuck lots of girls), and love. All of our other fake desires are rooted in our need for the love of others. We mostly desire “luxury” things like nice cars, mansions or designer clothes because we think it will cause other people to love us and care about us. A truly confident man knows that he will be loved no matter what he has or who he is, because his value comes from being imperturbable and a model for others. And if people want to deny him love based on his material circumstances, then that’s their problem, not his. 

I’m not saying that nice cars, mansions and nice clothes are bad things. I enjoy all those things. I’m also not saying that women don’t care about tangibles. Women definitely do care about how you look, how you dress, how much money you have, etc... There are some women that will just never fuck a short, bald poor guy no matter how much “game” he has. But your own confidence and self-esteem should not depend on your tangibles. You should live your most awesome life. If girls like you, great. If not, no problem. 

**Can you really not care what people think?**

It’s impossible to truly not care what anybody thinks of you. Human beings are social animals, and we evolved to form emotional connections with other people and to care what they think of us. We need sex, affection and human contact. The only way to truly not care about the opinions of others is to either be a psychopath or a hermit that lives in the woods.  

I’m not saying that you should cut off contact from all other humans. I’m saying you should engage in mutually beneficial relationships with people, where you exchange the things humans need to exchange (love, friendship, affection, fun times, etc…), WITHOUT LETTING THEM CONTROL YOU and without becoming submissive.  

To prevent people from controlling you, or abusing your, or manipulating you, or taking advantage of you, you must have a strong set of boundaries. Boundaries are “rules” for yourself that you will not allow others to break. A confident man is confident his rules are morally correct and makes others bend to his moral guidelines, not vice versa. If you have faith in your principles and stand by them, you cannot be manipulated by women or by society into acting against your own interests, doing the wrong thing, or chasing stupid trophies like nice cars and shit. 

I'm not here to push a certain type of morality on you, and I think many set of rules can be ""correct"" depending on your situatiion, the people you are dealing with, and your personal preferences. What's important is not having this or that set of rules, but generally having unbreakable principles. You should constantly reevaluate your rules and changing them if they are ""wrong"" and/or not conducive to the type of life you want to live. You should also be open to reasonable arguments by third parties that your rules may be wrong. 

**The good life**

An important part of being confident is having a clear vision of what you consider to be the good life. Nobody can control you if you are happily pursuing the good life. This vision is a set of priorities and beliefs about the world that guide what you seek and care about. For example, if a hot girl tries to pressure me to do cocaine I say no because cocaine contradicts my vision of the good life because of its harmful effects. This sounds like third grade health education, but it is amazing that many adults can be peer pressured simply because they don’t have their own vision of the good life. I know rich, successful adult men that have become cokeheads because the beautiful women they were pressured by hot girls to do it. It’s absolutely fucking incredible that a millionaire Silicon Valley CEO can be peer pressured by a bartender into doing cocaine but it happens all the fucking time. And because that guy had no vision of the good life, he is now addicted and does cocaine even when those girls are not around. 

Your boundaries and your vision of the good life are connected. I set boundaries because I am pursuing a certain life, and if you get in the way, you are dismissed. For example, my vision of the good life involves waking up early to work out and work on my businesses. Many people (usually trashy girls not doing anything useful with their lives) don’t understand that vision and try to pressure me into staying out late. No matter how beautiful they are or how close I am to getting pussy, I say no and go home. No matter how hot she is and how much I think I can’t find anybody else like her that will respect my rules, I keep the faith.  

Your vision of the good life should have a place for all of your pleasures and pursuits. I like fucking hot girls, but I also like getting enough sleep, eating well, going to fun concerts, being around positive people, succeeding at my business, talking about deep, intellectual things I am interested in, etc…  

Understanding the good life also makes you feel better about your shortcomings. Women are part of the good life, but you don’t need to fuck the hottest girl and you definitely don’t need to “get” every girl you like. If you think that happiness requires you to be 6’0 or drive a Ferrari or bang X girls a year, you lose your confidence if you don’t have those things. If your vision of the good life is simpler, however, you can’t be shamed and guilted if you don’t have those things.  

**Why are women attracted to confidence?**

First of all, everyone is attracted to confidence. Nobody wants to be around an insecure, sad, moping sack of shit. And nobody likes to be around somebody that is easily controlled. Humans are wired to reach for something higher than us, not somebody beneath us that doesn’t challenge us or help us grow. That said, women have a special desire for a confident man. Why? 

Because women have babies and are physically weaker than men, women evolved to seek a strong, powerful man who can make a credible commitment to protect her and her baby until the baby reaches a certain age. A protector’s commitment is only credible if he cannot be thrown off of his mission, whatever that mission is. If a protector becomes emotional, dishonest, distracted, or submissive, he can no longer be trusted to protect. In other words, if a protector can be controlled by others or crippled by despair, his commitment is not credible and the woman is vulnerable. 

It does not matter how confident you actually are, but whether you can display that confidence to a woman. Confidence is performative. A woman wants to see you confidently pursue a mission and not be perturbed and more importantly, not show despair. Women can subconsciously sense despair in a man. She wants to see you be a brick wall. Women also subconsciously know that the thing that is most likely to perturb a man is a woman, so she will purposely try to perturb you to see how you react. If you even flinch, she will question your emotional credibility. This is what we call a “shit test.” 

A big problem is that men meet women in social situations where they are drinking and having fun, so women do not see men confidently pursue their mission. For most men, when they go out, women are their mission. But fixating on women subconsciously causes you to be controlled by women, reducing your attractiveness. This is why DJs and bartenders are more attractive to women – they are actually doing something rather than just drooling over them. 

**Your place in the tribe**

On a subconscious level, women want a guy who does not appear to be controlled by the tribe. This is part of the reason women like “bad boys” – a “bad boy” tingles the same receptors that an alpha male tingles because the bad boy does not conform to anybody’s rules and does not “feel” like he is “controlled” by any other male. This is irrational, of course – most “bad boys” are losers and the opposite of an actual alpha male. But we are talking about emotions here, not rationality. The alpha male does what he wants, and he doesn’t rely on anybody else for anything, either physical or emotional. He is the only one that cannot be controlled. Sure, the alpha male does have the most tangible things (food and resources) but the alpha male isn’t thinking about that. 

The true alpha male is not the biggest, loudest, meanest, toughest guy: it’s the guy who literally does not give a single fuck and cannot be controlled. It’s the guy who walks in a party with a ridiculous ugly neon green floppy hat. It’s the guy who tells an embarrassing story about himself that most people would be too afraid to tell. It’s the guy who does something that’s a little off, not because he’s weird or has problems, but because he just lives in his own reality. The alpha male is totally relaxed, calm, confident in what he’s doing, and is never, ever, perturbed by anything anybody does, especially women. 

If you walk into a bar or nightclub, you see a bizarre scene. Otherwise confident, successful, manly men are selling their souls. They are begging beautiful women to buy them drinks, listening intently to their stupid stories and agreeing with their stupid opinions, begging for their attention, waiting for them as they talk to other men, etc… These men instantly lose credibility to women because they are begging to be accepted and are easily controlled. In other words, these men are experiencing the same emotional anguish that the women experience, which turns women off. Women want to escape their emotional anguish, not be with a guy that is also experiencing it.

I wrote an article about how women are not attracted to men that are overly emotionally invested in them. See here: https://www.woujo.com/blog/2017/4/11/how-to-not-become-emotionally-invested-in-women. A major reason emotionally invested people are unattractive is because they are “dependent” on another person for their good feelings, therefore making them controlled. And women are fundamentally not attracted to men who can be controlled.  

**Bitchy women**

A lot of guys’ confidence melts around bitchy women. I, however, love bitches. 

A woman is bitchy for one of two reasons: 1) she has suffered some trauma in her life that has damaged her, or 2) she regularly turns men into weak puddles, so she turns up the bitchiness to make sure she can find a mate whose confidence is rock solid. For women that are #1, you should just run. You are not her therapist and cannot help them. But women that are #2 are a fun challenge. Whenever a woman is a bitch to me, I know I am on my road to fucking her and all I need to do is keep my cool and not be perturbed. 

Bitchiness is just a front to hide their intense insecurity and anxiety. Confident, happy, well-adjusted people act polite and friendly, even if they are being hit on by somebody they don’t think is attractive. All hostility and negativity is rooted in fear, defensiveness, and your own perceived vulnerability. Women are crippled with insecurity and anxiety about how men, women and society in general feel about them and have an intense desire to be accepted.

Next time you go to a club, put your horniness aside and just focus on the body language of these bitchy women. They are afraid. They are insecure. They are awkward. They are dorks. They are easily controlled, if they could just find somebody with the balls to try to control them. Even when they try to talk tough or cool, it’s a bluff. A hot woman acting like a bitch is similar to a 16 year old nerd with a pocket protector and acne talking shit to a prison convict. He knows he is faking it, and the moment the prison convict calls his bluff he will back down in fear and humiliation. 

Not all women are bitches. I know some confident women, but these women are confident because they have other things going for them. They are smart, they have accomplished things, they are fun to hang out with, etc… But whenever a woman tries to act like she’s the shit just because she’s hot, she is faking it every single time. 

**How to act around women**

Let’s do some logic. Women are attracted to confidence. Confidence is faith that you will succeed. Therefore, women are attracted to men who have faith they will succeed in fucking them. In other words, women want a guy to act like he already knows she will fuck him. Of course, you don’t actually know whether she will fuck you. But nevertheless, you must act as if you KNOW she will fuck you. You must bluff as if you know she will say yes. And even if you get rejected, you must move on to the next girl with the same confidence.

Now the question becomes: if you truly knew from the bottom of your heart you could fuck a girl, how would you act? You wouldn’t supplicate, or beg, or act needy, or even do anything really. If you KNEW you could fuck a girl, you would do nothing. Of course, you should talk to her and be nice so that you don’t make her feel bad, and you would engage with her to the extent that she says or does anything interesting or funny. But the moment she does something negative, shitty, or boring, you immediately lose interest because you don’t need to put up with her bullshit. 

Unlike a lot of other PUA blogs, I am not going to feed you a bunch of lines of what a confident guy “would” say. The fact is, confidence is an emotional state, and you either have it or you don’t. And girls can sense it because it is very hard to fake your emotions, especially if you are hanging out with a girl for a long time. 

**Humility**

Releasing yourself from the mental slavery of the alpha male sounds great, but it is actually very dangerous. Most people in our society can only function if they are being guided by a superior: society, your dad, the government, your boss, etc... They need the anxiety induced by the alpha male to stay focused and not go off and get drunk and play video games. But if you want to be a truly confident, self-actualized man, you need to be able to motivate yourself when there is no alpha male swinging an axe over your head. 

Not only must you be your own alpha male, but you must cultivate a positive humility, where you listen to men that are smarter and more powerful than you, not because of your irrational ape emotions, but because they are smarter than you and they are helping you improve. If you look at history, a lot of times when men get a ton of power they go crazy (see kings, dictators, rock stars, Mike Tyson, etc...) because they don’t have the anxiety of the alpha male controlling them but they also don’t have the humility to stay focused and keep their head on straight.

A co-worker of mine still lives in Hollywood, and that area has turned into a disaster. Cops are always there, and always hanging back. They have been ORDERED not to interfere. There should be criminal investigations into Eric Garcetti and Charlie Beck in Los Angeles, and the mayor and chief of police of Berkley. I'm sure De Blasio and Rahm ""The Godfather"" are doing the exact same thing.

All of these mayors and police chiefs actively HATE the people they are supposed to be serving. They want chaos and destruction, although for the life of me, I can't understand why. The mayors and chiefs should be rotting in jail.

JoelEmbeast,2017-04-14 00:28:41+00:00,[OC] My proposal for a new lottery odds system based on wins/losses instead of standings.,"**""Losses above the league average” weighted lottery odds**

**Disclaimer:**  This post is not like any of the “Lottery Reform” posts I see here on a near daily basis.  I think the system in place generally does it’s job, but could use some tweaking.  Mainly I think the odds could be tweaked.  Unlike most proposals here I do not claim that this system will “fix” tanking, but it would change the day to day incentives of teams a bit.  My goal wasn’t to create the perfect system, just a slightly better one. 

**The problem:**  The current lottery system is based on standings, not raw win/loss.  I believe this is flawed. For example, imagine the bottom of the standings are as follows:

Brooklyn Nets: 20-62

Phoenix Suns: 21-61

Los Angeles Lakers: 21-61

Philadelphia 76ers: 22-60

In this scenario, despite having very similar seasons, (2 extra wins is nothing in the context of an 82 games season) the Nets would get 25% of the total lottery combinations while the 76ers would only get 12%.  This is a failure of the current lottery system because it doesn’t correctly allocate the lottery combinations in a way that reflects how bad the teams are.  The Sixers were only marginally better than the Nets so they should get marginally fewer balls, not less than half.

Last night was a great example of the problematic behaviors that come from this problem.  Going into their final games, the Sixers were tied with the Orlando Magic.  In the end, the Sixers lost and the Magic lost, leaving the Sixers 4th and the Magic 5th in the lottery standings.  Despite having nearly identical seasons by win %, the Sixers were awarded 12% of all possible lottery combinations with a 38% chance at a top 3 pick, while the Magic were awarded less than 9% of combinations with a 29% chance of a top 3 pick.  This may not seem like much to fans of non-tanking teams, but after an 81 game failure of a season, the threat of losing over 25% of your lottery combinations in one game is kind of ridiculous.   This incentive is enough to make some teams do everything in their power to try to lose.  **Cough**   Tiago Splitter threes **Cough**.

**My solution:** Weigh the lottery odds on the number of losses each team has above the league average, instead of a system based on standings.

How I determined that 41 losses was an appropriate baseline:

I initially came to the conclusion that the baseline bar for losses should be based on the team in the lottery with the most wins / fewest losses.  I soon realized that this created too much year to year variability, so instead I'm using ""losses above the league average"", using 41 losses as the baseline for the metric.  38-40 results in slightly better data for me, but “losses above the league average” makes a bit more sense in my head than “losses above an arbitrary set baseline.”  Therefore, I will subtract out 41 losses from each lottery team, and use that metric to determine the lottery odds.  One problem with this baseline is that sometimes, lottery teams have equal to or fewer than 41 losses, resulting in 0 or negative losses above league average.  When this is the case, each team at or above 41 wins will receive 5 total lottery combinations (of the total 1000,) and the remaining ones will be allocated according to the model.  Let’s look how this all works out. 

Brooklyn Nets: 20-62

Phoenix Suns: 21-61

Los Angeles Lakers: 21-61

Philadelphia 76ers: 22-60

In the current system, Brooklyn would be given over double the lottery combinations compared to Philadelphia, but in a system based on losses above the league average, they wouldn’t be much different at all.  

Brooklyn Nets (20-62):  62-41 = 21 losses above the league average.

Phoenix Suns (21-61):  61-41 = 20 losses above the league average.

Los Angeles Lakers (21-61):  61-41 = 20 loses above average.

Philadelphia 76ers (22-60):  60-42 = 19 loses above average.

In a lottery system based upon “losses above the league average”, these teams would receive relatively equal lottery odds that correctly reflect their relatively equal seasons. For example, Philadelphia (19 losses above the league average), should receive somewhere close to 19/21 the amount of lottery combinations that Brooklyn (21 losses above the league average) receives.

**Pros:** 

* The system more fairly allocates the lottery combinations.

* Individual tank races wouldn’t hold as much weight. 

* It allows you to discourage extreme tanking by not counting any additional “losses above league average” after a cutoff point.  I propose that any additional losses above 62 (20 win seasons) are not accounted for in “losses above league average”, so teams have no incentive to be “next level bad”.  A hard-cutoff isn’t ideal, but a more nuanced graduated system could be implemented as well, such as counting every loss after 57 (25 win season) as a half loss.

**Cons:**
  
* The system I drew up is way, way more complicated than the current system, and it’d need to be even more complicated I believe to properly work as well as it could potentially.  People even say the lottery is too complicated now and this is about 10x as complicated.

* Every lottery team has a very small incentive to lose any given game, regardless of if there are teams close to them in the standings.  Last night for instance, the Pistons had so reason to lose, but under my system they would.

* Standings still matter for the teams that don't win the lottery (most teams).  For instance, let’s say in the above scenario, none of the top 4 teams win the lottery.  All 4 teams would be pushed down 3 spots, and the Sixers (pick 7) would still receive a far worse draft pick than the Nets (pick 4), despite their very similar records.  Even though the lottery odds would be more fairly allocated, the standings would still hold an unfortunate amount of weight in expected draft position.  For teams in later lottery slots (8-14), the lottery odds are so small that they matter very little relative to the position that they will receive if they don’t win the lottery, so this system would do little to address behavior like what the Mavericks did at the end of this season.  It’s mostly aimed at addressing behavior among the bottom 5 teams.

* I later determined that I needed to transform the data to get ideal results.  The exponent that is chosen will be pretty arbitrary.


**How this lottery system would work with this season’s standings:**

First, we need to add up the total amount of losses above league average from all lottery teams.  Thankfully no teams are below 20 so we can just use the raw loss totals: 

(62-41)+(58-41)+(56-41)+(54-41)+(53-41)+(51-41)+(51-41)+(50-41)+(49-41)+(49-41)+(46-41)+(45-41)+(42-41)+(41-41) = 132 total losses above league average.  

Next, we need to take the 1000 total lottery ball combinations, subtract 5 of them (Miami has 0 losses above league average) and divide them by the total losses above the baseline to see how much each loss above the baseline is worth in lottery combinations.

995/132 = 7.54

Interpretation:  This means that each loss above the baseline is worth approximately 7.54 lottery ball combinations, or a 0.754% chance at the #1 pick.  This number is specific to these standings only, and will change every year based on the amount of total losses above league average, although it stays relatively close from year to year.

Then you calculate the odds for each team, using the following method:

**Brooklyn Nets** ( 62 losses): (62-41) = 21 losses above 41.  21*(7.54) = 158 lottery ball combinations out of 1000, or a 15.8% chance at the #1 pick.  They have a 25.0% chance under the current lottery system.

**Phoenix Suns** (58 losses): (58-41) = 17 losses above 41.  17*(7.54) = 128 lottery ball combinations out of 1000, or a 12.8% chance at the #1 pick.  They have a 19.9% chance under the current lottery system.

Here's a table which shows how all the odds would shake out (credit to /u/primarysrc for teaching me how to make the table:

Team|Record|Losses Over League Average (41)|New % #1|Current % #1
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:-- 
Brooklyn Nets|20-62|21|15.8%|25.0% 
Phoenix Suns|24-58|19|12.8%|19.9% 
Los Angeles Lakers|26-56|15|11.3%|15.6% 
Philadelphia 76ers|28-54|13|9.8%|11.9% 
Orlando Magic|29-53|12|9.0%|8.8% 
New York Knicks|31-51|10|7.5%|5.3% 
Minnesota Timberwolves|31-51|10|7.5%|5.3% 
Sacramento Kings|32-50|9|6.8%|2.8% 
Dallas Mavericks|33-49|8|6.0%|1.7% 
New Orleans Pelicans|34-48|7|5.3%|1.1% 
Charlotte Hornets|36-46|5|3.8%|0.8%
Detroit Pistons|37-45|4|3.0%|0.7%
Denver Nuggets|40-42|1|0.8%|0.6%
Miami Heat|41-41|0|0.5%|0.5%
Total|N/A|13|99.9%|100%

Due to rounding on my part, only 999 of the 1000 lottery combinations are accounted for. (sorry)

**Analysis:**

This lottery system accomplished its main job.  The difference in lottery combinations between teams with only a one or two win difference is much closer than it would be in the current system.  However, my system inadvertently gives too many lottery balls to teams in the middle of the lottery.  I personally believe the current lottery weights are relatively appropriate based on slots, so this is undesirable to me.  
So this model:

* Doesn’t give enough lottery combinations to the very worst teams (1-4).

* Gives too many lottery combinations to middle/lower tier teams (6-12)

To solve this problem you could perform a statistical transformation, raising each “wins above league average to an appropriate power (my tests showed between 1.5-2.0 worked best).  This would give more of the combinations to the very worst teams.

**Edit:**  Due to overwhelming support, I went through the effort of actually transforming the data. First, I took the wins over baseline for each team, and raised it to the 1.5th power.  This gives more balls to the teams with the highest losses above league average.  Those odds look much closer to the current system, while maintaining the benefits of my new proposed system (Teams that are 1-2 wins different have very similar odds).

[Here's a sharable link of the google sheet I used to do this work, in case you want to fiddle with the inputs to try to get a perfect model.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IScLq31D-nfhMvsOp0Wbf0Dpef3Q8l5nY__Ftp6AaYo/edit?usp=sharing)

Here’s the table using a 1.5 exponent to transform the data:

Team|Record|Adjusted Losses Over League Average (41-Losses)^1.5|New % #1|Current % #1
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
Brooklyn Nets|20-62|96.2|20.6%|25.0% 
Phoenix Suns|24-58|70.1|15.0%|19.9% 
Los Angeles Lakers|26-56|58.1|12.4%|15.6% 
Philadelphia 76ers|28-54|46.9|10.0%|11.9% 
Orlando Magic|29-53|41.6|8.9%|8.8% 
New York Knicks|31-51|31.6|6.75%|5.3% 
Minnesota Timberwolves|31-51|31.6|6.75%|5.3% 
Sacramento Kings|32-50|28|5.76%|2.8% 
Dallas Mavericks|33-49|22.6|4.8%|1.7% 
New Orleans Pelicans|34-48|18.5|3.9%|1.1% 
Charlotte Hornets|36-46|11.2|2.4%|0.8%
Detroit Pistons|37-45|8|1.7%|0.7%
Denver Nuggets|40-42|0|0.5%|0.6%
Miami Heat|41-41|0|0.5%|0.5%
Total|N/A|463.4|100%|100%

Note:  Denver ended up receiving less than 5 combinations initially, so I excluded them along with Miami, and only reallocated the remaining 990 combinations.  

Here’s the table using a 2.0 exponent to transform the data:

Team|Record|Adjusted Losses Over League Average (41-Losses)^(2)|New % #1|Current % #1
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
Brooklyn Nets|20-62|441|25.6%|25.0% 
Phoenix Suns|24-58|289|16.8%|19.9% 
Los Angeles Lakers|26-56|225|13.8%|15.6% 
Philadelphia 76ers|28-54|169|9.8%|11.9% 
Orlando Magic|29-53|144|8.4%|8.8% 
New York Knicks|31-51|100|5.8%|5.3% 
Minnesota Timberwolves|31-51|100|5.8%|5.3% 
Sacramento Kings|32-50|81|4.7%|2.8% 
Dallas Mavericks|33-49|64|3.7%|1.7% 
New Orleans Pelicans|34-48|49|2.8%|1.1% 
Charlotte Hornets|36-46|25|1.5%|0.8%
Detroit Pistons|37-45|16|0.9%|0.7%
Denver Nuggets|40-42|0|0.5%|0.6%
Miami Heat|41-41|0|0.5%|0.5%
Total|N/A|1703|100%|100%

As you can see, with an exponent of 2.0, the distribution of lottery combinations is nearly as stratified as the lottery is today.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  As losses get very high, win % drops very quickly with every loss  For instance the difference between 41-41 and 36-46 isn't as big as the difference between 25-57 and 20-62.  Exponential transformations can account for the increased rarity / meaning of losses as they get further and further above the league average.

So clearly the sweet spot for the exponent is somewhere in that general vicinity of 1.5-2.0.  If anyone is smarter than me about statistical modeling I could use some help ironing out the details.

By: /u/25_Star_General_

#Lord of the Rings Trilogy Tier


30) **San Antonio Spurs**

The gold standard.  547 consecutive 50-win seasons, dating back to their time in the Mesoamerican League where they dominated the Mayan hoop ball game. Timoteo Duncano led the league in their first year with 7000 points and 3 ritual sacrifices.  The addition of conquistador Gonzalo Ginobili in their 7th year really helped establish a dynasty.

29) **Golden State Warriors**

This silicon valley darling is light years ahead.  Their entire franchise is run by their proprietary SkyeNet^^TM supercomputer, removing human bias and fallibility, and drafts/trades are determined by an algorithm combining PER, TS%, BPM, ORPM, DRPM, RAPM, WAR, WS/48, 3pAR, VORP, and the Ashe Conformity experiment to determine level of malleability when the AI takes over.

28) **Boston Celtics**

The winningest franchise in NBA history.  Power couple Danny Ainge and Brad Stevens (henceforce known as BrAingelina) continue to run the model franchise after a 2008 title.  The Nets and Kings should be placed in a Battered Women's Shelter because they've been repeatedly abused by the Celtics in some of the worst trades I've ever seen.  

#Jurassic Park Tier

27) **Houston Rockets**

We all know MoreyBall.  It's where you try to win a trade with Houston, and you end up juggling Daryl Morey's balls in your mouth.  You wake up the next morning hungover, hoping you didn't have unprotected ~~sex~~ picks on the table last night.  Harden is a revelation at PG, D'Antoni's *Seven Seconds or Less* has been vindicated, and the Rockets' black magic has resurrected the corpses of Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon.

26) **Toronto Raptors**

This team is deep, and they convinced two All-Stars to stay -- something they never managed with Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady. Lowry and DeRozan are pluses, but Drake being their mascot is a minus.  I watched a 10-minute interview on TSN during a Raptor's game and Drake is the phoniest basketball fan I've ever seen.  They asked him to go through the entire roster and what they bring to the team.  He answered ""hustle and teamwork"" for all 15, like a kid in front of the class discussing his [book report](https://youtu.be/Mp_EArT4H_E) on a book he didn't read.  I think he went a little too hard with that lint roller and cut off the circulation to his brain.



25) **Oklahoma City Thunder**

That this team never won a Championship is completely insane.  Drafting Durant, Westbrook, Harden and Ibaka might be one of the greatest feats in NBA history.  The league shot them in the left foot grandfathering Durant's contract, causing gangrene. Then OKC said ""we'll take it from here"" and amputated their right foot by mistake and let Harden go to avoid the luxury tax.  That trade produced Steven Adams, and OKC was the best team in the NBA last season, where Klay Thompson recreated the [debate scene](https://youtu.be/_yYDzLUH1NE?t=1m5s) from Old School and singlehandedly ended a dynasty.  Sam Presti is a great GM, but it's hard to feel sympathy for cheap crooks who [stole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9Dp20ydm1E) the team from Seattle.

I'd ask Clay Bennett what defeat smacks of, but that would imply he could ever get the taste of David Stern's ass out of his mouth.

24) **Atlanta Hawks**

The Atlanta Hawks have been a great organization for years now, as the Mike Budenholzer era produced great ball movement and unselfish play that produced a 60-win season and an ECF berth.  The franchise was recently sold off due to racist comments, with the sale being handled by Goldman Sachs, while trading away Jeff Teague and putting their faith in Dennis Schröder to run the team.  There's nothing more reassuring than a German ascending to power while a bank hiding gold in Switzerland is brought in due to racially-motivated remarks.

#Forrest Gump Tier

23) **Cleveland Cavaliers**

That look when you're a dumpster fire franchise but the best player in the world happens to be born in your state.  Only 3 of the 7 best-run franchises have won a championship in the past 20 years, but hey, who needs organizational discipline, good scouting, a strong analytics team, trust, and a lack of dysfunction when you can luck into three #1 picks in four years and get LeBron back for free?  This is the most undeserving franchise, in the most deserving city.  David Griffin has done a very good job, but so have the GMs of at least a dozen other franchises.  

Never underestimate the power of bungling incompetence to produce high draft picks that reward stupidity.

#French Connection Tier
^Yes, ^there's ^a ^French ^Connection ^sequel.  ^No, ^you ^shouldn't ^watch ^it.



22) **Utah Jazz**

Man, the Utah Jazz are looking really good! Although I may be overly excited about them since I just saw *Book of Mormon* on Broadway. How about that Gordon Hayward, though?  Is this the year he hoists the Larry O'Brien Trophy? I haven't seen Utahans this excited following a white guy's quest for shiny metal since Joseph Smith found the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates).  Rudy Gobert is an absolute beast.  Quin Snyder is a great coach.  Their front office has loaded the team with talent.  ESPN is [gushing](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18273165/zach-lowe-utah-jazz-gordon-hayward-rudy-gobert-nba) about them.  

Not only are they a small market team, but most of us have a place in our heart for the Jazz as our default team in *NBA JAM*.  I could probably only name 8 NBA players in the mid-90s, and one of them was Jeff Hornacek.  When your jerk friends shoved Stockton and his INJURY stat became too high, you had to swap in [The Horny GOAT](http://spreegoogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/picture-31-e1300167872288.png) for a quarter.

21) **LA Clippers**

2017 is the year I stopped believing in the Clippers.  Every year I talk myself into it, and every year they disappoint.  Chris Paul is a point god.  Nothing you say will ever convince me Blake Griffindor wasn't the best player in the NBA through the first month of the 2015 playoffs.  He destroyed the Spurs.  He made Houston look foolish.  Then he just completely ran out of gas. He would disappear in the second half of games. Now he's punching people. And his quad has the structural integrity of the Death Star.  No matter how many times you rebuild it, it keeps blowing up.  Their bench has been a constant disappointment.  Doc Rivers has not gotten it done on the GM end, and the team has had full of drama with the infamous *DeAndre Does Dallas*.  They're still a great team with three All-Stars, but it's either Finals or bust for them this season.


#Blade Runner Tier

20) **Milwaukee Bucks**

Giannis Alphabetsoupo is a legitmate superstar. Jabari Parker and Khris Middleton are great pieces, and Malcolm Brogden, Tony Snell, Greg Monroe, Thon Maker, and Delly make this team interesting as hell.  Parker tore his ACL, and they were already (Khris) middling this year, but nevertheless they're still young, and I'm optimistic.  If Jason '*The BillieKingslayer*' Kidd can avoid the temptation to make another coup, I'm confident in his ability to lead this team to greatness.


19) **Portland TrailBlazers**

If the TrailBladerunners manage to snag the eighth and final spot in the West, the Spurs better watch out, given Kawhi is likely a replicant.  If there's one thing ~~Deckard~~ Lillard is good at, it's retiring powerful foes (Just ask Houston.)

Neil Oshley went from being the NBA front office equivalent of Ari Gold on *Entourage* to Charlie Runkle on *Californication* in the span of one year, because spending $150,000,000 on Evan Turner and Allen Crabbe is a lot like getting caught masturbating in your office.  You're still one of the most talented execs in the business, but now people are definitely kinda sorta looking at you funny when you walk by them in the hall.

The most popular safe word in Oregon is ""DON'T SIGN EVAN TURNER"" because there's only so much pain BDSM enthusiasts can take.

18) **Dallas Mavericks**

I love Dallas.  Everything they do is just so ballsy and entertaining.  They tore down their 2011 title team believing they could do better (they couldn't).  They gave up a ton of assets making a swing for the fences with Rondo (they whiffed).  They almost orchestrated the signing of DeAndre Jordan (they didn't.)  Oh, Brave, Brave Sir Cuban.  Who nearly fought the Dragon of Angnor...  Who almost stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol... And who had personally wet himself at the [Battle of Badon Hill](https://youtu.be/d-6kuVhKzmk?t=12s).

Despite all this, they still managed two Finals appearances, culminating in a Championship.  Their head coach, Rick Carlisle, is a dark wizard.  Their owner is genuine and kind.  And unlike the Miami Heat, they paid Dirk.  It's a classy franchise with a winning culture, and even when it would be easier to tank, they're still grinding it out for a playoff spot, throwing Harrison freakin' Barnes  the max, and giving us the Curry/Bogut/Barnes lineup we craved.  

17) **Miami Heat**

They finally did it.  The maniacs.  They really did it.  They blew it up.  They disrespected the shit out of Dwayne Wade over and over and he finally left, proving definitely *La Familia* was always complete bullshit.  They amnestied Mike Miller.  LeBron left. Bosh's career is over.  The stories of ""you're making the biggest mistake of your life"" with Bron and the falling out with Shaq are now public record.

Despite all that, the Heat are still one of the best franchises in the NBA.  Four straight finals, 3 rings, one of the best coaches in the league, and Pat Riley is still a mastermind.  He orchestrated getting LeBron and Bosh, nabbed Ray Allen, traded for Dragic, turned Whiteside into a max guy, swindled Justice Winslow in the draft, and found diamond in the rough Tyler Johnson.

As their 13 game win streak proves, never underestimate a winning culture to get the most out of players.  As for getting the most out of their fans? Well... if ever there's a fire at American Airlines Arena while they're down 10, there's no need to worry, because they've all already left.  Safety first!

16) **Memphis Grizzlies**

The Memphis Grizzlies are a solid organization.  Marc Gasol is an excellent basketball player -- and quite loyal!  Ditto Mike Conley.  Zach Randolph has been a key piece for years.  Vince Carter keeps defying father time.  The Grit and Grind Grizzlies have been a post-season fixture for awhile now, giving the 2015 champs a run for their money.

They've done well for a small market team, and I don't really have anything bad to say about them.  They gambled on Chandler Parsons and lost, which sucks, but a franchise in Tennessee has to take chances since they won't lure big ticket Free Agents.

I should say at least one bad thing about them.  I guess that Memphis Grizzlies fan was a giant [douchebag](http://www.totalprosports.com/2017/03/13/grizzlies-fan-trolls-chandler-parsons-right-to-his-face-say-i-ruined-the-grizz-season-baby-video/) to Parsons.  That guy looks like he lives in a frat house, takes intramural sports too seriously, and causes girls keep their hands over their drink cups at parties.

15) **Washington Wizards**

The Washington Wizards are on an absolute tear right now.  They're #3 in the East. Their starting five of John Wall, Otto Porter Jr., Bradley Beal, Markieff Morris, and Marcin Gortat is fantastic.  Things are finally looking up!

Except their bench may have, some certain, minor, you know, peripheral flaws, that in the wrong light, may, you know, sort of, ^kind ^of, ^be ^^interpreted ^^as, ^^^uh, [^^^^slightly ^^^^flammable.](http://i.imgur.com/2fdXFcW.png)  But I want to stay positive, so I'd say their secondary unit has a certain bucolic, roasting-marshmellows-by-the-fire quality, which I would in no way describe as a flaming dumpster of a bench.

The Wizards also have the distinction of leading the NBA in arrests since 2000 (honorable mention to the Jailblazers, who ranked second).  By that metric, the franchise has featured about as many guards as it has criminals. Who needs the Princeton Offense when you have the Stanford Prison Experiment!

14) **Indiana Pacers**

Paul George is having a down year, and probably heading to Lakerland after next season.  Meanwhile, Monta Ellis has fallen off a cliff, and is locked in for 3 seasons. Ditto Al Jefferson, who is a minus -- both at 10 million a pop.

They still have Myles Turner on a rookie scale contract, and he seems quite good, but I'm not sure what Indiana's plan is.  They treated Roy Hibbert badly.  Bird also fired head coach Frank Vogel despite his successful tenure there.  Not a good look for the franchise.

Hell, David West set **fire** to 11 million dollars to get away from the Pacers.  Then he got eliminated by the **Thunder**, only to join a team on the **water** in the Bay Area.  He's either chasing a ring or filling out a Pokédex. 

13) **Charlotte Hornets**

Charlotte created a lot of buzz last season, with an epic playoff battle against the Heat, featuring a classic battle between Dwayne Wade and his Pokémon [Rival](http://i.imgur.com/6nQmjCe.png).

While they've regressed this season, they still have a great coach, their front office has been noticeably better the past few years, and Kemba Walker is a monster on wheels.

It seems they'll have to wait until next season to have another go at it, as FiveThirtyEight only gives them a [2% chance](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2017-nba-predictions/?ex_cid=rrpromo) of making the playoffs.

12) **Minnesota Timberwolves**

CAT (Caterpillar Inc.) stock may be down due to a federal raid, but KAT (Karl-Anthony Towns) stock is up. Way up.  Sell your condo on Waiters Island and buy some KAT equipment while you can, this kid is going to be a freakin' superstar.  The T-Wolves are finally turning it around.

Rubio is on fire as a distributor (how stupid would that Derrick Rose trade have been?), and Wiggins is a legit scorer.  It appears Thibodeau may indeed be the right man for the job.  They're all on cheapo contracts and locked up for next season, too.

The only danger is Thibs running the team into the ground like he did in Chicago.  When it comes to his own players' knees, it's like he's on an Inigo Montoya [revenge spree](http://i.imgur.com/g7PElFn.png).

11) **Detroit Pistons**

Detroit is fighting for the 8th and final playoff spot in the East.  My general policy is the more Van Gundy's in the NBA, the better.  The Pistons have some nice pieces, but can't seem to get over the hump.  They played great against the Cavs in the playoffs last year, so I'm surprised they haven't improved.

I'd say just tank and wait it out until LeBron James retires in 2024, but that's the same year LeBron Jr. is coming into the league. Piston's LeBron-induced PTSD should see us well into 2045, when Detroit fans will finally emerge from their underground caverns petting their 2004 replica rings whispering *my precious*.

The Eye of LeBron is ever watchful.



10) **Philadelphia 76ers**

Trust the Process. I'm a huge Sam Hinkie fan.  The man gave 76ers fans hope, and a future.  Embiid is a superstar if he can stay healthy.  Saric is going to win ROTY.  Ben Simmons is a #1 pick.  They're flush with assets, cap space, and could even land the #1 and #4 picks [this](http://i.imgur.com/DzYHO4d.png) draft.  

What could possibly go wrong?

BRYAN: ""Once we trade away Okafor and keep Noel -- or was it keep Okafor and trade Noel? Gosh, it's so hard to remember who's who!  One is a centerpiece in the mold of Tyson Chandler, and the other is a defensive sieve who gives zero effort and can't play in a modern offense?  I just can't seem to remember, dad!""

JERRY: ""I'm busy pushing the guy who acquired all these assets in astute trades and long-term planning, you handle it, son!""

JERRY (sly wink): ""Don't worry, son. I have a feeling you're going to be #1 this year."" 

BRYAN: ""Like Andrea Bargnani!""

JERRY: ""Uh... maybe don't bring that up.""

9) **Denver Nuggets**

They have the Joker, a 21 year old phenom and franchise centerpiece.  'Nuff said.

8) **LA Lakers**

The Lakers lack what Minnesota, Denver, New York, and New Orleans have -- an All-Star caliber player to build around.  [Tank Commander Byron Scott](http://i.imgur.com/0Z37ale.jpg) is gone, but his mission lives on.  Los Angeles has a 55.8% chance of keeping their pick if it falls in the 1-3 range, and they've shut down all their veterans except for Nick Young (to avoid looking too shameless).  Instead, they'll just play Iggy Azalea music every time he goes to shoot.

Don't want Swaggy P accidentally making one!

7) **Orlando Magic**

They say every time the Orlando Magic draft a Center, a 30 for 30 *'What If'* documentary gets its wings.

Orlando seems like it's in a pretty bad place.  Their Ibaka trade was a bust, they have the third worst record in the NBA, and they are the only team in the NBA without a single player over 1.0 RPM. How is that even possible?  How do you not have a single player worth 1 extra point per 100 possessions over the average NBA player?

It's hard to have any confidence in a team paying Jeff Green and Bismack Biyombo a combined $32,000,000 a year.

Hopefully they can get a great pick in this deep draft and turn things around.  The Magic's 2017 Team Photo doesn't exactly [inspire](http://i.imgur.com/eipugIu.jpg?fb) confidence.

6) **New Orleans Pelicans**

New Orleans is the world capital of Voodoo, yet for some reason it was the Houston Rockets that reanimated the corpses of Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon.  Ouch.

You know what Anthony Davis could really use?  Some three-point shooters spacing the floor to open up the offense.  Pelicans fans will defend letting them go due to the fact they were oft injured, but nevertheless, those guys sure look good in the Lone Star State right now.

Instead, they made a splash and traded for Demarcus Cousins for cheap, a move which I like and they very much had to make.  It has worked out horribly thus far, but we'll see if they can figure it out next season.  There's definitely some inherent risk, given their 1st round pick could be quite valuable this year and Boogie might walk in 2018.

To keep him, they'll need to re-sign Jrue Holiday, the only other good player on the team, but given that they're already at $89,000,000 without him for the 2017-2018 season, will they have any money left over to sign FAs?

That contract they gave Omer Asik was fucking terrible, and will hurt their ability to put a team around their two All-Star bigs.

5) **Phoenix Suns**

The Suns' three best players are Devin Booker (age 20), Eric Bledsoe (age 27), and Tyson Chandler (age 34).  That's some perfectly normal spacing between births -- if you're a Vulcan mother going through [Pon farr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pon_farr) every 7 years.  It's fucking terrible if you're an NBA franchise.

For comparison, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green are all between the ages of 26 and 28.

I don't know what the hell the Phoenix Suns are doing, but signing Brandon Knight to a 5-year, 70 million dollar contract through 2020 doesn't seem like the answer.  They have some serious issues to address, both in terms of shot creation and nacho bowl creation, at least according to [Charles Barkley](https://youtu.be/uTOzKTxckd0).

4) **Chicago Bulls**

The Fire GarPax [movement](http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/chicagoinc/ct-garpax-protest-chicago-inc-spt-0303-20170302-story.html) is in full swing in the windy city.  The pair reportedly [lowballed](http://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/244760/Bulls-Threatened-To-Cut-Jimmy-Butlers-Minutes-If-He-Didnt-Sign-Extension-In-2014) budding superstar Jimmy Butler and told him ""if you don't sign this extension, we're going to play Tony Snell over you. We are going to give you his minutes and that's going to drop your numbers"" in order to depress his market value as an RFA, in true piece of shit fashion.

Butler also warned new players about Randy Brown being a front office rat reporting on players, something Rip Hamilton [confirmed](http://www.thescore.com/nba/news/1223297-rip-hamilton-coaches-warned-me-about-bulls-front-office-snitch) in February.  They also unceremoniously pushed former coach Tom Thibodeau out the door.

The franchise is a complete disaster at the moment, the team is dysfunctional, and the players have zero trust in the Bulls' Tony Soprano-wannabe front office.

But hey, they've shaken up things a bit, and GarPax has hired a [new assistant coach](http://i.imgur.com/Lay7rBq.jpg) to regain the player's confidence, so things are looking up!




3) **Brooklyn Nets**

The Nets don't have their own first round pick until 2019.

Billy King traded away 7 first round picks in 3 years in exchange for 1 second-round playoff berth.

Everything about this franchise makes me sad.  I feel like Horatio on the castle platform at the beginning of *Hamlet*, watching the dispirited corpse of Nets fans, their flair faded, crying out for justice against the King who slew them and forfeited their picks.

It's fitting the Brooklyn Nets official color is black.  Even Hamlet's mother loved Brook Lopez so much she wished him to another team, saying ""Good [HamLopez], cast thy nighted colour off.""  To which the ever-loyal Brook replied:

HAMLOPEZ

*'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,*


*Nor customary suits of solemn black,*

[...]


*But I have that within which passeth show;*


*These but the trappings and the suits of woe.*


2) **Sacramento Kings**

The only thing that keeps this franchise out of the #1 spot is that Vivek Ranadivé helped keep the team in Sacramento, and that there doesn't seem to be the same level of evil fucking assholes and front office snitches that permeate the Bulls and the Knicks.

It seems to just be sheer levels of staggering incompetence.  The Kings are like *The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo*... if the movie ended after he unchains her from the bed 30 minutes in.  No wonder Adam Silver intervened and sent Sam Hinkie packing.  What he did to Sacramento via trade was pretty unforgivable.

On top from the revolving door of coaches and political infighting, they let Isaiah Thomas and Seth Curry go for nothing, sent Boogie packing for peanuts, whiffed on almost every draft pick, got repeatedly trade-raped, and according to Zach Lowe, were reportedly **unaware of the stretch provision**.

How is that even fucking possible?  I've never been within 500 feet of an NBA front office (or Angelina Jolie, for that matter, thanks to a very unfair restraining order), and even I know about the stretch provision.  And that judge completely misunderstood the fan fiction I sent her.  I was biting Angelina's neck to Sire her, not injure her, so we could be together forever as Vampires.  It was completely innocent.

What were we talking about again?

#Braindead Tier

1) **New York Knicks**

Fitting that we begin and end with Peter Jackson-directed films, as intelligence and success, like [George and Elaine](https://youtu.be/1AjxoQA7EcE?t=30s), shift between the two P. Jacksons the longer Phil remains championship abstinent with the Knicks.  Constantly harping about how the triangle would help NYK win without the right personnel doesn't make sense.  The only triangular-shaped object that would make the Knicks champs is a flux capacitor inside a DeLorean traveling back to 1973.

The centerpiece of this shitcicle, of course, is Knicks owner and Sackville-Baggins hobbit James Dolan.  Petty and vindictive, he is constantly banning people from MSG, because that's what insecure trust fund babies do.  From Woody Allen to Charles Oakley, no one is safe from this poster child for nepotism.  Deeply mistrustful, he has spies everywhere in the organization, and has played a key role in the ~~Scouring of the Shire~~ Knicks' playoff drought.

Their treatment of former players is embarrassing, their conduct shameful, and their basketball decisions (outside of drafting Porzingod) have been just as bad.  This is the worst franchise in the NBA, something I didn't think possible with Sacramento existing, but here we are.  Their PR machine tweeting ""hope he gets some help soon"" put them over the top for me.

It takes some seriously braindead and malicious front office behavior to top the Kings and the Nets, so congrats to the New York Knicks.  You truly are a dumpster fire of a franchise.

#EDIT:

&gt;What he's trying to say is that the disclaimer that it's only ""slightly more towards the present"" is inaccurate and that it's heavily more weighted towards the present.

Err, yes, I misspoke. I meant weighted more towards the present while looking **only** at the last few years.  I should have clarified.

Otherwise the Heat would be in the Top 5 looking ten years back, the Lakers would be Top 3 going back forever (at the very least), and Golden State would be in the Bottom 3.

&gt;There are people in this thread getting angry for the inaccuracy of their team's description/ranking made by a dude who described Spurs as a franchise with 547 consecutive 50-win seasons, dating back to their time in the Mesoamerican League where they dominated the Mayan hoop ball game. Stop what you are doing for a moment and just think about this.

Yes, I should have expanded my opening paragraph to better explain this isn't meant to be accurate, and was purely for entertainment purposes.

I don't know your personal team's entire transaction history better than you, and I apologize if I upset you.  There are a lot of Heat fans who are pretty incensed about my Miami section and think I hate them (I don't.)   ",nba,1250

Today, though, I have a story about a dead MIL. The mother of the woman who married my uncle passed away on Friday. She was a devout Mormon (relevant, I promise). Apparently, getting ready for her death, she left each and every person in her family a note/letter saying goodbye. At the Memorial Service the day before the burial, family members were invited to go up and share a memory about the woman and what her last words to them were. Most people's note said the same thing ""I love you. I pray our Heavenly Father guides you to live righteously. I will be celebrating with your grandfather/father/uncle"" - that sort of sentiment. Close to the end, the youngest son's wife (known as DIL from here on out) takes the microphone and proceeds to tell everyone her memory of her MIL: 

&gt;DIL: Most of you don't know but MIL and I shared a name for the first few years of my marriage. She changed it to Angela, but her real name was, and my real name is Maria de los Angeles. MIL told me, before she changed it, that she didn't want to share a name with the woman who also stole her birthday, because my birthday is also on the same month and day as hers. I, of course, told her I fully supported her decision to do whatever she wanted but I was happy with my name and it would be staying and I couldn't do much about the whole sharing-a-birthday thing. She turned to me and she said 'Well, you can let me have the day of celebration, as the matriarch of the family'. So for 24 years, I let her have the day. My husband and children never celebrated my birthday on the day of because MIL wanted it to only be her day, and I said 'Fine, if that makes her happy.' And now, looking back at all the sacrifices I made to stay in her good graces, to have her love me as much as she loved her other DILs, I see that love culminate into this little note she left me.

She held up a balled up piece of paper. Seriously, that thing was crushed into her fist. 

&gt;DIL: I always felt she wasn't particularly keen on me because I married her favorite son. And now that she is gone, her note to me said, ""I could live with you taking my name. I could live with you taking my birthday. I could not live with you taking my son. But you did. You were so selfish you took my baby boy from me, too.""

Guys, the room was silent. There were so many children there (Mormons, afterall), but after DIL said that, you could hear a pin drop. It got so awkward, and I had to try so hard not laugh (as that's what I do when I don't know what to do). 

Then, staring into the casket at the dead old hag dressed in her temple garments, DIL saccharine sweet drops the best line:

&gt;DIL: MIL, I'm only saddened that you can't hear me. I have taken the man that I love for time and eternity. 

No one else was allowed on, until MIL's oldest son got a run through of what was going to be said. ",JUSTNOMIL,1475

**What's new this year?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Last year, MLS announced that teams would be receiving ""targeted allocation money (or TAM)."" In a nutshell, teams would be receiving $800,000 annually to spend on players who made more than the league maximum salary ($480,625). The money could be used to buy down the impact a player's salary had against the cap, open up Designated Player spots by buying down a player's salary, or traded as a form of currency.

In practice, TAM has two major impacts. First, it keeps successful players in the league. In the past, star players would have to go abroad if they wanted a fair wage for their talent. Now, teams can compensate their talent with a more competitive salary through TAM and keep them in the league.

Second, it helps improve overall squad quality. With the Designated Player Rule, teams were able to sign star players like a David Beckham, Kaka, or David Villa who was instantly the best player on the team. With TAM, teams are now able to fill out the middle of the squad with successful international players who may otherwise not be worth a Designated Player contract. For example, my team used TAM to sign Bosnian international Haris Medunjanin this off-season. He does not have the star quality to be a top 2 player on the squad and to warrant a DP investment, but he should be a top 5 player on the team. TAM allows a team to improve the middle of the squad, raising the overall quality of the team more than a single DP player could.

This year, MLS has increased annual TAM to $1.2 million. This allows more signings and an overall increase of the quality of MLS squads while allowing teams to hold onto their best players. The inevitable goal is to finally be able to compete with Liga MX teams in the CONCACAF Champions League and to raise the quality of MLS league wide.

Additionally, MLS has introduced new inititatives to help develop Canadian players. Canadians who were in youth academies prior to the age of 16 will now count as domestic players who will no longer require international spots for US teams. As well, MLS will pursue signing young Canadian players to Generation Adidas contracts prior to the draft, exempting their salary from the salary cap. Finally, MLS has set aside funds to help MLS teams sign Canadians abroad such as Atiba Hutchinson.

Otherwise, the other major off-season initiative has to been to reward youth development. Last year, MLS announced an additional $125,000 in for Homegrown Players Funds for teams over the next two years. This year, MLS teams will be provided with two extra roster spots reserved solely for homegrown players, bringing the roster up from 28 spots to 30. This will provide extra value to teams such as FC Dallas who have prioritized building their roster through academy youth.

**The Future**
-------------------

Expansion is the major focus in the near future. [Minnesota United](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e8/Minnesota_United_FC_\(MLS\)_Primary_logo.svg/1200px-Minnesota_United_FC_\(MLS\)_Primary_logo.svg.png) and [Atlanta United](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bb/Atlanta_MLS.svg/1024px-Atlanta_MLS.svg.png) join the league this year while [Los Angeles FC](https://lafc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LAFC_logo.png) joins next year. David Beckham's Miami project is in doubt as he has hit roadblock after roadblock from the city.

Currently, MLS has announced four expansion spots are open, but don't be surprised to see the number increase to five if Beckham's Miami project finally falls through. This has been the strongest round of expansion bids with several robust markets and ownerships competing for the spots. The 12 bids are:

* Charlotte, North Carolina: The Queen City is the largest city in North Carolina, and the city's location allows the team to brand itself as the team for both of the Carolinas. It fills a major geographic gap in the American South, establishes a top level team in a traditionally major American sports market, and sets up a rivalry with Atlanta.

* Cincinnati, Ohio: In FC Cincinnati's first season last year, the team surprised everyone by averaging an attendance of over 17,000. The immediate success rocketed them into expansion discussion as one of the favorites. Cincy would make natural rivals with Columbus who shares the same state.

* Detroit, Michigan: The past few decades have not been kind to Motown with the city making headlines for corruption, crime, and economic crisis. However, the city has remained a major sports market and a staple on the professional sports scene. A strong ownership ground, a rich soccer scene, and its major market status are the crutch of the expansion bid, but a questionable stadium plan could leave the bid dead in the water.

* Indianapolis, Indiana: A few years ago, Indy Eleven began play to a large fanfare but early growing pains hurt their attendance. A strong owner, natural potential rivalries, an established fan base, and a recognizable brand solidifies their expansion bid.

* Nashville, Tennessee: Seen as a long shot, Nashville has a few factors working in its favor. The prospective owner is a billionaire with the money to throw around to help the team hit the ground running while the city, itself, fills a geographic hole in the American South, has a growing millennial population, and is a fast growing metro area.

* Phoenix, Arizona: Based around the fantastically named Phoenix Rising FC, the bid benefits from Phoenix's status as the largest market currently bidding for a team. An eclectic but influential ownership group, large Latino population, and history of youth soccer help the bid. Additionally, Phoenix would fill a wide open hole in the Southwest. However, the failure of lower league teams in the past and logistical difficulties of playing a summer league in the desert may hurt Phoenix's chances though there was been talk of a climate controlled stadium.

* Raleigh/Durham, North Carolina: The other North Carolina bid looks to distinguish itself from Charlotte. While the latter could bill itself as the team of the Carolinas, Raleigh would focus on the Research Triangle. In its favor are a rapidly growing market with a larger millennial population, and an owner who has quickly developed clout in American soccer.

* Sacramento, California: Sacramento Republic is as close to a sure thing as any of these teams based on their lower league support. Owner in-fighting seemed to derail the bid, but the owners seemed to have settled their differences. Sacramento should attain one of the four spots.

* San Antonio, Texas: Though one of the smallest markets bidding for a team, San Antonio has a few advantages working in its favor. The only sports competitor in the city (the Spurs) owns them, ensuring the two teams will work hand-in-hand to promote and support each other. Additionally, the owners are among the most respected in American sports, building a very strong team in San Antonio. Perhaps the dark horse bid in this round of expansion, San Antonio will hope to make some waves moving forward.

* San Diego, California: The relocation of their NFL team to Los Angeles opened up the door to San Diego. Very little major sports competition and an attractive city to foreign talent should help their bid, but Sacramento's near certainty should hurt their bid.

* St. Louis, Missouri: A historical hotbed for soccer in America, the lack of a strong ownership group has been the main factor that has kept St. Louis from joining the league sooner. Another NFL relocation to LA may finally be the opening the city needs, but the bid will come down to whether the ownership group can nail down their stadium plan.

* Tampa/St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa's success likely hinges on Beckham's Miami bid. Should Beckham finally make some progress, a third Florida bid would be a much harder sell. However, Tampa could make a case for being a better option than Miami. The former is a larger market and the largest market in the expansion bid, has a very ambitious if eccentric owner with large clout in the city, and has lower league success. The bid has only gotten stronger over time, and they should make a strong run for one of the four spots.

------------------------------------------------------------------


F.A.Q.
--------

(I can update this with new questions.)
*Why is there no relegation/promotion?*

* Unfortunately, it is not economically feasible at present. The fear is that if a team gets relegated, fans will stop coming to matches, and the owner will fold the team. The average American sports fan is used to supporting the best teams in the world at their sport (NFL, MLB, NBA, etc.). We aren't at a point yet in popularity or financial stability where the risk of promotion/relegation is worth taking. I do hope to see it within a few decades.

*Why does MLS run spring to fall?*

* It's the same reason that Scandinavia runs spring to fall. The northern part of our country gets bombarded with snow in the winter unlike most of Europe. Even in March, a handful of MLS cities are still covered in snow. Plus, we don't want to compete against the NFL, NBA, and NHL.

*Isn't MLS a retirement league?*

* Not at all. The league has generally been moving more towards signing players under 30 like Giovinco, Nicolas Lodeiro, Miguel Almiron, and Romain Alessandrini.


*Why is the Supporter's Shield less prestigious than the MLS Cup?*

* In part, America values playoffs far more than the regular season. Also, the unbalanced schedule makes it an unfair comparison between teams. Where's the fairness in playing the Union three times compared to playing LA three times? The East is typically worse than the West, meaning Eastern teams have a better shot at winning the Shield.

*Who is an attacking team in MLS?*

* Your best bet would be Dallas who has put together a fun, swashbuckling side. Otherwise, Giovinco and Toronto are a clear choice.",soccer,1274

JaguarGator9,2017-02-26 18:12:29+00:00,"[OC] In 5 years, Super Bowl LVI is scheduled to be played on the same day as the 2022 Winter Olympics. How will the NFL address this problem?","I know what you’re thinking. We’re just 3 weeks removed from Super Bowl LI, and you’re already looking ahead five years to Super Bowl LVI? However, the NFL has a very interesting dilemma with this Super Bowl. For years, the Super Bowl has been the marquee event of that particular date. There will be programming before the game from other channels, such as college basketball games and celebrity bowling tournaments, but even that pales in comparison to what the pregame shows get.

Once the game starts, everything is about the Super Bowl. Other networks will just concede to the network broadcasting the Super Bowl. No other professional sporting events take place at the same time as the Super Bowl, and from the research I did, the only other sporting event taking place in the USA directly in competition with the Super Bowl was a women’s basketball game on ESPNU that started at 6:30 between Memphis and South Florida (I feel bad for everyone that had to play in that game). There are 2 options for people during the Super Bowl- you either turn on the TV and watch the game, or you don’t. There’s no other alternative. Nothing else is on TV during the Super Bowl, and for years, the NFL has been able to capitalize on this in the first Sunday of February.

Super Bowl LVI, on the other hand? That’s where things get a bit tricky. It’s one thing to go up against re-runs and [the Fish Bowl between the Los Angeles Clams and the Buffalo Gills]( http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/wild/fish-bowl/). It’s another thing to go up against the Winter Olympics.

**The Problem**

Assuming that TV contracts hold up, CBS will be broadcasting Super Bowl LVI (3-year rotation between CBS, NBC, and FOX). NBC has the rights to broadcast the Winter Olympics. Normally, this is not a problem- the Winter Olympics have never interfered with the Super Bowl. For the past four installments of the Winter Olympics dating back to 2002 in Salt Lake City, the Winter Olympics have been held five days after the Super Bowl, so you get no football hangover whatsoever (side note- those years with the Winter Olympics and World Cup are the best years for sports; the years with the European Championships and Summer Olympics are second best, and then any odd numbered years are not fun for the offseason).

Year | Super Bowl | Date of Super Bowl | Site of Olympics | Date of Opening Ceremony
---- | ----- | ------ | ------ | --------
2002 | Super Bowl XXXVI | 2/3/02 | Salt Lake City, USA | 2/8/02
2006 | Super Bowl XL | 2/5/06 | Torino, Italy | 2/10/06
2010 | Super Bowl XLIV | 2/7/10 | Vancouver, Canada | 2/12/10
2014 | Super Bowl XLVIII | 2/2/14 | Sochi, Russia | 2/7/14

It’s going to be the same thing next year. NBC right now is loving life, because they are broadcasting Super Bowl LII, and then five days later, get to broadcast the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. They’ve got the ultimate dream right now.

However, it’s not going to be like that in 2022. Why they awarded the Games to Beijing in the first place, I’m not entirely sure, seeing as they hosted the Summer Olympics, and have no mountains anywhere near the city center. They’re going to use [fake snow](http://www.bbc.com/sport/winter-sports/33747313) down the mountains (and no, that’s not fake news… they’re actually planning on using fake snow), and this will be the third straight Olympics in Asia (2018 in South Korea, 2020 in Tokyo, 2022 in Beijing).

In terms of football, though, the 2022 Winter Olympics poses a major problem. The Opening Ceremony for these Olympics are taking place on February 4, 2022. If the Super Bowl is still held on the first Sunday in February, then Super Bowl LVI will occur on February 6. For the first time ever, if the schedule holds up, the Winter Olympics and Super Bowl will come into conflict with each other.

There are two events that non-sports fans watch. One of them is the Super Bowl. They watch for the halftime show, they watch for the parties, and they watch for the commercials. It’s a fun atmosphere for all involved, even if you’re not a football fan. The other one, unfortunately for the NFL, is the Olympics, whether it’s the Winter Olympics or the Summer Olympics. They watch because it’s the only time you can see particular sports on TV at the highest level, they watch for that sense of American pride, and they watch because it’s an event that happens just once every four years. Here’s what the NFL would be competing against on that Sunday, assuming the 2018 schedule holds of what is taking place that Sunday:

- Alpine skiing (including a gold medal event)

- Biathlon (including a gold medal event)

- Cross country skiing (including a gold medal event)

- Curling

- Figure skating

- Freestyle skiing (including a gold medal event)

- Ice hockey

- Luge

- Snowboarding (including a gold medal event)

- Speed skating (including a gold medal event)

They’d be competing against not just one event, but a variety of them, including the juggernaut that is figure skating (the vast majority of the non-sports fans I know will be glued to the television during figure skating events), and a bunch of gold medal events in the process. That’s a lot different than competing against the Fish Bowl and some World’s Strongest Man re-runs, especially if you get a USA/Russia or USA/Canada hockey game scheduled at the same time as the Super Bowl. According to recent data, the 2014 Winter Olympics were watched in primetime by an average of [21.7 million people per night](http://www.newsday.com/sports/olympics/nbc-releases-sochi-winter-olympics-ratings-data-1.7204742), and [78% of US TV homes tuned into at least some part of the Winter Olympics](http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/network-press-releases/76-of-u-s-tv-homes-tuned-in-to-sochi-games-coverage-on-networks-of-nbcuniversal/).

Would the NFL still win the night if they competed directly against the Olympics? Absolutely. I don’t think anyone, even NBC, would think otherwise. Having said that, would their ratings take an absolute nosedive if they went head-to-head against the Olympics? You bet. There’s a high chance that the ratings dip below 100 million if the NFL actually went up against NBC during these Olympics.

Whether or not the NFL is aware of this problem or is thinking actively about this problem remains to be seen. But the league has three options to address it.

**Solution #1: Change Nothing**

There’s the first option, which is to change absolutely nothing. Play the game on the first Sunday of February at 6:30, and then when NBC comes on with their Olympic coverage, be in direct competition. However, there are a few massive problems with this option.

Number one, if the game becomes a blowout or unwatchable, or football fans tune out for the halftime show, they could switch over to NBC and just never change the game back. If you get a Super Bowl XLVIII-esque situation on your hands, by the end of the night, NBC might actually have comparable ratings with the Super Bowl. Remember what happened at Super Bowl XXVI during the halftime show, [which I wrote about here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/5qbeum/oc_on_this_day_25_years_ago_a_bold_decision_by/?ref=search_posts). In short, FOX decided to counter-program against the halftime show, actually drew a quarter of CBS’ audience away from the game and to FOX, and a large portion of the audience never flipped the game back to CBS because the game was so bad. Remember that Super Bowl XXVI was broadcast by CBS. They are well aware of their history, and they’d be broadcasting Super Bowl LVI thirty years later. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, on the other hand…

Number two, the amount that CBS would be able to charge for advertisements would plummet compared to previous years. Maybe instead of being able to charge $5 million (as is the standard price now), they’ll only be able to charge $3 million. How much a network can charge for ads depends on how many people are watching the game; there’s a reason why an advertisement during a regular season NFL game at 1:00 between the Browns and the Jaguars costs significantly less than a Super Bowl ad. If the NFL decides this option, CBS throws a fit. No way does CBS want to be competing directly against the Olympics, considering their own history and the advertising dollars at stake.

Yes, the NFL is stubborn. Yes, people now associate the Super Bowl with the first Sunday in February at 6:30. But there are so many ways that this could backfire that I doubt the league actually plays the game that Sunday at 6:30.

**Solution #2: Start the Game Earlier**

Of course, they could keep it on the same date as before, but just start the game earlier. If the NFL wants to be bold and place a Super Bowl in London, this is the year to do it. Start the game at 3:00 Eastern (which would be primetime in London), and have your earliest kickoff since Super Bowl X back in 1976, when the game started at 2:14 PM Eastern (for the record, the earliest ever Super Bowl kickoff was Super Bowl V in 1971, starting at 2:00). All data for that comes courtesy of [this chart](http://gawker.com/what-time-is-the-super-bowl-in-one-amazing-chart-1513231876). You keep the game on the first Sunday of February, but just start it at 3:00. Game ends by 7:00, postgame is over at 7:30, and it’s a perfect transition into NBC’s Olympic coverage.

This option isn’t perfect, though. For one, the pregame shows take a hit in terms of ratings. And while this option seems good on the East Coast, it’s an absolute pain on the West Coast. Does the league really want to have the Super Bowl start at noon on the West Coast, when people are just waking up two hours before kickoff? That contributes to the pregame shows taking a ratings hit. Also, CBS might still not be happy about this, because nobody would watch their lead-out show. They’d flip off the lead-out show immediately to go to NBC and the Olympics. While you wouldn’t have to deal with live Olympic events (it’d be 3:00 in the morning in Beijing), and while you would still be able to keep the game on the first Sunday in February, it still poses some problems for all parties involved. If you’re on the East Coast, though, this plan seems like heaven. 

**Solution #3: Move the Date**

And then, there’s the option to just move the game to a different date, like the final Sunday in January like it used to be prior to Super Bowl XXXVIII (Super Bowl XXXVI was supposed to be the final Sunday in January, but because of the attacks on September 11 forcing the league to postpone week 2, the Super Bowl got moved). The league has done this before with moving the season due to other circumstances. In the 1999 season, the NFL [moved the season back a week so that nobody would have to play on January 1, 2000, due to the Y2K concerns](http://a.espncdn.com/nfl/s/1999/0327/30700.html). From Wikipedia:

&gt; The start of the 1999 NFL season was pushed back one week and started the weekend after Labor Day, a change from the previous seasons. Due to the Y2K concerns, the NFL did not want to hold the opening round of the playoffs on Saturday, January 1, 2000, and did not want teams traveling on that day. Week 17 games were held on January 2, 2000, and the opening round of the playoffs would be scheduled for January 8-9.

The NFL needs the double bye before the Super Bowl because of the Pro Bowl (and because of the juggernaut that the game has become), so this means that the season would be pushed up a week, starting Labor Day weekend. Even though the game is on the final Sunday of January, this seems to benefit all parties involved from the NFL’s perspective… right?

Not necessarily. Because even though CBS isn’t angry, college football is to a certain extent. The NCAA has played week 1 of their season on Labor Day weekend, including games that Sunday and Monday that are usually marquee games. This year, the Notre Dame/Texas game that took place that Sunday night was one of the highest rated games of the season. Now, they wouldn’t be able to play that game because they can’t go directly against the NFL. Those Sunday and Monday night games that they had week 1 couldn’t be played. Of course, college football could, in turn, push their season back one weekend, but considering the fact that some schools aren’t even in session yet, attendance would take a dramatic hit in week one.

**Conclusion**

Because of the circumstances with the Olympics and the NFL, someone’s going to get ticked off no matter what the NFL proposes. There’s nothing the league can do about it. The question is what the league wants to do and what battle they want to fight. Do they want to fight a battle against both NBC and CBS, do they want to fight a battle against CBS, or do they want to fight a battle against the NCAA? Either way, the NFL is going to be in competition with some organization.

It may be five years away, but considering the fact that no stadium has been awarded the rights to Super Bowl LVI yet and no date has been determined for the game, the league has time to determine an appropriate solution. We’ll see which route they decide to go. 

**What Would You Do?**

[I decided to add a straw-poll](http://www.strawpoll.me/12423627) to see what /r/NFL would do in this situation. Choose from 1 of the 3 options I mentioned above- keep the game as scheduled, move it to an earlier start time, or move the date.",nfl,3186
jaynay1,2017-02-26 05:46:58+00:00,THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS HAVE CLINCHED A PLAYOFF BERTH,"With their win over the Nets, the Warriors have 49 wins and cannot finish with a worse record than 49-33.  This guarantees that they will finish ahead of at least 6 teams right off the bat, who have 34 or more losses:  Sacramento, Minnesota, New Orleans, Dallas, Los Angeles (Lakers), and Phoenix.  Finishing ahead of 7 teams clinches a playoff berth.

So then the next 2 teams in the loss column of the standings are the Trail Blazers (33 losses) and Nuggets (32 losses), who have 1 game remaining between them, meaning that depending on the result of that game, in the absolute worst case Warriors scenario either A, the Nuggets win, the Trail Blazers get their 34th loss, and thus 7 teams have a worse record than the worst possible Warriors record and they clinch, or B, the Trail Blazers win, and a multi-way tie at 33 losses is possible.

So that tie can't be less than a 3 way tie (Since all 3 of the Trail Blazers, Nuggets, and Warriors have to be involved), and that's where we'll start.

In the event of a 3 way tie, the first tiebreaker is record within the tied teams.  For these 3 teams, it would be as follows:

1. Golden State, 6-1.
2. Portland, 3-5.
3. Denver, 2-5.

So in the event of a 3 way tie, Golden State is fine.

4+ ties are a little trickier to produce, so first we'll eliminate the possibility of certain teams being involved; There are 9 possibilities, 6 who might not be in the tie for a multi-way tie.

We know OKC won't be involved because they are at best 1-3 against the Warriors, at worst 1-3 against the Trail Blazers, and at worst 2-2 against the Nuggets.

We know the Clippers won't be involved because they are at best 0-4 against the Warriors, and at worst 3-0 against the Trail Blazers and 1-3 against the Nuggets.

The Spurs, Rockets, Grizzlies, and Jazz are all possibilities.  So that's 15 combinations to be tested, all of which, I believe, leave the Warriors (2^4 minus the possibility that includes none of those teams because we've already tested it) in the playoffs.

For these, I can work them out in a comment, but this post is already getting quite long as is so I'm going to terminate it.  But basically, congratulations to the Warriors on clinching in February for the 2nd straight year.",nba,1942

Night 1: last week, Tuesday 02/14/2017

It was Valentine’s Day and everything was great.  I woke up early to get ready for work and get my daughter ready and the dog walked.  I dropped off my daughter at daycare and went to work.  My boyfriend sent me flowers at my office and I went back to my daughter’s daycare for a Valentine’s Day party then finished my work and picked her up to take her home.

Now, every night I have a routine (she’s 3 and needs her routine).  I make dinner and eat it with my daughter, we watch a little TV, I give her a bath, brush her teeth, FaceTime her dad, read her two books, say prayers, and put her to sleep.  It’s simple, it’s easy, and we do the same thing every night.  After she’s asleep, I walk the dog in the grass across the street, clean my apartment, call my boyfriend, watch some TV, then get ready for bed and go to sleep.  I normally start getting her ready for bed around 8 and I go to sleep around 12 and wake up at 7:00am, and that’s our routine day in and day out.

This night, I did my entire routine and decided to take a smoke break outside (please don’t rag on me for smoking, I know it’s not healthy and sometimes I walk outside if it’s been a particularly stressful day).  I walked out front of our apartment building towards the street. My unit is the bottom corner unit that is closest to the street, so the walk is about 15 total feet.  When my daughter is sleeping, I close the door and have a camera in her room where I can watch her sleeping on my phone.  

So, I’m outside smoking and I hear this soft ‘woossshh’ sound.  It kind of sounded like a whisper, and it startled me because I was playing around on my phone when I heard it. I looked around at the street and there were only parked cars.  There was no one outside anywhere near me, so I chalked it up to me hearing things and continued smoking and messing with my phone.

About 30 seconds later, I hear a same ‘woossshh’ sound, but it sounds like an old woman whispering ‘it’s here’.  The only reason that I say it’s an old woman is because the voice sounded worn and deep, kind of cracking.  I am almost 95% sure that ‘she’ said ‘it’s here’, and that’s when I put out my cigarette and immediately went into the house.  I hardly thought about it that night and continued my routine until I finally went to bed.

Night 2: Thursday, 02/16/2017

On Thursday, we had our usual morning routine, and I took my daughter to her swim class before we went home.  She was tired after swimming and it was lights out early.  I was walking the dog by 8:00pm.  There is a school across the street with a huge green belt, so I walk him over there when my daughter is sleeping.  I always make sure I can watch the door while I’m walking him, and I watch my daughter on my phone to make sure she doesn’t wake up and freak out that no one is in the house.  Should something happen, I can be at my front door in about 10 seconds.  My dog just had a bowl movement, so I was picking it up and tying the bag when I stood up and heard the ‘woossshh’ sound again.  It sounded like it was directly behind me, so I was startled and spun around.  My dog started growling in the same direction that I turned to, so I knew that he heard it too.  Just like on Tuesday, a voice again said ‘it’s here’ about half a minute later.  This time, it sounded like a child whispering the words.  It scared me so much that I ran with the dog inside.  Now, I knew that he could hear it too…this made it hard for me to sleep.  I started thinking that it was just my paranoia from the first night, but then it happened again to me.

Night 3: Sunday, 02/19/2016	

This is more like ‘day’ 3, since this happened during the day.  My daughter’s father had her for the night, so my boyfriend came over with his daughter to spend time with me.  She’s 4 years old, almost exactly a year older than my daughter.  They are in the same daycare, so it’s convenient that they’re also best friends.  His daughter is learning to write letters, so sometimes he and I will say letters out loud and she will write them on a piece of paper.  We went through spelling things like ‘DADDY’ and ‘DOG’ and ‘HAPPY’ when she started just writing letters by herself.  We didn’t think anything of it. She would write letters in a string on paper then give it to us to read.  None of it made any sense, of course.  She would come to us with letters like ‘PEIKCNEH’ and we would sound it out like ‘pee-keh-neh’, then she would laugh and think it’s hilarious.  She did this about three times when she finally wrote a string and gave it to me to read.  The string she wrote was ‘JCNUENITSHEREKDNHCK” and I sounded it out to her, saying “jeh-ceh-new-it’s-here-keh-din-heh-sik’.  I stopped reading the letter string and looked at her.  She was busy doing something else and not looking at me.  I took the paper over to my boyfriend who saw the same thing.  I reminded him of the stories from the two nights last week and told him that his daughter wrote the letters ‘ITSHERE’ in sequence.  He laughed it off and thought I was being ridiculous.  It was probably mere coincidence that the letters all strung together to spell that.  I tried once again to chalk it up to my paranoia.  But last night was when I knew this all wasn’t just in my head.

Night 4: Tuesday, 02/21/2017

Last night I didn’t sleep.  I can’t think at work, and I am typing this in my office just trying to figure out what the heck is going on.  I put my daughter down and woke up to a ‘ding’ notification on my phone.  It was about midnight and the ‘ding’ was a Snapchat notification from my brother.  My brother is in his early 20’s, so him messaging me at this time wasn’t out of the ordinary.  I opened the Snap to see that he sent me a picture of him with his friend in some park.  It was dark outside and they had big smiles on their faces.  He added a caption to the photo that said only ‘its here’ in lowercase letters.  I couldn’t believe my eyes, so I replayed the snap (keep in mind shapchat will only let you see a direct message twice for a maximum of 10 seconds each time, so I only saw the picture for 20 total seconds).  I immediately replied to him using a chat function and said ‘what’s there???’.  He never replied.

Night 5, Wednesday 02/22/2017

I called my brother this morning in between meetings and he doesn’t remember sending me a Snapchat.  He did get my message that said ‘what’s there???’, but he said he wasn’t sure what I was referring to.  I need to find out what is here.  I’m starting to think that I need to find something and that someone or someTHING is in need of whatever the object is.  When I get home, I’ll ask my upstairs neighbors.  They’ve been living here for 15 years, so they are bound to know something. 

Today, Thursday 02/23/2017

Ok, guys I’m seriously FREAKED out right now.  I decided to take some pictures and upload them with links so that you can see what I’m going through.  I can’t work.  I don’t know what to think, my mind is consumed with a ton of thoughts, and I don’t really know where I should start.

I made an album on IMGUR that includes the location that I was standing in when I heard the first voice:[HERE](http://imgur.com/jQ3YiGI) and [HERE](http://imgur.com/bOYRQeq) ...I also took a picture of the school area where I walk my dog at night across the street and where I heard the second voice: [HERE](http://imgur.com/81k0Iuh) ...I kept the paper that my boyfriend’s daughter wrote on and included it so that you can see what I read as well [HERE](http://imgur.com/81k0Iuh) 

I guess I’ll start by saying that last night was relatively normal.  We finished our routine and I put my daughter to bed as always.  I texted my upstairs neighbor to see if she would come down to speak with me, and she came down the stairs around 9:30pm and sat with me on my stoop.  I told her everything that had been happening over the last week and a half and she actively listened and didn’t say much.  I was hoping that she could give me an answer.  I’ve seen enough horror movies and read a ton of Stephen King and Michael Crichton novels to really scare myself.  I had formulated this idea in my head that I would have to go on some sort of quest or help some ‘spirit’ or something.  I know it sounds ridiculous.  It looks ridiculous when I type it…

Alright, so after I finished my story, I asked my neighbor about the previous residents of this apartment.  She said that there was an older couple that lived there for a while before she moved in (mind you, she’s lived there for 15 years already).  I moved in almost exactly a year ago today.  I asked her why they decided to move out, and turns out that this couple had a grandson that had unfortunately passed away when he was about 3 or 4 years old due to some rare illness.  She couldn’t recall what the illness was, but she remembers that she spoke to the couple and they told her that they were moving to Denver to be with their daughter and help her through the loss of a child.  I felt incredibly devastated for this family that I haven’t even met.  I couldn’t fathom the loss of a child that was so near my own daughter’s age.  

But her story didn’t explain the ‘IT’S HERE’ messages that I have been getting.  She didn’t know what else to say to me but told me that if I needed anything that she was just a phone call or text away.  I thanked her and then ended up going to sleep.  The night was uneventful…but the morning is what really has my mind occupied.

Here’s a little more background of my routine:  I have huge windows that look towards a small alley way on the side of our building.  I close my curtains when I get home at night (usually around 6:30pm) and open them to let the natural light in the morning (around 7:00am).  This is important because what happened would have HAD to happen between these hours.

I woke up early this morning and got myself and my daughter ready for the day.  When I opened my windows, I saw a HANDPRINT at the top of the window, and I uploaded a picture [HERE](http://imgur.com/8pw27pr)  …This wasn’t just any handprint, it was really detailed.  It looks like it was put on intentionally.  The thing that scares me about it is that it’s a little handprint, and it looks like the size of a child’s [HERE](http://imgur.com/w6GRzlm) ...I took a picture of it and put my hand next to it for comparison [HERE](http://imgur.com/w6GRzlm) ...The thing that I can’t get over is that it’s NOT on the INSIDE of my window but on the OUTSIDE.  The other thing is that I have a screen on the outside of my window.  ALSO, my apartment is raised so someone would have to pick up a child to put the handprint there.  For this little handprint to be there meant that someone had to remove the screen, lift up a child, stick his/her handprint on my window, and then put back the screen [HERE](http://imgur.com/VovXpcS) 

I’ll tell you why this cannot happen:

1.	I have a dog that barks and growls at anything and everything that passes by my door, whether it is a neighbor (sorry neighbors) or a cat.  I would’ve heard the dog make some sort of sound.

2.	I have an ALARM on my window that would have gone off if anyone touched it.  I set the alarm every night when I go to bed and turn it off during the morning.

3.	I would have HEARD someone take the screen off and put the screen back on.

So, this scared the living JESUS out of me, and I dropped my daughter off at daycare and called my landlord on the way to the office.  I explained to him what was happening, and he told me the same story about the elderly couple that lived in my apartment before me.  He isn’t able to give out their personal information to me, but he did give me both of their first and last names after a little pushing.

I think I need to do some digging and find out who exactly this couple is.  I want to know if by ‘IT’S HERE’ if I should be looking for something or someone.  I’m starting to become really paranoid about everything.  I’m going to have a girlfriend stay over with my daughter and me tonight because I don’t want to be alone.  I wish I had a more detailed update, but I will for SURE let you know what I find out tomorrow after I am able to do some research…if anyone has any questions, let me know in the comments.  If not, please just wait for an update and keep my daughter and me in your thoughts for safekeeping tonight.

NinetyTwo92,2017-02-21 07:01:56+00:00,"[OC] The Los Angeles Clippers need to strip Doc Rivers of his ""President of Basketball Operations"" Job.","This might get lost in the Cousins and other Trade Talk news – but it is 2:00AM and I need to get this off my chest. I know this has been brought up countless times in this sub, but I wanted to break it down for everyone. 

The Los Angeles Clippers need to strip Doc Rivers of his “President of Basketball Operations” title. My argument is based on 3 main ideas why: 

* Statistics and History

* Efficiency

* Conflict of Interest  

**Statistics and History**
 
There has been only one coach / GM hybrid that has won a champion in the past 20 years: Greg Popovich. 
Every other championship team in the past 20 years split these responsibilities among two individuals. Both positions did not belong to one individual during the championship year, or the years leading up to the championship. Gregg Popovich is an outlier. The success he has had with the Spurs as Head Coach and General Manager, is not realistic or statistically probable. 

+ + Pat Riley ( thanks to u/MelGibsonDerp )
 
Looking at the regular season and post-season records for the Los Angeles Clippers we also can see that the team has not performed much better under Doc Rivers than they have under Vinny Del Negro.  


**Efficiency Killer**

By now we should all be aware of the fact that multi-tasking is not efficient. The quality of our work drastically plummets once we introduce another task. This is easy to demonstrate on a small scale, with our day-to-day tasks. However, having one individual take on the responsibilities of Head Coach and General Manager has the same effect. There is no way Doc Rivers just as efficient at both, as he would be if he exclusively focused on the responsibilities of one of these positions. 

This logic is (somewhat) the basis of Peter Drucker’s “Managing Oneself” essay, written for the Harvard Business Review many years ago. Drucker is widely regarded as the father of modern management and “Managing Oneself” is still lauded as the “go to” book for executives. In the essay, Drucker states that individuals and business fail because we spread ourselves too thin, and try to do too much. The idea is to discover one thing that you are exceptional at, and hammer that home. We all have our strengths and weaknesses. We are only wasting time attempting to improve on our weaknesses, when we should be focusing on our strengths and being the absolute best in whatever field that may be. Focusing on your strengths and masking your weaknesses will bring your and the organization, success. 

We already know where Doc’s strengths lie. His experience and accolades as a head coach drastically outweigh those as General Manager. Not only that, he has been known to be a “Player’s Coach” and get along with most of his players. His focus, and only priority, needs to be coaching.

**Conflict of Interest**

This one is simple to understand. Being a head coach and general manager creates a major conflict of interest. As a head coach you get to know your players on a personal level. Not only do you build positive relationships with these players, you also have conflict and negative experiences. That’s normal. Emotions are high, and it’s an extremely competitive sport. The individual that spends so much time with the players, and gets to know them on such a personal level, should not oversee trades and player signings. Especially someone who is known as a “Player’s Coach”, like Doc Rivers. He builds strong bonds with his players. He also is the only coach in NBA history to have his son on the roster. Because of this, he is incapable of performing his duties as “President of Basketball Operations” in an unbiased manner. The goal is to win, and create a winning culture – not create a fraternity. 

Doc Rivers needs to have his title of President of Basketball Operations stripped, even if that means we lose him as a Head Coach as well. The Los Angeles Clippers would be far better off hiring two separate (experienced) individuals to take over these positions, and excel at them - than having Doc Rivers perform “just okay” at both.  



*tldr: There has only been one individual that has managed to win a championship while holding the positions of head coach and gm. Holding both responsibilities is also detrimental to Doc's efficiency as a head coach and president of basketball operations, he simply cannot do both at a high enough level to actually win a championship; one will always falter. Last, he should not be in charge of the team roster when he builds strong relationships (both positive and negative) with players as head coach.*",nba,1242

Hayong,2017-02-10 14:36:08+00:00,If You're In a Big City Please Stick With The More Populated Areas,"Now let me tell you. I know that New York City and Los Angeles are gigantic cities, but it is nowhere as confusing as Seoul, South Korea. I have been here at least 3 times in the past 6 months, but I have yet to figure where anything is, but I still decided to stupidly walk around without my cell phone at 2 in the morning. 

It was in the middle of a conference and I just couldn’t go to sleep. So I grabbed a coat and walked out of my hotel room. There really wasn’t anything going on inside of the hotel. The bar was closed, and the computer room was locked. The swimming pool and gym closed at 10 pm so I made the dumb decision to walk around outside. 

I tried to keep track of which street I took, but after walking around for 20 minutes I quickly forgot where I was. Taxis are all around this city at any time. So catching a cab and getting back to the hotel would not be a problem. 

After a couple more minutes of walking I noticed that the huge buildings started to disappear, and the sounds of cars became extinct. This was absolutely perfect for me. I found a little convenience store and grabbed a couple of beers and walked down the street hoping to find a park of some sort. 

The lady in the front counter greeted me when I walked in, but I noticed how old the store looked. I looked at her and saw that she was a fairly short woman maybe in her early 20’s. I know it doesn’t seem important, but to me it felt strange that a young woman like her would work in a rundown store like this. I pushed the thoughts out of my head and grabbed 2 bottles of Soju. (The most popular Korean alcohol beverage and only around a dollar)

I paid for my drinks and walked out of the store. Something about this location made the weather feel just right. Usually it’s completely cold in the middle of February, but it felt so nice out I could take my coat off. This was definitely the most comfortable couple of hours of my life. The fact that there were far less people here than the rest of Seoul made it just that much better. 

While I was walking down the street while sipping on the Soju I looked around and noticed that there were almost no buildings around me. There was just a park in the distance and 3 other smaller buildings including the convenience store. I also noticed that I was walking up to the park without even noticing, but it did seem like a really nice place to drink the rest of my drink so I kept going. 

On the way there I finished off the first drink so I placed the empty bottle in my pocket. I took a little rest to catch my breath and open the next bottle. After my mini break I looked back up and noticed that the park seemed to be farther away. I rubbed my eyes, but the park still seemed to be farther away. For a second I thought about turning back around and catching a cab, but I decided against it. Already halfway there; what was the point in giving up with a full bottle of Soju anyways? 

This time I focused on the park while I walked towards it; only taking my eyes off of it occasionally to take another drink. I started to slowly calm down when I noticed I was definitely getting close. Around 50 paces away from the park I tripped on something and fell to the ground. Right as I was falling down I know for a fact I heard someone whispering to me. It was in Korean, but I will try my hardest to translate it. “Come in. Come in. It’s fun. You won’t regret.” I got up and looked around, but the only thing that was there was what tripped me. It was an empty bottle of beer. 

I picked it up to chuck it into the grass when I noticed how old it felt. I could make out the word “Jinro Brewing” on the bottle. I turned the bottle around to see if I could read anything else on it. My eyes finally fell on a series of numbers. 

*19531011*

I don’t know why it was the beer bottle that made me run away from the park. I don’t know why I didn’t run away when I heard the whispers, but I just wish I never even went out of my hotel room. I bolted down the street and towards the convenience store, but every couple of steps I kept hearing the park call back to me. “Don’t run. So we can play. Come in here. Forever you can stay.” I ignored the calling, but I will tell you that every time it called out to me I was just that much more tempted to just go back to the park. 

“Just look back once and it will stop.” Against my will I stopped completely and looked back. The park was gone, but a group of children were running around the empty lot. A man carrying a beer bottle was walking down the street towards the park. He took out a knife from his back pocket and threw the bottle on the ground. 

The kids stopped playing and looked at the man with curiosity. Without slowing down he walked up to the first kid and raised the knife up, but before he could even stab a kid the other children swarmed around him and each took out a knife.  A couple stabbed at his legs, a few jumped on him and the rest just stepped back and watched while laughing. The man’s blood was flying all over the lot. I couldn’t watch any longer so I turned around and continued to run to the convenience store. 

I kept running away from the park and from the laughter coming from the children. Right when I got near the convenience store the noise stopped. I turned around and the park was back there again. 

When I got up to the store I tried opening the doors but it was locked. I tried shaking the doors harder hoping it was jammed but the door wouldn’t give.  Desperation started to take over my body, but I ignored it and started to walk away. That is when the door rattled from the other side. I walked back up to the door, and saw the lady that checked me out. I started to point to the door but she shook her head slowly at me. Bits of her skin started falling off of her face every time she moved her face. She said, “Go to the park. You can stay forever. You can never die. Stay at the park. You will be happy.”

I screamed and banged the door where her face was and kept running away from the park. I started to see familiar buildings and started to calm down. After a couple of minutes I started to walk. The streets of a busy Seoul started to come into view. I got on my knees and thanked the world for saving my life. I took out the second bottle of Soju and took a long chug of it. I finished the bottle off and threw the bottle in the grass and looked up. 

I was back in the park. 

The kids started to come out of the shadows and slowly walked up to me. I frantically looked around. Hoping there was some sort of place of shelter. My eyes fell on a older phone booth. 

I forced myself onto my feet and ran inside of the phone booth and picked up the phone. After muttering a quick prayer I put the phone up to my ear. The relief I felt when I heard the dial tone is beyond words. With tears falling from my eyes I put 500 won (50 cents) and called for a taxi. I thought about calling the cops for a second, but I knew there was zero chance in hell they would believe my story. The dispatcher answered my call and I told her that I needed a ride from a park close to Ibis Hotel. She asked me where the park was exactly but all I could do was describe out what the park looked like and what the stores around it looked like. She muttered silently for a second and said that a taxi was on its way. 

By the time I hung up the phone the kids had surrounded around the phone booth. They started to bang all around me, but I sat down as low as I could and put my feet up against the doors. A girl with long flowing brown hair walked up to me and stared me down with a smile on her face. Her body started to bubble around her midsection and legs. Her face started to stretch out until the woman from the convenience store was staring me down. She started chanting with the kids, “Open the door. Live forever. Just open the door. Escape the terror.” 

A couple of the kids started to jam their knives into the door and pry it open. I kept my legs in the same spot. Waves of pain overcame my body whenever they stabbed my feet, but I held on. I didn’t want to die. I didn’t care about my feet. I just wanted to live. I just wanted to be at the hotel. I wanted to go back home.

When my legs started to give out I heard a honk in the distance. I looked to my right and saw a taxi. I got to my feet and braced myself to be attacked by the children, but I was only met by the sound of impatient honking. I opened my eyes to see that the kids and the women disappeared. The park looked to be ages older. I opened the door and dead bolted to the taxi and got in the back. 

The taxi driver took one look at me and asked me where I was headed. I muttered Ibis Hotel and he drove off. On the way there the taxi driver kept giving me an odd look. 

I asked him why he was staring, but he just shrugged his shoulders and kept driving till we arrived at my hotel. I opened the door and started to head out when he grabbed me by my shoulder. He whispered to me, “Every couple of weeks we get a call over there. That’s why we knew where you were. Avoid the park at all costs. It is still haunted by the ghosts of children that are responsible for 12 deaths in their town. Many men tried to stop them, but they were unsuccessful. Now they stay at the park and prey upon people that foolishly go near the park. You are lucky. You survived. Keep it that way.”

I’m at my hotel now. I wanted to give you this warning. 

If you happen to be in Korea and you find yourself in Seoul.  

Please only stay in areas that are heavily populated. 

I leave you this final warning before I head out to the park. I can’t stop thinking about all of them. I want to live forever. I want to know what true happiness is. 

[Good Bye] (https://www.facebook.com/HayongNoSleep/)

AmerChemSocietyAMA,2017-02-07 12:49:18+00:00,"American Chemical Society AMA: Hi Reddit! I’m Michael Qiu, Library Relations Manager with ACS Publications. Ask me anything about being a science librarian.","Hi Reddit! My name is Michael Qiu and I’m the Library Relations Manager with ACS[ ](http://imgur.com/hoKm4RT)Publications. In my current job, I am responsible for developing our marketing, outreach, and engagement programs with librarians across the globe. Before coming to ACS in 2015, I was a Science &amp; Engineering Librarian at the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles, CA. I was the librarian for chemistry, chemical engineering, materials science, and petroleum engineering. Even though I no longer work in a library, I stay actively involved within the library community.

I received my Master in Library and Information Science (MLIS) from UCLA (Go Bruins!) and my BS in Chemistry from Iowa State University. I’m a native of Iowa, but have bounced between Los Angeles and Washington, DC, and now have finally settled in Milwaukee.

When I was an undergraduate I learned quickly the importance of the library and the librarians that help make everything that much easier. The library is a central hub of information and can be easily overlooked. Without the library and the science librarians at Iowa State, I would not have had someone to teach me how to search, retrieve, and properly use resources or had access to journals, ebooks, and databases like SciFinder. It really was this connection that helped me make the leap from chemistry to library and information science.

As a science undergraduate, library school does pose its challenges (there are no lab experiments and lots of writing), but I encourage everyone to not overlook this career path. There is a huge need for librarians with a science background. My time at ACS has also given me a chance to interact with PhD students through our [ACS on Campus](http://acsoncampus.acs.org/) program and librarianship is an alternative career path many are unaware of.

Working as a librarian and in my current job, I have had the opportunity to interact with so many different people and learn so much. I hope this AMA gives you the opportunity to ask me a question that you think I can help answer, or even better, ask a question you don’t know who to turn to, after all, all librarians love a challenge.

I’m excited to answer any of your questions. Since I won’t be able to answer everyone’s questions, if I don’t answer have an opportunity to answer your question here, do not hesitate to reach out to me on Twitter [@MichaelatACS](https://twitter.com/MichaelatACS) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelqiu1).

I’ll be back at 12 noon ET (9am PT, 5pm UTC) to answer your questions.

-ACS edit formatting

Edit: Good morning (or afternoon) Reddit! It's just about 11 am here in Milwaukee, so it's time to get answering questions. I'll be answering questions for the next hour, so keep the questions and comments coming in.

Edit: My hour has come and gone, but it doesn't mean the questions should stop. I've enjoyed this so much that I'll try and come back this afternoon to answer a few more questions. Otherwise, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via Twitter or Linkedin (see above). Thanks again to everyone!",science,2334

He waived his right to appear at a hearing on Saturday after King County District Court Judge Arthur Chapman found probable cause to hold him on investigation of attempted **rape of a child** in the first degree and communicating with a minor for immoral purposes.

Those organizations provide *mental health services for at-risk youth* and help troubled families.

&gt;""His involvement with children may have helped contribute to his understanding of the people impacted by this ruling but would not have shaped his interpretation of the rule of law,"" said Paul Lawrence, who was one of the attorneys who filed an amicus brief backing Washington State in the immigration case.

This coming Summer we will reach the 15th anniversary of World Cup 2002 hosted by Japan &amp; South Korea. I remember watching France '98, but 2002 is the first World Cup i remember being fully invested in and after Steven Gerrard's retirement  (who, it turns out, was injured and missed out anyway) a little while back i became curious of just how many players who took part are still going. Well, there were 32 countries all arriving in East Asia with a 23 man squad, so here's a list of those that are still going...

**In Summary**    
So in total that means that of the 736 players who turned up at the tournament, there are only 75 still going.    
-	 Midfielders are the best represented with 26, defenders are the lowest with 13.   
-	Japan still have the highest number of active players with 9, while 3 countries (France, Germany &amp; Portugal) have no one still standing    
-	With only 3 players still going, group D is the clear group of ~~death~~ retirement.    
-	The average age of players still going is 37, with three 32 yr olds and incredibly one 49 yr old in the shape of Masashi Nakayama.    
-	There are 6 unfortunate souls however who currently find themselves without a club, so if you’re looking for a bargain after deadline day then look no further.

WhenMachinesCry,2017-01-27 15:03:06+00:00,"In light of Enes Kanter's injury, let's take a look at other stupid ways NBA players got injured.","**""ARE YOU EXTINGUISHING TO ME??""**

During 2012 playoffs a frustrated Amare Stoudemire, for unknown reasons, attacked a fire extinguisher minutes after the New York Knicks' Game 2 loss to the Miami Heat. The Knicks power forward suffered lacerations on his left hand which required stitches. He suffered the laceration on the inside of his palm, on the side of his hand closest to the pinkie. Subsequently, Amare has been extinguished from Game 3. It is important to note, that fire extinguisher's side of the story was never heard.

------------------------------

**BEEP, BEEP**

Shortly after inking a six-year, $66 million dollar contract extension, Monta Ellis torpedoed Golden State's 2008-09 season when he tore a ligament in his left ankle and sustained a high-ankle sprain in a ""low-speed"" moped accident. So not only did he screw his team over, he lost serious Man Points for getting injured not only on a moped...but while driving said moped at low speeds. 

---------------------------------------

**UPSETING THE GODS**

Tony Allen blew out his knee -- tearing both ACL and MCL -- while trying to throw one down after the whistle had blown. That's a direct message from the Basketball Gods, and it can be interpreted as: ""Thou shall not showboat, mortal fool!"" Oh, and he also missed the dunk.

----------------------------------------

**BIG BALLS TOO MUCH FOR THE WOLVES' TITLE HOPES**

The Minnesota Timberwolves' best chance of reaching the Finals with Kevin Garnett came in 2004, but Sam Cassell injured his hip before the start of the Western Conference Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers defeated the Wolves and played the Detroit Pistons in the Finals. ""All the time,"" said Flip Saunders about Cassell's injury. ""It was his hip. He made a shot out of the corner against Sacramento in Game 7 [of the conference semifinals], and he did his little Big Balls dance, and from that, he created a little avulsion fracture in his hip. No question, I think about that dance all the time. But that’s the NBA. I went to four straight conference finals in Minnesota and Detroit, and we had injury issues in each one. The team that wins the title is usually the healthiest team.""

-------------------------

**PRO BOWL**

Andrew Bynum injured his knee when going bowling, while being injured. Yes he did.

---------------------------

**NIGHT PARALYSIS**

In 2012 Kevin Love slept with his right arm extended off his bed all night and when he woke up he couldn't move it and had to miss the next game. 

------------------------

**STEVE THE SPIKE**

Lakers guard (at the time) Steve Blake suffered a puncture wound to his left foot after stepping on a spike strip in a parking lot. He was out for three weeks. Blake said he hurt himself when he ""got distracted going back to my truck"". Good job, Steve.

--------------------------

**LOTION-EYEZ KILLA**

Charles Barkley missed the Phoenix Suns' 1994-95 season opener because the first layers of his corneas got burned off by body lotion during an Eric Clapton concert. Apparently, allergies and the dazzling stage lights caused Sir Charles to rub his eyes, and he got lotion in them. Phoenix Suns team doctor, Richard Emerson, said: ""It was a chemical reaction to a type of lotion that he uses. I wouldn't anticipate it'll reoccur because I don't think he'll use that type again."" 

---------------------------------


**SLEEPIN' &amp; CHILLIN'**

Prior to the 1995-96 NBA season, BJ Tyler was selected by the Toronto Raptors in the 1995 expansion draft. According to journalist Chris Young's book Drive, Tyler accidentally fell asleep with a pack of ice on his knee, severely damaging it and thus losing all the speed for which he was famed, and subsequently had to retire.

--------------------------

**DISHES GET STICHES**
Brad Miller needed nine stitches in his right index finger after almost chopping it off with a knife while doing dishes last season...on the same day he was named Western Conference Player of the Week for the second time in his career. Said Miller: ""It's the last time I help do dishes."" Said teammate Mikki Moore: ""When I saw him, it was all wrapped up. So, I said, 'You're going to drop 20 and 20 in two games and then go and cut your knuckle off?' I said, 'That's real smart, Brad.' He said, 'Nah, that's my luck.'"" 

--------------------------------------------

**""THANKS REF""**

During the 2001-02 season, Corey Maggette got so upset over a call that he slammed his hand on the scorer's table in frustration and dislocated the ring and little fingers on his right hand. Maggette ended up with a cast and a four-week vacation.


-------------------------------------

**FINALS MVP**

Ah, Darko, Darko, Darko. He was put in for what was described as a ""token"" appearance in the Pistons' Game 5 blowout of the Lakers in the 2004 NBA Finals. He played 2 minutes, finishing with 1 rebound, 1 steal, 1 turnover...and 1 broken hand. Oh yes he did. The injury required surgury and sidelines him for eight weeks. 

--------------------------

**CAN'T HANDLE THE JOE**

Derrick Coleman -- whose NBA career was limited and cut short largely due to injury problems -- got injured again, only this time it happened while filming an episode of the TV show Pros vs. Joes. DC was participating in a rebounding challenge against some ""average joe"" when he came down from a jump and landed awkwardly, hurting his always-troublesome knee. This means that Coleman probably has the dubious distinction of being the first Pro to ever get injured during battle with a Joe.

-------------------------------------------

**SLICING AND DICING**

The Bulls rookie (at the time) Derrick Rose was forced to miss some practice time because, get ready for it, he cut himself under the elbow on his left forearm. In bed. From a knife he used to slice an apple. Said Rose: ""Silly accident this morning. I went to get a bottle of water, forgot the knife was there and sat down and sliced my arm. I panicked when it first happened. I called [Bulls trainer Fred Tedeschi]. We got it stitched up about 8 [a.m.]. It was a large wound, but they healed it up. I'm good. I could have practiced, but they told me to wait until [today]. I can still dribble, shoot, do all that stuff. I'm hoping they'll let me play.""

------------------------------------

**HOW TO PUT ON A SHOE 101**

In December 2001, before a game against the Washington Wizards, DirK Nowitzki sprained a tendon in his ankle when he put his shoe on improperly and the stomped his foot on the floor to make sure it was on right. The injury was so bad he missed the game. 

---------------------------------------

**HIDDEN DANGERS OF A WALK-THROUGH**

Eddy Curry had to miss a game due to a badly sprained left ankle suffered at...a walk-through at his team's morning shoot-around. Nope. I'm not kidding. Said teammate Malik Rose: ""How do you explain something like that?"" Good question. A very good question.

----------------------------

**E-CITY VS PHYSIOBALL**
Speaking of good questions, here's another: Can a player suffer a more embarrassing injury than spraining his ankle during a walk-through? Well, the answer is ""yes"" my friends. From the New York Daily News: ""Poor Eddy Curry. He sat on the giant blue physioball during a break from Monday's practice and the ball exploded. Eddy fell and scraped and his wrist but should be okay. The ball, which is used for stretching exercises, was pronounced dead at the scene."" This also answers the classic ""How do you know when you're too fat?"" question.

-----------------------------------

**""I TRIED TO WARN HIM"" - Eddy Curry**

Francisco Garcia broke his arm...on a physioball. No, really. At least he wasn't so fat it exploded on him...

-----------------------------

**DIAL 555-INJURY**

Prior to Game 3 of the 1992 first round playoff series between the Indiana Pacers and the Boston Celtics, George McCloud ""held his ankle in a funny way"" while talking on the phone. This somehow injured the ankle so badly he couldn't play in the game and had to sit on the bench in street clothes as his team got eliminated. 

----------------------------

**AGENT ZERO'S BARBERSHOP**

File this one under ""unfortunate pube shaving accidents."" Very unfortunate. I'll let Gilbert Arenas tell the tale: ""When I was new in the NBA the team veterans convinced me to shave, you know, down there, because they said the hair stinks. I used my girlfriend's razor, which was rusty and gave me keloids. The doctor prescribed medicine to dab on, but I just poured it all over. Three days later I woke up screaming. The skin was burnt off my scrotum, down to my crack, everything -- just raw flesh. I still had to run and play, so I used a numbing spray for a month until it healed. Now I use clippers.""

-----------------------------

**OFF TO A GREAT START**

Greg Ostertag fractured the third metacarpal on his right hand in October of 2004 when he tripped on a footstool while getting out of bed. Mind you, this happened after his first day of practice with his new team, the Sacramento Kings.

--------------------------

**THE LUGGAGE CONSPIRACY**

1991 Jeff Ruland made a comeback for the Sixers. He was out of action for five years but attempted to return for the 1991-92 season. However, the comeback ended because of...a luggage cart. Yes, a luggage cart, which was (allegedly) rammed into Ruland's leg by a Celtics employee as he waited for a team bus outside Boston Garden. (It should be noted that Ruland was not a popular in Boston, and he was even nicknamed ""McNasty"" by the Celtics' late great broadcaster Johnny Most.) Ruland said: ""I got run over by a luggage cart. That's hard to swallow. It can't be accidental, they were moving too fast. Whoever could foresee anything like this happening?""

------------------------------------

**PERK'S TIC-TAC-TOE**

Boston's big man (at the time) Kendrick Perkins missed time due to a right big toe that was injured when he dropped a bed on it. ""I was asleep. I guess whoever put my bed together didn't put it together right when I moved, so one side of my bed fell. My bed was tilted, so I got out of my bed to go push down on the other side. And when I was about getting ready to push down on the other side, the headboard started coming in. So I tried to push the headboard back so it wouldn't fall over. My foot was under the bed and the other side of the bed fell on my foot."" Man, I hate it when that happens.

-------------------------------

**CRIPPLING BUZZER-BEATER**

During the mid-90s, Kevin Johnson won a regular season game on a buzzer-beating shot and received a crippling bear hug from teammate Charles Barkley. And I mean ""crippling"" in the literal sense. Chuck squeezed Kevin so hard his shoulder was dislocated. (At least Barkley didn't rub any body lotion in KJ's eyes.) He was out of action for the next two weeks. KJ also had hernia surgery in 1996 after years of abdominal problems that were allegedly brought on by picking up teammate Oliver Miller to celebrate a play.

----------------------------

**TALL PEOPLE PROBLEMS**

Kobe Bryant hurt his back. Vacuuming. But he says it's because of vacuum size discrimination. 

------------------------------

**AIR TAKES OUT BIRD**

In the fall of 1988, Larry Bird was attempting a comeback from dual achilles surgery when he permanently injured in his back. How? He was undercut by Michael Jordan, who then fell on Bird...in the Kenny Rogers Charity Basketball Tournament in Kentucky. According to his second autobiography, Bird Watching: On Playing and Coaching The Game I Love, Bird said: ""We were in the final minutes of this charity basketball game when I went up for a rebound and came down a little sideways. Michael Jordan was going for the ball too, and he landed on my back. Right away I knew I was in trouble. I had torn additional portions of the disc wall, and my back was really traumatized. I didn't know it then, all the way back in 1989, but that was the beginning of the end…I never came all the way back."" 

------------------------

**""I GOT A YACHT TO FEED""**

Latrell Sprewell, the man whose hands once said 'hello' to his coach's neck, broke his hand by taking a swing at the boyfriend of a female party guest who threw up on his yacht. But it seems that Spree's punches were roughly as accurate as his jumpers (42 percent lifetime): He whiffed and punched the wall instead. Sprewell tried to cover up the incident, but some of his guests leaked the story and the Knicks fined Spree $250,000 for not reporting the injury. Sprewell complained about it to the press. ""They talk about being a family but they're not sticking with me. The biggest thing to me is that I'm hurt. So don't kick me when I'm down."" 

--------------------------

**DNP - GAMING**

Lionel Simmons suffered an injury during the 1990-91 season: He missed two games with wrist tendonitis caused by overtraining on his Nintendo Game Boy.

Note that, a year later, Derrick McKey missed seven games with the same injury.

-------------------------- 

**AQUA LUC**

During the 1996-97 season, the Bulls lost Luc Longley's services for seven weeks after he got hurt body surfing. Yeah. Luc was body-surfing off the coast of Los Angeles coast when an unexpectedly strong wave drove him shoulder-first into the ocean floor and knocked his clavicle and shoulder out of place.

--------------------

**HIS SMOKENESS**

Although Michael Jordan  was already kinda sorta unofficially retired (again), Jordan severed a tendon in his right index finger (i.e., on his shooting hand) while using a cigar cutter in January 1999. Officially listed as a ""a laceration of the flexor tendon,"" Jordan needed surgery to repair it and six weeks of occupational therapy to rehabilitate it.

--------------------------

**HIGH MUGGSY**

Muggsy Bogues, the tiny, tiny man (who was playing for the Toronto Raptors at the time) missed the second half of a game against the Portland Trailblazers after accidentally sucking in some ointment fumes during a halftime treatment. Said Bogues: ""Never happened to me before and I hope it never happens again. That was one of those fluke things you don't even dream about.""

---------------------------

**TEAM BONDING**

This entry harkens back to 2003, during Portland's infamous ""Jail Blazer"" era. Ruben Patterson ended up with a shiny black eye thanks to a five-knuckeled ""hello"" from teammate Zach Randolph. Patterson, who earlier that season had been arrested on suspicion of domestic assault, was arguing with Qyntel Woods, who himself had been recently cited by Portland police on marijuana possession charges after a traffic stop, when Randolph stepped in and sucker-punched Patterson. While, it should be noted, Patterson was being restrained by teammates. Nice, huh? Patterson then promised not to retaliate...until his probation expired in May (it was April at the time). Good times all around. 

-------------------------

**EXTREME HOBBIES**

While playing for the Chicago Bulls during the Michael Jordan-less 1993-94 season, Scott Williams had a string of bizarre injuries. First, he missed four days of practice after straining his shoulder at the team's annual bowling outing. A few days later, he hurt his back lifting a TV he bought on sale. Then, later in the season, he injured a tendon behind his right kneecap while stretching, and that was the end of his season.

--------------------------

**RADMAN'S WINTER X-GAMES**

In February of 2007, Vladimir Radmanovic separated his shoulder falling on a patch of ice in Park City, Utah. Or so he claimed. But a few days later, Radmanovic admitted that he had actually hurt himself in a fall during a jump while snowboarding. Said the Radman: ""The truth is that I hurt myself in a fall while snowboarding. Being young and sometimes immature, I initially panicked and made up a false story about how I hurt myself. However, over the past few days my conscience has been bothering me terribly. I am not a dishonest person and could no longer live with this deception. Therefore, I came forward today and told the truth to the Lakers."" Mind you, his contract specifically banned him from taking part in activities that involve significant risk of injury, including skiing and snowboarding. The space cadet was fined $500,000.


------------------------------------

**LIGHTS OUT**

Carlos Boozer broke his hand after tripping over his gym because it was too dark to see at 6PM. Somebody was knocking at the door, and Boozer rushed to answer. On the way, he tripped over his big gym bag in the hall and fell. He went down awkwardly on his right hand and felt it pop. The neighbours later testified they heard an extremely loud ""AHHH AND-ONE!"" echoing through the neighbourhood.

They are twin brothers who were separated at birth by a 20 year old Bill Nye who panicked about being a father.

On a rainy day in St. Petersburg, Florida shortly after being hired by NASA, NASA was forced to scrub a launch because of the weather giving Bill Nye the opportunity to explore his new city. After a night out on the town Bill meets a beautiful woman in which he engages a sexual act with. A few months later he gets a call from that same woman. She is pregnant...with twins. Bill panics knowing there is no way he can be a father with his hectic job and youth. The woman does not go through with an abortion and Bill is mad. Bill decides he has no choice but to steal one son and send him on the West Coast and keep the other close by just so he has the satisfaction of watching him grow up. Bill flies with baby Lane to Seattle where he has some family but an engine failure stops the plane short and is forced to land in Nebraska on May 9th, 1975. Lane Kiffins birthday.

While this is all happening, Bill Nye has already killed the mother of the twins before leaving for the West Coast and has hidden baby Daniel with a Cuban gang who hides him for Bill until he returns to Florida. After a short stay in Nebraska finding Lane a new home and waiting out the search of his now deceased lover, Bill returns to Florida where he gives Daniel to a family in Titusville, FL on May 29th, 1975 which happens to be Daniel Tosh's birthday.

Lane and Daniel have no idea of one anothers existence but they have their fathers charismatic personality which leads them on different career paths. Lane becomes a star football player and that leads into a coaching career but Lane feels something is missing. After spending time at USC in Los Angeles, he spent time in Florida stealing away recruits. He realized he was often better recruiting Florida than he was California. Why was this? He also had a feeling that he never really wanted to leave..It was almost as if he had Tampa 2 in his veins.  Meanwhile, brother Daniel who also has his fathers personality becomes an outgoing comedian who is born for the limelight. Growing up in Florida Daniel knew where he belonged and was not held back by being out of place. He was comfortable in his own skin. 

When the opportunity came, Lane moved back to Florida the first chance he got. While Daniel swapped places with Lane and now lives in Los Angeles.

What happens to Bill Nye in all of this? He gets disrespected on the Larry Wilmore Show all while his two kids who don't know of their brotherhood make fun on one another on TV and Social Media.

[LATEST VIDEO UPDATE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B07-D5dmHK8)

Jeffrey (the fella in the hat; also a Trump supporter) and I went to the LA women's march just to document the liberal nonsense. We crossed paths with Big Joe, and the rest is history!

I just got off the phone with Big Joe, and I am planning to meet up with him this week so he can answer your questions. Maybe do an AMA? He's a bright guy (as you all already know) and he wants to help wake up the sheeple. The goal we have now is to develop a show format for Joe so we can continue Red-pilling the entirety of Los Angeles county!

I am somewhat new to organizing things for T_D. If you have ANY suggestions on what we can do to help give this quintessential Alpha male a bigger microphone, let me know! I'm all ears!

I will update you on everything when I speak to him again tomorrow and as new things come in.

For those wondering, ""Based in LA"" is the brainchild of me and Jeffrey (the goofball with the hat). We are aiming to build a media company focusing on politics, culture, and comedy that stems from a more right-of center mindset. Stay tuned!

freerealestatedotbiz,2017-01-22 23:11:36+00:00,Q2 Rookie Report,"#Pre-Introduction Read-Me

While this is called a “rookie report”, I include players some players that are effectively rookies, though they technically were already in the league before this year. For more information on why I do this as well as which such players are included, please read #Before We Begin.

#Introduction

One of my favorite things to follow every season is the mystery and the promise of the NBA rookies. However, there isn't too much coverage of how these guys play. So, I’m posting a statistical summary of this season’s rookie class around the end of every quarter of the season. It’s true that the rookie season is not all that indicative of the rest of a player’s career. However, I want to share this stuff with you guys (1) because I think it’s fun; (2) the players that show noticeable improvement from the beginning to the end of this season are probably worth keeping an eye on; and (3) oftentimes fans (myself included) form their opinions of a rookie after seeing them once or twice, and on any given night a rookie can look like he’s polished beyond his years or a complete disaster.

All stats for this post were recorded on 1/22/17 from [Basketball-Reference](http://www.basketball-reference.com/), meaning the last day of games included was 1/21/17.

You can find my spreadsheet with all the stats [here]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CpkYigXRKF6BY_ee1y-gSkHxqtOnk_EK9LLBQdA-f7c/pubhtml)

#Before We Begin

*Small Sample Size Police*

The sample sizes are too small. That’s just the name of the game when you look at what rookies are doing. As a reminder to everyone, take all the stats with a grain of salt. But let's not get too hung up on this and instead enjoy the rollercoaster of absurd highs and lows that such small sample sizes will take us on throughout the season. That said at some point the sample size is just too small to be of even minimal value. So, for a rookie to be included in my reports, he’ll have to have played at least a number of minutes equivalent to averaging 5 minutes per game in at least half of the time period of the report. So, to make it into this post, a rookie must have played at least 105 minutes (21 Games x 5 MPG).

*Growing Pains*

A sentiment I see frequently is “[Rookie] sucks!” or “[Rookie] doesn’t deserve playing time because he’s trash!” This attitude implies that there are some rookies that are good and some rookies that are bad. The truth is, as you'll see, that rookies all pretty much suck by NBA standards. Even the guys who impress in the box score begin to lose their luster when you look to advanced stats that account for efficiency and defense. It’s a difficult adjustment to play in the NBA and the statistics bear that out. Also, the fact that stats like VORP are not too kind to rookies says as much about the rookies themselves as it says about just how good a replacement-level NBA player is at basketball. So, it’s not wrong to say a rookie “sucks,” but that should not be the end of the analysis as we try to suss out what kind of player a guy is going to be in the future. “Sucking” is just sort of part of the process of being a rookie. Lastly, this means we should just be that much more appreciative when we see a rookie who is putting up a stat line that actually resembles a quality NBA stat line.

*“Rookies”*

I identified 86 players for consideration in this report. That number includes the 2016 draft class, undrafted players (domestic and foreign), players from earlier draft classes playing their first minutes, **and players who played fewer than *200* minutes of NBA games prior to this season**. I included that last group just because it seemed a little unfair to count as rookies guys who have had professional training for multiple years before coming over or starting their rookie season, but not to count other guys in a similar position who just happened to end up on the basketball court for a few minutes during garbage time. 
In my first report, I set the cut-off at 400 minutes played prior to the start of this season because I felt like somebody who played in a full 82 games but averaged less than 5 minutes per game is someone that I would say still hasn’t really played a season of NBA basketball. However, most of the feedback I received was that this cutoff was too generous. I reduced the cutoff down to 200 minutes, which eliminated all the players that were specifically called out in the last thread.

Between changing the cut-off and waivers, the following players did not make it from the last report: Terry Rozier, Chris McCullough, Aaron Harrison, Cristiano Felicio, RJ Hunter, Salah Mejri, Jonathan Gibson, Darrun Hilliard, James Michael McAdoo, Montrezl Harrell, Joe Young, Jarell Martin, CJ Wilcox, Arinze Onuaku, Lucas Nogueira, Delon Wright

And we also had some new additions to the available pool: Pierre Jackson, Chasson Randle

*Final Notes*

Last time, I misused the term “replacement player”, erroneously tying it to VORP and not BPM. I’ve corrected that for this report.
I also started recording WAR this report as I felt it helps clarify what some of the advanced stats mean for teams and players.
There was a request last time to include per 36 stats. Since that would almost double the work I have to do for these, I opted not to include those yet. However, I’m planning on adding those to the year-end report along with some other stuff like ORtg and DRtg.
All stats are cumulative, so they go back to the start of the season and are not limited to just the games that took place between now and my last post.

#Rookie of the Year

Joel Embiid (PHI) continues to tighten his grip on the ROY award. He’s averaging 19.8 points per game—over **10** more points than the next best rookie (Dario Saric at 9.4). He’s putting up 7.8 rebounds, 2.1 assists per game, 2.5 blocks per game, and 0.8 steals per game. And yes, those numbers are all improved from my last post. He has far and away the highest Usage rate of any rookie at 36.2% (Dejounte Murray comes in second at 26.2%). Oh and let’s not forget he’s a 7-footer whose shooting 34.8% from 3, just under league average (35.9%) on 3.1 attempts per game. His BPM is 3.7. His VORP is 1.1, translating to 2.97 wins above a replacement-level player (WAR). Even with his minutes restriction, he’s third among rookies in minutes per game. Nobody else comes close to these numbers this season. Every game he plays is a must watch for fans that follow young players and their development.

Runner Up: Malcolm Brogdon (MIL): 9.4 PPG, 44.2% FG, -1.2 BPM. 0.2 VORP, 0.54 WAR

A couple other players are posting similar box score stats (Dario Saric (PHI), Buddy Hield (NOP), and Brandon Ingram (LAL)). However, when you turn to advanced metrics, all those guys look like net negatives for their teams. So, to me they don’t really challenge Brogdon for second place.

#Notable Improvements

Malcolm Brogdon. He is averaging 9.3 PPG (third among rookies) on 54.4% TS% up from 6.8 PPG on 45% TS%. Last quarter he was sitting at -3.8 BPM and -0.1 VORP, but has since improved to -1.2 BPM and a positive VORP of 0.2. He’s also improved to 2.8/4 R/APG from 2.6/2.6 R/APG and has earned 5 more MPG in the Bucks’ rotation. From a middling second round pick to arguably the best player in his draft class, with heavy emphasis, *right now this season*. It’s hard to say what his ceiling is beyond this. But he is giving the Bucks exactly what they could hope for out of a 24-year-old rookie: an instant contributor.

Buddy Hield. Hield got off to a shaky start to the season. At the time of the last report, he recorded a sad BPM of -6.1. He was inefficient from the field, managing 7.6 PPG on a dismal 35.8% from the field (22.9% from 3, 43.3% TS%). Today he’s still digging himself out of that hole, but has improved to 9 PPG on 39.5% from the field. Most exciting is that he’s heating up from deep, boosting his 3P% all the to 37.2% on 4.3 attempts per game. His BPM is still below the rookie average at -3.5 and his VORP has not improved at all from the -0.3 of the last quarter. Nonetheless, he’s starting to look more like the Buddy Hield we were all expecting to see after his career at Oklahoma. If he can keep this up, I think he will have had one of the better seasons out of all the rookies this year when all is said and done.

Caris LeVert. It’s a little misleading to call his work an improvement as he was hurt for the entire first quarter of the season. Regardless, his play has been impressive since his return. He’s shooting 45.5% from the field (33.3% from 3, 58.2% TS%) to the tune of 6.9 PPG. His BPM is decent at -0.7 with a VORP of 0.1, translating to 0.27 WAR for a team struggling to secure wins. The Nets failures are a tragic meme these days, and that tends to overshadow a series of shrewd moves by their front office, of which LeVert is just one of the latest. From snatching RHJ from Portland to picking up Sean Kilpatrick to hiring Marks and Atkinson, they’ve shown some real savvy in managing their team. I’m excited to see what this staff can cook up once their larder is fully stocked again.

And, as detailed above, Joel “The Process” Embiid went from best to bestest.

#Cooling Down

Nobody cooled down more than Jonathan Gibson (DAL) who went from my pick for ROY runner-up in the last post to being waived in favor of Pierre Jackson. He was a fun storyline while he lasted, but the fact remains that he was 29 years old and probably just enjoying a high mark in his statistical variance during the last quarter. I wish him the best in his future endeavors.

Jamal Murray was another guy swimming around in the Embiid’s ROY wake last quarter. At the time he was averaging 9.9 PPG and shooting 41.1% from the field and 45% from 3. He was adding in 2.4 RPG and 2.2 APG and beating out replacement-level status by a decent margin at -0.6 BPM. Today he’s cooled off, sinking to 36.9% from the field and 31.9% from 3. His APG are also down to 1.7 and he’s scoring a little less at 7.8 PPG. But most troubling of all is his BPM which has dropped below replacement-level to -3.4. All in all, this sort of looks like what most expected from him: a very streaky shooter who, at only 19 years old, would need some time to develop consistency and efficiency. Don’t be surprised if he’s back to the top of the report by the time the 3rd quarter ends.

Jaylen Brown. At the time of the last report, Brown was looking efficient and impressive. He was scoring 6.1 PPG on 52% TS% (44.7 from the field and 33.3% from 3). And his BPM of -2.3 suggested that he was treading rookie water as a replacement level player. While his FG% is mostly unchanged, he’s cooled off from behind the arc (30.2%) and is now averaging only 4.9 PPG. His BPM sank to -4.9 and he’s posting a VORP of -0.4, which translates to -1 WAR. Last time, he looked like he was developing much faster than anyone expected, and today we are reminded that looks can be deceiving as he has regressed toward what will probably look like his mean this season. Accordingly, he’s lost a couple minutes in the rotation down to 13.2 MPG from 15.5. He is of course a 20-year-old drafted for his upside and not his immediate contributions, but his hot start certainly got the best of me and it’s been sobering to see him come back to earth.

#Averages of this Rookie Class

* Points Per Game: 4.86 (up from 4.49)

* FG%: 41.9% (down from 42.8%)

* 3P%: 29.4% (down from 32.2%)

†Please note that even though Semaj Christon made it onto a leaderboard, he really is terrible. He’s scraping together 3.2 PPG on a cringe-inducing TS% of 37.8%. His abysmal BPM of -7.1 is only bested by Paul Zipser’s tragic -8.1 BPM. He has a rookie-class worst VORP of -0.7, which translates to a WAR of -1.89, which basically means his presence so far has made the Thunder 2 losses worse than if they just had replacement-level John Q. Basketball in his stead. Also, sorry Nets fans, but Christon is actually tied for the lowest VORP with Isaiah Whitehead, who is also posting a -0.7 VORP.

#Better Late than Never

Malcolm Delaney (ATL) and Mindaugas Kuzminskas (NYK) are the oldest true rookies at 27 years old.

#Happy Birthday!

The following rookies or “rookies” had a birthday since the last report: Alan Williams (PHX), Pat Connaughton (POR), Daniel Ochefu (WAS), Sheldon McClellan (WAS), Malik Beasley (DEN), Jarnell Stokes (DEN), Henry Ellenson (DET), Rakeem Christmas (IND), Deyonta Davis (MEM), Troy Williams (MEM), Malcolm Brogdon (MIL), Buddy Hield (NOP), Josh Huestis (OKC)

#Riding the Pine

The following teams are not giving their rookies or “rookies” much playing time:

* Charlotte Hornets

* Detroit Pistons

* Indiana Pacers

* Los Angeles Clippers

* Orlando Magic

* Sacramento Kings

* Utah Jazz

It’s interesting that by and large these teams are in their conference’s scrum for the 8th seed. That kind of makes sense if you think about it. Our average WAR for this rookie class is -0.26 and we’re talking about for the most part playoff-hungry teams for whom 1 win could make all the difference. Is an 8th seed worth sacrificing a year of development for your young players? At the same time, maybe Joel Embiid’s stellar season suggests that maybe actual playing time isn’t a crucial factor in player development. I’d say that Embiid is such an outlier, no decisions should be made with his performance as support or justification.

Just as a side note, it’s hard to blame the Utah Jazz for ending up on the list since their only rookie is Joel Bolomboy, and I wouldn’t be going out of my way to give him minutes either. Likewise, the Clippers only have two rookies to speak of, one of whom has been hurt all year (Brice Johnson).

*I made 18 points a hard cut-off because I really feel that 20 points, though arbitrary, is what makes a game “notable” for me. But when I started going through game logs, it became clear that setting it that high would limit me to pretty much only Joel Embiid highlights. So I lowered it to 18. In other words, my hard 18 is really just a soft 20, and I wanted to keep it that way. So, my apologies to Brandon Ingram fans since he’s hit 17 points in multiple games.

#Hopefully Next Time

Here are all the players that didn’t meet the minutes requirement for this report:

Demetrius Jackson, Jordan Mickey, Treveon Graham, Christian Wood, Pierre Jackson, AJ Hammons, Nicolas Brussino, Michael Gbinije, Henry Ellenson, Damian Jones, Chinanu Onuaku, Rakeem Christmas, Georges Niang, Brice Johnson, Diamond Stone, Ivica Zubac, Thon Maker, Cheick Diallo, Marshall Plumlee, Josh Huestis, Stepehen Zimmerman, Chasson Randle, Ben Simmons, Derrick Jones, Tim Quarterman, Malachi Richardson, Skal Labissiere, Georgios Papagiannis, Bryn Forbes, Fred VanVleet, Bruno Caboclo, Joel Bolomboy, Sheldon McClellan, Daniel Ochefu, Danuel House

#Conclusion

That’s a wrap on this rookie report. Things are beginning to coalesce more along the lines of expectations, though there have been some nice surprises and storylines starting to open up, too. Anyway, my goal here isn’t to draw too many of my own conclusions and instead just give you all a one-stop shop for some select stats that you can analyze for yourself. But I will close by saying that in the end, everything is in the shadow of Joel Embiid, a god among rookies.

I am The Process. The Process is with me.

Let me know if there are any stats or anything else you want to see in later posts.

Buddy Hield played for Oklahoma, not Indiana. Thanks u/boomerx23 and apologies to Okalahomans everywhere.

I worked as an INS Attorney (1976-1982) and, for the past 30+ years, have managed a law firm in downtown Los Angeles specializing exclusively in immigration law.

So Dean Spanos took the bait, and made the announcement to block Raiders from taking the stadium vacancy. Technically Spanos can still change his mind and stay in SD.

PleadingtheYiff,2017-01-07 20:35:38+00:00,Breaking: I have uncovered and compiled evidence of a massive ISIS network spanning all 50 states of the U.S.,"#Abstract:

The director of the FBI, James Comey, has stated that ISIS now has a presence in all 50 of the United States:

ABC 7 News Chicago: https://archive.fo/OiEHM

This presence varies in its form from state to state. It exists in the form of smaller cells attached to mosques run by radicalized imams, paramilitary groups operating out of compounds throughout the US, reinforced by veterans and command figures from ISIS’ Syria theater and bolstered by recruits from American minority communities. If all the reports outlined here are in fact found to be true, ISIS has managed to amass a terrifyingly impressive network across the United States that would be capable of wreaking heavy damage in the event of a large-scale terror incident.

#I. Training Camps

One of the ways ISIS has established a military presence in the US is by directly franchising out training camps that build operations centers/cells in various parts of the country. Some of these camps are public knowledge although the media has tried to hide them from the public.

At least one established network of paramilitary training camps has been public knowledge since at least the 1980’s. The [Jamaat ul-Fuqra](https://archive.fo/iJLcm), or “Muslims of America” network has run a network of camps [estimated in a report from Sean Hannity](http://www.military.com/video/operations-and-strategy/domestic-terrorism/terrorist-training-camps-in-the-us/660940716001) to be spread across 35 different locations. The report (linked here) showed a number of Islamic jihadist style military training videos filmed at these sites in the United States.  News site WND has placed the number of camps at least 22:

WND: http://archive.is/eYGbK

Here is a map showing the location of most of the compounds run by Jamaat ul-Fuqra:

https://i.sli.mg/nmtohh.jpg

The Clarion Project ran a report citing FBI documents which state that in 2014 the FBI investigated the organization “…based upon specific and articulate facts giving justification to believe they are engaged in international terrorism or activities in preparation thereof…” This was due in part to an “accidental” deadly shooting that occurred in one of their compounds, Mahmoudberg, in Texas:

FBI Document: http://www.clarionproject.org/analysis/exclusive-clarion-project-discovers-texas-terror-enclave#popup-1

Mahmoudberg was one of several compounds located on property Jamaat ul-Fuqra had purchased in the area:

Clarion: http://archive.is/6yjBu

Jamaat ul-Fuqra was based in Pakistan and its leader, Mubarak Ali Gilani was directly involved in the kidnapping and murder of journalist Daniel Pearl, who was kidnapped while going to interview Gilani in Pakistan. He was questioned but never arrested for the role he played:

http://archive.is/vjwk5

You will recall of course, that the group who carried out the murder of Pearl was Al-Qaeda in Iraq, which was the forerunner of ISIS.  This indicates that ISIS has had established connections to this network in particular since at least 2002.

Hannity’s report and the piece by WND both mention the fact that Jamaat ul-Fuqra has produced a video titled “Soldiers of Allah” where Gilani states:

&gt;We are fighting to destroy the enemy. We are dealing with evil at its roots and its roots are America.

Despite all of this troubling information, the Department of State does not list Jamaat ul-Fuqra as a terrorist organization. Here is a list of videos both showing footage these Islamic jihadist paramilitary groups have filmed or reports referencing them:

https://vid.me/64tH

https://vid.me/Fade

https://vid.me/d7Fd

https://vid.me/4RMz

It appears that there may be a correlation between the states where camps run by Jamaat ul-Fuqra are located and recent terror attacks which have linked to ISIS. 

For example, one of the largest compounds is located in Islamberg, New York. Many of the training and propaganda films made by Jamaat ul-Fuqra are produced at this location. It is interesting that this particular location is so significant to the group when one considers terror activity in the New York/New Jersey area, such as the recent pressure cooker bombings:

The Telegraph: https://archive.fo/hom7j

The Telegraph: https://archive.fo/VVGKJ

The Washington Post: https://archive.fo/wJzdm

The authorities attempted to claim that the individual arrested, Ahmad Khan Rahami, acted alone and there was no cell. But that contradicts other prior reports complete with footage showing multiple other individuals who were active in the terror operation:

CNN: https://archive.fo/kEPW1

The “lone wolf” narrative pushed by the mainstream media is a lie in almost every single case. Wherever there is a “lone wolf” there is a bigger wolf pack nearby providing logistical and operational support. We’ve all seen the damage that individual attackers have caused in various terror incidents and how much chaos an entire squad of ISIS operatives such as those who perpetuated the 2015 Paris attacks can cause. Imagine what will happen when all of them decide to attack at once? The death toll in each location might potentially be in the hundreds, if not thousands.

It is also interesting to note that these pressure cooker attacks happened at the tail end of a spree of “gas leak” explosions in New York. The most recent one occurred in September and was first blamed on a Marijuana growing operation, then a meth lab showing apparent law enforcement confusion as to what and who had actually caused the blast. Others mention that residents didn’t actually smell gas leaking before the explosion. The shifting stories and common stated causes of the explosions are very interesting. When done intentionally, this is known as a “supplement narrative” or a cover story that the public is more likely to accept than what really happened. Here are a number of local news reports on the incidents:

Gothamist: https://archive.fo/bQzwo

NY Daily News: https://archive.fo/Z4zkp

WKRC Cincinnati: https://archive.fo/CwyWr

Pix 11 TV: https://archive.fo/ruuGN

In addition to Jamat ul-Fuqra, other Islamic groups in the United States are Dar al-Hijrah Islamic Center, the Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA), Masjid at-Taqwa (led by Siraj Wahhaj) and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). I have not yet researched these other groups, am not alleging that they are paramilitary in nature and merely list them for referential purposes.

#II. Using mosques as centers for radicalization

In addition to training camps, domestic ISIS terrorists seem to have been groomed to some extent at local mosques by extremist imams.  It is of course not logistically tenable to have paramilitary wings located in every single US state. In such cases, smaller cells coordinated by handlers preaching extremist Wahabbist or Salafist Islam are a much more secure and low profile option. 

Mosques in Europe have been proved to be at risk of being coopted by jihadi groups for use as operations centers. In the aftermath of the Paris terror attacks, French authorities raided a number of mosques and made more than 200 arrests, confiscating 334 weapons of which 34 were described as “war grade.” The raids led to the closure of over 100 mosques in France:

American security officials have also highlighted that many mosques in the United States are involved to some extent with extremism. Breitbart cited a former FBI counter-terrorism special agent as opining that as many as 75% of American mosques were used by jihadist networks:

Breitbart: https://archive.fo/JCTe8

The imams and mosques of specific “lone wolf” attackers in the U.S. have been suspected of having varying levels of involvement in their radicalization process. The Los Angeles cleric Roshan Zamir Abbassi who ministered to the San Bernardino terror attackers was questioned after it emerged he had exchanged a flurry of texts with attacker Syed Rizwan Farook and was allegedly lying about the fact that he knew his wife:

NY Post: http://archive.is/YX4yw

In a revelation suggesting evidence that mosques can and do play host to more than one radicalized attacker, it was revealed that Pulse nightclub attacker Omar Mateen and American suicide bomber Moner Abu Salha both were enrolled in the radical cleric Marcus Dwayne Robertson’s Timbuktu Seminary.

Daily Mail: https://archive.fo/iudwl

In the aftermath of the Pulse shooting, the imam of The Husseini Islamic Center was caught on camera calling for death to gays: 

WFTV 9: https://archive.fo/8Q2WU

https://vid.me/E2w8

The imam of the Boston Marathon bombers, Abdullah Faaruuq, denied radicalizing them despite videos emerging of him making fiery sermons alluding to committing acts of violence. New also surfaced that he was on the radar of groups monitoring preachers of extremism before the attacks occurred:

Fox News: https://archive.fo/ZrlIB

More moderate imams also spoke to the press talking about how extremist clerics had taken over many Boston mosques in recent years:

Fox News: https://archive.fo/G6En6

It has also been revealed in a report by The Gateway Pundit that yesterday’s airport shooter, Esteban Santiago lived within walking distance of the only mosque in Alaska. As more information emerges about the cleric running this facility, will we find out that he too has a history of preaching extreme Islamic ideology?

#III. Smuggling Syria veterans and command figures into the US

**A. ISIS operatives’ presence and activity are now being routinely reported at the southern US border**

While developing domestic paramilitary capabilities, ISIS and groups collaborating with them are attempting to move military assets including combat veterans and command figures from the Syrian/Iraqi theaters into the West. These redeployments are likely rapidly increasing as regional and international coalitions have been closing in on their Middle East territories. ISIS movements into Europe among the refugee population are already fairly well documented. Not so well known are a growing number of reports that ISIS members are locating into the Western Hemisphere and infiltrating the United States.  

In 2015, Judicial Watch ran a series of reports based on testimony from various Mexican military sources stating that ISIS was running a small camp just a few miles from the border of Texas near El Paso:

Judicial Watch: https://archive.fo/aQkhJ

The watchdog further claimed that ISIS was paying multiple cartel organizations to smuggle members across the US border using rural smuggling routes and regional airports to avoid the U.S. Border Control:

Judicial Watch: http://www.judicialwatch.org/blog/2015/07/mexican-cartels-smuggle-terrorists-into-u-s-through-rural-texas-border-region/

They supported their sources with a leaked document from the Texas Department of Public Safety stating that several known members of Islamic terror organizations have been apprehended attempting to enter the U.S. in recent years:

Texas DPS Document: https://www.scribd.com/document/256933420/Border-Surge-Report

Additionally cited was a 2004 document from the Department of State, which stated that multiple known Arab extremists were using Mexico to enter the United States, including a top Al Qaeda operative, Adnan G. El Shurkrjumah who was wanted by the FBI:

Judicial Watch archive: http://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/statedocs/

These reports follow a 2014 project conducted by Judicial Watch documenting the existence of an operation stretching from the southern border to Chicago being run by cartel and ISIS members to move drugs, weapons and individuals from Mexico into the US. This is especially interesting considering the fact that the recent Ft. Lauderdale attacker was Hispanic:

Judicial Watch: https://archive.fo/2c4J8

This year, Judicial Watch reported they had been tipped off by a Homeland Security official that cartel groups were helping multiple ISIS members, including leadership figure Shaykh Mahmood Omar Khabir, enter the United States to conduct surveillance for an attack on American soil:

Judicial Watch: https://archive.fo/9xzZ5

In April 2016 Khabir bragged to Italian newspaper [Il Giornale](https://archive.fo/IcMlQ) that it would be easy for him to “get in with a handful of men, and kill thousands of people in Texas or in Arizona in the space of a few hours.”

Judicial Watch quoted Mexican officials who were incredulous that the Obama administration was not taking these threats more seriously. 

Judicial Watch’s reports were [denied by Texas DPS Director Robert Bodisch](https://archive.fo/i18IR). However, the language Mr. Bodisch indicates that his denial is in fact untrue, though it does not legally qualify as perjury. When confronted about the two reports that Judicial Watch had obtained from Texas DPS contradicting his statement, he merely asserted that neither he nor intelligence officials could “confirm” the reports and he did not accuse Judicial Watch of misquoting their other sources. Notice the language here: to explicitly deny the authenticity of the documents would be to make an untruthful statement, hence Bodisch’s decision to merely state that he could neither confirm nor deny their authenticity. The two reports outlined plans by ISIS operatives to attack Fort Bliss, Texas, and that four of their members had been detained in Texas.

[Politifact](https://archive.fo/aX1zM) made a similarly disingenuous attempt to discredit Judicial Watch’s reports. The report also cited Texas DPS officials who merely said they could neither “confirm nor deny” the documents and sources cited by Judicial Watch. In fact, officials with El Paso’s Sherriff’s Department expressed shock the Judicial Watch’s findings, before their superiors told Politico they similarly “couldn’t provide relevant information” about the report. Again, notice that no authorities have outright denied Judicial Watch’s findings as to do so would be to commit perjury, especially if the official in fact had knowledge suggesting that the reports and information was in fact true. Finally, Politico cited a Border Patrol official who merely cast doubt on Judicial Watch’s reports before it emerged that he had left the Border Patrol in contentious circumstances. None of this refutes the findings and reports of Judicial Watch.

**B. How ISIS can cross from West Africa to the Western Hemisphere**

It is, in theory, actually incredibly easy for ISIS operatives and commanders to leave the theater of war in Syria and move into the Western Hemisphere, potentially linking up with paramilitary forces located in some of the camps mentioned above.  South American and Mexican drug cartels have been increasingly running drugs into West Africa using entire fleets of decrepit and unregistered cargo planes:

The Telegraph: https://archive.fo/lyFCe

CNN: https://archive.fo/9p3bM

In order to move the drugs from West Africa to their ultimate markets in Europe, narco groups have been working to smuggle them in cooperation with multiple Islamic terror groups. These terror groups benefit financially from the arrangement.  Below are reports from the United Nations and Financial Action Task Force explaining these business arrangements in addition to an article from The Telegraph outlining the arrangement:

United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime: https://archive.fo/OV4fV

Financial Action Task Force: http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/TF-in-West-Africa.pdf

The Telegraph:  https://archive.fo/bscuT

ISIS has known franchises in West Africa, most notably the Nigerian extremist group Boko Haram. It would logistically possible to move assets from Syria into West Africa via their franchises in Libya and jump the Atlantic into the Western Hemisphere:

NY Times: https://archive.fo/tivy4

ISIS’ estimated monthly income of $80-120 million USD (and that number relies only on what is public knowledge) also shows that it is financially possible for them to pay their way through Western smuggling networks. All that would be needed is the willingness to outbid competing state agencies reaching out to cartels in the hope that they will keep extremists out of the United States and the adjacent countries:

Stuff Mag New Zealand: https://archive.fo/5rL6K

As a final note, once ISIS members have entered the United States, it is quite easy for them to take up positions and embed themselves within Sanctuary Cities, where lax immigration laws give them a veritable free pass to move around without fear of harassment from or detection by local law enforcement.  

#IV. Radicalizing black American youth

There are also indications that recruitment and radicalization is occurring in various black American communities in recent years.  ISIS has publicly stated its desire to recruit African Americans and exploit unrest caused by police violence incidents to increase sympathy for it’s cause in the black community:

Heavy: https://archive.fo/IkYAL

In some of their recruitment media, ISIS has actually used Black Lives Matter talking points in an attempt to convince Americans to join the organization:

Breitbart: https://archive.fo/tXFhh

Recently I came across a nine month long program Black Lives Matter has been running labeled as the “Youth Empowerment Strategy program at Dubai.” The stated purpose of the program is to “to empower our youth with the knowledge, skills and confidence to conduct themselves with poise and professionalism”.

https://i.sli.mg/t4fYOr.png

Here is BLM’s main web page with the program visible in their event calendar:

http://blacklivesmatter.com/events/

Here is the website for the program in Dubai

http://www.uvconsultants.com/youthempowerment/

Given that it is common knowledge Saudi and UAE state groups use educational programs as a way to radicalize youth and infect them with the Wahabbist ideology that breeds terrorism, what exactly is this program BLM is partnering with? Does it involve religious teaching? More research and demands for clarification from Black Lives Matter is needed to clarify that American youth are not intentionally being exposed to state agents who are radicalizing them.

It is worth remembering that George Soros funds Black Lives Matters:

Breitbart: https://archive.fo/MFLe6

The man who broke the Bank of England makes his money and gains control through sewing economic and political chaos. In fact, documents released by DC Leaks have proved he has used Black Lives Matter protests to further his agendas in the past. This current “educational” program and recent shifts towards extremist behavior should be alarming to many given what is known about the way he uses the organization:

The Free Thought Project: https://archive.fo/UGxST

#V. The United States government is either negligently ignoring these facts or factions within it are attempting to prevent action from being taken to deal with ISIS 

From what information is publicly available, ISIS or groups affiliated with them are creating and training paramilitary groups around the country, infiltrating American mosques to turn them into centers for radicalization and staging points for “lone wolf” style attacks and attempting to engage in recruitment and radicalization campaigns among American minority groups. It beggars belief that the United States government is not aware of these developments. In fact, Director Comey’s statement about ISIS’ presence in all 50 states implies that intelligence agencies do in fact know of this threat.

The State Department, who Wikileaks have revealed to have illegally helped Hillary Clinton delay the process of turning email records over to Congress, has tried to deny that ISIS operatives are present on the US southern border.

Fox News: http://archive.is/WoW91

Their claims that Judicial Watch’s reports are “unfounded” are in direct contradiction to their reports from over 10 years ago which describe Al Qaeda terrorists operating in and around Mexico in attempts to gain entry to the United States just as ISIS allegedly seeks to do now. And again, they do not explicitly deny the authenticity of the documents produced by Judicial Watch because this would legally land them in very hot water.

Other reports of government failure to tackle this apparent extremism exist as well. In 2016, the Daily Mail reported that the FBI had failed to inform American citizens that their names were present on a “kill list” of 15,000 potential targets complied by ISIS:

Daily Mail: https://archive.fo/Kf3lq

There are two conclusions to draw from incidents such as this. Either the US government and current administration is so hopelessly incompetent that they are unable to detect domestic and foreign threats which are discoverable by investigative journalists and whistleblower organizations. Or, there are factions within the United States government who are seeking to prevent competent, well-intentioned members of the intelligence community, law enforcement, and legislative/regulatory branches from taking action against ISIS operatives and extremist recruits who are active both on the American border as well as in the United States.

The fact that certain agencies and news groups have engaged in legalistic denials of reports about the growing ISIS threat to the United States certainly indicate that the latter might sadly be the case.

We are building it because open data helps people fight air inequality and no one else was building it. Ask Us Anything!","Hi Reddit!

Air inequality - the unequal access to clean air to breathe - is responsible for one out of every eight deaths in the world ([WHO, 2014](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/air-pollution/en/)). According to the [World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2016/09/08/air-pollution-deaths-cost-global-economy-225-billion), this equates to a loss of an estimated 5 trillion USD to the global economy each year. The impact of air pollution on human health and the economy is a massive injustice to our civilization. Meanwhile, we’ve seen from Bangkok to Los Angeles how meaningful access to air quality data can effectively arm communities to combat poor air quality. Yet, the injustice of air pollution is often compounded by the fact that such access to basic air quality data can be most difficult in the most polluted places. At the same time, many governments around the world, including in severely polluted places, publicly share air quality data - to the tune of 5-8 million data points per day - but in disparate and sometimes temporary forms.

The OpenAQ community ([openaq.org](https://openaq.org/)) noticed this a little over a year ago, and we decided to capture these data before they disappear and put them in a universal format for anyone to access in a highly available manner. We developed an open-source project (github.com/openaq), and so far have aggregated more than 30 million air quality data points from 42 countries. To date, journalists, public health researchers, policy analysts, low-cost sensor developers, users of satellite data, students, teachers, and others from 1461 cities in 119 countries have accessed our platform, and we receive roughly 500,000 requests each month to our API (docs.openaq.org). An open-source community has developed around the dataset, which has allowed the creation of apps, data-driven media articles, research, and open-source packages in R and python.

We are always seeking software developers, scientists, journalists and lovers of open data to jump in and join us in opening up the world's air quality data for everyone.

About us: 
Christa Hasenkopf, CEO/Co-Founder of OpenAQ: 
I'm a PhD atmospheric scientist who got distracted by the worlds of science policy &amp; international development for a few years at USAID and the US Department of State. Before that and along with Mongolian colleagues and an American software developer (who is also my husband, Joe Flasher :)), I launched the first air quality instrument to automatically share data via social media in Mongolia. This is where I first realized the power that even a little open air quality data can have in fighting air inequality.

Joe Flasher, Co-Founder of OpenAQ 
I’m Joe Flasher, co-founder and lead architect of the OpenAQ platform. I was trained as an astrophysicist but have been working in software development and open data in some capacity for around a decade. I have also shaken hands with someone who shook Carl Sagan’s hand.

Olaf Veerman, Development Seed
I’m the project lead of the OpenAQ project for the Phase I of the Open Science Prize at Development Seed. Besides doing open data work, I’ve lived throughout Latin America and worked with civil society organizations to create social impact through the use of technology.

I've since built that company into a multi-million dollar company and the redditors that followed are now doing a combined $50 million dollars per year! Updated case study and AMA.,"4 Years ago I wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/sblc6/from_an_idea_to_replacing_my_fulltime_salary_in_4/) about me making $4k per month and then turned it into a [case study](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/tltuy/day_26_from_zero_to_website_launcha_recap_of/) on how to build local service businesses. A couple hundred people from Reddit followed along to build companies and those companies now do a combined $50 million per year! 

If you want to start something in 2017, I've updated the case study a bit below.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: This is local service business.  Not sexy enough for most of you and that's fine. But I have not found a more predictable path to building a million dollar business than this and I’ve built [several](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2h1mlt/the_inner_workings_of_a_subscription_box_company/), [successful](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3r8hzo/so_were_now_over_2_million_per_year_in_combined/), [businesses](https://launch27.baremetrics.com/) so far.

**WHY LOCAL SERVICES?**   
Frankly, there is a TON of money to be made.  

These are huge markets in terms of $$$.  However, unlike regular e-commerce companies where you are competing with the best internet marketing people in the world, with local services you're competing with just the people in your neighborhood, most of whom do not understand internet marketing at all.

And on top of this we come with a crazy advantage with online booking that 99% of the companies don't have.  Imagine a store that sells simple things but for some reason nobody in the industry allows you to purchase online. Well a bunch of redditors are changing that in cities all around the world, and crushing it.

And that’s why we have been able to take such a big chunk out of the industry so quickly.   My goal is for this network to grow from $50 million a year to $1 billion in the next 5 years. I think it’s possible. 

A few screenshots from some of the folks that followed along...

When you add all the companies up,  it’s $50 million per year and most started less than 3 years ago. I have the raw data for that $50 million number btw, and we're working with someone from r/dataisbeautiful to go through it and create something to compare revenues, figure out growth rates, correlations with city sizes etc. Will make another post on that when it's done in a week or two.

This isn't just me saying this btw, the [fastest growing Ycombinator company](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/341229908078501890) (before they jacked it up) was also a home cleaning company.

Try to do just do one thing per day, even if it’s just reading an article, or it will get overwhelming. This is going to be a slow steady candle burning, not a quick passionate flash fire that burns out. Here goes:

**Sunday, Jan 1st, 2017**
That's today. Do nothing. Just chill, let the alcohol wear off, and relax.  The next 30 days will be sick!!!

**Monday Jan 2nd: Choose Your Industry**
Wake up, eat a good breakfast and get ready to crush 2017.  Choose one, listed here in order of likelihood of success in my opinion: Home cleaning, carpet cleaning, home painting, lawncare, laundry.  I've also seen people do well with mobile car detailing, dog walking, and others. Simple local services, but we'll be doing NONE of the actual work! I’m going to assume home cleaning for simplicity for this guide, but you can interchange that with almost any local service you can imagine.

**Saturday Jan 7th: Branding**  
Good looking people get more breaks in life. Same for good looking websites. Launch with a good looking brand that looks more like a startup than an old school company. The goal is to have the most professional site in your industry in your city. Just spend the day googling around for your service in your city and looking at their websites.

**Monday Jan 9th: Planning the website**
So we need to get a good looking site. Three choices:
1) Get a cheap wordpress theme and tweak it. 2) Buy a more expensive but [ready-to-go theme](http://demo.themestreet.net/launch27/index.html) that is already branded beautifully (if we do say so ourselves)  2) Most expensive: Get something built yourself. I personally like 99designs for homepage design and created a guide on how to get good outcomes there:  

Step 1: Setting up the contest: https://vimeo.com/147716915  
Step 2: Marketing the contest: https://vimeo.com/147716917

step 4: Managing the contest: https://vimeo.com/147716916  
Step 5: Wrapup and handover https://vimeo.com/147716914  
  
Bottom line is, I don't launch any projects with ugly design.

**Tuesday Jan 10th: Copywriting**  
You have to write engaging content for your website. For the top section make sure the customer knows where you do business: Things like “Premier Maid Service in Los Angeles” or “You Deserve a clean home in Nevada”. You get the gist.  The goal is casual and fun copywriting for the entire site. Watch this video on [our copywriting efforts](https://player.vimeo.com/video/169960700).

**Wednesday Jan 11th: Building Trust**

**Thursday Jan 12th: Pricing**  
We’re going for simple online booking, that's one of our major competitive advantages, so keep in mind we have to have a pricing structure that works. Here’s [something](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/slrip/day_9_pricing_mindset_layer_on_value_and_charge/) to read on pricing from the original case study.

Yep, it’s hard. 

One month of hard work, but in 30 days you can start making money instead of dreaming about that fancy mobile app that you’ve been planning out for the last 2 years!

COSTS:
Domain: $10  
Hosting: $10 per month  
Theme: $450 (website)  
Launch27: $59 per month  
From here on out if you can budget $300 per month for marketing it would be a win.  (That’s like eating out money and cable/cell phone bill )  

Core customers will come from: Yelp, Adwords (hire someone), Thumbtack, Craigslist, local seo, and others.  Will come back on February 1st to continue this if enough folks give it a shot.  

**BUILD SOMETHING IN 2017**  
At the end of the day build something! If not this, find something else. But there's no excuse to be hanging out in r/entrepreneur for years without working on something.

Makes no sense :-)

Knowing you guys really well, I know there are a ton of excuses you've already created for why this won't work. I wrote this: [The Top 12 Wantrepreneur excuses on how to get past them](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4ivuhb/the_top_12_wantrepreneur_bullshit_excuses_and_how/). 

Good luck and AMA

P.S. Want to add this as someone said I make it sound too easy.  Business is risky. Anyone that tells you otherwise has never started a business. It's incredibly difficult, subject to fail, will make you overweight sitting at a computer, will give you high blood pressure and anxiety if you're not careful, and it is incredibly difficult to find customers (and shoot sometimes even more difficult to have those customers pay you when you're done). Nothing about business is easy, otherwise EVERYBODY would be doing. It takes an almost insane person to take on trying to make it in the world with their own two hands and take on ALL the responsibility for the livelihoods of a lot of people. Just keeping it real! This is hard, but doable, because a ton of people have done it, but it's not for everyone by any means.  Not everyone is cut out for entrepreneurship to begin with and certainly not everyone is cut out for local services and dealing with human beings. Good luck.

David920,2016-12-29 21:30:50+00:00,My Resignation as a /r/Pokemon Moderator,"Hey /r/Pokemon!

I have been back and forth as of late about making the decision to resign from my position as a moderator of this subreddit, but I've finally come to the conclusion that it would be best for the team of moderators that I work with and for myself. My schedule in real life has become too busy to continue being a good moderator and I've realized it's time to start a new chapter in my life.

I was 14 years old when I began moderating this subreddit. Now that I am 18, I am in the process of moving from a small town in Ohio to the big city of Los Angeles to pursue my dream of film directing. I have also been cast in a couple musicals, currently working on filming a Documentary about how music impacts mental health diseases such as Alzheimer's, finishing recording my debut album and releasing it on Spotify/Band Camp, and I am also just trying to finish up my Senior year of High School.

I've had a seriously amazing 3 years moderating /r/Pokemon and I figured I would showcase some of the things that I've seen the community do!

________________________________________________________________

**[Team Blissey](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/3ktemv/rpokemons_first_charity_event_extra_life_team/)**



This is one of my favorite things I've seen the community do! I organized and headed Team Blissey. Team Blissey was an Extra Life game team, members would stream for 24 hours and raise money for Children's Hospitals. We raised over [$500.00](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/3rwj3r/go_team_blissey/) and it was a really, really special thing to see happen.

________________________________________________________________

**[The Justin Flynn AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/2nphhb/hi_im_pokemon_world_championships_commentator_and/)**

I managed to get in contact with Justin Flynn, Pokemon World Championships Commentator, through a friend from school who is one of Pokemon's top competitors. I asked Justin if he'd like to do an AMA and he said sure!

This was /r/Pokemon's first real AMA and it was a really great thing to get to see happen on the subreddit.

________________________________________________________________

[**/r/Pokemon Draws Pokemon**](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/38du2t/rpokemon_draws_pokemon_the_album_is_here/)

The community of /r/Pokemon came together and members of the community got individual Pokemon to draw. We completed the Pokedex together and it was seriously one of the coolest things I've seen!

________________________________________________________________

**Creating /r/upvoteexeggutor** 

On Halloween this year, we hosted a Purge event, allowing pretty much anything to go that day... and holy cow did you all come up with some crazy things. But the best thing that came from it was a crazy long Exeggutor meme that just kept extending his neck and eventually made it a subreddit. I still laugh about some of the backlash we got that day.

________________________________________________________________

**/r/PokemonTurfWars**

Now this one holds a truly special place in my heart. It's practically where I got started on Reddit. I remember reading a thread on /r/Pokemon about some one wanting to put together a Risk based Pokemon game through Pokemon Showdown and with the villain teams.

So people in the comments volunteered as leaders. I figured why not and volunteered! 

I was put in charge of Team Aqua, deeming myself Captain Archie. The people I met on my Team and the times we had truly brought us together as a family and they are moments I will never *ever* forget.  Team Aqua actually won Season 1 too, so that was neato!

I saw a moderation application for /r/Pokemon shortly after being in charge of Team Aqua and figured I'd go for it and the rest is history.

________________________________________________________________

I've seen this community do such incredible things. We've had members draw every single Pokemon in the Pokedex daily, I've seen songs made for the subreddit, and I've seen the community come together to do some really awesome things.

Thank you so much for the past three years, I would not trade them for anything. I'll still be around, just look for the Trainer Gold icon.

Here's to a great new chapter!
Signing off,

cinnajerry,2016-12-29 07:01:42+00:00,I think I was fired because I voted for Trump.,"I cinnajerry am writing this on behalf of my sister...

Hi everyone.  My name is Rina and I'm a Hispanic single mother living in California.  I'm hesitant about writing about this because I'm now back in the job market and I don't want this to reflect badly on me, but you know what, the truth needs to come out.

I live in Los Angeles and I was working as a temp-to-perm HR assistant for a community clinic.  Throughout the election process I refrained from speaking openly about who I was going to vote for.  The Chief Human Resources Officer and the entire office (~20 people give or take a few throughout the day) felt very comfortable speaking about their support for Hillary Clinton.  There was not one conservative (that I knew of) on the floor.  The day after the election the entire office was very salty.  People were angry, but I kept my vote to myself.  I stayed out of political conversations with these people because I knew I would be the odd man out.  That night my manager was invited to a ""wake"" for the ""death of the office of the Presidency"".  The only reason I knew about it is because the next day at work, the Chief Human Resources Officer came in with a much more cheerful demeanor.  She explained she felt this way because she had just attended the ""wake"".  She was so proud of all the protesters on the street and she also said she was ""ready to fight.""  Again I kept my mouth shut.  In the hallways, she kept chanting ""He's not my President.  He's not my President.""  Business proceeded as usual.  Later during the day I was in her office going over the tasks she was giving me as her HR assistant.  We were interrupted by the facilities manager who walked into her office.  My boss eagerly brought up the ""wake"" to the facilities manager happy to have another ear to sound off to.  She was proud of herself and started chanting ""He's not my President.."" again.  The facilities manager joined in and started saying something along the lines as, ""I can't believe he won.  I was in shock...""  At this point I was zoning them out.  Which is when facilities manager looked at me and said, ""We're not offending you are we?""  I was stunned.  She looked at me as if she KNEW who I voted for! I didn't know what to say except I knew I didn't want to lie so I said, ""No.  To each their own.""  The room got awkwardly silent and I looked at my boss and they both looked flabbergasted.  I nervously laughed and tried to lighten the mood by saying, ""I voted for Obama....""  At that point my boss told me that I just didn't know my history (I'm a Hispanic single mother) and apparently during the Great Depression Mexican American citizens were shipped on a bus back to Mexico without regard to citizenship.  So she felt that would happen again, and I responded with, ""I don't feel it will ever get that bad.""  I then explained my own position for why I voted for Trump.  I voted for the party that was in closer alignment with my morals and values.

She scoffed at me and said, ""We clearly have different values.  But you know what, we shouldn't be talking about politics anyway.""  I found her shutting me down to be extremely hypocritical, but I held my tongue.  She was the Chief Human Resources Officer, and I wanted to convert to permanent status.

The next week a new full-time non-temp HR assistant was hired into the department on their payroll while I was still a temp-to-perm.  For the next 3 weeks all of my duties were assigned to this new assistant.  My manager was also very cold to me.  She stopped talking to me.  Until finally after Christmas my temp agency recruiter called me and said my suspicions were correct...  and that my assignment was ended.  The reason for termination ""the position for HR assistant was eliminated"".  That was a lie because the girl that replaced me had a job title of HR assistant.

I don't even know why I'm writing this.  After talking to my brothers, they said I should post my story on here because I think it's fairly obvious I lost my job because I was dragged out of the closet as a Trump supporter!  January 20th 2017 can't come here fast enough.

VodkaInsipido,2016-12-27 21:47:35+00:00,Hip-hop and the LGBT community: a look back and a look ahead.,"I’m bad at starting texts. Like, real bad. I barely know how to introduce this post because this theme is really delicate. Plus, english isn’t my first language so I can fuck up. So instead, I'll show an interview that probably everyone already saw, but that is still important: [Kanye West talks homophobia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp45-dQvqPo). Why is it, in my opinion, so important? Because it is the way most of the homophobes get well, homophobic. Of course, a lot get taught since kids that being gay is a sin and a lot of terrible things, but this is the most common way. LGBT has always been treated differently, from how AIDS was treated to the segregation and the homophobia itself. For many people, being different is bad, and worth mocking up. 

And that is explained in Kanye’s words brilliantly: *‘Yo, you actin’ like a fag. Dog, you gay?’ And I used to deal with that when I was in high-school and it made me kind of like homophobic ’cause I would go back and question myself… if you see something and you don’t want to be that because there’s such a negative connotation toward it, you try to separate yourself from it so much that it made me homophobic by the time I was through high school. Anybody that was gay I was like, ‘Yo, get away from me.'’*. Law of the jungle, you bully or you get bullied. If you’re called a fag, you’ll have to prove you are not insulting others. You are going to tattle to any adult? Oh god, you must be such a fag. There’s not any other way to get out apart from saying calling out others. For that reason, whether you have any gay feeling or not, they are repressed deep into you, making homophobes.

**But, things have changed.**

Ok, the LGBT community is still really mocked up and there is still a lot of hate against them. But we are getting better and it is shown in how hip-hop, a subtly homophobic genre, is getting real talents from any part of LGBT.

One of the first cases of homophobia could’ve been in 1986, with the **Beastie Boys** and their debut album, considered an iconic classic for many people. Although this wasn’t really explicit, Licensed to Ill’s first title was *Don’t Be A Faggot*. 13 years later, Ad-Rock wrote a letter to *Time Out New York* to [*""formally apologize to the entire gay and lesbian community for the shitty and ignorant things we said on our first record""*](http://ew.com/article/1999/12/15/beastie-boys-apologize-past-homophobia/). Why the initial title didn’t work? Because Columbia didn’t want to: they wouldn’t release it under that name. Fantasizing about how this title would impact their career is really interesting: would it benefit them? Would it damage their reputation? Could it be a first case for many to come?


Another, even clearer moment of homophobia, was with **Will Smith**. In [Live at Union Square (November 1986)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51PAr0HosTw), the tenth song from *He’s the DJ, I’m the Rapper* shows an, in my opinion, disgusting lyric: *All the ugly people be quiet / All the filthy, stinky, nasty people be quiet / all the homeboys that got AIDS be quiet / all the girls out there that don't like guys be quiet*. Of course this line didn’t have a big impact, but what’s interesting is how it was so casual to say in a hip-hop song, a line that nowadays would make headlines if it was said from a big rapper like Drake, Kendrick Lamar or Kanye West. But in 2012 he changed of opinion, calling same sex marriage a brave act: [*“if anybody can find someone to love them and to help them through this difficult thing that we call life, I support that in any shape or form”*](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/05/15/will-smith-comes-out-for-marriage-for-gay-couples-to-support-obama/)*.


And even bigger rappers from the late 80’s and the early 90’s showed the stigma, like **Eazy-E**. On the second track from *Eazy-Duz-It*, [Nobody Move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHWHEtoqTF4), it’s revealed that the woman Eazy is about to rape is, indeed, a man: *The suspense was making me sick / She took her panties down and the bitch had a dick! / I said: ""Damn"", dropped the gat from my hand / (What I thought was a bitch, was nothing but a man) / Put the gat to his legs, all the way up his skirt / Because this is one faggot that I had to hurt*.


But even the most beloved groups can fall in the cliche of having to be homophobic. Even the most progressive ones, like **A Tribe Called Quest**. In [*Georgie Porgie*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyKcZb5LufE), a cut from *The Low End Theory* **Phife Dawg’s** verse is a clear example: *In the beginning there was Adam and Eve / But some try to make it look like Adam and Steve [...] But on the DL, getting done up the butt box / Oh my God how gross can one be / Well anyway, better him than me / Used to be down with the crew and had the girls that were def / Instead of staying to the right, he fell off to the left*. **Grand Puba follows**: *Even wore a dress and on his face he had swine / He cipher monkey cipher, you fucking faggot / Couldn't wait for gay parade so you can drag it / George used to flip, went from hitting skins to sucking nigga's dick / George better get a grip*. 

And at the end, **Q-Tip** final verse is homophobic from start to end, even him admitting it: *Now Georgie Porgie pudding pie / What made you choose the path of the gays, oh why / Ain't got no reason, to hell with alibis / Won't play basketball cause your nails ain't dry / Call me homophobic but I know it and you know it / You're filthy and funny to the utmost exponent / Never will I do that, disrespect my mommy / So run and hide your salami / Used to, didn't you, used to be my man / Instead of shaking, you're dragging your hand / Yes it's the Abstract the info provider / Here's your new name - the rump rider*.

A Tribe Called Quest redeemed themselves, too, this year. With [*We The People…*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO2Su3erRIA), **ATQC criticized Donald Trump’s thoughts** against minorities: blacks, mexicans, poor people, muslims and gays. Does this mean the time has changed their views? Probably. Hip-hop, as the whole world, has changed with the time. Nowadays, the LGBT community is viewed from most of the people as a normal collective, like any race or ethnicity. And as those, they’re integrated, or almost.



When you think of a modern, LGBT artist, the first one you could probably think of would be **Frank Ocean**. Frank’s story is a relatively known one: he was one of the first artists in this decade to come out being a R&amp;B artist, in a genre that was traditionally heterosexual. He was dropping hints from the start, like in **Odd Future’s** [*Oldie*](https://youtu.be/fzi24Nssiow): *I'm hi/high and I'm bye/bi, wait I mean I'm straight*. A little hint that now seems obvious but so subtle no one realized until *Channel ORANGE*. Less than a week before the release of his debut album, Frank wrote a letter that he later [posted on his personal Tumblr](http://frankocean.tumblr.com/post/26473798723), were he explained his first feelings towards a man at the age of 19: *4 summers ago, I met somebody. I was 19 years old. He was too. We spent that summer, and the summer after, together. [...] By the time I realized I was in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless. There was no escaping. No negotiating with the feeling. No choice. It was my first love, it changed my life. [...] Imagine being thrown from a plane. I wasn’t in a plane though. I was in a Nissan Maxima, the same car I packed up with bags and drove to Los Angeles in. I sat there and told my friend how I felt. I wept as the words left my mouth. I grieved for them, knowing I could never take them back for myself. He patted my back. He said kind things. He did his best, but he wouldn’t admit the same. He had to go back inside soon. It was late and his girlfriend was waiting for him upstairs.* A song about that man was written for *Channel ORANGE* too: [Forrest Gump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHyo82Zqx6U).


LGBT artists appeared in R&amp;B, but they also have appeared in hip-hop, like **Mykki Blanco**, a transgender rapper. Her first album, *Mykki*, was released precisely this year. She won some awards in her teens, even an scholarship to attend the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago*, but she later dropped after two semesters. Apart from her debut, there’s a lot of other material from her: *Mykki Blanco and the Mutant Angels*, *Betty Rubble: The Initiation* and *Spring / Summer 2014*, all EPs. But she also has two mixtapes, *Gay Dog Food* and *Cosmic Angel: The Illuminati Prince/ss*, both pretty explicit of her labels. This last mixtape was produced by another really interesting queer rapper, **Le1f**.


But not only there are queer rappers and singers out there, but also producers. **Kaytranada** is one of them. Being a pioneer in the SoundCloud scene, he came out publicly [in an interview](http://www.thefader.com/2016/04/05/kaytranada-album-interview-99-percent) with The Fader: *At home, his depression only escalated. One day, he got in a fight with his mom and his brother about “stupid shit,” and he ran down to the basement. “I knew what was wrong,” he says. “I knew why I was pissed off out of nowhere.” His older sister, who also lives at home, came down to console him. She found him in tears and started to cry, too. It was then that he told her a truth about himself, the root cause of his turmoil: he was gay. “I just snapped,” he says. “Something inside me was like, ‘Wake the fuck up.’ I felt like there were two people inside me. I was trying to be somebody I was not, and I was frustrated that people didn’t know who I was”*. This year he released his debut, *99,9%* featuring artists like Vic Mensa, Anderson .paak and Syd.


**Syd** is also an interesting case. Part of the band **The Internet**, she decided to come out as gay ([she hates the word lesbian by the way](http://www.laweekly.com/music/syd-the-kyd-on-odd-future-her-sexuality-and-why-she-hates-the-word-lesbian-2409072)) in the music video for [*Cocaine*](https://vimeo.com/31228243), one of the tracks from *Purple Naked Ladies*, The Internet’s debut album. And now she’s working in her solo album, too.


It should be necessary to talk about **Young Thug** too. Not gay, not bisexual, not trans, why then? Because of his thoughts on gender. [*Jeffery’s* cover](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cqv7GDjUEAEcDEN.jpg) was provocative because of what it meant: a man, concretely a rapper, wearing a dress. He could be named a lot of things, but specially transgender. For him it’s different: [*“In my world, you can be a gangsta with a dress or you can be a gangsta with baggy pants. I feel like there’s no such thing as gender”*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ymE6dUF98Y), he said in his Calvin Klein ad. His often provocative outfits prove it, like that time when he wore a [‘girl top’](http://yaadentertainment.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/15f172939f4bddc0803d01f52f2a98bc.600x600x1.jpg) or what he used [for the CK ad](http://static.vibe.com/files/2016/07/young-thug-womens-wear-640x801.png). In the traditional use of the word ‘thug’, a man who wears such extravagant clothes wouldn’t be a thug.

And as a final side note, there are a lot of famous rappers who are LGBT+, like the mentioned case of Kanye West, [A$AP Rocky](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/25/rapper-asap-rocky-gay-thing-hip-hop_n_2950676.html), [The Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90V7p0wh5nY), [Jay-Z](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZsItunLZDU), [Kid Cudi](https://twitter.com/KidCudi/status/742103011091054593) or [Vic Mensa](https://twitter.com/VicMensa/status/747199001494093825) just to name a few.



At the end of the day, hip-hop has changed as much as the rest of the planet. We are not yet in a world where the LGBT is fully integrated, there’s still a lot of hate towards them and look at countries like Saudi Arabia, where you can be killed just for what you like. But still, things have changed. AIDS is treated like a normal disease that anyone can get, not as a punishment to gays; same sex marriage is finally legal in most of the US and a lot of countries; everyday there are more people who can accept who they truly are. There might be a bright future ahead, both for music and for everyone.

A10A10A10,2016-12-22 23:08:44+00:00,Another version of myself has appeared...,"About an hour ago my wife received a text message.  I of course thought nothing of it at first, but then my wife looked at me with a strange expression on her face.  Then she looked back at her phone.  She asked “Did you have any problems on your flight?”

We were sitting in our living room, both with a glass of wine.  I had just gotten back from a week long business trip overseas.  “Yeah, there was some pretty bad turbulence” I told her.  This was an understatement.  It was the worst turbulence I had ever experienced.  And there were other really strange lights and colors and faint rumbling sound in the background.  It was overall a really creepy event that none of us on the flight fully understood.   There were even some discussions about taking a detour and landing in Los Angeles, which thankfully didn’t happen.  But I didn’t want to worry my wife with all that.

“Why, who texted?” I asked her.

“*You* did,” she responded.  She shrugged, “It says ‘*Flight problems.  Won’t be home tonight*'”.

I took my phone out and showed my wife “I didn’t send that.  My phone hasn’t been getting reception ever since I landed.  Was that really sent from my phone number?”

My wife quietly laughed and nodded.  This wasn’t scary yet for either of us.  But it would be.  “Should I text back?” she asked.

“Sure.  Why not.” I replied.  We were both smiling.

My wife spoke out loud what she was texting, “Well, you’re sitting right beside me.”  She clicked send.

Almost immediately she received a text back.  It just said, “Huh? Well, I’m here in Los Angeles.  Will be home tomorrow”.  My wife was still smiling.  I wasn’t any longer.  My phone number was texting my wife from the city where my flight almost detoured.

My wife started to notice the change in my tone.  “Oh come on,” she said, “it’s a glitch with the phone company or something.  You’re not really getting weirded out about this….”  but I cut her off.  

“Ask him to describe the person sitting beside him on the flight.” I told her.  

“Maybe we should just stop this and…”

I cut her off again, “Please just do it.”  She typed it in and sent it.  A moment later the reply came back.  My wife read “*Shaved head.  Beard.  Lots of piercings and tattoos*”.  I stood up and started pacing around the living room.  My wife was confused.  “Was that actually true?”  She asked?  

“Yes,” I replied, “that’s precisely who was sitting beside me”.  I was officially scared.   Then she received another text.  It asked, “*What book was he reading?*”

I tried hard to remember the name of the book the passenger beside me was reading, but I didn’t know.  It was a Tom Clancy novel though.  That I was sure of.  “Just write back ‘Tom Clancy’.”  I told my wife.  Neither of us was smiling any longer.  Neither of us was having fun.  This was starting to feel too real.  My wife typed in the message and sent it.

My wife asked me “You’re not really starting to believe this, are you?”  Just as I was starting to respond to her I was cut off by a sound.  The phone.  It was ringing.  It was ‘me’ that was calling.  My wife looked scared.  She asked “Should I answer it?”  I didn’t know what to say or do.  I shrugged.  It must have rung ten times before I finally told her yes.  She should answer.

My wife slowly clicked the answer button on her phone.  She slowly lifted it to her ear.  “Hello?” she said.  So quiet it was almost a whisper.  Then my wife’s eyes grew large in shock.  She stared at me.  Her face was turning pale.  I could see tears starting to develop.  “This is impossible.” She said.  She paused a few seconds.  Listening.  Then she said “No.” After a pause, she continued, “It’s true.”  She almost yelled the last part, hysteria creeping into her voice.  Then she said “Ok.”  

She looked up and slowly handed the phone over to me.  I raised the phone to my ear, and started saying “Hello”, but then I heard a familiar sound.  It was that thunderous rumbling sound again.  That I heard on the plane during the turbulence.  It was loud and piercing.  I couldn’t hear any voice.  It sounded like the white noise you hear when an old television was on a wrong channel.  It sounded like thunder.  It sounded like gears grinding together.  It sounded like all of those things.  It sounded like none of those things.  I started seeing the lights and colors again.  Just like on the plane. I couldn’t hold the phone any longer.  I dropped it on the floor.  

My wife looked at me confused. “Did you hear him?  It sounded just like you.  It was you.”  She was shaking in fright.

“I couldn’t hear him,” I told her, “it was muffled.  I don’t know *what* I heard.”

“What are you talking about?” she asked.  “That was you.  I know you.  I’m certain of it.”

The phone on the ground started ringing again.  Both of us just stared.  Neither of us answered. It must have rung for two minutes.  When it stopped, a text message appeared.  My wife picked it up and read it. “I have no idea what’s happening, but I’ll be home tomorrow at 2pm.”

The phone started ringing again.  My wife turned it off.  

It’s been about an hour.  My wife and I are trying to figure out what’s happening.  We have a day to try and make sense of it.    I’ve typed this up here and am asking for advice.  Has anyone out there heard of something like this?  I’ll be checking comments.  Then I’ll update tomorrow.  After 2pm.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT!!!

Ok.  I don’t know where to begin.  I think I have to accept it.  There is another version of myself in the world, and he’s currently at my house with my wife.   At the moment, I’m sitting in a hotel in Los Angeles.  My flight got detoured here.  Something really really strange happened. I came here to reddit to write about it.  And I saw this post... written by my own username.

Whatever that post is above me?  I didn’t write it.  It is my username.  A10A10A10.  That I can see.  But I can’t read the title of this story.  And I can’t read whatever is written above me.  It’s gibberish.  It’s not even written in characters I recognize.   Symbols that make absolutely no sense to me.    I’m going to copy the first line from whatever is above and paste it below.  

“About an hour ago my wife received a text message.  I of course thought nothing of it at first,”

Can anyone out there read that sentence?  To me, I still just see alien looking symbols.  And when I stare too long at the writing above, I start to hear a strange rumbling type sound.  A sound that I’ve heard twice before.  But I’ll get to that in a moment.

About my night…  My flight hit outrageous turbulence today.  I heard terrifying sounds and saw really bizarre colors.  When it finally ended, the pilot made the decision to alter the course and detour to Los Angeles. I really didn’t know what had happened.  I was disappointed.  I had been away for a week and I was anxious to get back home.

When I landed, I sent my wife a text message explaining the situation.  That I was in Los Angeles.  What she sent back seemed ridiculous. “Well, you’re sitting here beside me.”  It seemed out of her character to joke like that.  It really didn’t make sense.  I texted back that I was in Los Angeles.  And that’s when she sent a really strange reply.  She asked me to describe the passenger sitting beside me.  I didn’t get it, but I humored her.  How could I forget him?  He had a completely shaved head, a long beard, and at least 15 piercings.  I described him in a text message.  

Then I decided to play the game back.  I asked her what book the passenger was reading.  She replied immediately with “Tom Clancy”.  How did she know that?  How was that in any way possible?

I decided to give her a call and figure this out.  She answered the phone after many many rings and quietly said “hello?”  

I told her, “Hey, it’s me.  What is happening over there?”  

She stayed silent for a moment, then simply said, “This is impossible”.  I was getting annoyed.  I told her, “You can’t really be saying that I’m sitting there beside you.  If this is a joke, end it now.  It’s not funny. ”  

My wife quietly replied “No.”  But then almost yelled, “It’s true”.  I could tell she was getting really worked up and this wasn’t a joke.

I told her, “If someone’s really there, put him on the phone.”

And that’s when I heard those sounds again.  Almost like white noise.  Or thunder.  Or the rumbling of an earthquake.  I began seeing bright lights and colors.  And then it ended.

I tried calling back.  No answer.  I was really really confused.  I decided to just send a message saying the time I’ll be home tomorrow.  2pm.  I tried calling again, many times.  But I’m pretty sure my wife turned her phone off.  

So what the hell is going on?  Is there really another version of me?  Is he really with my wife right now?  Did he write the first part of this entry?  Why can’t I read it?  Will he be able to read what I’ve written?  

So many questions.  I’m not sure if I’ll ever find answers. I have no idea what will happen when I get home tomorrow at 2pm.  But if I live to tell the tale, I’ll be back with an update.

marisam7,2016-12-21 08:59:50+00:00,Islamophobic Myths Debunked,"#Myths about the proportion of Islamic Terrorist Attacks on U.S Soil

So I was on Facebook recently and saw a post claiming that, ""Islam has carried out more than 100,000 terrorist attacks against Americans since 9/11"" with no citations what so ever.

Looking at the Facebook group that posted this, I assumed from the fact their profile picture is a stock image of an interracial couple inside of a snipers crosshairs with the caption ***""Race mixing and Liberalism is a mental illness but we have the cure""*** that most people would be able to see this group isn't the most trustworthy source but despite that, the post had hundreds of upvotes and comments. Not from Neo-Nazis and White Supremacists but from average people.

I saw dozens of comments from people like Susan (*A retired school teacher and grandmother from Indiana*) who responded by talking about how the liberal media refuses to even acknowledge Muslims are a problem despite them killing thousands of Americans every day and how when Obama finally dies the Lord Jesus will send him to hell for him helping cover up the evil deeds of Muslims. 

Or people like Gary (*A small business owner and NRA member from South Carolina*) Who responded to the graph by making a long incoherent rant where he talked about how when he was a kid during Vietnam the liberals tried so hard to go after our soldiers calling them rapists and baby killers and just because they didn't like the methods didn't mean someone had to them and because they did what they did we won the war and the Vietnamese realized they could never take over America so they didn't try and bring the fight to the US. 

His post then goes on to argue that we need to put someone with balls in the White House who will let soldiers do what they did in Vietnam and when that happens the terrorism will stop. 

Now its very frighting that people like Gary who not only for some reason believe that the U.S won the Vietnam War (which they didn't) and who thinks that the Vietnamese wanted to take over the United States  (which they didn't) but also ontop of that thinks the reason the US won the war is because U.S soldiers raped women and murdered children and that if the U.S started committing war crimes again the terrorism would stop.

Ignoring the fact of how scary it is that a person like Gary is allowed to own firearms. And the fact that [U.S soldiers have raped and murdered children while deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmudiyah_rape_and_killings) The main thing I learned from this post is how people just making up numbers can incite hatred and violence.

I looked more into Facebook and found other lists that actually do go through all the Islamic terrorist attacks. Yet these lists will cite things like: 

&gt; **Nation of Islam member robbing a convenient store in 1975** 

as a terrorist attack. Or 

&gt; **Turkish man who was in prison for bank robbery in New York stabbing a prison guard in 1981** 

as an ""Islamic terrorist attack on law enforcement."" 

Going through these lists more, many of the examples they give just didn't happen. They will give a name or a description of an event or a location or a date and when I google the info I don't find any results for it being real or in many cases it did happen but the perpetrator wasn't even a Muslim.

Some of these lists all of which are poorly put together and without any real citations circulating on Facebook and other known Islamophobic websites have even been republished by actual news sources such as [WorldNetDaily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldNetDaily) to the response in the comment sections of paranoid delusional rants by people who use obscure biblical passages and sources of Islamic text to falsely claim Muslims truly worship Satan and Islam translate directly into ""the religion of the devil""

**So I decided to go through the list starting with the World Trade Center bombings in 1993 and create a coherent list of all the successful Islamic terrorist attacks which resulted in at least 1 death that occurred on US soil.** 

I found soon after that it didn't take long to make this list. Due to the fact that since 9/11 there have only been 9 successful Islamic terrorist attacks. 


1. 2016 Orlando Night Club Shooting	
1. 2015 San Bernardino Shooting	
1. 2015 Chattanooga, TN Military Shooting	 
1. 2014 Oklahoma Beheading	
1. 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing	
1. 2009 Little Rock Shooting	
1. 2009 Fort Hood Shooting	
1. 2006 Seattle Jewish Federation Shooting
1. 2002 Los Angeles Airport Shooting	

**Before 9/11**

1. 1993 World Trade Center bombing 

So in 15 years out of the 3.3 million Muslims in the United States only 11 of them have committed a terrorist attack. That means only 1 out of every 300,000 Muslims is a terrorist in the United States. 

**Looking more into this I decided to do the same research but on terrorist attacks committed by Right Wing Extremists in the same time frame to see how many terrorist attacks they committed which resulted in one or more casualties.** 

**I found they committed 45 successful terrorist attacks**

At this point I thought even though [you are 7 times more likely to be killed by a right wing extremist then a Muslim terrorist in the United States](http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/11/30/3725562/you-are-more-than-7-times-as-likely-to-be-killed-by-a-right-wing-extemist-than-by-muslim-terrorists/) and even though [Non-Muslims Carried Out More than 90% of All Terrorist Attacks in America.](http://www.globalresearch.ca/non-muslims-carried-out-more-than-90-of-all-terrorist-attacks-in-america/5333619)
This is just one country. 

So I decided to look at another country with a significantly higher per capita Muslim Population. Canada, which has well over a million Muslims who make up 3% of its population, and instead of doing a small 20 year timeline I decided to look into the entire history of the country to get the most accurate results.

* Number of terror attacks: 10

* Number of injuries: 100+

* Number of deaths: 0

**Sikh:**

* Number of terror attacks: 7

* Number of injuries: 6

* Number of deaths: 324

**Christian:** 

* Number of terror attacks: 7

* Number of deaths: 1

**Environmental:**

**So to put this into comparison there are half the number of followers of Sikhism in Canada than Islam.**

**Yet Sikhs have killed 162 times more people in the name of their religion than Islam has in Canada alone.**

Despite this, no one is calling for Sikhs to be deported like they calling for [the 37,402 Syrian Refugees in Canada to be.](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/refugees/welcome/) 



Now to the people out there saying, 

&gt; ***You only look at terrorism, what about all the other crimes muslims commit!***

#Well lets look at a few places around the world:

**The first place I'm going to look at is the city with the highest Muslim population in the United States,  Dearborn Michigan.** 

Dearborn has a population of around 100,000 people half of which are of Arab Decent.

[*Last year Dearborn had 3 murders and 35 rapes.*](http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/mi/dearborn/crime/)

**Lets look at other cities in the United States with the same population but instead of being populated by Muslims lets look at cities populated by White Christians.** 

Billings, Montana is a city with a population of around 100,000 people same as Dearborn. 90% of these people are white. 

And the city has such a small Muslim population that there isn't even a mosque in it. 


[*Last year Billings had 10 murders and 72 rapes*](http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/mt/billings/crime/)

Just in case that one example was an outlier I looked up a few cities with the same population as Dearborn to compare the crime rate:

City | Number of Murders 2015| Number of Rapes 2015
---|---|----
Dearborn MI | 3| 35
Sandy Springs GA| 6 | 40 
Pueblo CO | 10 | 152
Billings MT | 10| 72
West Palm Beach FL |15 | 45

I could keep going but I think you get the point. 

Dearborn Michigan despite having more Muslims living there than anywhere else in the US is below the average national crime rate.

[Dearborn  is 16% safer than the average city.](http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/mt/billings/crime/)

And statistically speaking 64% of the people reading this right now are more at risk where they are live currently than if they moved to Dearborn and surround themselves with Muslims.

Chances of being a victim of crime:

&gt; In Dearborn
1 in 275

&gt; In Michigan
1 in 234

But forget about the U.S lets look at cities outside of America. Last time we looked at Canada lets look at the U.K this time.

###**Birmingham has one of the largest Muslim populations in England.**

[One out of every 5 people in the city of Birmingham is a Muslim.](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html) 

It is one of the highest Muslim Populations in the country.

[Let's look at the crime rate there:](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/crime-statistics-for-birmingham-3217262)


City | Crime Rate Per 100 Residents
---|---
Birmingham | 5.15
UK Average | 6.57
London | 42.53

###But maybe that isn't good enough for you lets look at the rest of Europe:

**Amsterdam has been cited as having one of the largest Muslim populations in Europe. Pretty soon 20% of the city will be Muslims.** 

You would think this influx of immigrants would cause the crime rate to sky rocket right? 

I myself assumed it would when I was researching this and honestly was shocked to see news articles titled: 

&gt; [AMSTERDAM’S 2015 HOMICIDE FIGURES HIT RECORD LOW](http://www.nltimes.nl/2015/12/30/amsterdams-2015-homicide-figures-could-hit-record-low-point/) 

But the fact of the matter is its true that they did. 

* In 2015 there was 15 murders in Amsterdam 

* In 2013 there was 22 murders in Amsterdam

* In 1998 there was 65 murders Amsterdam

The higher the Muslim population has been getting in Amstredam the lower the murder rate gets.

&gt; ***But how can that be?!?! Multiculturalism is a failure just look at the rape rate in Sweden! What about all those Muslims raping children? I read about on Breitbart and Infowars!***


Many news headlines about Muslim refugees raping and killing people are fake. Infowars and Breitbart, in particular, have reported outright lies, such as the time they (along with many other right wing news outlets) reported the story about Syrian Muslim refugees gang raping a little girl in Idaho.""

[Local officials and police even had to have a press conference afterwards to explain not only did the story never happen but there aren't even any refugees who live in the entire county.](http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/state/idaho/article84829787.html)

[And no, none of the right wing news sites ever apologized for spreading false info or even redacted the stories. They still have them up on their site without even acknowledging it was proven to be false.](http://www.infowars.com/report-three-syrian-refugees-rape-little-girl-at-knifepoint-in-idaho/)

Reasons like this are probably why so many media watchdog groups and committees into the ethics of journalism have time and time again ranked Breitbart as one of the most dishonest journalist outlets ever created. And when I say ever created, they get a lower ranking than North Korean State Run Propaganda Media.

But for the stories that are true where it turns out a Muslim did kill someone or molest a child, even though these cases are rare they still do happen. The only thing the media never talks about is how they **happen at a lower rate than the native born population.** 

If you were to randomly pick 100,000 American Citizens born in the US and then pick 100,000 Americans originally born in other countries, [you would discover that that the number of immigrants who had committed crimes is lower than the number of native born Americans who committed crimes.](http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mythical-connection-between-immigrants-and-crime-1436916798) 

The same is true for Europe as well. [The Crime rate in Germany for instance is lower than it was 10 years ago according to police documents](http://www.dw.com/en/germany-has-become-safer/a-19444826) [and that is in part due to the fact that refugees are less likely to commit crimes then native born Germans. And out of the crimes they do commit less then 1% of them are sex crimes.](http://www.thelocal.de/20151113/police-refugees-commit-less-crimes-than-germans) 

The only difference when a Muslim refugee molests a child and when a Catholic Priest does the same thing. Is that when the Muslim does it you don't see the Catholic Church covering it up. 

[And Muslim groups aren't spending millions of Dollars to lobby against sex crime laws like Catholics groups are.](http://www.ibtimes.com/new-york-catholic-church-spent-2m-lobbying-against-child-sex-abuse-accountability-2376078)

But in response to common claims that multiculturalism is a failure because Sweden has the second highest rape rate on earth and allows refugees in I just want to remind everyone that the rape rate didn't sky rocket in Sweden after they started allowing refugees into the country. [The rape rate skyrocketed in 2005 when Sweden reformed its sex crime legislation to make the definition of rape much much wider. Ontop of that the Swedish police trained to improve the handling of rape cases which led to more victims coming forward to report assaults. This is why the rape rate appears to be so much higher than it is. Even though Criminologists say that the number of rapes that occur in the country aren't above average and surveys from The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights discovered that instead of being the rape capital of the world Sweden is actually below neighboring countries of Denmark and Finland in terms of the number of rapes.](http://2static2.fjcdn.com/comments/Inb4+quot+look+at+their+rape+levels+you+cuck+quot+_473d0e13a7742baf9aa976bb534e1457.jpg)

&gt; ***But the Qur'an is violent!***

Here are a few quotes:

&gt; ***""If a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father.  Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her.""***

&gt; ***""If within the city a man comes upon a maiden who is betrothed, and has relations with her, you shall bring them both out of the gate of the city and there stone them to death: the girl because she did not cry out for help though she was in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbors wife.""***

&gt; ***""You may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you.  You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land.  You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance.""*** 

&gt; ***""When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are.  If she does not please the man who bought her, he may allow her to be bought back again.  But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her.  And if the slave girl’s owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his daughter.  If he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his wife.""***

&gt; ***""If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.""***

&gt; ***“A man or a woman who is a medium or a necromancer shall surely be put to death. They shall be stoned with stones; their blood shall be upon them.”***

&gt; ***""If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you love, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, “Let us go and worship other gods” do not yield to them or listen to them. Show them no pity. Do not spare them or shield them. You must certainly put them to death. Your hand must be the first in putting them to death, and then the hands of all the people. Stone them to death, because they tried to turn you away.""***


* Punishing Women for Being Raped
* Promoting Sexual Slavery
* Stoning Gays
* Stoning Witches
* Murdering Infidels

**These seem like quotes from a barbaric stone age death cult right?**


Well you would be correct because **these quotes are from the Bible.** ^(The same book the Republicans and Trump want to use to govern the country.)

&gt; ***But the difference between Christians and Muslims is Christians don't follow those quotes and would never do that! They don't have child brides or commit honor killing or any of those evil Muslim things!***

Except they do. 

[In Christian Majority Mozambique women can be punished for being raped by being forced to marry their rapists and this is in accordance to the law.](http://allafrica.com/stories/201402270391.html)

[Christians in The Central African Republic execute more people every year for witchcraft in the name of Jesus than all the Muslims in the Middle East do according to the UN.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/centralafricanrepublic/12018588/Christian-militias-in-Central-African-Republic-burnt-witches-at-stake-says-UN-report.html) 

[40% of the marriages in Tanzinia involve child brides according to Human Rights Watch.](https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/12/09/ending-child-marriage-africa)

**And honor killings aren't even an Islamic specific concept.** 

[You can find many examples of cases where a Christian father beat his daughter to death with a metal bar because she wanted to marry her Muslim boyfriend.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/23/israel)

[Look at India. Where Hindu and Sikhs are some of the highest perpetrators of honor killings on earth today.](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/honour-killings-are-a-separate-horror/article8381779.ece) 

[Even in places like Brazil it was a big problem until recently. Men could be acquitted for murdering their wives up until 1991 on the basis of them disgracing their honor, and because of that you would see 800 recorded murder honor killings in a year. Even after the laws were changed, lower courts still ignored the ruling of the Supreme Court and acquitted people like Joao Lopes for a double homicide.](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/29/us/honor-killing-of-wives-is-outlawed-in-brazil.html)

&gt; ***But women in Somalia aren't allowed to drive***

The idea of showing the treatment of women in Somalia or other parts of the Middle East as proof that Islam is evil makes as much sense as showing the treatment of women in the Congo as proof that Christianity is evil.

Lets look at a Muslim nation that isn't torn by war as see how they treat women:

Kyrgyzstan is a landlocked country located in Central Asia with a population of 5 million people. In this country close to 9 out of every 10 people are Muslims.

In 2010 after large opposition protests caused the President to resign the Muslim majority population voted and elected [Roza Otunbayeva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roza_Otunbayeva) as the country's new leader. [Roza Otunbayeva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roza_Otunbayeva) is not only a woman but an atheist. 

Why is it that in Kyrgyzstan and Somalia they both read the same holy book ^(The Qur'an) but in one country an Atheist woman would be stoned and in the other elected president. 

It's probably the same reason why in both Italy and the Congo they read the same holy book ^(The Bible) but in one an Atheist woman would be stoned and in the other elected president. 

&gt; ***But still why is the Middle East so war torn to begin with? Why can't you get your stuff together and stop oppressing women?***

I wish you could post pictures on reddit but you can't so I'll just link them with a description:

[**Here is a picture of a Muslim woman named Benazir Bhutto she is the former Prime Minister of Pakistan.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benazir_Bhutto) 

[**Here is a picture from the 1970s of some women in Iran wearing Bikinis on a beach.**](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YNjvH23Aq7Q/VhgPqOxaaJI/AAAAAAAAL2A/B7xa-eTe8O0/s640/12.jpg)

[**Here is a picture of women in Afghanistan studying at Kabul University to become doctors in the 1980s.**](http://www.internationalist.org/afghanstudentswww.jpg) (40% of doctors in Afghanistan were female at the time. That's higher than the current presentage of female doctors in the United States today.)

[**Here are women in the Afgan Military posing with their weapons.**](http://www.internationalist.org/afghanwomensmilitiawww.jpg) (This is 30 years before women were allowed to have active combat roles in the United States Military.\)

And that’s not even getting into things like gay rights. [Like how Gay relationships were decriminalized in Jordan in 1951.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Jordan) (Two decades before the Gay Rights Movement in the U.S) 

That was around the same time that people like Alan Turing were being given prison sentences in the U.K for being gay. 

[And 100 years before that in 1858 Homosexuality was decriminalized in the Ottoman Empire.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_history_in_Turkey)

Or how in countries like Bahrain with a 99% Muslim population, when the people there are asked if they would be okay with having a gay neighbor or friend, [a higher percentage of them said yes. Than in the United States when pollsters asked the same question.](http://www.samuelwbennett.com/where-is-homosexuality-is-never-justifiable/) 

[Or if you actually did research into the famed Section 377 in the penal codes of countries like Malaysia, Singapore and India and Pakistan and Palestine that criminalized ""sodomy"" you can find that all of those laws were not only created by British Administrators during colonization since they had a much bigger problem with gays then any of the native Muslim or Hindu or Buddhist cultures ever did. But actually justified using the Bible and citing religious morality as the reason for the law.](http://www.lawyerscollective.org/vulnerable-communities/lgbt/section-377.html)  

&gt; ***So what changed? To make it the way it is today?***

* The same thing that changed Latin America to make it a violent cesspool of Drug Cartels.

* The same thing that changed Southeast Asia that allows the rise of anti-government rebels. 

**The United States government came into the region, destabilized it, overthrew their democratically elected leaders and replaced them with Islamic extremist dictators who would sell oil for a cheap price, and denounce the Soviets.**

The Middle East didn't even have Muslim countries before. Most were secular nations where people elected leaders. 

In Saudi Arabia the monarchy the country has is literally only 60 years old. They didn't have a King before that they had a President.

* [1953 Iranian coup d'état](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)

And this isn't like a conspiracy on the level of *""The US was responsible for 9/11.""* It is just a common fact. You can read about it on Wikipedia even. [The CIA openly backed and put the groups in power.](http://www.globalresearch.ca/a-timeline-of-cia-atrocities/5348804) They would [fund drug lords.

Remember that picture up there of those women fighting in the Afgan Army? 

At that point in the countries history the leader of Afghanistan liked the Russians a lot more than he liked the Americans. 

So you know the the CIA replaced him with? 

[The Taliban.](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/who-is-responsible-for-the-taliban)

Before these Coups there wasn't widespread terrorism. Look at Syria in 1948 and look at America. One of those countries had groups of religious extremists going around dragging people from their homes and lynching them solely because of their race. 

* Those religious extremists were the K.K.K and that country was America.

Look at Afghanistan in 1975 and look at Ireland. One of these countries had groups of paramilitary religious extremists kidnapping and murdering innocent people. Bombing hospitals and public places, killing dozens at a time. 

* Those religious extremists were the IRA and that country was Ireland.

There isn't even a counterpart to compare the groups to because none existed in these countries. No one was doing these things before the CIA got involved. 

&gt; ***But like you said the CIA did the same thing in Latin America and Africa and South East Asia. So why is it only Muslim countries who become terrorists? Why don't those countries have terrorism?***

* [In Myanmar Buddhist Terrorists have been targeting religious minorities and killing hundreds of them](http://world.time.com/2013/06/20/extremist-buddhist-monks-fight-oppression-with-violence/) Though they target all non-Buddists. They have been going after Muslims especially hard [massacring dozens in a single attack.](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/un-dozens-of-rohingya-muslims-massacred-by-buddhists-in-rakhine-burma/)

* In Israel there are unprovoked and well organized attacks by Jewish Terrorists. [Things like the Duma attacks which happened last year where a group of Jewish Terrorists decided to pick  a random Muslim home and firebombed it, killing an 18 month old child and two other people.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duma_arson_attack) Even outside of Israel in the United States groups like [The Jewish Defense League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Defense_League) are responsible for acts of terrorism. Whether it be the time they tried to assassinate a US congressman in 2001. Or the time [one of their members massacred 29 people.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_the_Patriarchs_massacre)  

* Hindu terrorism is so common that there is even a word for it. It's called Saffron terror. And not only are [there more Hindu extremists than Muslims.](http://scroll.in/article/718458/most-extremists-in-india-are-not-muslim-they-are-hindu) but [the Indian government considers Hindu Terrorists a much larger threat as well.](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Rahul-Gandhi-told-US-Hindu-extremists-are-a-bigger-threat-to-India/articleshow/7115703.cms)

* For Christian terrorists I could go on and on about this, pointing out examples of groups like The Lord's Resistance Army who are still active in Uganda and South Sudan and who are [still claiming child sex slaves in the name of Jesus.](https://www.rt.com/news/kony-children-sex-slavery-396/) But I'm going to try and put this into numbers. [ISIS has killed a total of 18,800 people \(almost all were other Muslims\) so far. According to the latest UN figures.](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isis-terror/isis-death-toll-18-800-killed-iraq-2-years-u-n499426)
In that same amount of time [Christian Terrorists in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have killed a total of 300,000.](https://www.hrw.org/africa/democratic-republic-congo)

**Christian terrorists in a single country kill 16 times more people than ISIS has world wide.** 

* Muslims make up 1% of the U.S population and commit 1 terrorist attack every 1.6 years. 

* [Christians make up 1% of India's population and are committing 800 terrorist attacks a year. 
It’s that simple.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Front_of_Tripura)

[According to the Global Terrorism Index:](http://economicsandpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Global-Terrorism-Index-2015.pdf) If you look at the top 50 countries with the most terrorism you would find. 

* 21 are Muslim majority countries.
* 20 are Christian majority countries.
* 3 are Buddhist majority countries. 
* 3 are Hindu majority countries. 
* 2 are Atheist majority countries. 
* 1 are Jewish majority countries.

That would mean 60% of the Muslim majority nations on earth **do not** rank in the top 50 countries for terrorism.   

Yet 100% of the top Hindu majority nations do.

It's that simple.

&gt; ***Why isn't the media talking about this?***

The short reasons is that there isn't any oil in the Congo or India so no one cares.

**But back to the main point of this post:**

#Islam isn't causing terrorism. 

* If it did, you would expect to see Muslims in Canada reading the Qur'an and bombing buildings

* You would expect that back in the 60s Syria would of had terrorists doing the exact same thing they are doing now.

* You would expect Muslims in Kyrgyzstan not voting for a woman as President.

* And most of all you would expect that if it did cause terrorism there would be more terrorism and violence in Muslim countries as opposed to the opposite which is the case if you compare Muslim communities in the west with non-Muslim communities and compare the Middle East with Christian Nations in Central Africa.
&gt; ***So what is the reason for terrorism then?***

The reason for terrorism is there being nothing to stop it.

If anyone has watched Walking Dead or Mad Max or any post apocalyptic movie then you understand the idea of those raving bands of killers and rapists going around doing whatever they want because there isn't anyone to stop them. 

Now if we put that into a real life scenario what happens is you get ISIS, you get the The Lord's Resistance Army and the Catholic Drug Lords in Honduras with their own Patron Saints and the Atheistic Rebels murdering missionaries in Thailand for being Christians and so on... 

&gt; ***But I heard that X% of Muslims want to murder infidels and kill innocent people? And force Islam on everyone.***

I've seen this a lot before. Anyone who is reading a poll that claims things like:

&gt; 80% of Muslim Americans told us they want to take over the country.

I urge you to actually find out who did this poll and look into their sample size and methodology because the weird thing is the people who are putting out these polls are always the same people. They are groups like [the Gatestone Institute which has been discredited time and time again as an Anti-Islamic propaganda mongerer.](http://www.alternet.org/investigations/one-americas-most-dangerous-think-tanks-spreading-islamophobic-hate-across-atlantic) They are people like [Frank Gaffney who was literally banned from all of the other conservative think tanks for being to racist and crazy even for them.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gaffney)

And always these polls are never Primary Sourced or Peer Reviewed. How about we look at some actually well established and cited polls.

**Here is one such example below:**

*Some people think that for the military to target and kill civilians is sometimes justified, while others think that kind of violence is never justified. Which is your opinion?*

 | Muslim | Protestant | Catholic | Jewish | Mormon | No religion/Atheist/Agnostic
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
Never justified | 78% | 38% | 39% | 43% | 33% | 56% | 
Sometimes justified | 21% | 58% | 58% | 52% | 64% | 43% | 
Depends | 0% | 0% | 2% | 3% | 3% | 0% | 

Keep in mind that the question was not asking about ""collateral damage"" but rather **targeting civilians**.

* http://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/njiym7x7nkuh2cnawawxka.gif

&gt;Gallup analysis suggests that one's religious identity and level of devotion have little to do with one's views about targeting civilians. According to the largest global study of its kind, covering 131 countries, it is human development and governance - not piety or culture - that are the strongest factors in explaining differences in how the public perceives this type of violence.

&gt;While the majority of world citizens agree that military attacks targeting civilians are never justified, a decade after 9/11, there is a wide range in the level of support for this view. A clear majority in Asia and MENA find military attacks against civilians unacceptable. This is not surprising considering the acute conflicts raging in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, and other parts of the Middle East.

&gt;In contrast, regionally, residents of the U.S. and Canada are most likely to say that military attacks against civilians are sometimes justified. **Americans are the most likely population in the world (49%) to believe military attacks targeting civilians is sometimes justified, followed by residents of Haiti and Israel (43%).**

* http://www.gallup.com/poll/157067/views-violence.aspx

One of the most cited anti-Muslim statics I see was made by Pew Forums in 2013. 

* https://believervsnonbelievers.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/gjpdwjjapa.jpg

This poll and many like it have been picked apart by numerous people for the lazy methodology and lack of diversity in the countries they poll.

And I could show those detailed arguments or compare the surveying they did to basically if a group of researchers went to a single small town in Texas and polled 10 people on social issues. Then used that to claim, “9 out of 10 Americans are against gay marriage.” but I’m just going to explain this in the exact terms of what happen.

[In 2013 Pew Forums](http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf) put out ads in the local newspapers in either a single city or either the top two or three largest cities in the country, for 39 different countries. These ads basically said, “Are you a poor Muslim and you wanna make 10$? Then come out to the offices of this survey polling company we subcontracted to get data for us and fill out forums for 6 hours then you can get your $10.”

And in each one of these countries between 500 and 1,500 people showed up for that 10$ and 4 hours into filling out the surveys when they got to the question on page 243 where it said, “Do you think all non Muslims should be killed? Yes or no?” around 1/3 of them just checked the yes box. 

That does not mean that 1/3 of all Muslims think the 6 billion non-Muslims alive should be killed. 

I find it especially ironic though that same people who are touting methodology like this to justify bigotry are the same people who try and debunk the surveys that claim 1/4 women have been victims of sexual assault as “feminist propaganda.”

Now if you do find polls that are well cited saying: 

&gt; X% of Muslims in this country want Sharia Law

Then the number would have to be pretty high to beat the number of Christians in the U.S that want Biblical Law.

[**Since 57% of Republicans want Christianity to be the national religion of The United States.**](http://www.politicususa.com/2015/02/25/57-republicans-dismantle-constitution-christianity-national-religion.html)

**-Edit-**

Looking more into disproportionate representation of Muslims I found that despite Muslims making up 23% of the worlds population [they account for 5 out of the past 12 Nobel Peace Prize winners.](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/) (Which is 42 percent.) 

Just a curious note on how Muslims are earning Nobel Prizes at twice the rate they proportionally should. ",islam,1896

Starfall_University,2016-12-19 03:21:00+00:00,(Spoilers Extended) GRRM Deserves a Lot of Credit for this Meta Decision,"Like many of you, I only discovered the ASOIAF book series because HBO, and David Benioff and D.B. Weiss in particular, created the TV show. Kudos to them and everything they've done to bring this fantastic slate of books to the masses.

But we need to give GRRM more credit here.

**Without GRRM's high standards for what became of his ASOIAF books, this phenomenon would not exist like it does today.**

*""Prove it, Starfall_University! Plus, that's a dumb screen name anyway! Just for that you hvae to double-prove it!""*

Very well.

##""Who is Jon Snow's Mother?""

Many of you are probably aware of the fact that some time in 2006 or so, GRRM sat down with D&amp;D over a big fancy lunch in Los Angeles and hashed out the potential of adapting the series, then at four books.

If not, here's the short version: https://youtu.be/-stnFeXb8sE?t=56

Basically, GRRM tested them to see if they were serious about these books. Were they really invested in it? Did they really read it with interest, and did they care enough about its central themes and mysteries to even know why Jon Snow's real mother might be an intriguing dilemma?

Apparently, they provided GRRM with the right answer, and they were off.

But that wasn't the first time GRRM considered selling the adaptation rights.

##Why GRRM Saying ""No"" Was the Best Thing to Happen to ASOIAF

According to Martin himself, when the books started selling well (particularly after the release of ASOS *and* the success of the Lord of the Rings trilogy), Hollywood came knocking. 

But they did not bear gifts. In fact, they came at him with a ton of bad ideas. [The first: they would film only the first movie, and after it was a hit, secure the budget for the rest](https://youtu.be/hIva5LzhPFE?t=2121). 

By this time, GRRM was jaded enough about Hollywood to know that a film A Game of Thrones would not be guaranteed enough success to fund an entire series. In his mind, it was just as likely that A Game of Thrones would be released...and that would be the end of it.

Hollywood had other ideas. [Film only the Jon Snow storyline to cut down the focus of the story for one film](https://youtu.be/hIva5LzhPFE?t=2148). Or film only Daenerys. 

Says GRRM,

&gt; That would be a good movie. That would be interesting, but it wouldn't be *my* story.

If I wrote a series of books that were a major hit, if Hollywood offered me a dump truck full of money just so I say ""yes"" to them making a movie and nothing else, I'm not sure how easy it would be to turn down the first offer.

That's basically a license to print money.

GRRM was in the position of knowing Hollywood *and* having managed his finances well enough that he *could* say no to the money these Hollywood types were offering. He could take the time to adequately test D&amp;D's dedication to the story. 

That discernment preserved ASOIAF for the only medium that made sense: modern TV.

##Thanks, George

it's not easy bringing ASOIAF to life, I'm sure, and I credit David &amp; Dan with taking years out of their respective lives to bring the story to life in an exciting, if not always entirely faithful, way.

But it's because George said ""no"" to those early cash grabs that we got the worldwide phenomenon that is ASOIAF.

No matter what you think of him for not finishing the books before the series wraps up, remember that *that* decision is the reason most of us are here in the first place.

Previously I worked in the FBI forensics Laboratory. Ask me anything about applying forensic science to investigations of bioweapons and other WMD acts of terrorism.","[ACS AMA](http://imgur.com/hoKm4RT)

Hi Reddit! I am Randall Murch, a Research Lead for Office of the Vice President, National Capital Region, and Professor of Practice, School of Public and International Affairs (http://www.spia.vt.edu/), at Virginia Tech (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University). I am based in Arlington, VA, not on our main campus in Blacksburg, VA.

I am in my second career at Virginia Tech. For my first career, I was a Special Agent and Senior Executive, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of Justice for nearly 23 years. I had field investigative assignments in Indianapolis, IN, Los Angeles, CA early on (primarily national security investigations) and then mid-career in New York, NY (technical operations). I also served in the FBI (Forensic) Laboratory for 10 years as: a forensic biologist (crime scenes, method development and validation, casework lab analysis, reporting, courtroom testimony, providing training), research scientist (human DNA analysis), department head (biological, chemical, materials, physical sciences, firearms and explosive devices) and deputy director for science in the FBI (Forensic) Laboratory. For ca. 8.5 years, I was assigned to various positions in the Technical Investigative Program: as a technical operations planning officer (FBI Headquarters), engineering technology development unit chief (Quantico, VA), technical operations squad supervisor (New York) and deputy division director (Quantico, VA). I led the forensic and technical support to many major terrorism investigations and special events while in the FBI. 

I retired from the FBI in November 2002 and then worked for a Government “think tank” for two years. I have been at Virginia Tech since December 2004. I have extensive knowledge and with the development and operational use of science and technology as it relates to law enforcement, and national, homeland and global security, including at the interfaces of science and technology, operations, policy and law, as well as strategic program development and implementation. I have spent much of the last 20 years focusing on major events, terrorism, and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) terrorism and proliferation. While in the FBI I led the creation of the first—ever WMD forensic investigative program, which originated in the FBI Laboratory in 1996 and now encompasses a number of Federal agencies, national laboratories, universities and companies and collaborates with foreign governments worldwide and has many aspects to it. While in the Government and since from the university, I have worked with many Federal agencies with a variety of missions, foreign governments, and international agencies. I have served on a number of advisory boards and committees, including at the U.S. National Academies (study committees and reports on: establishing homeland security science and technology; advancing life science and technology and impacts on national and global biosecurity; nuclear forensics; improving the U.S. forensic science system; and, defense programs related to chemical and biological defense).

Currently my research and program development interests include: biosecurity and counter-bioterrorism; chemical and biological defense (including biosurveillance); advancing forensics and attribution technology, operational capabilities and policy relating to WMD (mainly bio); advancing general forensic science and policy; and understanding and developing solutions at the intersection of biosecurity and cybersecurity.
I have a B.S. degree from the University of Puget Sound, Tacoma WA, a M.S. degree in Botanical Sciences from the University of Hawai’i at Manoa, and a PhD degree in Plant Pathology from the University of Illinois, Urbana – Champaign.

You can ask me anything about the technical investigative aspects of catastrophic and WMD terrorism (and how agencies work together for preparedness and response), forensics and attribution of biological weapons/bioterrorism/biological weapons proliferation (I know something about chemical, radiological and nuclear weapons/terrorism too), biodefense, biosecurity, how forensic science relates to investigations, prosecutions and exonerations, forensic science policy, and the current state of forensic science (and where improvements are needed).

""Not expected to change"" was a lie as i said! 

Also she says most of the 70,000 come from detroit area which is not Trump's strength.

Centipedes we need to be IN BATTLE MODE AND MAKE SURE TRUMP iS RECOUNTING STATES WHERE HILLARY WON. #alexjones #recount2016   . A partial state recount must be challenged and not allowed to change results.

This video has been  widely linked as ""chris wallace DESTROYS JILL STEIN"" . I am all for cheerleading but that is NOT what is important in what she says here. Whats important is she finally admits THESE RECOUNTS ABSOLUTELY COULD BE USED TO TRY CHANGE THE RESULTS.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdlX0Ubflz8

Its not a ""mindgame"" . Its a REAL ATTEMPT TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION BY CHANGING ONLY STATES THAT TRUMP WON .


MOST IMPORTANT.
If trump doesnt start recounts in states where hillary won he could lose.  

Even though recount deadlines have passed he needs to do what Jill Stein has done which is ignore state rules and go directly to federal and supreme court to argue that it is unconstitutional to change only some states with recounts and not recount the other states. In order to be able to do that it helps to lay a legal attempt out to begin that process so he can show he made efforts as soon as Steins unfair and unjustified efforts were wrongly allowed.


BUT TRUMP HAS TO START MAKING THAT ARGUMENT AND CLEARLY HE IS BEING POORLY SERVED BY HIS LAWYERS WHO DIDNT EVEN MAKE HIM AWARE THAT ON SATURDAY  jill stein did NOT drop the PA recount but instead was going to federal court to get it.  So Trump made a  incorrect tweet sunday morning saying she dropped it. His lawyersclearly eithe rwerent aware or didnt tell him what was happening even though it was clear from a simple google search (update this search google http://www.google.com/search?q=recount&amp;num=100&amp;tbs=qdr:w,sbd:1&amp;tbm=nws&amp;source=lnt&amp;sa=X&amp;dpr=2  )  every few minutes to stay informed)

WE NEED TO MAKE SURE TRUMP IS AWARE HE IS NOT BEING KEPT ON TOP OF THIS!


AND we need also need to research whether his election lawyers are too tied to the Bushs because some of these lawyers are Bushes old lawyers from 2000.

Bush lawyers cant be trusted.

Also Stein just got a court order at midnight sunday/monday http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/us-district-judge-approves-jill-steins-request-to-accelerate-michigan-recount  to start the michigan recount early at 12 noon Monday  


Also there are a lot of frankly suspicious people on THE_DONALD posting comments who keep trying to say we should slow down the trump battle train and not fight this and just relax.  

THE TRUMP BATTLE TRAIN DOES NOT SLOW DOWN AND DOES NOT RELAX AND DOESNT NOT LET THE ENEMY SNEAK ATTACK.


Also stein has  gone to federal court already on sunday about pennsylvania and  a ruling is expected Monday morning. Pa is NOT OVER  . STEIN DID  NOT DROP PENNSYLVANIA. SHE JUST MOVED TO FEDERAL COURT


And clint curtis has apparently filed for recount in florida by the deadline.  

Trump is ahead by 38 electorla votes.

Florida alone is 29 wisconsin is 10 i dont know michigan an d PA but any two or three of these could change the election results depending on court case results.


Trump MUST BE RECOUNTING IN STATES HILLARY WON AS A BACKUP!


The crooked media is being silent because they dont want Trump to see the big picture threat here and want him to not recount states hillary won and cheated like Virgina, Nevada, NH and  Colorado and Minnesota according to the flag officers as the video i posted a few days ago said.


And Trump needs to be inspecting the election voter lists in Los Angeles county - not for machines or counts but for illegal voters and maybe get the whole county thrown out. Or something.",The_Donald,2863

ThatParanoidPenguin,2016-11-27 20:30:17+00:00,"[DISCUSSION] I wrote up a list (with a lengthy description for each song) of the most overlooked, underrated, slept on tracks from the whole year of 2016. If you're looking for new music to listen to, please check this out.","Edit: [here's a Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/paranoidpenguinmusic/playlist/5BfnhZU5g3P4KMQqQXuRua) and an [Apple Music playlist](https://itunes.apple.com/us/playlist/hhh-2016-sleep-mix/idpl.994351cfc9d04213b3c84edb1ad6518c) (thanks /u/Thisisfischer) and a [Google Play Music playlist](https://play.google.com/music/playlist/AMaBXymdwGcQkAMONDbgJepnygA-XH36hilrFmwgZPC5R5Md-ixfG2M7OkSBxjlLD8PBexrDbxVbo3-Hk_IyC-8zwrbwIXyhpQ==) (thanks /u/Just8laze) and a [Tidal playlist](http://tidal.com/playlist/ab1fe86f-0a0d-41ed-93f7-6080c62884e5) (thanks /u/smoker05) and a [Deezer playlist!](https://www.deezer.com/playlist/2497321548?app_id=100023) (thanks /u/Jicmic)

There has been a lot of music to digest this year, and with a wealth of high-profile releases, it's almost impossible to listen to everything, and things get glossed over. Don't worry, I've got you covered. I've been making a playlist all year with songs from almost every hip hop release this year (there's a lot of stuff I missed, especially near the beginning, but I think there's a lot of good stuff in here that either was ignored on HHH or not even posted). Here's the absolute best songs I've heard that you probably haven't.

Roughly in chronological order:

[Daz Dillinger &amp;amp; Snoop Dogg - Have U Eva](https://youtube.com/watch?v=z7sfz5jcUDk)

It's unfortunate how mediocre this album ended up turning but, but there are a few good tracks. This one is pretty good, and probably has the best chorus out of anything on the album.

[Domo Genesis - Dapper (feat. Anderson .Paak)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=C_9HNEyLa4U)

Probably gonna be one of the most popular songs on this list, but I haven't seen anybody talk about it since it dropped. I've never really been a big fan of Domo but I heard this on a playlist one day and was surprised to see who it was. The album is pretty good, and I think this Odd Future rapper still has a career ahead of him.

[BROCKHAMPTON - Ben Carson](https://youtube.com/watch?v=jLwY3LR1Xqk)

This is Kevin Abstract's rap group, and they are massively underrated. All-American Trash is one of the best projects by anyone this year, as it's 13 straight top notch quality tracks, with a ton of variety in genre, and some seriously unique sounding songs. Ben Carson is the first one, and it's easily the most under-the-radar rap banger of 2016. The verses are crisp, insanely quotable, the beat is weird enough to defy convention, and the bass is something else. 

[Sir Michael Rocks - Kilo On Craigslist](https://youtube.com/watch?v=RDug40M_Ess)

I honestly haven't listened to Populair or Part 2 since they've dropped. Honestly, they're middling at best. But this track is probably my favorite cut off of both, it's just some really solid hip hop, and the ""kilo on Craigslist"" line is undeniably catchy.

[Royce Da 5'9 - Tabernacle](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4STstdvnMfU)

It's very arguable Layers should be on this list, as it's one of Royce's best in recent memory. But my personal favorite cut off the record is this strong Gospel-inspired stream-of-consciousness-esque fire. Definitely check out Layers as well, as it's a very strong track, with both Pusha T and Rick Ross delivering some great verses, and I struggled to figure out which one to include, but in the end the bars on here are so strong it's hard to deny it's spot.

[Snoop Dogg - Super Crip](https://youtube.com/watch?v=W60RPBvL7X4)

I'm trying to limit the artist count to one, but I consider groups as one separate artist, and besides, Snoop's a legend and this song is too good to be ignored. Snoop's output in the last few years has been back and forth, but there's always some gold on each project he's released. Last year's Bush blessed us with tracks like Peaches N Cream, and COOLAID is the same way. Super Crip sounds like classic Snoop, with an insanely good chorus. The instrumental is super catchy and each little background noise adds so much to the maximalist instrumentation. And when those drums kick in, it's undeniable that this song deserves to be on this list.

[De La Soul - Here in After (feat. Damon Albarn of Gorillaz)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OWpmWvJThkQ)

Yeah, it's another song that's pretty popular compared to the others. And the Anonymous Nobody... may not be the best hip hop album of 2016, but all around, it's an extremely enjoyable listen that serves as a full experience in the best way possible. The second-to-last track, may not be the best one, but it's such a smooth blending of De La's style and Albarn's instrumentation, I definitely had to choose it. The bridge that happens around the halfway mark is one of the most subtle and yet most impressive of the year, and as great as the outro after it is, I almost feel like this would make for a better closer to the album, because it's just so well done.

[Ka - Just](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Do2xXV2xrr0)

The Night's Gambit is undeniably one of the best hip hop albums of the last few years. That said, Honor Killed the Samurai is Ka's newest effort and it's almost as good as the 2013 record. ""Just"" is the lead single from the album, and it features a winding synth instrumental with Ka just spitting bars upon bars. He's one of the most lyrical rappers out there today, and has been providing the underground with impressive verses for years. Just is perhaps the most bombastic song on Honor Killed the Samurai, but that doesn't detract from its greatness.

[Iamsu! - Fly Guy (feat. Show Banga)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=YpuXjYTzx9Q)

Iamsu! might never have the fame he captured with Sage the Gemini on Gas Pedal, but that doesn't mean he has stopped serving us bangers. His 2016 album was mostly forgettable, but Fly Guy is one seriously high-energy testament to his ability to deliver hype. 

[GTA - Little Bit of This (feat. Vince Staples)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=qkxEKumTj08)

For some reason, unorthodox electronic producers and Vince Staples work together like bread and butter. His work with Flume and James Blake may be some of his best, and it's clear he's not gonna slow down with the features anytime soon. This time, he's collaborated with a Miami producer duo called GTA, and they're not just any EDM duo - GTA's album delivers with features from Iamsu!, Tunji Ige, and Tinashe, with their style incorporating the best of EDM while also avoiding a lot of the sounds that make the genre so stale. Little Bit of This features some seriously compelling percussion with a lot of great little sounds sprinkled throughout the whole thing, from sirens, to squealing tires, to a perfectly-timed frog croak before the chorus.

[Audio Push - Play Action (feat. Hit Boy)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=MbXp48Wcdbo)

Yes, these are the guys that did Teach Me How to Jerk. Yes, you should give them a chance. 90951 is the other zip code album, for those who are thinking of Jay Rock, and Play Action is easily the strongest track on the whole record. It's a dark, lowkey banger with some seriously sick lines (""Told my accountant I can not cut back on my spending, Checks clearing, used to shop on clearance, TJ Max"") and a drum pattern that makes the whole song. It's unsurprising that this album got zero attention but please give this one a listen, it's been one of my favorite songs to throw on repeat.

[Slaves - Consume or Be Consumed (feat. Mike D)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=05Q5akU8d7g)

No, this isn't the post-hardcore band under the same name. Instead, this is a punk duo from Kent, England. I saw them open for Wolf Alice (I believe? I don't really remember), and they were pretty good. I noticed their new album dropped and I was surprised to see a song with the one and only Mike D! The duo manage to deliver some pretty good verses, and while Mike D's verse is short, it's still dope.

[Apollo Brown &amp;amp; Skyzoo - Basquiat on the Draw (feat. WestSideGunn &amp;amp; Conway)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_CzqgDd5Ivc)

Armed with a Jay Z sample (From Rick Ross' 3 Kings), Basquiat on the Draw delivers some classic hip hop (it's good to hear scratching again!) from Apollo Brown and Skyzoo. WestSideGunn and Conway deliver some fire verses also, and what more is there to say? There's also a sample of Basquiat interview that really adds to the track, and I would just say give this one a listen.

[DJ Mustard - Been A Long Time (feat. YG &amp;amp; Ty Dolla $ign)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=uAwqMBbaWnQ)

I'm sure we're all pretty tired of DJ Mustard (I know I am), but he released an album this year, and it's pretty solid. The opening track, Been A Long Time, is nothing short of a banger, and the trio delivers some serious chemistry. It's one of the only songs I keep finding myself revisiting on this album, because it's just so replayable.

[SiR - Cadillac Dreams (feat. Big K.R.I.T.)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=DPeJRzqvK1I)

The whole world still sleeps on KRIT, unsurprisingly, but he keeps on delivering the fire. Cadillac Dreams is a collaboration with California R&amp;amp;B singer SiR, and the result is buttery smooth. SiR is definitely one to watch out for, as he lies somewhere between the convention and perfect of Anderson .Paak and the experimentation and oddity of Lance Skiiiwalker. KRIT comes in at the end and does his thing and the whole world is better for it.

[Swet Shop Boys - Shottin](https://soundcloud.com/i-d-online-1/premiere-swet-shop-boys-shottin-1)

Swet Shop Boys is Heems' side project with MC Riz and Redinho, and their newest effort, Cashmere, is a seriously great album lost in a sea of seriously great releases. On Shottin, political bars are delivered over a pushy beat, and you're really unsure if you should dance or ponder, especially with lines like ""I'm from cop-killer Queens, kill a cop and it's fine, I read pigs are haram in the book that's divine"". Either way, it's a hell of a song.

[Emeli Sandé - Garden (feat. Jay Electronica &amp;amp; Áine Zion)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=garBZwVW2K8)

It's a pop/R&amp;amp;B song, but Emeli Sandé joins the echelon of high class and quality singers like Tinashe and Janelle Monáe. On Garden, she enlists the help of legendary hide-and-seek (lmao) rapper, Jay Electronica. You spend the whole song waiting for his appearance, and that's great, but I'll be damned if the rest of the song isn't extremely strong as well. It's probably the best R&amp;amp;B singer &amp;amp; rapper collab this year besides Alicia Keys' Blended Family with A$AP Rocky.

[E-40 - On One (feat. AD)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=u-6sSu88Aas)

In case you didn't know, E-40 dropped a 42 track double album a few weeks ago, and it's long as hell but oh god is it fire. On One is a single from the second half, and it's absolute fire. Seriously. E-40 brings the hype, and it's impossible to deny the energy this guy has despite nearing the age of 50. The chorus is one of my favorites of the year, and the beat is just insane. Definitely check out this and the whole project, there's features from Jay Rock, Gucci Mane, and more.

[Lance Skiiiwalker - Could It Be](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M1bW8SJrSxc)

It's hard to put a song from a TDE signee on this list, but I gotta say, the deep cuts on this album have been pretty slept on. Could It Be is a dark, gloomy track that takes a sudden final shift halfway through that shouldn't work, but just does. Lance is all over the place, but it's in a good way, and in the second half, he's pretty much only accompanied by layered background vocals and a constant drum beat, closing the song with those vocals cutting off.

[Jay Prince - Father, Father](https://soundcloud.com/jayprincemusic/father-father)

Following in the footsteps and inspiration of singy-songy rappers like Goldlink, Jay Prince delivers it with a twist - over some classic looped soul production. The opening unraveling into the loop that's used throughout the track is pretty magical, and the accompanying piano is dissonant yet positive. And when the chorus finally kicks in, it's just bliss. 

[Owen Bones - Where On Earth (feat. The Cool Kids)](https://soundcloud.com/owenbones/where-on-earth-feat-the-cool-kids)

Before I write this, I gotta say you seriously gotta check out this guy's album Dive Club. There's some killer features over his signature light industrial style, and the whole thing is just phenomenal. At least check out the track Mach One with Tunji Ige &amp;amp; lil aaron or Narcosis with Saba. As for the track, it's amazing to hear The Cool Kids again, and they fit perfectly on this darker track. The decision to cut the track in half and shock the listener with the next verse is a smart one, and the production is normal enough for casual listening but reveals a lot of you take the time to dissect it.

[Tkay Maidza - Carry On (feat. Killer Mike)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=qeiIvureL-k)

Yeah, it's another pop song. However, the Australian singer tries her own at rapping alongside hip hop legend Killer Mike, and the result is pretty great. Her vocal style is a marriage of something like Charli XCX and M.I.A, while also retaining her own identity. Killer Mike delivers a short verse, but it breaks up the song and it's definitely welcome. All in all, it bangs, and that's what matters.

[lil aaron - 4 MORE DRINKS/PINK FENTY SLIDES](https://soundcloud.com/lilaaron911/4-more-drinks-pink-fenty-slides)

A two part song with one of the best beat switches of the year, 4 MORE DRINKS/PINK FENTY SLIDES is the epitome of what lil aaron stands for: Drugs, drinks, and girls. If that sounds familiar, I'm not surprised. However, this album and song are anything but familiar - the Los Angeles rapper has taken the druggy auto tuned style of Travi$ Scott and turned up the rock to 11, and the result is something that's at the least fascinating, and at the best, the absolute next best thing. Heavy in atmosphere, 4 MORE DRINKS is doused in braggadocio self-aware self-loathing (""I'd rather kill myself than ever go back home"") over a classic drum pattern laced with some signature Travi$ guitars and some wobbly synths. PINK FENTY SLIDES, however, kicks in, and the synths are bursting to the max. Then, the drums come, and momentum is turned up, and the wobbly synth appears from the first half, and the song finishes how it started, with the roar of an engine.

[Z-Ro - I Can (fear. Mike D)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ioulERkTWVY)

""My neighbors are white but I act like I still live in the hood, They say I shouldn't ball so much, but I feel like I should"" is the perfect summary of this song. Z-Ro is back with a project called Legendary, and while the album itself may not be legendary (it's still pretty good though), this song is almost there. With another impromptu and brief feature from Mike D, Z-Ro delivers some fire. 

[KXNG Crooked - Dem People (feat. Xzibit &amp;amp; SAS)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=k98G_GrPvcI)

KXNG Crooked dropped two albums in 2016, and this song is from the second one. Beginning with a bouncy yet hard instrumental, you know you're in for a treat, and yes does it hit hard. Contrasting Crooked and Xzibit's spoken word bridge with SAS' smooth singing, it's a hell of a track. ""You probably think you're walking through a zombie apocalypse, Imma be a tour guide here, grab these binoculars"", KXNG raps over this surprisingly political track.

[december. - ILLEGAL](https://soundcloud.com/december1025/illegal)

SoundCloud rappers Matt McGhee and Miles Meraki are ""december."", and while it sounds like standard SoundCloud fare, there's something about this track that keeps me coming back. Maybe it's the infectious chorus (""that's illegal!""), maybe it's the hard-hitting instrumental, maybe it's the way each rapper rides on the beat.  I still can't figure it out, but like the album cover shows, it encapsulates that blur of night driving, perhaps doing some stuff that's slightly illegal.

[Adam Vida - I'm Juiced (Tommy Pickles)](https://soundcloud.com/adamraps/juiced-prod-mr-carmack)

Here's a hot take: you're gonna hear this everywhere. Joining the ranks of rappers like Aminé defining the new wave of party rock, Adam Vida drops some lighthearted yet hard bars over a simple yet infectious beat, and absolutely kills the chorus. It's poppy yet veteran, and his brand of rap should attract both casual listeners and longtime hip hop fans.

[Kevin Abstract - Papercut](https://youtube.com/watch?v=YoTJY4U1H60)

Another semi-popular song, but I think it needs to be heard. I had a hard time figuring out which Kevin Abstract song I would pick, because his debut album, American Boyfriend: A Suburban Love Story, is brimming to the rim with good ones. Papercut is perhaps one of the best example of his style and defiance of genre, and it's one of the album's standout tracks. It's more on the hip hop side than most songs on the album, yet it retains a deep rooting in indie and pop music, especially near the end. Whatever genre it is, it's lines like ""The hardest part of my day is wishing I was fucking straight"", that provide a somber recollection of the past as Abstract struggles with living as a bisexual.

I put together a list of 25 rivalry games that all fans should enjoy with descriptions and videos for each game. Hope you all enjoy!","Hey everyone! Last week I asked /r/CFB if anyone would be interested in a post dedicated to 25 individual rivalry games that all fans should watch, [which can be found here.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/5do1gx/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_rivalry_week_post/) After a positive response, I decided to launch the project.

Each game will feature the names of the schools involved, location &amp; date of game, name of rivalry (if applicable), name of trophy (if applicable), a short description of the match-up with some background info, and a video link. Please note that these games are not ranked in any particular manner, and I did my best to include as many different rivalries as I could in order to avoid any kind of favoritism. I hope you enjoy and find this to be a great addition to your Rivalry/Hate Week schedule!

**The Kick Six**

[Alabama](#f/alabama) Alabama Crimson Tide vs. [Auburn](#f/auburn) Auburn Tigers

*November 30, 2013, Jordan–Hare Stadium, ""The Iron Bowl""* 	[Iron Bowl](#f/ironbowl-sheetl-row18-col07)

The 78th meeting between Alabama and Auburn featured a Top 5 contest, an outright SEC West title, and bragging rights between two foes. The two time defending national champion and AP number 1 ranked Crimson Tide opened as a 10 point favorite against the 4 ranked Tigers. Both teams lived up to the hype and battled in a heavily contested match. After Auburn tied the game with 32 seconds remaining, Alabama managed to move the ball down field to attempt a 57-yard field goal. What transpired was one of the most miraculous and utterly shocking endings to a game in the entire history of college football.

**The Choke at Doak**

[Florida State](#f/floridastate) Florida State Seminoles vs. [Florida](#f/florida) Florida Gators

*November 26, 1994, Doak Campbell Stadium, Trophy: The Florida Cup* 	[Florida Cup](#f/floridacup-sheetl-row19-col08)

Led by future Heisman Trophy winning quarterback, Danny Wuerffel, the number 4 ranked Florida Gators looked to crush their cross-state rival, defending national champion, and the number 7 ranked team in the country, Florida State, at home to close out the 1994 regular season. Both teams entered the contest with a 9-1 overall record with national title aspirations on the line. As the game unfolded, it looked as though Florida would cruise to an easy 28 point victory. Though, not everything is written in stone in college football. The Noles rallied and wiped away the deficit to end the game in a 31-31 tie.

**The Game of the Century**

[Nebraska](#f/nebraska) Nebraska Cornhuskers vs. [Oklahoma](#f/oklahoma) Oklahoma Sooners

*November 25, 1971, Owen Field, ""The Game of the Century""* [Game of the Century Classic](#f/gameofthecentury-sheetl-row19-col09)

There may not have been a more appropriate name for the 51st meeting between Nebraska and Oklahoma. Heading into the Thanksgiving clash, the Cornhuskers enjoyed a 20 game win streak and the number 1 overall ranking. Meanwhile, the Sooners boasted an equally impressive undefeated 9-0 record and the number 2 overall ranking. To give you an idea of how important this game was, the ABC broadcast had 55 million viewers, which at the time was the largest television audience ever for a college football game.

**Divine Intervention**

[BYU](#f/byu) BYU Cougars vs. [Utah](#f/utah) Utah Utes

*September 15, 2012, Rice-Eccles Stadium, ""The Holy War""* 	

The 2012 contest between the Cougars and Utes finished in what can only be described accurately as ""bizarre."" Facing a 17 point deficit heading into the 4th quarter, BYU found themselves in a hole. However, the Cougars managed to rally to bring the game within 3 points with less than 4 minutes remaining. From there, both teams learned that a lot can happen in the final seconds of a game, including: fans storming the field, missed game winning field goals, and potential game ending penalties.

**The Juice is Loose**

[UCLA](#f/ucla) UCLA Bruins vs. [USC](#f/usc) USC Trojans

*November 18, 1967, Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Trophy: The Victory Bell* [Victory Bell](#f/victorybell-sheetl-row17-col11)

Our second match-up of the list dubbed ""Game of the Century,"" the 1967 game between UCLA and USC contained a mountain of excitement. Led by senior quarterback and Heisman Trophy candidate, Gary Beban, the 7-0-1  and number 1 ranked Bruins looked to conquer their Trojan foes. With a Hesiman Trophy candidate of their own, number 4 USC turned to star running back OJ Simpson for support. While both teams played well, it was OJ and the Trojans that would deliver the killing blow in the form of an iconic 64-yard touchdown run.

**An Egg-cellent Ending**

[Ole Miss](#f/olemiss) Ole Miss Rebels vs. [Mississippi State](#f/mississippistate) Mississippi State Bulldogs 

*November 18, 2013, Davis Wade Stadium, ""The Egg Bowl,"" Trophy: The Golden Egg* 	[Egg Bowl](#f/eggbowl-sheetl-row18-col05)

In the 2013 Egg Bowl, Mississippi State looked to knock off their in-state rival despite a key loss. Their starting quarterback, Dak Prescott, was unexpected to play and ruled out after suffering an injury earlier in the month against Texas A&amp;M. After trailing 10-3 late in the game, Dak was called in to play despite his injury and missing the first 3 quarters of the game. With less than 11 minutes remaining in the 4th, Prescott orchestrated a 13-play 59-yard TD drive to tie the game with 2:20 remaining. From there, the magic of overtime took over.

**The Play**

[Stanford](#f/stanford) Stanford Cardinal vs. [California](#f/california) California Golden Bears

*November 20, 1982, California Memorial Stadium. ""The Big Game,"" Trophy: The Axe* 	[The Axe](#f/axe-sheetl-row17-col10)

Joining the Kick Six as the second miracle finish of the list, The Play was the final desperate act of the 1982 meeting between the Stanford Cardinal and the California Golden Bears. After leading his team down the field to set up a field goal to take the lead late in the game Stanford quarterback, John Elway, called timeout with 8 seconds remaining in the contest. Placekicker Mark Harmon then nailed a 35-yard kick to put Stanford up 20-19 with 4 seconds to go. However, Stanford would soon painfully learn that 4 seconds is more than enough time for lightning to strike in the game of football.

[South Carolina](#f/southcarolina) South Carolina Gamecocks vs. [Clemson](#f/clemson) Clemson Tigers

*November 19, 1977, Williams-Brice Stadium, ""The Palmetto Bowl""* 	[Palmetto Bowl](#f/palmettobowl-sheetl-row19-col15)

At first, the 1977 South Carolina-Clemson game looked to be a snooze-fest. With a commanding 24-0 lead late into the 3rd quarter, the Tigers appeared well on their way to victory against the Gamecocks. Suddenly, South Carolina's offense exploded to score 27 consecutive unanswered points to take a 27-24 lead with less than two minutes remaining. The come-back seemed complete, but Clemson had other plans.

**Bo Beats the Buckeyes**

[Ohio State](#f/ohiostate) Ohio State Buckeyes vs. [Michigan](#f/michigan) Michigan Wolverines 

*November 22, 1969, Michigan Stadium, ""The Game""* [The Game](#f/thegame-sheetl-row16-col21)

In 1968, the Ohio State Buckeyes pummeled their arch rival, the Michigan Wolverines, into the ground in Columbus 50-14.  When Ohio State scored late in the game to make it 48-14, head coach Woody Hayes sent out his offense to go for an additional 2 points, which the Buckeyes converted. When asked why after the game, Woody famously said, ""Because they wouldn't let me go for three."" The following season, one of his former assistant coaches, Bo Schembechler, took the head coaching job at the University of Michigan and looked to avenge the embarrassment from the year before at the hands of Ohio State. Remarkably, Bo led the Wolverines to a highly improbable upset against the Buckeyes and one of Woody Hayes' best teams ever. This win is widely regarded as the defining moment and beginning of the ""Ten Year War"" between Woody and Bo in the Michigan-Ohio State rivalry.

**The Bush Push**

[USC](#f/usc) USC Trojans vs. [Notre Dame](#f/notredame) Notre Dame Fighting Irish 	

*October 15, 2005, Notre Dame Stadium, Trophy: The Jeweled Shillelagh* [Jeweled Shillelagh](#f/jeweledshillelagh-sheetl-row17-col06)

During the early part of the 21st century, the USC Trojans dominated the college football landscape. Going into the 2005 game vs Notre Dame, USC had a 27 game winning streak and was the number 1 overall team in the country. Not to be outdone, the Irish were ranked 9 and had home field advantage. After a long and grueling game on prime time, the Trojans found themselves on the ropes late in the game. With time ticking down USC quarterback, Matt Leinart, scrambled to get out of bounds and fumbled the ball in the process. As the ball flew out of the field of play, the stadium time keeper mistakenly let the clock run and fooled the Notre Dame student section into rushing the field having believed the game was won. After the officials cleared the mistake, 7 seconds were put back on the clock and future Heisman Trophy winner, Reggie Bush, helped the Trojans quarterback to pay dirt.

**Bulldogs Feel the Ramblin' Wreck**

*November 29, 2014, Sanford Stadium, ""Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate"", Trophy: The Governor's Cup* 	[Governor's Cup](#f/governorscup-sheetl-row19-col10)

Looking to represent the ACC Coastal Division in the ACC Championship Game, the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets had to first overcome a difficult obstacle. Standing in their way was their greatest nemesis, the Georgia Bulldogs, a team that proudly boasted a 6 year win streak against the Yellow Jackets. The game was a back and forth slug-fest and came down to two consecutive clutch drives by each team. The first by the Bulldogs in the final minutes to take the lead, and the second by the Yellow Jackets to tie on a clutch 53-yard field goal. In the end, it would be Georgia Tech's time to prevail.

*December 2, 1944, Municipal Stadium, ""Army-Navy Game""* 	[Army-Navy](#f/armynavy-sheetl-row21-col02)

While the country was occupied fighting the Axis powers during the Second World War, the football teams for the United States Military Academy and the United States Naval Academy looked to do battle on the gridiron. In 1944, Army and Navy met for their annual showdown in Baltimore ranked as the number 1 and number 2 teams in the nation. While Army won the contest 23-7, the game demonstrated both the height of each school's football programs, and the pride of the country they served.

[Wisconsin](#f/wisconsin) Wisconsin Badgers vs. [Minnesota](#f/minnesota) Minnesota Golden Gophers 

*October 15, 2005, Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, Trophy: Paul Bunyan's Axe* 	[Paul Bunyan's Axe](#f/paulbunyansaxe-sheetl-row16-col18)

Before the legendary ending to the 2015 Michigan-Michigan State game where the Spartans blocked a punt in the final seconds to complete a miraculous victory over the Wolverines, there was the 2005 Minnesota-Wisconsin game. 22 ranked Minnesota had a 34-31 lead with 38 seconds remaining when they sent their punter, Justin Kucek, out to punt the ball away on 4th and 1. The 23 ranked Badgers needed a break out play on special teams to set up a potential game winning drive. Instead, Kucek made an awful mistake, and the punt block team took advantage.

**War for the Roses**

[Oregon State](#f/oregonstate) Oregon State Beavers vs. [Oregon](#f/oregon) Oregon Ducks

*November 16, 2009, Autzen Stadium, ""The Civil War""*

The 2009 conflict between the Oregon State Beavers and the Oregon Ducks was one of the most important in the entire history of the rivalry. The 16 ranked Beavers headed into the contest with a 6-2 conference record, while their 7 ranked rivals held a 7-1 conference record. With each team needing a victory to win the PAC-10, the winner would be guaranteed a berth in the Rose Bowl. Ultimately, the Ducks would hold on to win a 37-33 thriller.

*November 23, 2012, Martin Stadium, Trophy: The Apple Cup* 	[Apple Cup](#f/applecup-sheetl-row17-col01)

In a game dictated by momentum swings and missed opportunities, the Washington State Cougars managed to pull off an incredible come-back in the 2012 game against Washington. Down 28-10 heading in the 4th quarter, the Cougars rallied to score 18 unanswered points to tie the game at 28 a piece. Still, the Huskies managed to set up a potential game winning field goal for placekicker, Travis Coons, in the final seconds of regulation. Coons missed the 35-yard attempt and the game went into overtime where the Cougars completed the upset and the largest come-back in Apple Cup history.

*October 13, 1984, Cotton Bowl, ""Red-River Rivalry,"" Trophy: The Golden Hat* [Red River Shootout](#f/redrivershootout-sheetl-row15-col04)

The 1984 meeting between the Oklahoma Sooners and Texas Longhorns was a game for the ages. Mother nature made a statement early by forcing the number 1 ranked Sooners to slog through the soaking wet field of the Cotton Bowl against the number 3 Longhorns. After Texas shot out to a 10-0 half-time lead, the Sooners managed to fight back to claim a 15-12 advantage with the game nearing the end of regulation. Trailing by 3 with only 10 seconds remaining Texas quarterback, Todd Dodge, threw a ball into the end zone that appeared to be intercepted by Keith Stansberry. However, the officials ruled the pass incomplete, which allowed the Longhorns to hit a game tying field goal as time expired.

*November 20, 1998, Lane Stadium, Trophy: The Commonwealth Cup* [Commonwealth Cup](#f/commonwealthcup-sheetl-row14-col02)

If you were to ask a Virginia Tech fan or alumni what word would accurately describe the 1998 season, ""heartbreaking"" would probably be the most popular choice. They lost to Temple 24-28 after failing to score on the one yard line and they lost to Syracuse 26-28 after giving up a big pass play at the end of the game. Looking to avenge their two losses on the season, 20 ranked Virginia Tech looked to top their in-state foe and 16 ranked Virginia at home in Blacksburg. After jumping out to a 29-7 lead at halftime, the season's theme of disappointment turned its ugly head and the Cavaliers came back to win 36-32.

*October 25, 2003, Bryant-Denny Stadium, ""The Third Saturday in October""* 	[Third Saturday in October](#f/thirdsaturdayinoctober-sheetl-row18-col13)

What stands as the longest game ever in the history of the Alabama football team, the 2003 game versus Tennessee was one for the ages. A grueling and hard-fought contest gained headway late in regulation where both teams played to a 20-20 tie. In overtime, the intensity only continued and both teams felt the full force of each side's will to break the other's hopes of victory. It took a total of 5 overtimes before Tennessee held the Crimson Tide to a 51-43 victory.

The Tigers and Rebels first met on the gridiron way back in 1894. It wasn't until 2008, that the annual game played between the two schools was renamed The Magnolia Bowl. A year later, the number 8 Tigers were on the brink of an upset as they trailed the unranked Rebels 23-25 with 9 seconds remaining. On 4th and 26, LSU managed to complete a 40 yard pass for a first down with 1 second to spare. Instead of rushing the special teams unit onto the field to attempt a game winning field goal, the offense stalled and allowed time to tick away. Les Miles and the Tigers were left instead, with bitter disappointment.

*November 18, 2006, Ohio Stadium, ""The Game""* [The Game](#f/thegame-sheetl-row16-col21)

For the first time in the historic rivalry between Michigan and Ohio State, both teams would face one another as the number 1 and number 2 ranked teams in the country. The importance of the game was not only emphasized by the skill of both teams, but of painful loss. The night before kickoff legendary Michigan coach, Bo Schembechler, died. During the pregame ceremonies, Ohio State honored Bo, his memory, and his role in the rivalry with a moment of silence. Known as the ""Game of the Century,"" the 103rd meeting between the Midwestern schools was magical in every sense. As Leiv Schreiber described it in Michigan-Ohio State: The Rivalry, ""the game unfolded like a celebration- a 100 yard homage to all who played, coached, and cheered throughout this storied rivalry."" In the end, the Buckeyes prevailed 42-39.

A crowd of 69,938 fans, the largest ever to see a football game at Mountaineer Field at the time, was treated to one of the greatest Backyard Brawls between Pitt and West Virginia ever. With both teams ranked as the number 9 and number 10 teams in the country, plenty was at stake early in the season for each school. However, it was the Mountaineers who looked to be in control of the game as they headed into the 4th quarter with a commanding 31-9 lead. Despite the score, the Panthers fought on and proved through sheer tenacity and will that they were still capable of winning the game. Pitt stormed back to tie the score at 31 a piece after capping off the come-back effort with a game tying field goal as time expired in regulation.

The 1991 match between the number 2 Miami Hurricanes and the number 1 Florida State Seminoles looked to be a game with something special in the making. In a tight game Seminoles placekicker, Gerry Thomas, proved to be a pivotal role player. Throughout the afternoon, Thomas converted three field goals from 25, 31, and 20 yards to keep his team in it against Miami. With 30 seconds left in the game Coach Bobby Bowden put his kicker on the field to convert his 4th in a row on the day and seal the win for his team. Unfortunately for Thomas, he pushed it a little too much.

Given the current state of the Kansas Jayhawks and Missouri Tigers football teams, thinking of a time when they were both Top 5 teams seems almost fictional. Still, it was only less than ten years ago that the the two schools were not only ranked number 2 and 4 in the country, but had a gridiron rivalry to boot. The first meeting of the Border War between Kansas and Missouri took place in 1891, and since it's inaugural game it became one of the most contested rivalries in college football. Perhaps there is no better example that demonstrates the animosity between the two schools than the 2007 game where Missouri eventually won 36-28 in a back-and-forth shoot-out.

Though the rivalry between the Sun Devils and Wildcats is often overlooked in the PAC-12 thanks to the likes of other traditional powerhouse programs, it is one of the fiercest in college football. In 2014, the two teams met in one of three previous games where both teams were ranked. The 11 ranked Wildcats looked to fend off the 13 ranked Sun Devils in a high-noon showdown in Tuscon. In the end, their efforts were successful and the Wildcats emerged victorious in the hot Arizona sun.

Two teams that typically share a bond in hating Michigan, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and Michigan State Spartans save one day out of the year to direct their anger toward one another. Each season the two schools fight for bragging rights, the Megaphone Trophy, and the right to set the pace for the rest of their seasons. The 2010 game was a back-and-forth slog that eventually wound up in overtime. After holding Notre Dame to a field goal, the Spartans sputtered on their first offensive series. That's when Mark Dantonio sent his kick team on the field to pull off something a little more dramatic than a game tying kick.

Thanks so much for reading guys! I hope you enjoyed it! It was really fun researching games for this post and I would love to do one of these in the future for you all. Obviously, there are a ton of games I missed that I think also deserve recognition. But for now, this should be a good starting point. :)

[deleted],2016-11-22 15:26:25+00:00,Kanye West is forcibly hospitalized in the same institution where MK Ultra experiments were (are?) conducted,"It's theorized many celebrities undergo ""reprogramming"" when they have a breakdown. 

Kanye was forcibly [hospitalized](http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Rapper-Kanye-West-Hospitalized-After-Canceling-Saint-Pablo-Tour-402350286.html) in the psych ward at this place:

&gt; A source familiar with the case said Los Angeles police responded to a medical welfare call about 1:20 p.m. No criminal activity was involved; the decision to hospitalize West at ***Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center*** was for his own health and safety, the sources said.

The Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center was home to top mind control programmer and psych ward head, [Louis Jolyon ""Jolly"" West](http://www.freedommag.org/english/la/issue02/page12.htm). It is also believed that his work was continued as late as 1989:

&gt;   Between 1974 and 1989, West received at least $5,110,099 in grants from the federal government, channeled through the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), a major funding conduit for CIA programs. Many millions more poured into the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute that West headed, including over $14 million in federal funds in one fiscal year before he stepped down.

[Britney Spears](http://www.mtv.com/news/1583480/britney-spears-hospital-workers-fired-for-looking-at-singers-medical-records/) was another celebrity who went to this institution after her breakdown... and [Amanda Bynes](http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/amanda-bynes-transfers-ucla-medical-center-continue-treatment-article-1.1429095)... and[ Michael Jackson](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/media-reports-that-michael-jackson-94914)...and his daughter [Paris Jackson](http://nypost.com/2013/06/09/paris-jackson-transferred-to-ucla-medical-center-where-dad-michael-died-four-years-ago/) after *her* breakdown... and [Lindsay Lohan](http://www.judiciaryreport.com/lindsay_lohan_in_psychiatric_wing_of_ucla.htm).

Are we noticing a trend yet? 

Edit: those saying ""it's near their house,"" keep in mind there are about [13 such facilities](https://www.google.co.in/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=los+angeles+psych+wards&amp;rflfq=1&amp;rlha=0&amp;rllag=34075978,-118271495,2794&amp;tbm=lcl&amp;tbs=lf:1,lf_ui:2,lf_pqs:EAE), just within LA and not counting the surrounding areas. If it's because the facility is ""world class,"" what in its history makes it that way? What did the top contributor to the facility bring to it (see above)?",conspiracy,1493

**EDIT 2:** [The advertisement (important)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CvQInptWYAAPUdx.jpg)

From the [USA Today article:](https://www.google.com/amp/amp.usatoday.com/story/94211910/?client=ms-android-att-us)

&gt;three customers who bought the burrito in Los Angeles this month are suing. As City News Service reports, one of the men behind the proposed class-action lawsuit brought in Los Angeles Superior Court ordered the menu item on Nov. 3 thinking it was a 300-calorie dish. David Desmond ""felt excessively full and realized that the burrito couldn’t have been just 300 calories"" after eating it, per the complaint.

Help suggest companies. Also help suggest companies to remove from this list - there are lots and we want to be effective! Keep in mind that these are only *suggestions*, this is by no means a set of commands for you to obey.





#Edit: due to popular demand, companies which merely supported Hillary or Democrats have been removed!

10thplanetwestLA,2016-11-09 20:09:46+00:00,Yesterday's PARKING revenge story (somewhat unique),"Let me preface this by saying that I live in Los Angeles, so the traffic and parking is usually a nightmare.  

I went to the gym after work yesterday and it's in a plaza where the parking lot is horrendous.  For the number of popular establishments in the plaza, the parking lot is quite small.  LA Fitness, Rite Aid, Smashburger, California Pizza Kitchen, Gamestop, Brazilian Restaurant, Sushi Restaurant, O'Reilly Auto Parts, clothing store, hair products store, tanning salon (or laser hair removal?), nail salon, Yogurtland, boba shop, Coffee Bean, Robeks, Subway....and the parking lot only has about 200 parking spots.  Typical wait time for a parking spot during rush hour is about 5-20 minutes unless you get super lucky. Surrounding area is residential and you need a special permit to park on the street after 6PM.  

To make matters worse, the parking spots are [angled like this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Angle_parking_lot_diagram.PNG).  Only one car can fit between the parked cars, so if a car ahead of you is waiting for a spot, then you have to wait.  Even if the car idling ahead of you squeezes over to one side, you still can't get around them.  

Yesterday, I was making my rounds and about 3 minutes in, I see a guy walking over to his BMW ahead of me and gets in his car with ample room for him to back out and I can take his spot.  Score!  People who park in this lot are normally very courteous as they understand that the lot is a nightmare.  They usually either back out of their spot as quickly as possible or wave off a driver who is waiting for their spot if they are going to take a while.  This guy did neither.  I sat there for about 3 minutes and the BMW driver showed no signs of starting his car or backing up.  I started to feel bad about the car waiting behind me, so I decide to move and try looking for another spot.  As soon as I'm about to pass the parked BMW, his reverse lights come on.  WTF!!!!!!!  The car behind me is on my ass, so I can't back up and my chances of taking that spot are now gone.  I move forward a bit more, BMW pulls out, and car behind me takes his spot (which should have been my spot).  Now it's just me and the BMW behind me.  

A short while down the parking aisle, I see some guy rummaging through his trunk with gym clothes on.  I would normally just pass someone like this as there's a 50% chance they had just arrived and looking for their things to take into the gym.  Not today.  I turned on my blinker and just waited...and waited...and waited.  I saw the guy in the BMW behind me try go around, but as mentioned, there's not enough room.  I see him anxiously creep forward a couple centimeters at a time trying to signal to me to move.  I don't budge.  I wait another minute or so until a couple cars are now behind him.  I feel bad for those guys, so I slowly move and go to another aisle.  The BMW finally has the opportunity to go to the exit and accelerates HARD with a deep VROOOOOM!  Oh, were you in a hurry to leave?  I couldn't tell by the 3 minutes it took you to get out of the parking spot.  ",pettyrevenge,1211

joeroganpodcastfan,2016-11-07 16:16:46+00:00,I will now be voting for Trump in as a hispanic in Los Angeles,"You can check my history, I am not a Trump fan, I liked Bernie Sanders but I honestly thought he would win without a doubt so I didn't even vote for him in the primary =/ .. and as far as the general election I was honestly going to not vote as both candidates didn't really inspire me..

but the last few weeks, to maybe even a month or so, I've been seeing more and more of Donald and it's changing my mind about him. I've NEVER seen a presidential candidate speak as blunt and openly as he does about the issues we have within our government. 

I used to kind of jokingly bash Trump with my friends, but now when I start hearing more about the Wikileaks releases, and when I ask my friends about it - they don't know anything about it. Or how the media will just tell me it's Russia without actually explaining wtf is going on, that began to irk me as well.

Lifelong democrat who will now be going Republican for the first time ever. None of my friends or family agree with my decision, but that's OK. That is what freedom is all about

Also, I want to spread awareness about Tulsi Gabbard, yes, she is a D, but she is one who is for the greater good IMO. But for this election, it's Trump!

BLKavarice,2016-11-02 19:43:31+00:00,"Guys, I think Cathy O'Brien is a big lead to the Clinton sex trafficking ring that the FBI is trying to get us to dig up.","So a couple of weeks back when we were still on the sex scandal rebuttals against Hillary, we briefly touched on a lady named Cathy O'Brien. The big jab in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arHL2Mz14yc) was that it implied that Hillary was a lesbian and that the Clintons were involved with drug and sex trafficking back in Arkansas.


Given that it seems the FBI documents are attempting to establish an [""event timeline""](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5aqvr4/this_is_the_secret_of_the_fbi_tweets_this_is_what/) that leads to the pedophilia ring of Jeffery Epstein and the Clintons, I think this should be pushed a bit further.


Based on what we know about these incidents with Cathy, they involve the CIA (that we know is favoring Hillary, opposite the FBI supporting Trump),  Robert Bryd (Senator, KKK leader, and Hillary's mentor), Henry Kissinger (of SoS and warmongering fame, also a mentor to Hillary), and of course the Clintons. Details below.




_____


The video I linked to above was of a woman named Cathy O'Brien. In the video she discusses her encounter with the Clintons during the time she was kidnapped into a sex trafficking and drug ring that ended up in Arkansas. Her and a woman named Brice Taylor were involved, both of which presented the following information, as pieced together by /u/globalism_sux and /u/Ifeanyi18. Watch the video first.

______

[Brice and Cathy were] two victims of the CIA's MK ULTRA program both independently speaking and even writing books about being used as Sex Slaves to the Clintons and many other politicians.


This is from the 80's and 90's too with them reporting their stories as soon as possible.

Here are Page Excerpts from their books about the Clintons.


**From Cathy Obrien's ""Tranceformation of America""**

http://sli.mg/a/xH6rJz

**From Brice Taylor's ""Thanks for the Memories""**

https://i.sli.mg/2Xx8dr.png



Both of their stories are supported by CREDIBLE witnesses.

Brice Taylor was literally helped/rescued by the Former Head of FBI Los Angeles department, Ted Gunderson.

Cathy O'brien was helped/rescued by Mark Phillips, who was contracted by the Defense department, and he even provides documentation/photos in her book of his work with the defense department.

Here are links to both of their books, as well as videos of them giving their testimonies. Seems the elite/CIA did a great job at suppressing the books as the only available copies of the books are archives.

Brice Taylor: Thanks for the Memories

A quick Summary of the contents of their books, details their role as MK slaves for the government.

Cathy Obrien alleges her handler was Senator Robert Byrd.
Brice Taylor's handler was Henry Kissinger.

Both talk in detail, about from their experiences/use as MK victims, that all the elites at the top were working together to bring about what they called the New World Order, including the Bush's, Clinton's, Al Gore, Dick Cheney, The British Royal Family, Former Mexican president Salinas, and many others.

Cathy O'brien talks explicitly about George H.W bush and Bill Clinton being great friends and how they talked as a matter of fact, that Bill would become president after Bush. (She details this in that video linked above as well.)

To add some support to their stories as well, Brice Taylor details, that Henry Kissinger was one of the masterminds of the New World Order, and many presidents took orders directly from Kissinger/another group of people she only knew as 'The Council'.

Then in 2014, 20 years after her stating these things in this book.... Henry Kissinger publishes a book called ""World Order"".

https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/hillary-clinton-reviews-henry-kissingers-world-order/2014/09/04/b280c654-31ea-11e4-8f02-03c644b2d7d0_story.html?utm_term=.fa82ceaaceec

Reviewed by none other than.. Hillary Clinton.

Here's also a video of a number of Politicians, including George H.W Bush, Al gore, Obama, Bill Clinton, Henry Kissinger, John Kerry and more, many years after her book calling for/talking about a New World Order.

If this is all related to the Epstein stuff, then I really think we might be onto something. We need to push and possibly involve this in our FOIA requests. This is even more pertinent since Byrd is already dead and we can ask the FBI about him.


The reason why all of this is important is because it ties into the network of corruption, where as we've only been able to focus on the Clintons and a few others. We know that the MK Ultra program happened. They were testing on people and needed to keep it hidden. What better way to do that then to establish a top secret sex trafficking ring and involve all the top politicians? It would allow the CIA to operate as they wanted, gave the politicians reason to not report it because they would be implicated, gave them reason to deter investigation into the matter, and allowed the politicians to get their kicks at the expense of other people.

This may explain all the weird behavior of our current top officials hindering investigation into the Clinton foundation. As FBIanon said, this corruption involves a ton of people both public and private sector and was possibly the reason Comey backed off.",The_Donald,2010
Ehan2,2016-11-02 17:39:29+00:00,Quick Thoughts on every Week 9 game,"**PRO TIP: CTRL+F to find the players you care about.**

**[Week 8 Quick Thoughts]( https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/59j8n6/quick_thoughts_on_every_week_8_game/)**

In response to some feedback last week, I’ve made a greater effort to give more context to each defensive matchup. Hopefully this leads to a better product and more accurate advice!

----

##**Falcons @ Buccaneers**

•	**Matt Ryan** will be a top QB1 against a Buccaneers defense that has given up 300+ passing yards to every competent quarterback they have faced, including Ryan himself back in week 1. Tampa Bay is giving up big games to just about every WR they face, so you can fire **Julio Jones** up safely as a WR1. **Mohamed Sanu** has been up and down in terms of targets, but against this defense he’ll make a good boom or bust flex. The Bucs have not been awful against the run, allowing not a single 100 yard rusher and boasting the 5th fewest RB receptions allowed on the season. **Tevin Coleman** is likely to miss another game with a hamstring injury, however, and so based on volume, talent and red zone carries **Devonta Freeman** will be a strong RB1 play. **Austin Hooper** is a viable TE streamer against a poor defense. He'll have increased opportunity with **Jacob Tamme** out.

•	**Jameis Winston**threw for 281 yards and four touchdowns in week 1 against the Falcons on the road. While he may not reach such lofty heights this week, there is plenty of reason to be optimistic about a strong QB1 performance from Winston. **Mike Evans** is an every week WR1 against a defense that has allowed several strong weeks to WR1s including Jordy Nelson, Tyrell Williams, and Evans himself. **Cameron Brate** has target numbers of 3, 3, and 5 in the last three games which is the bad news. The good news is that the Falcons have given up 5 touchdowns to tight ends, 4th most in the league, and Brate is used quite a bit in the red zone. Brate will be a TD dependent TE1 streamer. With **Jacquizz Rodgers** going down to a foot injury, Tampa is down to its 4th starting RB. **Antone Smith** out snapped and out touched **Peyton Barber**, suggesting Smith could lead the backfield on TNF. Atlanta has allowed a middling number of rushing yards; it is through the air that RBs are killing them. They’ve allowed the most receiving yards (476) to running backs on the season. I’m not confident in either Smith or Barber in the passing game, so the outlook is not as bright as it seems. Still, I expect plenty of red zone opportunities in this shootout. As of now Smith is the preferred RB3 based on last week’s usage, but this situation is very uncertain; Barber flashed a lot more potential in Week 7 and he is the more talented back in my opinion. The addition of **Mike James** to the committee only serves to muddy things further. Keep an eye on the situation as the week progresses.

##**Eagles @ Giants**

•	**Carson Wentz** faces a challenge in the New York Giants’ defense which has not allowed a standout performance to any QB despite facing Aaron Rodgers and Drew Brees; the Giants’ defense is allowing an average of 1 passing TD per game. Wentz will be a mid to low end QB2. The Giants have allowed solid PPR performances to slot receivers Cole Beasley, Willie Snead, Jamison Crowder and Randall Cobb. Next up, **Jordan Matthews**, who is coming off of a resurgent 14 target game – fire Matthews up as a WR2. The Giants are middling against the run, and displayed some vulnerability to pass catching backs in weeks 6 and 7 when facing Terrance West (4 catches, 36 yards) and Todd Gurley (6 catches, 35 yards). Therefore, I’d expect another strong game from **Darren Sproles**, who out touched supposed starter **Ryan Mathews** 20 to 4 last week. Mathews kept himself from the void with a goal line TD, but playing just 10% of snaps, he cannot be trusted in any lineups. Sproles will be a low end RB2 with extra appeal in PPR. 

•	**Eli Manning** has not been great this season, he hasn’t even been good. With only one top-12 performance under his belt, he can’t be trusted in 1 QB leagues this week against one of the league’s top defenses. If you’re in a 2 QB league, however, there is some reason to hope. The Giants’ are coming off a bye where their offensive struggles had to have been the focus. If they have sorted those out, Eli could get back on track. Rookie Dak Prescott did just manhandle this defense in the second half of Sunday Night Football, after all. The Eagles are good, but far from a shut down defense for wide receivers; Antonio Brown did great against them, and many other WRs, most recently Dez Bryant, have had solid to good fantasy performances against them. **Odell Beckham’s** performance is tied to Manning’s and the offenses in general, but I believe he will turn in a solid WR1 performance as the Giants try to get their offense back on track by involving their best player. **Sterling Shepard** is getting WR2 targets but has not been turning them into WR2 numbers; he is a desperation flex in this matchup, same as **Victor Cruz**.  The running game is a bit of a mystery coming out of the bye, with **Rashad Jennings** increasingly inefficient it has been speculated that dynamic rookie **Paul Perkins** may get more involved. Jennings will be an RB3 with a chance to score at the goal line. Perkins isn’t startable yet but he is my recommended stash of the week for those hurting at RB.

##**Lions @ Vikings**

•	Minnesota is coming off of one of their poorest showings defensively, but I’m still not comfortable starting **Matthew Stafford** as anything more than a QB2 against the Vikings at home – on the season they have been very, very solid at shutting down opposing passing games. For the time being at least, **Golden Tate** has surpassed **Marvin Jones** in terms of targets. I’m not sure who Xavier Rhodes will be covering, though my guess would be Marvin Jones. If that is the case, Jones will be a low end WR3 this week. Tate will be a stronger WR3 start, but keep your ear to the ground for news on who Rhodes will be lining up against. **Theo Riddick** is an every week PPR RB2 – I’m not worried about the matchup, as teams have had some success chucking passes to their RBs out of the backfield against Minnesota (see: Bobby Rainey, Fozzy Whittaker, Paul Perkins (one big play)). **Eric Ebron** returned to an immediately solid workload of 10 targets and should be grabbed and used as a TE1 in a middling matchup for his position – with the WRs overwhelmed, Stafford might look to him more often as an outlet, and he’s always a threat in the red zone if the Lions can get there.

•	**Sam Bradford** will be on the streaming radar against the Lions’ league worst QB defense; that stat is padded by bouts against Andrew Luck and Aaron Rodgers, but this defense also vaulted the likes of Case Keenum to QB1 status. If you’re in need at QB this week, Bradford should be able to turn in low end QB1 numbers. The Vikings’ finally got a clue and fed their best offensive player, **Stefon Diggs**, 13 targets on Monday Night Football. The Lions’ have not been able to limit any teams’ receivers aside from the Osweiler-led Texans – call that an outlier. Diggs is in the WR2 discussion. **Adam Thielen** will be a boom or bust flex for the truly desperate; the matchup gives him some upside but the floor is rock bottom if things don’t work out. **Kyle Rudolph** was quiet last week but you’re going to want to start him again; the Lions’ are getting absolutely wrecked by tight ends, allowing strong performances to the likes of Jack Doyle, Lance Kendricks, Vernon Davis and CJ Fiedorowicz. Rudolph is a firm TE1. If **Matt Asiata** continues to get the backfield to himself then I like him as a solid RB2 in this matchup where goal line chances should be more plentiful. If McKinnon returns then his floor is lowered, but his ceiling remains high. **Jerick McKinnon** would be a tough to trust RB3 coming off an injury in an uncertain timeshare, though I remain a truther.

##**Steelers @ Ravens**

•	**Ben Roethlisberger** has some nasty home/road splits and is coming off of knee surgery. My suggestion? If you had a solid backup filling in for Big Ben last week, roll with them for one more week, just to be safe. With Ben back, **Antonio Brown** is a top WR1 play (as if that was ever in doubt) against a Baltimore defense giving up huge games to WRs all season. Baltimore shows up on paper as the 6th best fantasy run defense, but they have faced very little talent so far. LeSean McCoy, Isaiah Crowell, and Matt Forte all had solid games against them. **LeVeon Bell** should have no trouble at all – he’s an RB1. With Ben back, **Sammie Coates** is back on the flex radar against a Baltimore defense that is giving up big plays, Coates’ specialty. **Ladarius Green** will be activated soon; he may be a vital tool for the Steelers’ who have historically used their TE often, and are still looking to fill the WR2 void left by Martavis Bryant. Stash him if you’re desperate at the position.

•	The passing volume has been there for **Joe Flacco**, averaging 44 pass attempts per game, but the touchdowns have not, with only 5 through 7 games. With this much passing volume, positive TD regression has to be coming. If you need a streamer this week, or a solid QB2, you could do a lot worse than Flacco at home this week. **Mike Wallace** is quietly having a great season – with 33 targets through his last 4 games, he is getting great volume with **Steve Smith** hampered by injury. The Steelers are a tough on-paper matchup for WRs, but have given up plenty of solid performances to teams’ WR1s; with this kind of volume, Wallace is a low end WR2. **Terrance West** is coming off a dude week, but to his credit it was the stout Jets’ run defense. The good news is that no other RB got significant work so his job seems secure for now. **Kenneth Dixon** is worth a stash if you have the room but reports that he will get more involved should be taken with a grain of salt; West is working and things will not significantly change anytime soon, pending an injury or a disastrous performance. The Steelers’ run defense is struggling, yielding huge games to Ajayi and Blount prior to the bye. With little competition in the backfield, West is a solid RB2 in this matchup. **Dennis Pitta** has greater than 8 targets in 5 of 7 games, so the volume is there, and it’s a plus matchup against a defense that has given up good games to big name and no name tight ends alike – he’s a TE1.

##**Cowboys @ Browns**

•	With Cleveland giving up good to great games to every QB it has faced thus far, **Dak Prescott** will be firmly on the QB1 radar this week; stream him if you’re in need. The Browns’ defense has been no better against WRs, and I expect big things from **Dez Bryant** who received an uncharacteristic 14 targets last week. There is plenty of big play potential against the Browns and I like Bryant as a WR1. **Cole Beasley** was hindered but not erased by Bryant’s return. I don’t expect the target split of 14:7 for Bryant:Beasley to continue, I imagine it will even out somewhat. Beasley is still a strong WR3/flex, particularly in PPR formats. Obviously the Browns have not been strong against the run either and **Ezekiel Elliott** will be an elite RB1 in this one. **Jason Witten** is worthy of streamer consideration in this matchup against the league’s worst fantasy TE defense; they’re obviously vulnerable to the position and Dak will take advantage of that.

•	It is unclear who will start for the Browns’ at QB as of this writing, but it will be either **Josh McCown** or **Cody Kessler**. The fantasy world crosses its fingers for McCown. McCown will be in the low end QB1 discussion against Dallas. Kessler would be a low to mid QB2. **Terrelle Pryor** would be a strong WR2 start either way as the team’s primary target. **Corey Coleman** returns from his hand injury as an immediate WR3 plug in – he displayed serious talent in his second game in Baltimore. **Isaiah Crowell** will have a limited ceiling against the Cowboys’ tough run defense, but his rushing floor has been fairly safe all season, and he has dominated in the red zone. I’d say he’s a high RB3, low RB2 for the week. **Duke Johnson** has a bleak outlook, as the Cowboys have been pretty good against receiving backs so far this season – he’s a low end flex. **Gary Barnidge** will be in a good spot against a Cowboys’ defense that has been vulnerable to tight ends – Josh McCown being under center would further improve his outlook. Barnidge will be a good low end TE1 streaming option.

##**Jaguars @ Chiefs**

•	**Blake Bortles** is playing dreadfully, but is racking up garbage time points in certain contests which get out of hand early. Relying on garbage time production is a fluky practice, as not all game scripts allow for it. Bortles is a fine QB2 but I’d look to stream in 1 QB leagues. **Allen Robinson** is suffering from the bad mechanics of his quarterback, but is receiving a heavy workload (15 targets last week). This week Robinson will be a WR2 against the Chiefs’ defense which has been giving up huge games to WRs all season. If Bortles can improve his throwing technique, Robinson will be back in the season long WR2 discussion. **Allen Hurns** is receiving a very solid workload himself, and should also benefit from the plus matchup; fire him up as a strong WR3/Flex. The Chiefs are some of the best in the league at halting the TE position so **Julius Thomas** will not be a viable TE play this week. The Jags’ running game is truly putrid because they are never winning. **TJ Yeldon** has some flex value in PPR leagues as the primary passing down back but that’s about it. **Chris Ivory** is more of an RB4.

•	**Alex Smith** is in the concussion protocol, so **Nick Foles** will step up and start. He will not be a viable QB2. If **Spencer Ware** can be cleared from the concussion protocol he will be an RB1 in this game; the Jags’ are middle of the pack against the run on paper but they have given up solid games to every talented RB they have faced. If Ware can’t go, **Charcandrick West** will be a solid RB2. **Jeremy Maclin** got more involved last week, catching a TD from Alex Smith, but he only managed 3 catches on 10 targets. This matchup is a good one, and Foles gave him a slight bump in target share, so Maclin is in the upside WR3 department. Jaguars’ are ranked 5th against fantasy tight ends, but the only TEs of note they have faced thus far are Walker and Pitta who were able to turn in low end TE1 performances. **Travis Kelce** will be a mid-range TE1.

##**Jets @ Dolphins**

•	The Dolphins’ defense does not pose an especially great challenge, but **Ryan Fitzpatrick** has not been a startable QB in 1QB leagues since Week 2. That’s not someone I want to bet on as anything more than a low end QB2. This defense just allowed a 93 yard, 1 TD game to Marquise Goodwin, so I have faith that **Brandon Marshall** can turn in a good WR2 day. **Quincy Enunwa** keeps making big plays and it has apparently earned him a larger target share, with 11 targets last week. I honestly see him as a low end WR2 as well, with a potentially lower floor if for some reason the targets start going back the other way. **Matt Forte** has another two weeks’ worth of workhorse usage under his belt, and he has not disappointed with two strong RB1 finishes. We cannot simply forget, however, the split that formed with **Bilal Powell** in weeks 3 through 6. Forte is best treated as an RB2. Powell is an upside flex in PPR formats. 

•	The Jets are allowing the most passing yards in the league, so **Ryan Tannehill** is firmly on the streaming radar as a low end QB1. His WRs will also benefit heavily from the plus matchup. **Jarvis Landry** should be a high end WR2. **Kenny Stills** will be a not so bad flex play. **DeVante Parker** is a punt flex play, but there’s certainly upside for the deep threat – just keep his low floor in mind. The Jets are very strong against the running game, allowing the fourth fewest rushing yards in the league, but pass catching RBs can still do well against them. Add the fact that **Jay Ajayi** is playing out of his mind, is coming off a bye, and has no **Arian Foster** to compete with for pass catching duties and Ajayi can comfortably be started as a high RB2/low RB1.

##**Saints @ 49ers**

•	**Drew Brees** is away from home, which you ordinarily never like to see, but this week we’ll make an exception. They’re giving up an average of 230 passing yards and 2.14 passing TDs per game, and face a decidedly above average QB in Brees. He’ll be a QB1. San Francisco is a fairly generous defense across the board for all positions, particularly RB, a position to which they’ve granted 1139 rushing yards, the worst in the league. **Mark Ingram** was unceremoniously benched last week for a fumble, replaced by **Tim Hightower**. It is clear that at best for Ingram, this is now a committee. At worst, he is Hightower’s backup. I’ll choose to believe head coach Payton when he says Ingram still has a significant role. In that case, against this putrid defense, Ingram and Hightower are both high upside plays. I would put them both in the category of low end RB2, and that’s only because of their uncertain workloads. If we get any clarity, you can upgrade the beneficiary. **Brandin Cooks**, **Michael Thomas** and **Willie Snead** are all strong starts against this very bad 49ers defense. Their targets have been all over the place based on who is open. I would rank them Cooks &gt; Thomas &gt; Snead, which not-so-coincidentally correlates with their TDs on the season (5, 3 and 2 respectively) – red zone usage is big in differentiating these receivers. **Coby Fleener** is a boom or bust TE who has had his only two big games at home. He has also seen his snaps decrease precipitously from 77% five games ago to 34% last week. **Josh Hill** may be taking over. In an away game, with so many other mouths to feed around him, Fleener’s tough to trust.

•	**Colin Kaepernick** gets a prime matchup against the Saints defense. His high rushing floor combined with the matchup should get him a high end QB2 performance.  What can really be said about the 49ers’ receivers? I wouldn’t start any of them. But if you’re desperate, **Torrey Smith** could catch a long touchdown like he did in week 6, making him a viable boom or bust flex. **Jeremy Kerley** has been a no-show since **Blaine Gabbert** was benched. **Carlos Hyde** should be back from injury and is a legitimate RB1 against the Saints’ awful run defense. **DuJuan Harris** would be the back to own and use as a plug and play RB2 if Hyde is ruled out.

##**Panthers @ Rams**

•	**Cam Newton** should have no trouble putting up a high end QB1 performance against this defense, which has had success against bad/struggling QBs (Gabbert, Wilson, Palmer, Manning) but which has been lit up by good QBs (Winston, Stafford). Los Angeles has faced a series of horrendous tight ends which has inflated their stats against the position – in fact Cameron Brate, the only TE they’ve faced to receive more than 5 targets, lit them up, so the elite **Greg Olsen** should have no trouble at all putting up TE1 numbers. **Kelvin Benjamin** can also be used as a strong WR2 against a weak passing defense – his targets should rise again from Week 8’s paltry 5. **Jonathan Stewart** is a firm RB2 despite the tough on-paper matchup – Cam post-concussion is not doing his usual red zone heroics, leading to more goal line TDs for Stewart. 

•	**Case Keenum** has at least demonstrated he can put up solid performances in the right matchup (see: Detroit) so I’m projecting a high end QB2 finish for him, worthy of streaming consideration for those in need. **Tavon Austin** has received 8+ targets in 5 of 7 games, which is significant. Anyone receiving that kind of target load is worthy of flex consideration – against this struggling secondary, Austin is worthy of your WR3/Flex spot.  **Kenny Britt** is also in the flex discussion, again because of the matchup, but he is lower down the totem than Austin. Britt left us hanging before the bye, but prior to that dud he was on a 3 game hot streak. He could get going again now post-bye. **Todd Gurley** faces a rather tough Carolina run defense that limited David Johnson to just 24 yards on the ground last week – Gurley has been getting more involved in the passing game though, which helped save DJ, so I still like him as an RB2 this week. **Lance Kendricks** is a high TE2/low TE1 play this week just because the Panthers have been so bad against tight ends, and they haven’t even faced any exceptional talent. Kendricks is coming off a two game streak with 8+ targets so the precedent for his success is there.

##**Titans @ Chargers**

•	**Marcus Mariota** is on a great 4 game streak, and the San Diego Chargers have not been great this season, but look closer and see that they have held their last two opponents to 1 passing touchdown and 2 INTs combined. One of those opponents was Matt Ryan. I think Mariota is a low end QB1 for the week. **DeMarco Murray** is obviously in line for a huge week against a run defense that has allowed 10 rushing TDs, the second most in the league. Monitor his health, but it sounds like his toe injury is nothing serious. Handcuff **Derick Henry** needs to be owned everywhere. **Rishard Matthews** and **Kendall Wright** are about even with each other in the Titans’ passing game; neither has a standout target share, and both are catching touchdowns. With low targets there’s always a chance for a bust, but I’m comfortable with either as a WR3/Flex. **Delanie Walker** is seeing his targets divided among the aforementioned wide receivers, but he’s still a TE1 based on his talent and red zone potential.

•	**Philip Rivers** has faced Denver twice in three weeks, which has been tough, but he’s putting that tough stretch behind him now. Rivers has been better at home so far this season, and the Titans have given up QB1 performances in their last 3 games to Kessler, Luck and Garbage King Bortles. I’m penciling in Rivers for low end QB1 production. If **Travis Benjamin** misses time with his PCL injury, **Tyrell Williams** will be a locked in WR2 on volume alone. If both play, they’re both more WR3 types. **Melvin Gordon** faces a seriously tough run defense this week which will limit his yardage, but he’s always a safe bet for a score in some fashion – his elite red zone usage keeps him in the RB2 range, and it helps that he displayed serious talent as a runner against a tough Denver D last week. **Hunter Henry** lost serious playing time and targets to **Antonio Gates** last week, suggesting that once again SD will go with their immortal veteran over their young talent for as long as they can. Gates will be the TE to own in this plus matchup, and is worth starting as a TE1. Henry can be stashed in case injuries once again catch up with Gates.

##**Colts @ Packers**

•	The Packers have really only “limited” one QB, Brian Hoyer, who broke his arm early in the game. I have no worries about **Andrew Luck** as a QB1 this week – so far, he is having his best year yet. **TY Hilton** had his targets dip due to a hamstring injury that limited him during the game, and probably also partly due to the return of **Donte Moncrief** to the lineup. This game has shootout potential written all over it and I’d expect a lot of passing plays thanks to Green Bay’s solid run defense. Hilton is a borderline WR1 and Moncrief is a strong WR2. **Frank Gore** will have a tough go of it against Green Bay’s run defense which held Devonta Freeman to just 35 yards on the ground, and everyone else (besides Ezekiel Elliott) to under 50. Gore is not enough of a pass catcher to save his floor here, but his potential for a goal line TD in this shooutout does. He’s a boom or bust, TD dependent RB2 play – insert safer, higher floor options if you have them, and don’t expect much yardage. **Jack Doyle** felt the presence of Moncrief the hardest, his targets dropping back down to three last week. However, part of that was Kansas City’s elite TE defense and I think Doyle bounces back as a TE1 – the matchup is okay, the game is a shootout, and Doyle already has 4 TD passes on the year – he’s a definite red zone threat. However, if **Dwayne Allen** returns to the field (he practiced on Wednesday) Doyle will be a mere TE2.

•	**Aaron Rodgers** will also be a strong QB1 play in this likely shootout against this defense which just gave up two touchdown passes to Nick Foles. Nick Foles!!! The Colts’ secondary is allowing 288 passing yards per game, and **Davante Adams**, **Jordy Nelson** and **Randall Cobb** should be the biggest beneficiaries. Adams has been a target monster over the last two games, which should settle down with Cobb returning, but perhaps not by much. Cobb is coming off a hamstring injury and thus may see his reps managed. Jordy is obviously a red zone favorite and a threat to score each week, but I’ll take the volume of Adams over him for now. Both are in the high end WR2 discussion for the week, while Cobb is a riskier WR3 bet coming off his injury. It seems clear that until **James Starks** returns, **Ty Montgomery** will be the “running back” for the Packers, so fire him up as a strong WR2 option in PPR leagues, and a good WR3 in standard. Now might be a good time for RB desperate teams to stash Starks – **Knile Davis** (waived) and **Don Jackson** obviously haven’t worked out.

##**Broncos @ Raiders**

•	**Trevor Siemian** gets a good matchup against the Raiders paltry defense, but his play has been so poor over the last four games from a fantasy perspective it will be impossible to trust him as more than a QB2. I do love the outlook for his receivers, **Demaryius Thomas** and **Emmanuel Sanders**, whose roles are truly interchangeable. Both are strong WR2s this week. **Devontae Booker** is the workhorse in this backfield now, and this defense will pose no problems for him – consider him a strong RB1 play. **Virgil Green** is starting to get more involved, receiving 6 targets last week. If you need a punt play at TE in a deep league, this is a good matchup for him.

•	**Derek Carr** had an excellent performance last week, but that was Tampa Bay. This is Denver. Denver, which has limited every QB it has faced to a subpar fantasy performance, barring only Cam Newton in week 1. Those other QBs? Luck, Dalton, Winston, Ryan, and Rivers (twice). Oh, and Brock Lobster, but nobody is impressed by that. I don’t think Carr is any better or worse than those guys. So I’m expecting a floor, QB2 type of game from him. Denver has also completely shut down opposing wide receivers, allowing the fewest yards (only 759!) in the entire league. **Amari Cooper** and **Michael Crabtree**, as good as they are, will just be floor-based WR3s against this elite defense. One thing Denver has not shut down this season is opposing run games, so **Latavius Murray** is still in the low end RB2 discussion. Though he is clearly leading it, he is still in a committee, which limits his upside.

##**Bills @ Seahawks**

•	What an ugly, nasty, no-good game for Monday Night Football. I’ll be sleeping through this one. Anyhow, **Tyrod Taylor** has been a remarkably productive QB without **Sammy Watkins** in the lineup. His rushing ability has been a big help in that regard. The Seahawks defense has been tough against QBs on-paper, but has really only faced two good QBs, Matt Ryan and Drew Brees, and they did well and had QB1 days against them. Tyrod isn’t as good as them, but he isn’t as bad as the other QBs the Seahawks have dominated, so I’ll hedge my bets and say Tyrod has a high floor, low ceiling, high end QB2 type of day. He won’t lose your matchup, but he won’t win it for you either. I’m not endorsing the start of any Bills’ WRs against the Seahawks – none are receiving enough targets, or have enough talent, to stand out as a startable flex. If **LeSean McCoy** can play, he’ll be a solid RB2 against a Seahawks defense which is tough on paper, but that just gave up over 100 yards rushing to Tim Hightower. If McCoy can’t go, **Mike Gillislee** will be on the RB2 spectrum as well.

•	**Russell Wilson** is a disaster for his owners. He hasn’t scored a touchdown since Week 4. Maybe his mobility will improve once his knee brace comes off, maybe that will help. I need to see it first. Wilson is a lower end QB2 until he proves otherwise. Buffalo hasn’t exactly been friendly to opposing QBs not named Brady anyways. **Doug Baldwin** is languishing under Wilson’s struggles and is just a WR3 until the offense improves. The matchup looks tougher for **Jimmy Graham** than it really is, because Buffalo has faced such meager TE competition outside of Gronk and Martellus Bennett. Graham should be used a low end TE1, who is also suffering from Wilson syndrome. The Awakening might be coming to an end in Seattle, as **Christine Michael** is losing snaps and opportunities to rookie **CJ Prosise**, the team’s new pass catching pack. **Thomas Rawls** is also fast approaching. Michael will be an RB2 against Buffalo, and owners should consider selling high. Prosise is not yet startable.

03pct_2,2016-10-29 17:06:31+00:00,League Lawyer: Account Banning,"Hi everyone.  Me again.  Since my last post I have been inundated with legal questions via PM and I want to answer them publicly in this format (so I don’t have to send dozens of PMs on each subject).  See below for the first Q&amp;A.  I’ll follow up with others when I get time.

Question: &gt;“I spent $1,000 on skins and other content on my account and then got banned for “scripting” but I don’t script and never have.  What are my rights, legally?”

One of the things you as players need to understand is the difference between “ownership” and a “license.”  Grossly oversimplifying here for a lay audience, “ownership” is the exclusive legal right to possess and exclude others from taking possession of or otherwise interacting with a piece of property.  A license is simply the right to do something, it is NOT ownership.  

So, if I tell you that you can walk your dog on my lawn, I have verbally granted you the right to walk your dog on my lawn until I say otherwise (this is a license!) and you could raise this fact as a defense if I called the cops on you and pressed criminal trespassing charges the next time you walked your dog on my lawn.  Another example: if the state of California decides you are capable of competently driving a car, they will grant you a…wait for it… driver’s **license**, which is the right to drive a car, subject to obeying traffic rules.  You do not OWN your driver’s license, they can take it away if you break traffic laws.  

When you buy a skin in LOL, you are getting a **license** to the skin, not **ownership** of the skin.  Licenses don’t have to be verbal, they can be in writing.  And they don’t have to be simple like the one in the above dog example, they can be extraordinarily complicated and take up dozens of pages of text.  The license Riot grants you when you purchase content in LOL is revocable (i.e., they can take it away) under certain circumstances (as specified in the LOL Terms of Use), chief among them when you break the Code of Conduct, for example, by scripting.  

A thought experiment: Now, hypothetically, if Riot were to grant “ownership” of skins, literally they could only sell a given skin to one person.  That person would become the copyright holder upon purchase, and any subsequent sales of that skin by Riot to other players would be a knowing and willful violation of the first purchaser’s copyright in that skin.  This is nonsensical and absurd.

TL;DR - You have no legal remedy when Riot decides to close your account because you broke the Code of Conduct, unless you can prove they did so in error.  If they did so in error, they have breached the contract.  Proving they did so in error is quite difficult.  How do you prove your PC doesn’t have a scripting program on it (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_absence)?  

If this problem is really widespread and people are actually getting accounts banned when they did nothing wrong (and not just wasting my time), my suggestion would be for a single wronged individual to organize an effort (e.g., soliciting stories or signatures from other wronged individuals) to demonstrate the scope of this problem to Riot.  That scope should be memorialized in a letter which should, in turn, be physically mailed to the Riot legal team:
Riot Games, Inc., 12333 W. Olympic Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90064 ATTN: LEGAL DEPT.

I would be happy to author the letter if someone else wants to collect the data/stories/signatures and analyze the scope of the problem (if indeed the problem exists).

Lastly, if you’ve spent $1,000 on this game, I would urge you to ~~reconsider your spending habits~~ get gud.

JaguarGator9,2016-10-20 18:56:05+00:00,"[OC] In 1993, the NFL experimented with an 18 week schedule consisting of 2 bye weeks. Here's why it failed, and here's how the league can implement such a system today.","When the CBA expires and negotiations take place in a few years (and the inevitable lockout happens), one of the hot topics is going to be the 18-game schedule, expanding the regular season by 2 games. There’s been enough debate over that topic, and generally, most fans consider that to be a bad idea. It increases the risk for injuries, the players would never agree to it, it dilutes the regular season and the record book, teams would get tired and fatigue would come into play during the postseason… you get the idea.

However, one thing that is somewhat being talked about is not an 18-game schedule, but rather, an 18-week schedule, where each team still plays 16 games, but receives 2 bye weeks. Let’s say you cut one week off of the preseason and have each team play 16 games but receive 2 bye weeks instead of receiving just one. What could possibly be the downside of a 2-bye week system?

Well, the NFL tried a 2-bye week system in 1993. And it failed. Miserably.

Now that’s not to say that a 2-bye week system today can’t work. Times have changed. In the rough quarter century or so since 1993, Sunday Ticket and RedZone were created, primetime football on Thursday is a regular thing, and the Patriots went from being the laughingstock of the NFL to the most hated team in American sports (and we let that happen). Was the 2-bye week system just a bad idea that should never be implemented again, or was it a system that failed due to poor execution and the times not allowing for it to be good? Well, let’s take a look.

**Overview**

Oddly enough, I couldn’t find too many articles from 1993 about the change. Most of the things I could find were retrospective. You know how you can find lots of articles today criticizing the NFL for a rule? Couldn’t find any from 1993 on the 18-week system, which is odd, because it was hailed as a unanimous disaster. I could find [one sentence from 1993 which outlined the rule change](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-03-22/sports/1993081079_1_bailey-nfl-meetings-new-york-giants), which stated this:

&gt; As expected, the owners formally decided to play 16 games over 18 weeks this fall, giving each team two byes and cutting the time between the conference championship games and the Super Bowl from two weeks to one.

You have to remember what the NFL just did a few years ago when they expanded the schedule from 16 weeks to 17 weeks in 1990. It worked. It was a success. So, the league decided to push the envelope and get a bit greedy by making it 18 weeks, giving each team two bye weeks. The logic, according to Wikipedia, was twofold. Number one, if the schedule was 17 weeks, then the postseason games would’ve fallen on January 1, and the NFL did not want to compete with college bowl games. The NFL playing some wild card games on 1/1/94 (a Saturday) could’ve been a disaster, considering the fact that they would’ve been competing against the [1994 Orange Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Orange_Bowl), maybe one of the greatest championship games of all-time.

The second reason, obviously, was revenue. More weeks of football meant more money. Remember that 1993 was the final year of the television deals for the NFL. New deals were signed in 1993, and in those deals, CBS lost the rights to the NFC to FOX. If the 18-week season was successful, then the prices for those television deals would’ve skyrocketed. All in all, not a bad idea by the NFL in the slightest bit. It seemed good on paper (minus the getting rid of the bye week between the conference championship and the Super Bowl), and it seemed like a surefire way for the league to get money.

So why was this a disaster?

**Reason #1: Placement of the Bye Weeks**

The Chicago Bears of 1993 may have been the streakiest NFL team of all-time. I mean, [just look at these results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Chicago_Bears_season#Regular_season). That had to be a product of the 2-bye week system, mainly, how poorly the bye weeks were spread out. For those that can’t check, the Bears lost their first 2 games, had a bye week, won their next 3 games, had a bye week, lost their next 3 games, then won their next 4 games, and finished the season by losing their final 4 games to finish the season with a 7-9 record.

Notice the thing about the bye weeks for those 1993 Chicago Bears, though? Two bye weeks in the first seven weeks of the season? In the first 7 weeks, the Bears had the same number of road games as they did bye weeks. Seems like poor placement if even under a 2-bye week system, you’ve got to play 11 games in a row. Turns out, this was common for most teams in the league. Here’s where every team had a bye week in 1993:

Team | Bye Week #1 | Bye Week #2
------ | ------- | --------
Buffalo | 3 | 7
Indianapolis | 3 | 7
Miami | 3 | 7
New England | 5 | 11
NY Jets | 3 | 7
Cincinnati | 5 | 9
Cleveland | 5 | 9
Houston Oilers | 5 | 9
Pittsburgh | 5 | 9
Denver | 4 | 8
Kansas City | 4 | 8
LA Raiders | 4 | 8
San Diego | 4 | 8
Seattle | 6 | 12
Dallas | 4 | 8
NY Giants | 4 | 8
Philadelphia | 4 | 8
Phoenix | 5 | 12
Washington | 4 | 8
Chicago | 3 | 7
Detroit | 6 | 11
Green Bay | 3 | 7
Minnesota | 3 | 7
Tampa Bay | 3 | 7
Atlanta | 6 | 10
LA Rams | 6 | 10
New Orleans | 6 | 10
San Francisco | 6 | 10

The NFL’s idea of placing bye weeks was to do it by division, so the entire division had off at the same time (minus the divisions with 5 teams). Even more concerning is that teams would have 3 weeks of games before the next bye week, and then would still have to play the rest of the season. The only teams with bye weeks that actually made sense were New England, Phoenix, Detroit, and Seattle, because there were significant gaps between the two bye weeks.

And even still, each team had to play the final 6 weeks of the season. There were no bye weeks after week 12 in an 18-week, 2-bye week system. By comparison, there are teams in today’s NFL that have a bye week in week 13. The placement was all wrong, and when you place the bye weeks wrong, of course it’s going to mess up the way teams play and their momentum.

**Reason #2: More Bye Weeks = Less Games**

Remember the placement of the bye weeks and how poor that was? Let’s break down how many teams had off each week, keeping in mind that at the time, there were only 28 teams in the league.

Week | Number of Teams Off | Number of Games
----- | -------- | ------------
3 | 8 | 10
4 | 8 | 10
5 | 6 | 11
6 | 6 | 11
7 | 8 | 10
8 | 8 | 10
9 | 4 | 12
10 | 4 | 12
11 | 2 | 13
12 | 2 | 13

During certain weeks of the season, roughly **30% of the league** was on bye. Numbers don’t reach that high today, and yet, that’s what the NFL thought was a good idea back in 1993. There were 10 games on during certain weeks of the season. Now, let’s assume that we’re playing under today’s rules where there’s a Thursday night game, a Monday night game, a Sunday night game, and even a London game. That means that you’d get just 6 games in the regular Sunday slot, which would likely be 4 games at 1:00 and 2 games at 4:00. Networks would never agree to such a ridiculous system nowadays.

When you give certain divisions the same bye weeks, sometimes, the times for games get a bit ridiculous. In week 4, there were just 2 games at the 4:00 slot; of those 2 games, none of them came in the Mountain or Pacific Time Zone, as the home teams were the New Orleans Saints (vs. San Francisco) and the Cincinnati Bengals (vs. Seattle). The following week (week 5), the NFL went to the other extreme, scheduling 5 games at 4:00 and just 4 games at 1:00. That’s right- it seems inconceivable now, but there was a time where the NFL had more 4:00 games than 1:00 games.

In week 7, because the league had a game on Thursday night and only 10 games for the whole week, there was no Sunday Night Football game. If there was, then there would’ve been room for just 7 games during the regular Sunday slate. In week 8, there were only four games at 1:00 total (by comparison, this week, CBS can choose between 5 games for the 1:00 slot… and that’s just one network). You can see why this was a disaster.

Peter King, in [this 1993 article about the problems with the NFL]( http://www.si.com/vault/1993/12/06/130077/rx-for-the-nfl-pro-football-might-still-be-americas-favorite-game-but-with-fewer-stars-too-many-injuries-and-not-enough-offense-the-nfl-has-to-start-curing-what-ails-it), stated this about the double bye week system:

&gt; The double byes are a double disaster. A second bye week was added this season in order to stretch the network TV schedule to 18 weeks. The boneheaded result was that there were as few as 10 games per weekend through the first two months of the season, not 14. Fewer games, fewer chances for good games, obviously.

You also have to remember that this was one year before the advent of Sunday Ticket, and this was well before the creation of the RedZone. You got one game, and you were stuck with it depending on where you lived. Either way, the placement of the byes led to fewer games, when that was an easily avoidable problem.

**Reason #3: More Bye Weeks = Loss of Rhythm**

Roughly 75% of the league had 3 weeks in between their byes. For some perspective, imagine if after the Eagles play the Vikings this week, they had another bye week. It would seem way too close and could easily disrupt rhythms. Well, that’s what teams were complaining about with this two bye week system. Unless you were one of the lucky teams from a 5-team division that didn’t follow the same bye weeks as the rest of the league and actually had some time between the two bye weeks, you were off twice in five weeks.

All momentum that the Bears had going into their second bye week in 1993 was completely destroyed by the time they got out of that bye. The Kansas City Chiefs, after starting off 5-1 in their first 6 games, slipped to .500 in the 4 games following their second bye week. The Seattle Seahawks went from a .500 team to dropping 4 straight after their second bye week. The second bye week rarely helped a team, and normally impeded their progress.

**Could It Work Today?**

Times have changed. Roughly 25 years later, a lot has changed that could make a 2-bye week system feasible. Everyone hates the fourth preseason game, and that’s going to be gone sooner rather than later. Replacing one week of the season with that preseason game would allow 2 bye weeks to happen while, at the same time, keeping that bye week between the conference championships and the Super Bowl that has been there every year since the 2003 season (Super Bowl XXXVIII).

There are also more teams in the NFL than there were back in 1993. When 8 teams were off in 1993, only 10 games could be played during the week. However, when 8 teams are off in 2016 (which never happens), you can still play 12 games. Realistically speaking, the most teams off in any given week in 2016 is 6, which happens in week 8 and week 9. Even if having 6 teams off was a regular thing under an 18-week season, you’d still get 13 games, 11 of them coming on Sunday (since there would be a TNF and a MNF game). That’s still not a bad option for networks to have, especially when compared to 1993, when the system was so messed up that there were only four 1:00 games total at any given point.

However, the way to make it work today that was the critical error in 1993 would be to spread out the bye weeks. There are many good arguments as to why a team needs 2 bye weeks during a long regular season. However, there aren’t many good arguments as to why a team needs 2 bye weeks within 3 weeks of each other. With better spacing between bye weeks, a 2-bye week system during an 18-week season can work.

Let’s see a system like this in action. Let’s assume that under the 32-team format, that the NFL will implement a 2-bye week system and an 18-week season that still consists of just 16 games. This means that you’ve got to fill 64 bye week slots, and there needs to be a way to divide this evenly.

The best way to do this is to have an alternating pattern where one week, 4 teams get off, and the next week, 6 teams get off. This means that there would be 13 weeks where teams could have a bye week in an 18-week season. No team would have a bye week the first two weeks of the season, and no team would have a bye week the final three weeks of the season. Additionally, during Thanksgiving (if necessary), the alteration would stop, and only 4 teams would get a bye week (even if 4 teams had off the week before). The reason for this is simple- with 3 games now on Thanksgiving, a Monday night game, and a Sunday night game, if 6 teams got off on Thanksgiving, there would only be 8 games during the Thanksgiving day slate, which would be a 1993-esque disaster all over again.

Bye weeks would occur between weeks 3 and 15, so no team would have a bye week during weeks 1-2 and weeks 16-18. Every team would be guaranteed a bye week between weeks 3 and 9, and every team would be guaranteed a second bye week between weeks 9 and 15. There would be a minimum of 5 weeks between each bye week, so as not to totally disrupt the rhythm of teams playing (so you wouldn’t have a bye week in week 8 and then have one in week 10).

But how do you make it so that every week, there’s at least one good team playing? What happens if all the good teams are on bye during a given week, and then the networks are screwed and the ratings go down? This would all be protected by a European drawing of pots. I’m not kidding, NFL. You can literally televise when each team is having a bye week, and people will still watch. Televised or not, this would be how the NFL determines what teams are on bye. Here’s how it works:

Divide the NFL into 4 pots of 8 teams each, based off of the previous season’s results. Pot A would consist of every team that made it into the divisional round (picks 25-32). Pot B would consist of the next 4 best teams in the AFC and the next 4 best teams in the NFC. Pot C would consist of the next 4 best teams in each conference, and Pot D would consist of the worst 4 teams in each conference.

Then, after dividing the league into those 4 pots, you draw. For week 3, a team from Pot A, Pot B, Pot C, and Pot D are drawn. For week 4, a team from all four of those pots are drawn, plus an additional team from Pot A and Pot B. For week 5, a team from Pot C, Pot D, Pot A, and Pot B are drawn. For week 6, a team from all four of those pots are drawn, plus an additional team from Pot C and Pot D. Once each team is drawn once, that’s how the bye weeks are determined. Every drawing would have the same number of teams from each conference, so as to ensure fairness for all the networks. If you’re still confused, fear not, for there is a sample system of how this would all play out.

**Sample System**

This is based on the 2015 standings. First, we have to divide the teams into pots. Remember that there are 8 teams in each pot, with 4 in each conference.

Pot | AFC Teams | NFC Teams
---- | --------------- | --------------
A | Denver, New England, Kansas City, Pittsburgh | Carolina, Arizona, Green Bay, Seattle
B | Cincinnati, Houston, NY Jets, Buffalo | Minnesota, Washington, Atlanta, Los Angeles
C | Indianapolis, Oakland, Miami, Jacksonville | Detroit, Philadelphia, New Orleans, NY Giants
D | Baltimore, San Diego, Cleveland, Tennessee | Chicago, Tampa Bay, San Francisco, Dallas

Now that we have the pots, let’s assign the bye weeks for an 18-week system. Again, this is all a hypothetical. Remember that when it’s a 4-team bye week, we take one team from each pot, remembering to take 2 from the AFC and 2 from the NFC. When it’s a 6-team bye week, some pots will have 2 teams taken, but we will still have the same number in each conference. Also note that under this system, in 2016, Thanksgiving would fall on week 13 (it falls on week 12 this year, but since the season would be pushed up by one week, we’d have it on week 13).

Week | Bye Week Teams
------ | ----------------------
3 | New England (A), Washington (B), Oakland (C), San Francisco (D)
4 | Carolina (A), Cincinnati (B), Philadelphia (C), Baltimore (D), Pittsburgh (A), Los Angeles (B)
5 | Indianapolis (C), Dallas (D), Denver (A), Atlanta (B)
6 | NY Giants (C), Cleveland (D), Green Bay (A), Houston (B), Jacksonville (C), Tampa Bay (D)
7 | Seattle (A), NY Jets (B), New Orleans (C), Tennessee (D)
8 | Kansas City (A), Minnesota (B), Miami (C), Chicago (D), Arizona (A), Buffalo (B)
9 | Detroit (C), San Diego (D), New England (A), Washington (B)
10 | Oakland (C), San Francisco (D), Carolina (A), Cincinnati (B), Philadelphia (C), Baltimore (D)
11 | Pittsburgh (A), Los Angeles (B), Indianapolis (C), Dallas (D)
12 | Denver (A), Atlanta (B), NY Giants (C), Cleveland (D), Green Bay (A), Houston (B)
13 | Jacksonville (C), Tampa Bay (D), Seattle (A), NY Jets (B)
14 | New Orleans (C), Tennessee (D), Kansas City (A), Minnesota (B), Miami (C), Chicago (D)
15 | Arizona (A), Buffalo (B), Detroit (C), San Diego (D)

Notice how the whole thing repeats itself once we hit week 9? Now, under this system, this is when each team would receive their bye weeks. When you compare it to the 1993 system, it’s like night and day, especially in terms of the spacing out between bye weeks.

Team | Bye Week #1 | Bye Week #2
------ | ------- | ----------
NE | 3 | 9
NYJ | 7 | 13
MIA | 8 | 14
BUF | 8 | 15
HOU | 6 | 12
IND | 5 | 11
JAX | 6 | 13
TEN | 7 | 14
PIT | 4 | 11
BAL | 4 | 10
CIN | 4 | 10
CLE | 6 | 12
DEN | 5 | 12
KC | 8 | 14
OAK | 3 | 10
SD | 9 | 15
NYG | 6 | 12
PHI | 4 | 10
DAL | 5 | 11
WSH | 3 | 9
ATL | 5 | 12
CAR | 4 | 10
NO | 7 | 14
TB | 6 | 13
CHI | 8 | 14
DET | 9 | 15
GB | 6 | 12
MIN | 8 | 14
SEA | 7 | 13
SF | 3 | 10
ARZ | 8 | 15
LA | 4 | 11

There is still adequate spacing in between each team’s bye weeks, and even though a good team is going to be off at any given week, there are going to be other good games to complement that. If possible, they could even put something into the schedule that makes it so that whenever two teams in Pot A have a bye, that the national game that week consists of two of the remaining six teams in Pot A.

**Conclusion**

The two bye week system in 1993 was a colossal disaster, but that was because of poor planning from the NFL and because the world was not ready for a two bye week system in terms of having the Sunday Ticket and the RedZone. No longer are fans stuck with just one game. That being said, when close to 30% of the league was off any given week, when only four games were being shown at 1:00, when there was no spacing out between the bye weeks, and when the bye week between the conference championships and the Super Bowl was removed, you can clearly see why it failed.

With better planning, a 2-bye week system can work in today’s NFL. If there was a way to adequately space out the bye weeks and make it so that marquee games would be guaranteed to occur, even if certain marquee teams are on break, then the league would strongly consider going back to their old ways and reconsidering a 2-bye week schedule over 18 weeks. It gets rid of the fourth preseason game, it adds more meaningful football while being significantly less taxing on the players, and increases revenue and the television contracts. With the proper system in place, a system like this can be a win-win for all parties involved.

GoinValyrianOnDatAss,2016-10-20 05:39:46+00:00,LumeriCo is the New Overwatch,"Today, Sombra continued the ARG, eventually leading us to the LumeriCo website where we “hacked” into some email correspondence between some employees. 

I believe those employees are the members of the new Overwatch, and they were speaking in code the whole time.


&amp;nbsp;
**The Hero Compass:**
-
A few months ago, the ARG lead us to creating this image:
Some speculated that [this image](http://wiki.gamedetectives.net/images/d/d7/Overwatch_map.jpg) could have to do with the Dorado fountain, as it looks a bit like a compass from above. In the end, we went no further with this picture, I think it has significance now.


&amp;nbsp;

**One of the translated emails states**:

As you all know, the nuclear plant Dorado enter service on November 1. It is a very special day for everyone in LumériCo as with activation, we will have completed the vision we had in the beginning when we started LumériCo and we will be assuming the task of providing Mexico a network and infrastructure worldwide. As Dorado is my home, and of course, home to LumériCo, I thought it would be appropriate to commemorate the occasion. As Dorado is my home, and of course, home to LumériCo, I thought it would be appropriate to commemorate the occasion. We will be organizing a small celebration with the community in the central square in Market Street and I was pleased that each employee could come accompanied by his family.

I have no words to express the pride and happiness I feel to have reached this monumental goal. And this win is through hard work, dedication, and vision of each member of LumériCo.

With infinite gratitude, William

&amp;nbsp;

**Analysis:**

The line, “We will be organizing a small celebration with the community in the central square in Market Street and I was pleased that each employee could come accompanied by his family.” is of the most significance. 


The celebration obviously happened already in the Durado market, the party remnants are still there. There are nine unique employee names in the emails, and nine heroes in the found compass picture. I think Blizzard is referencing us trying to put the fountain and compass picture together in this line.

**Here's what I've come up with:**

* Gonzalo Flores = D. Va

We know that everyone has been waiting for this announcement: finally retire the old espresso machine and buy a new one. It will be ready and waiting on Monday, so they can start the week as it should.

&amp;nbsp;

**Analysis:**

This looks like it is a message from D. Va (explained later), to Blizzard. She is asking them to fix Bastion.
The espresso machine is likely code for Bastion. Bastion started making noises that turned out to be Morse Code today. The Morse Code has since stopped, but the final Blizzard email seems to be saying that they are going to be adding a reworked Bastion into the game sometime before Monday, which matches up with the earlier mention of a new PTR patch here:
The PTR patch is supposed to introduce “significant hero changes”. It’s possible that Blizzard intends to release the PTR patch tomorrow between 3:00pm and 4:00pm tomorrow.

&amp;nbsp;

**Analysis:** 

The keyboard here could either be just a regular keyboard, or possibly referring to D.Va’s mech. Either way, many of Gonzalo’s email responses contain emojis, even a “winky face”. 

Gonzalo also says that she gets away with doing whatever she wants because at least some of the others are her followers. I think this is actually just a rough translation to fans. A couple of the heroes in-game voice lines indicate that they are fans of D.Va.

Pedro then responds to D. Va by saying “Siiiiiiiiii, maeeeeeeeeesssssssstrrrrrrroooooo”. I think this is just there to point out that Pedro is a fan of D.Va’s.

It took me awhile to figure out who Yolanda Mejia was, but with some clues and process of elimination I figured she must be Tracer. Yolanda is referred to as “she” in one of the emails, so I assumed she was either Tracer, Mercy, or Symmetra. Having the title of Shipping Manager makes the most sense with regards to Tracer as it has to do with moving things around a lot, which I imagine Tracer would be pretty good at.

Affair: Rest is important

Hello everyone:

In recent months the number of employees working overtime has been increasing. I am honored and excited by the level of dedication and passion that motivates this behavior, but they must know that they should not sacrifice their personal lives. This company was created to benefit society, and society includes every one of the members of LumériCo.
Please take advantage of their paid vacation. They are to use them.

Regards,

&amp;nbsp;

**Analysis:**

In this email, the increasing number of employees working overtime is likely referring to the increase in number of heroes joining the new Overwatch and/or the heroes dying to Reaper, Widowmaker, and Co. 

I don’t think the paid vacation actually has anything to do with vacation, and is actually referring to special weapons that they have been developing to help the new members. It seems like some heroes haven’t been using the special weapons to their full extent and have been dying because of it.

&amp;nbsp;

**Analysis:**

This email lead to finding D.Va’s private .git repo during the ARG. I believe this is Valeria Valderrama telling D.Va her .git may have been hacked and that the situation may have escalated to “Miss Jimenez”.

Miss Jimenez is probably a codename for Sombra, they’re aware of her presence and believe she is the one possibly accessing the .git. Seeing as Sombra sent us there in the ARG, they were right.

Can you check?

This is referring to Sombra accessing their website, likely during a mission they were on last week, somewhere far from electricity (Maybe hinting towards a new map?).

&amp;nbsp;

Hello, William.

The concert was spectacular! It was worth waiting so long.

To your question most people in my structure takes, on average, 67.4 hours of vacation per year. Do you agree with what you intuías?

**Analysis:**

Gabriela Moyano is another employee with a title. This one is Chief Technology Officer, and who do we know that’s fascinated with new technologies? Symmetra. She also ends her response with “Cordially” which, of all the Overwatch heroes, Symmetra seems the most likely to be so professional.

I think they’re discussing a new tech here when they talk about a concert, possibly to do with Lucio.

The name Marco, and the number 67.4 seems to be Blizzard showing their appreciation towards the fan artist [Marko Raassina](http://markraas.tumblr.com), the 67.4  specifically referring to this [comic](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/4mb9gp/674_of_my_overwatch_experience/).

This one ended up being kind of funny. Rodrigo Mendoza is a character played by Robert De Niro in the 1986 film, “The Mission”. In the film, Rodrigo Mendoza is a sword wielding bad guy who ends up dueling his brother. Genji used to be a bad guy, wields a sword, and dueled his brother.

Silvia is an American country music singer from the 1980s, one of her big hits was called “Tumbleweed”. McCree is an American cowboy who spawns a tumbleweed when he ults.

There’s a real life Los Angeles singer who goes by Miguel and puts out a style of music called neo soul, which sounds very much like Lucio’s music. The name combined with the music style seems like enough evidence to say that the Miguel mentioned in this email is probably Lucio.

I'm thinking there never was a dinner, and they were actually doing a mission or training exercises, something of that nature.


&amp;nbsp;
**The Remaining Heroes:**
-

The last two heroes left on the compass picture is Mercy and Winston. The only names that haven’t had a face put to them yet is Valeria Valderrama and Pedro Munoz. 

The only real hint towards who Valeria is, is Pedro referring to her as a “her” and as Val Val. The nickname seems to indicate that they’re friends, and Winston and Mercy go way back to the beginnings of Overwatch. Since Mercy is the only girl left, Valeria must be her.

There’s a bit more evidence that Pedro is Winston. Pedro is a fan of D. Va, and we know that Winston at least watches Hearthstone so it’s not much of a stretch to imagine he may be into E-Sports in general. On top of that, he shows interest in D. Va’s new keyboard and he’s one of the few techy heroes in Overwatch.

The last remaining person mentioned in the emails is William Page, who is obviously the leader. I’m unsure if this is actually Soldier 76 or just the benefactor who owns LumeriCo, and is therefore funding Overwatch. Some of the ways he speaks in the emails is very Jack Morrison-esque. Talking of pride, hard work, dedication, vision, and honor.


&amp;nbsp;

**Extra Thoughts:**
-
A couple extra hints towards LumeriCo being a cover for the new Overwatch. 

&amp;nbsp;

**The fountain in Dorado says:**

“Even the darkest night gives way to dawn""

""In honor of the fallen during darkness""

""Be reborn in the light""


""And never be forgotten”


&amp;nbsp;

The power plant is supposed to come online on November 1st, the Day of the Dead. “Be reborn in the light” fits pretty well here. If Overwatch comes online that day, Overwatch will be being reborn in the light of the plant.


&amp;nbsp;

**Sombra sent us this message:**

I'm congratulating you for getting in here. I only wanted to know if you were ready or not. (Hey, it's really difficult to get good help lately... you should see some of the clowns I'm working with). For now, let's continue with the true challenge: taking down Lumerico Corp president Guillermo Portero. Why? Because he's a greedy and corrupt man, and an abominable thief. His plan of bringing in line the most powerful and biggest zigurat the 1st of November is nothing more than a deceit, an elaborate plan by his gang to become even more influential in the people of Mexico and get more money. And who's gonna pay for that? Common people, the ones that are always forgotten.

I've started upgrading my protocols so that they are used to take down the Lumerico Corp infraestructure and Los Muertos are also trying to go against the corruption. Meanwhile, search the Lumerico Corp site for info we can use against the bastard, or better, get his username and password so that hundreds ""not so favorable"" facts about the president start popping up.

I was able to get the username and pass of a Lumerico Corp employee, start here:

GFlores/g#fNwP5qJ

&amp;nbsp;

**Analysis**


Depending on how you interpret it, Sombra could be taking a stand against Overwatch here. She could be part of the large amount of people that believe that Overwatch would cause more harm than good. She says the common people would suffer, and she talks about the Lumerico president’s gang. What gang is she referring to? She might be talking about Overwatch.

&amp;nbsp;

In my opinion, Sombra knows that Lumerico is a cover for Overwatch, and she knows that they’re about to resurface. I think she “hired” us to get into their website to reveal their plans to the world. I think we’re unintentionally working for the bad guys to stop Overwatch.

Let me know what you guys think, I’ll update this post with any more info anyone might have.

EDIT: I'm hearing that William Porter is actually a miss translation with Google Translate and his name is actually Guilliame Portero. This is the owner of LumeriCo and is likely NOT Soldier 76. He's probably just a benefactor that wants to see Overwatch rebuilt.

Looked on my car group today and saw it reached multiple facebook groups. Gotta love social media. I posted this as a Hail Mary to see if anything would pop up and sure enough his family heard from him and he's just blowing off steam. Thanks again. In a side not I see a lot of people in my area on here pm me if anyone wants to go canyon cruising!

Hello r/cars 
Realize this isn't a normal post but gonna get right to the point. I have a friend who me and the car group we are part of hasn't heard from in a week. He left another friends house on Thursday and no one has heard from him since. We have looked at hospitals police stations etc. Hoping anyone in the SoCal area(specifically Los Angeles/West Hollywood) can keep an eye out for a silver S2K with a SoCal lateral g sticker on the side and a highway 2 sticker on the rear wind guard thing that's on the back of the seats. Also keep an eye out on the canyons for him. We don't think he took a canyon home but just covering everything. He frequents Angeles crest, little t, and the Malibu canyons. No need for upvotes just your eyes. 
Thanks

Edit 2: thank you everyone for the help and good wishes really really appreciate it. I will update with any news that I receive. His family asked us to let them  handle things with the police so we are just looking on the streets and canyons. 

Edit 3: thank you so much for all the support again. Just some details so you don't have to read through all the comments. A police report has been filed. He has an iPhone but seems to be off, dead or has no service. Been going up canyons to see if we can see anything. Will update when I have more news. Trying to respond to as many comments as I can.

**DISCLAIMER:** This is not a list of criminal record as much as it is a list of arrests.

quickonthedrawl,2016-10-04 13:28:15+00:00,"Week 5 D/ST Scoring, 2016","*{ [Week 1](https://empeopled.com/p/92946) | [Week 2](https://empeopled.com/p/93452) | [Week 3](https://empeopled.com/p/93764) | [Week 4](https://empeopled.com/p/94058) }*

Welcome back!

For the most part, Week 4 was not too harsh. Patriots D/ST owners may say otherwise, but there were very few duds overall. That does not mean it was a good week though; as you can see in the article, the correlations for both these rankings and FantasyPros ECR were below par for the week, though both were almost exactly in line with each other.

Thankfully, there were only a few really punishing landmines. The Chiefs were one, although that was a tough sell a week ago anyway. The Ravens were another, but the matchup was obviously bad from the start. The Jets were pretty bad too, although once Wilson was a full go, they lost all of their luster. And even the Patriots, as disappointing as they were in every facet of the game, still scored 6 points. Otherwise, despite the low correlation, D/STs mostly kept our heads above water. They averaged 7.8 D/ST points in Week 4.

We are starting to get into the meat of the season. Most teams now are who they've shown themselves to be over the first four weeks, both offensively and defensively. 

**[Defense Wins Championships, Week 5](https://empeopled.com/p/94322)**

This week's top teams (MFL Standard scoring):

Rank | Team | Points | Tier | Notes
:--------: | :-------- | :--------: | :--------: | :--------
1 | Minnesota Vikings | 11.9 | 1 |  Last night was a bad fantasy game and they still scored 8 points
2 | Carolina Panthers | 10.2 | 1 | One more chance to shine?
3 | New England Patriots | 10.2 | 1 | Do not expect a repeat of Sunday anytime soon 
4 | Denver Broncos | 10.2 | 1 | Duh
5 | Philadelphia Eagles | 10.2 | 1 | Still might be knocking on the door of ""plug-and-play""
6 | Los Angeles Rams | 9.4 | 2 | Who the hell knows what to do with this team?
7 | Arizona Cardinals | 9.4 | 2 | Not worried yet, but I'm close
8 | Green Bay Packers | 9.2 | 2 | Going to be seeing the Packers a lot in this range, give or take

**(The top 16 teams, and whichever extras are on the same tier as #16, can be found in the link above)**

Most ""Should I start Team A or Team B!?"" questions can be answered very simply by the rankings. There's no magic to it, especially this early in the season. If you have the option of Team A or Team B, and both teams are on the same tier, then the distinction between them is very marginal! Do not stress yourself out about choosing between them. Look at the following week's matchup to see if either option has an edge, and then go from there. Remember, if your league uses different scoring from MFL (which is similar - but not exactly the same - as ESPN, Yahoo!, CBS, et al), then you may need to use some of your own intuition to parse two similar choices.

Best of luck in Week 5!",fantasyfootball,1379

______________

**The Pick and Ban phase:**

During League of Legends matches, players go through a Pick and Ban phase before you start the game. This is where players choose which champions they want to play and which champions they want to ban. Teams get 3 bans each per game.
Pick and Ban in League of Legends works like this: Teams will take it in turns banning champions until 6 bans have been made. The team on the left side will ban first, then the team on the right and so on. Once bans are done, the team on the left will pick a champion first. Then 2 players from the right side will pick, then 2 players from the left side, then 2 players from the right side, again 2 players from the left and last but not least the final person on the right side will pick a champion.

______________

**Meta:**

So, to get a bit more knowledge before watching Worlds, here is the 'structure' of a game of League of Legends. Games are *usually* played 1 person **top** - 1 person **mid** - 2 people **bot** and 1 person in the **jungle**. (note - In Worlds some teams will place 2 top and 1 bot and occasionally there may be 2 in the jungle with a roaming support to help the jungler). 

**Top lane** is usually tankier/fighter type champions, **Mid lane** is usually Ability power/Mage type OR Attack damage casters/Assassins, **Jungle** is usually fighter/bruiser type champions and **Bottom lane** is one Attack Damage Carry and one Support champion. Each region has their own playstyle that they use and will be seen throughout every game. Some teams will prefer to farm and only fight late game, some teams will play extremely aggressive and try to fight early on in the game.

______________

**Objectives:**

In League of Legends there are multiple neutral objectives for both teams to take. Slaying these mighty creatures will provide bonuses to the player. The objectives that both teams have on their sides of the map are Red Brambleback, Blue Sentinel and Scuttle Crab. Red Brambleback is a lizard creature accompanied by 2 smaller lizards. When slain, he will provide you with a buff that provides your attacks with a slow that also deals damage over time and heals you over time. Blue Sentinel is a big golem creature accompanied by 2 smaller sentinels. When slain, he will provide you with a buff that grants you 10% cooldown reduction and greatly increased mana regeneration. Scuttle Crab is a small crab that moves up and down the river. When slain, Scuttle Crab drops a large movement speed buff on the ground for your team, instead of this being an individual buff it stays on the ground and also grants small vision around the area.

Those who are brave enough will also attempt more monstrous creatures like **Baron Nashor**, **Dragon** and **Rift Herald**. Baron Nashor is a giant worm monster from the Void. He spawns at the 20 minute mark and he typically requires all 5 members of your team to defeat. If Baron Nashor is slain, the team that kills him will gain a significant buff which increases your teams attack damage, ability power, a shortened recall (4 seconds instead of 8) and it will empower your teams minions when you are near them.

Dragon will spawn as one of 4 different Elemental Dragons. Only one of them can be in the game at once and when Dragon is killed, he will respawn as a different Elemental Dragon. Killing these Dragons will provide bonuses to the team. **Cloud Drake** grants 25 / 50 / 75 bonus movement speed while out of combat. **Infernal Drake** grants 8 / 16 / 24% increased attack damage and ability power. **Mountain Drake** grants 10 / 20 / 30% additional damage as true damage to Epic Monsters and turrets. **Ocean Drake** grants a buff that restores 4 / 8 / 12% of missing health and missing mana over 5 seconds every 8 seconds while out of combat. Once the game reaches 35 minutes, these dragons cease to spawn and instead the **Elder Drake** will spawn. Slaying the **Elder Drake** grants (45 × Elder Dragons slain) (+ 45 for every elemental dragon stack) true damage on all spells and basic attacks against non-turrets over 3 seconds.
The strength of all elemental dragon buffs is also increased by 50% for the duration. This lasts for 120 seconds and is incredibly powerful.

Rift Herald spawns 6 minutes into the game and de-spawns permanently at 19:45 as Baron Nashor doesn't like company. Killing Rift Herald grants you 5% damage reduction while no allied champions near and Corruption: At 100 charges, your next basic attack discharges all stacks of Corruption, dealing 15-270 magic damage (at levels 1-18, damage halved for ranged champions). This buff lasts for 20 minutes.

______________

**Vision:**

Vision is a vital part of League of Legends. Vision is granted by 3 different trinkets that every player can purchase for 0 gold at level 1 (with the exception of Orb that can only be purchased at level 9). Lens, Orb and Totem. These can all be upgraded once you reach level 9 in-game to improve their effectiveness. Lens is Red, Orb is Blue and the Totem is Yellow. Sweeping/Greater Lens allows for stealth detection in a small area when used. Scrying/Farsight Orb reveals a location on the map for 5 seconds (this is not global). Warding/Greater totem places a ward on the map where placed. You can also purchase an item called **Sightstone** that allows you to place up to 3 wards on the map before running out of charges (charges can be refilled by returning to the fountain).

______________

**Items:**

During a game of League of Legends you need to purchase items to become stronger. These items range from increasing your attack damage, granting you health, giving you more movement speed and so on. It's hard to go in depth about the items simply because there are too many to name on here. If you want to know more information about a specific item, you can find a full list of them here: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Item 


______________

**Key words/terms that you'll hear during Worlds:**

 - Minions - Minions are the small red and blue things you see in the lanes. Killing them grants the player gold and experience.

 - CS - CS or Creep Score is the amount of Minion kills that a player has.

 - Last hit - Last hitting is the act of waiting till a minion has low health to be able to kill it with one basic attack.

 - Farming - killing as many minions or monsters as possible while avoiding fighting in order to purchase items quickly.

 - Gank - A teammate going to the top, mid or bottom lane to help kill the enemy.

 - Armor + Magic Resist: Armor is a stat that provides protection to Physical Damage. Magic Resist provides protection to abilities that deal Magic Damage

 - Lane swap - A player not playing in the usual lane. E.G. A top lane champion playing in the bottom lane whilst the teams Bottom lane champions play in the top lane.

 - Recall - An ability that allows you to go back to your base after channeling for 8 seconds.

 - Flash - A spell that allows the player to instantly move a short distance with a 5 minute cooldown.

 - Teleport - A spell that allows the player to teleport to an allied tower, ward or minion with a 5 minute cooldown. If a player cancels teleport whilst channeling, the cooldown is reduced by 100 seconds.

 - Cooldown - When an ability/spell is used it cannot be used again for a certain amount of time, the Cooldown is that amount of time.

 - Turret/tower - The big towers in the lanes that do damage to minions and champions, They must be destroyed in order to destroy the enemies base.

 - Inhibitor - The inhibitors are three hexagonal structures that must be destroyed in order to destroy the enemies base. Destroying them grants your team Super minions that will spawn.

 - Nexus - The nexus is the big structure with a giant crystal at the back of the base. Destroying the enemies Nexus is the main goal of the game and must be destroyed in order to win (Unless the enemy team surrenders).

 - Movement Speed - Movement speed is the rate at which your champion moves. Boots are a core item on every champion that provide an amount of movement speed with different unique effects.

 - Attack Speed - Attack Speed is the rate of fire that your champion has. 2.000 Attack Speed would mean your champion fires 2 basic attacks a second. Attack Damage Carries are the main champions that use Attack Speed items.

 - Attack Damage - Attack Damage is a value affecting the damage a unit or champion is able to deal by increasing the damage dealt by basic attacks and abilities. While every basic attack deals damage equivalent to the champions attack damage (before applying damage modifiers), abilities scale with a percentage of the champions attack damage that can range between 0% and 1200%. Attack Damage mainly increases the damage of abilities that deal **Physical Damage**.

 - Ability Power - Ability Power is a champion statistic that increases the effectiveness of most abilities. It stacks additively. Ability Power mainly increases the damage of abilities that deal **Magic Damage**.

madkingray,2016-09-27 16:45:32+00:00,Oxiclean Whore,"So I’ve got a roommate problem. Let’s call him Slippery Pete. I share a 978 sq ft loft with Pete and one other guy (Dave) in Downtown Los Angeles (rent sucks here, you guys). That is there are no walls. What we have are an assortment of bookshelves, sheets on wardrobe racks, oriental screens, street found plywood, an extra large surfboard, and other assorted goodwill pickups. The plan was for this loft to be cheap bachelor’s paradise: home and getaway to three freelance guys and a dog who weren’t making the most money in LA when we signed a lease. 

It’s a glorified locker-room. With Pete as that gross, hairy guy pantsing freshmen and thinking his dick tucking mangina jokes never get old.

Over the course of this year Pete has done the following:

-	not had money for rent on four separate occasions, forcing me and Dave to pay his share in the hope of being paid back. Now sometimes this thing is understandable. LA can be fucking hard, man. However, Pete would consistently say he had the money up until THE DAY RENT WAS DUE as he “didn’t want to bother us before he needed to” forcing Dave and I to suddenly fork over cash we’d never planned on forking over 

-	not paying the electric bill for five months. It was in his name and we’d been giving him money for every bill. When the power didn’t go off the first time he was late he figured he could keep taking the money from us without a problem. His logic was that he was using this money to pay us back for the rent he owed us. Aka taking our money and giving us back the same money as if he’d earned it. Well, the power went off. That didn’t go over well. But that's another story.

-	He only eats Carl’s Jr and dollar store microwavable food. I call him the Jackson Pollack of toilet bowl art

-	Lastly, he never buys supplies for the apartment. Oh boy does this one bug me. No paper towels, no toilet paper, no dish soap, and he even has the gall to use my Oxiclean. The Oxiclean I’ve been buying throughout the year. For that’s one thing about Pete that I don’t get. He never has money for rent, he fills himself with junk food, his life in general is a complete mess, and yet his wardrobe is expensive and spectacular. And he’s OCD about it. Spending hours – legitimate HOURS – ironing and preparing his shirts and jeans for the week. In doing this he typically SOAKS shirts in my Oxiclean then leaves the bottle empty, waiting for me to buy another. 

So on laundry day (2pm on an unemployed Tuesday) I went to grab my Oxiclean and that’s exactly what I found: an empty bottle. However, instead of getting angry or heading out the door for CVS, that lightbulb of petty revenge exploded like a gallant firework over my head. I filled that bottle to the brim with goddamn tap water and hand soap.
It’s been a few months now. Every time that bottle runs low or empty I fill it right back up with water and soap. He’s the only one who uses the bottle (I have my own hidden for me and Dave). It’s become a light in an otherwise stressful home life. I’ll come home after a bad day at work, or Pete will be up to his usual antics like leaving pubic hair in the sink, and I'll want to beat the loose watery shit out of him. Yet then I'll remember 1-2 times a week I see him soaking his stained clothes with tap water and SoftSoap. And in that moment a calm comes over me and that locker-room feels a little bit like that cheap paradise I'd hoped it would be.


(Disclaimer: why have we not kicked him out? One, Pete is a very old friend of Dave's and Dave hasn't had the heart. Dave also came into a bit of money this year and was able to cover most of the rent costs, where I didn't lose out on that much money. Two, if we kicked him out there is ZERO chance of us finding a replacement for this loft. Three, Dave and I are moving out in two weeks. I have no idea where Pete is going and I don't care.)

Caleb_Pitts,2016-09-19 16:28:50+00:00,Dwight Howard's Shoulders: An In-Depth Analysis,"**Dwight Howard** -- 5x 3-point maker, 5x First Team All-NBA Center, 10x Father, and also a [very large pair of shoulders.](http://i.imgur.com/2RUYMi7.jpg)

**But what makes him tick?**

It’s his shoulders. His shoulders make him tick.

**But what makes his shoulders tick?**

That’s the kind of question we’ll be answering today. How did his shoulders get so big? How big are his shoulders? Why are my shoulders so small? I’m self conscious about my small shoulders, how do I make them big? Most of these will be answered, but probably not all of them.

**HISTORY:**

Dwight David Howard was born December 8, 1985, to two parents. I could look up who those two parents are, but instead let’s say his dad was Wilt Chamberlain, on account of his boning ability, and his mom was Goro from Mortal Kombat, on account of his shoulders. The doctor made no note of Dwight’s shoulders at birth, but he did describe the newborn as “a bad locker room presence”.

Dwight had a normal childhood, shoulder-wise, [and even when he was drafted his shoulders weren’t big enough to distract from his actual existing braces](http://i.imgur.com/0mzFnMl.jpg). Dwight’s shoulders slowly grew through his first four years in the NBA though, with widespread attention being brought to them in the 2008 Slam Dunk Contest, in which Dwight performed his winning dunk as [his crime-stopping alter ego “Shouldersman”](http://i.imgur.com/t8n6lm0.jpg). The dunk was so impressive that it actually restarted judge Julius Erving’s heart, which no one noticed had abruptly stopped beating earlier in the competition. Upon regaining consciousness, Erving gave the dunk an eight out of ten.

After a 3-peat of DPOY awards and a trip to the finals, Dwight’s dominance as the best center in the league started to wane. In 2012, Howard reportedly missed 35 practices with the Orlando Magic, citing scheduling conflicts with his many parent-teacher conferences. That was a joke, by the way. Dwight doesn’t know where his kids go to school.

After a messy break from the Magic, Dwight headed to Los Angeles to make more children and play alongside a macaroni sculpture of Steve Nash. Hopes were high for the Lakers, but the team never reached it’s full potential due to a number of problems, including injuries to the sculpture of Steve Nash which, again, was made of fragile, dried macaroni. The seemingly stacked team was swept in the first round of the playoffs. Dwight and his shoulders left LA at the end of the season, seeing the writing on the wall, which spelled “GET OUT” and was written in blood by teammate Kobe Bryant.

Before starting his next season in Houston, Dwight hit the gym hard. Man, he was working on his shoulders every damn day in every way he could think of, he was taking all the groceries from his car to his house in a single trip like some roided up lunatic, he was picking up his kids for the first time in their lives, then putting them down, then picking them up again, just to get a workout in. He was determined to make this his year, and he had new, oddly specific goals; He was gonna make his shoulders the most iconic physical trait in the NBA. What was his competition? He couldn’t think of any

Dwight landed in Houston, already wearing his Rockets jersey (It was actually a t-shirt when he put it on, but his shoulders are so big at this point that they burst through any shirt he tries to wear, making it a jersey) and ready to take his crown. James Harden met him when he got off the plane, they shook hands, Dwight was called for a foul, and Harden took two free throws. A couple weeks in, practice was going great. Dwight thought this year was gonna be his season, until one day, when browsing the Rocket’s online store, Dwight started noticing all the beard-related James Harden merchandise, and not noticing all the shoulder-related Dwight Howard merchandise, because there wasn’t any.

How could he have been so stupid? Of course James harden has the most iconic physical trait in the NBA, beards are a “thing” right now. Dwight couldn’t wait till shoulders were a “thing”, that’s gonna be dope, because it will definitely happen. But, for now, he was pretty steamy about all this.

At team workouts the next day, Harden was struggling to bench press two helium filled balloons.
“Hey, could I get a spot?” He asked Dwight. Dwight silently nodded, knowing this was his chance. He got in spotting position, fingers on the bar that, if dropped, could end James Harden and his beard, making Dwight’s shoulders the #1 physical trait in the whole NBA. At that very second, two imaginary shoulders appeared on Dwight’s not-imaginary shoulders, one with red horns and a pitchfork, the other with angel wings and a halo, a la The Emperor’s New Groove.

“Do it! Drop the bar!” Sneered the Devil shoulder, who was trying a little too hard.

“Don’t drop it! Think of the Kardashians!” said the Angel shoulder, with a reference that was very relevant at the time this story takes place.

Dwight didn't know what to do. Should he take his chance to end his only competition, or should he not murder James Harden? It was a tough decision, but then Dwight remembered that if he committed murder, his children would always know where he lived, because he’d live in jail. He would have no excuse to not see them, and he couldn’t let that happen.

Dwight held the bar while James Harden finished working out. “Hey, I’m not sure why I’m saying this, because obviously you never considered doing it, but thanks for not murdering me, it would have been really easy.” said Harden. They high-fived, Harden took 2 free throws, and Dwight gave up on his dream shoulders, leaving for atlanta a couple seasons later.

And that’s the true history of his shoulders. Let’s move on.

**IMPORTANCE:**

**How important are the shoulders to Dwight’s game?**

Short Answer: Very important

Long Answer: Very important. So important that I, Caleb Pitts, will go on record saying that without shoulders, Dwight Howard would be significantly worse at basketball. If Dwight’s amount of shoulders was accurately listed as “none”, it’s safe to assume that he would have difficulty in three distinct areas that are important to his play-style, and possibly more:

**Dunking:** This jumps out immediately because, without the rotator cuff in his shoulder joint, Dwight would not be able to stretch his arms above his clavicle higher than the distance of his elbow to his fingertips. Dwight is listed as 265 pounds (although he would be closer to 190 without his shoulders), and to compensate for the loss of length, he would have to increase his jumping strength exponentially. This re-conditioning might prove difficult, and could sap a key element from his game. My recommendation would be to duct tape all of his children to himself while training in order to strengthen his legs, simultaneously fulfilling his legally required time-spent with each of his unwanted kids.

**Holding the Ball:** This is probably the biggest one because, without shoulders, there’s very little hope that Dwight Howard would be able to hold a basketball with two hands. This is especially devastating to his career, because his career is playing basketball. The saving grace here is that Dwight has large enough hands that he can easily palm a basketball, but even still, there’s not much you can do with any sort of ball if you genuinely have zero shoulders.

**Producing Children:** Dwight Howard has a lot of sex with a lot of different women. There’s no doubt that would probably change if he had his shoulders voluntarily removed because, as you can see in [this professional artist’s rendition, he looks pretty weird without any shoulders](http://i.imgur.com/5E5ycRY.jpg). One of Dwight Howard’s personal goals is, as he put it, “Having enough kids that I can celebrate a birthday every day. I really love birthdays.” Having no shoulders would, in all likelihood, keep him from accomplishing this.

**ANALYSIS:**

**So, what does this all mean?**

Not much.

[I tried e-mailing a professor at my local university to get a more academic view of Dwight’s shoulders, but they didn’t seem interested.](http://i.imgur.com/VQisWyU.jpg) So I guess I gotta do this part myself. Fuuuck man I was really counting on that guy.

Ok. So. Math. Here I go. I’m gonna do it.

Per bball reference, Dwight’s best overall season was his 2010-2011 season with the Magic. That year, he put up monster numbers defensively, earning a DPOY award, and dropping 22 ppg on the other end of the floor. This is definitely a fact, but what does it have to do with his shoulders? I don’t know yet. How does Zach Lowe do this shit?

OK I GOT IT. [Here’s a picture of Dwight’s shoulders in 2010, his best year.](http://i.imgur.com/PmHlFvb.jpg) Those shoulders are looking massive, man. Straight boulder shoulders. Now, let’s look at [a picture of his shoulders from this last season](http://i.imgur.com/viUdQeA.jpg). Looking a little lacking, honestly. I mean, compared to an average human they’re still hilariously big, but compared to Dwight Howard, those thangs are looking a little tiny. His averages for this past season were 13.7/11.8/1.7 which, much like his shoulders, are looking a little puny comparatively. Is that a coincidence? Probably not, I don’t really know.

Ok so i’m gonna say there’s a positive correlation between the size of Dwight’s shoulders and his caliber of play on the floor. To further back that up, [here’s a picture of his shoulders his rookie year](http://i.imgur.com/cmFuYD9.jpg), when he was only posting 12 ppg. Lookin’ pretty dorky man, lookin’ pretty scrawny honestly. I think this proves it, Dwight’s peak game coincides with his peak shoulders. Peak shoulders was the 2010-2011 season, and if he ever wants to get back to elite performance as a player, he’s gonna need to get back to that elite level of shoulders. I’m gonna ballpark the difference in mass between Dwight’s current shoulders and his peak shoulders at 14.7%. Yeah, that sounds right. So, in conclusion….

***For Dwight to return to his borderline MVP performance level, he needs to increase his shoulder mass by 14.7%.***

Holy shit I did it. Bitch I feel like Nate Silver.

Welcome back!

Week 1 is always a little rough, and 2016 is no exception. For the most part the surprises weren't too traumatic, but overall it was a very low-scoring week. Only one team scored a D/ST TD, although they did it twice, and the rest of the league kept their scoring fairly tame. Kansas City and Los Angeles were the two biggest disappointments, whereas Minnesota, Miami, and San Francisco all vastly outperformed expectations.

The average MFL score on the week was just 5.8 points. Expect that to bump up by almost 3 points going forward (for reference, 2015 averaged 8.5 points per game among all D/STs).

Week 2 gives us a few solid options for streamers, as well as a few teams that rank a little lower than I certainly expected to see. It will be interesting to see how it all turns out!

**[Defense Wins Championships, Week 2](https://empeopled.com/p/93452)**

This week's top teams (MFL Standard scoring):

Rank | Team | Points | Tier | Notes
:--------: | :-------- | :--------: | :--------: | :--------
1 | Carolina Panthers | 11.3 | 1 | SF nowhere near as good as in Week 1
2 | New England Patriots | 10.1 | 1 | Lock in the Patriots for the next few weeks
3 | Denver Broncos | 9.7 | 2 | 
4 | Pittsburgh Steelers | 9.6 | 2 | Primary streaming option
5 | Seattle Seahawks | 9.3 | 2 | Don't be fooled, they should be tier 1
6 | NY Jets | 9.2 | 2 | Secondary streaming option
7 | Houston Texans | 9.2 | 2 | 
8 | Philadelphia Eagles | 8.8 | 3 | Tertiary streaming option

**(The top 16 teams, and whichever extras are on the same tier as #16, can be found in the link above)**

Most ""Should I start Team A or Team B!?"" questions can be answered very simply by the rankings. There's no magic to it, especially this early in the season. If you have the option of Team A or Team B, and both teams are on the same tier, then the distinction between them is very marginal! Do not stress yourself out about choosing between them. Look at the following week's matchup to see if either option has an edge, and then go from there. Remember, if your league uses different scoring from MFL (which is similar - but not exactly the same - as ESPN, Yahoo!, CBS, et al), then you may need to use some of your own intuition to parse two similar choices.

Best of luck in Week 2!",fantasyfootball,2122

interiorlittlevenice,2016-09-13 00:11:57+00:00,Why don't we 're-use' open worlds?,"I've been playing Watch_Dogs again (which is surprisingly better than I remember it), and I was struck today by what seems like an extraordinary waste of an excellent open world environment.  

One of the big problems game developers of all stripes have is that art and level design are by far the most resource and labour-intensive parts of game development.   Whereas an indie film maker can apply for a permit, gather together a crew and film in the same New York City as the director of a $200m blockbuster - and can capture the same intensity in their actors, the same flickering smile or glint in the eye, for an indie game developer this is an impossible task.  We mock the 2D pixel art of many an indie game, but the reality is that the same 'realistic' modern graphics seen in the AAA space are beyond the financial resources of any small studio.  

This resource crisis also manifests itself at AAA studios.  When the base cost of an immersive, modern-looking open world game is well over $50m for the art, modelling and level design alone, and requires a staff of hundreds just to build, regardless of any mechanics added on top, it is unsurprising that publishers are unwilling to take risks.  Why is almost every AAA open-world game an action adventure where the primary interaction with the world is through combat, either driving or climbing, and where a 12-20 hour campaign that exists to mask the aforementioned interaction is complemented by a basket of increasingly familiar repetitive side activities, minigames and collectibles?  For the same reason that most movies with budgets of more than $200m are blockbuster, PG-13 action films - they sell.  

---

With games, however, there seems to me an interesting solution.  Simply re-use the incredibly expensive, detailed virtual worlds we already have, massively reducing development cost and allowing for more innovative, lower-budget experiences that don't have to compromise on graphical quality.   

The Chicago of Watch_Dogs could be the perfect setting for a wintry detective thriller in the Windy City.  Why not re-purpose the obsessively recreated 1940s Los Angeles of L.A Noire for a love story set in the golden age of Hollywood?   Or how about a costume drama in the Royal Court at Versailles in the late 18th century, pilfering the beautifully rendered environments from Assassins' Creed Unity?   Studios might even license out these worlds, sitting unused as they are, to other developers for a fee, allowing indies to focus on the stories and character that populate them instead of the rote asset generation that fuels level creation itself.  

It seems ridiculous to me that we create and explore these incredible worlds at immense financial cost, only to abandon them after a single game.  Surely our finest open worlds have more stories to tell?   ",truegaming,1003

Check [this comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/50tfwe/week_1_dst_scoring_2016/d79460f) for a rundown of what I would do with Minnesota, Philadelphia, Tennessee, and Cleveland.**

Week 1 is always a little bit weird.

We have people here in the sub who have been here for half of a decade. We have some that have been here since this morning. And most of us fit somewhere in between. So where do I even start?

This column started back in 2012. It was just a list of rankings that grew into something a little larger, and now we're here. Why are we here? First and foremost, we want to maximize our D/ST scoring. Of course, that's easier said than done, and there are competing thoughts as to how best to do that.

Some people say to stream. For those less experienced, ""streaming"" refers to aggressive use of the waiver wire to essentially extend your own bench. You add/drop a new team every week, or every 2-3 weeks, and rely extensively on matchups to gain your edges. You're looking to start D/STs against the 49ers or the Browns or the Rams or whichever other offenses turn out to be very bad. This is my preferred strategy with the position.

Others say to take a good D/ST in the draft and just hold them. This is a great idea, if we only knew which D/STs were going to be good. The problem is that we are often very bad at determining which ones are going to be good versus the ones that were good last year. So, last year some people thought they were getting a steal by drafting the Buffalo Bills or Miami Dolphins. Oops, I was one of them. So while drafting a good D/ST is obviously the ideal outcome, the rest of us simply have no choice but to make do with what's left.

In Defense Wins Championships, I do my best to sort through the good from the bad, and to arrange the ""good"" choices in tiers. I also try and keep up with the meta strategy of streaming D/STs in general, especially as we get closer to the playoffs, where strategies really open up a little: you have more freedom to carry multiple defenses, as well as a few other minor strategic differences between then and now.

It's good to be back. I look forward to spending another season here, as I have every year since 2012:

**[Defense Wins Championships, Week 1](https://empeopled.com/p/92946)**

AMA!,"**My short bio:** Hello, I am Dr. Michael Colvard, a practicing eye surgeon in Los Angeles. I was born in a small farming town in the South. Though my family didn't have much money, I was lucky enough to acquire strong reading skills which allowed me to do well in school and fulfill my goal of practicing medicine. 

I believe, as I'm sure we all do, that every child should be able to dream beyond their circumstances and, through education, rise to his or her highest level. A child's future should not be determined by the zip code they happen to be born into or who their parents are.

Unfortunately, this is not the case for many children in America today. The [National Assessment of Reading Progress study](http://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reading_math_2015/#reading?grade=4) shows year after year that roughly 66% of 4th grade kids read at a level described as ""below proficiency."" This means that these children lack even the most basic reading skills. Further, data shows that kids who fail to read proficiently by the 4th grade almost never catch up.

I am not an educator, but I've seen time and again that many of the best ideas in medicine come from disciplines outside the industry. I approached the challenge of teaching reading through the lens of the neurobiology of how the brain processes language. To paraphrase (and sanitize) Matt Damon in ""The Martian"", my team and I decided to science the heck out of this.

**Why are we doing such a bad job of teaching reading?**
Our kids aren't learning to read primarily because our teaching methods are antiquated and wrong. Ironically, the most common method is also the least effective. It is called **""whole word""** reading. **""Whole word""** teaches kids to see an entire word as a single symbol and memorize it. At first, kids are able to memorize many words quickly. Unfortunately, the human brain can only retain about 2000 symbols which children hit around the 3rd grade. This is why many kids seem advanced in early grades but face major challenges as they progress.


**The Phoneme Farm method**
I teamed up with top early reading specialists, animators, song writers and programmers to build Phoneme Farm. In Phoneme Farm **we start with sounds first**. We teach kids to recognize the individual sounds of language called phonemes (there are 40 in English). Then we teach them to associate these sounds with letters and words. This approach is far more easily understood and effective for kids. It is in use at 40 schools today and growing fast. You can download it free [here for iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/professor-pup-s-phoneme-farm/id1085432161?mt=8) or [here for iPhones](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/professor-pup-s-phoneme-farm/id1085432161?mt=8) to try it for yourself.

**Why I'm here today**
I am here to help frustrated parents understand why their kids may be struggling with reading, and what they can do about it. I can answer questions about the biology of reading, the history of language, how written language is simply a code for spoken language, and how this understanding informs the way we must teach children to read.

- [Special (feat. theMIND)](https://soundcloud.com/trapo-1831/special-featuring-themind) 

Trapo's voice doesn't seem fitting of an eighteen year-old: it carries more emotion that someone that age should be able to and it's much deeper than the overwhelming majority of people his age. On both his project, he switches seamlessly from rapping to singing and does both very well. There is something special in him, and it becomes obvious to anyone who has listened to his projects. I recommend starting with the first one, not only because it's my favorite of the two, but also because it has ""Cards and Conversation"" in it and that was one of my favorite tracks from any artist last year.

- [Location](https://soundcloud.com/thegreatkhalid/location-prod-by-syk-sense-tunji-ige-smash-david)

There's a bounce to Khalid's voice, and a natural comprehension of melody that's surprising for a singer that's 1) so young and 2) apparently not backed by any major name or label in the industry. His biggest single so far has been ""Location"", which has amassed over two million plays on Soundcloud since its release three months ago, and it has every reason to be the record that propels him into the national eye: it's catchy, with a quality, yet minimalistic beat that lets Khalid's vocals be the centre of attention, and relatable regardless of what your current relationship status is.

I wrote that Khalid's self-titled Soundcloud set included ""almost every track"" he has to his name. The one track it misses is his slow, bare-bones, haunting [cover of Frank Ocean's ""Lost""](https://soundcloud.com/thegreatkhalid/lost-frank-ocean-cover), featuring nothing but his voice and a pace-keeping snap of the fingers. It's my favorite recording of his and a perfect showcase of his voice.

As one of the main members of Members Only / Very Rare, he had heavy participation on:

- [King Of The Dead](https://soundcloud.com/members-only666/06-xxxtentacion-king-of-the-dead)

X is my favorite up-and-comer at the moment, and one of the most versatile artists in the game. 50% of his catalog doesn't sound like the other 50%, because half of his  discography is made up of slow, melodic, brooding rapped and sung records, and the other half is incredibly energetic, with fast flows and in most cases an often almost-shouting delivery.

X is currently behind bars, for [assaulted and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon](http://mugshots.com/US-Counties/Florida/Orange-County-FL/Jahseh-Onfroy.139534103.html). He is notorious in his area for being a hot-head, fighting anyone he has a problem with. [Exhibit 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubeHO6RxNvQ). [Exhibit 2](https://twitter.com/xxxmembersonly/status/738720196572123136). [Seen here weaponless yelling ""shoot me"" and approaching a dude that pulled a gun on him](https://twitter.com/china_x3/status/720077298242875393). The picture of him at the beginning of this post about him is him posing with a dude he beat up, after dude bought a feature from X, didn't get it and confronted him. He allegedly beat his girlfriend. Long story short, X is fucking crazy. I hope he can be freed soon and get help from those around him because his music is great and he has potential to be huge. He was building a huge amount of hype around the time he went in, both in his city and on the internet.

If his music or his persona interest you, I recommend watching his [No Jumper interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV7Q2teRLPc). It's over an hour long and it gives some insight into the type of person Jahseh Onfroy is.

""The Slump God"" is a close affiliate to XXXTENTACION, and an equally exciting rapper, albeit for different reasons. His signature fast flow that never seems forced or sloppy makes him super interesting to listen to, but that might not be the biggest draw in his music. The beats he rides often sample the cartoons most of y'all grew up on; flips he's gone over include [SpongeBob](https://soundcloud.com/rickybobby-slumpgod/shit-talk-ft-pollari), [Courage The Cowardly Dog](https://soundcloud.com/rickybobby-slumpgod/young-vorhees-prod-by-lanlordcollectin), [Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends](https://soundcloud.com/ronnyjlistenup/ski-mask-the-slump-god-x-keith-ape-prod-by-ronnyjlistenup) and [Billy and Mandy](https://soundcloud.com/rickybobby-slumpgod/billymandy-prodking-yosef). It can quickly become an overdone gimmick, but for now it's a unique aspect of Ski's music.

Back in 2014, in a time where no one knew who Bryson Tiller was and young girls didn't fuck with The Weeknd, Corbin (then Spooky Black) seemed like he could be the next big thing in RnB. He first appeared as a durag-wearing white boy from Minnesota, which made him hard to take seriously at first. However, he kept on evolving and honing his craft, which made listeners more and more interested in him. He switched his goofy name for Corbin in an attempt to be taken more seriously and dropped [""Worn""](https://soundcloud.com/spookyblack/corbin-worn-prod-by-wedidit-thestand4rd/), which was a much more mature and ""serious"" approach to his music. The following year, him and Bobby Raps dropped Couch Potato, one of last year's best releases. Since then, however, he's been completely quiet (at the expense of his buzz).

[This Is The Album (2015)](http://djbooth.net/albums/review/jaden-smith-this-is-the-album-ep)

In the last year, year and a half, Jaden Smith has been doing his best to shed his image of a pseudo-intelectual (which, to be fair, was no one's fault but his own). And if the general public was quicker to forget preconceived notions, he already would have. Generally in a slow, melodic flow, Jaden's shit is soothing, similar to Childish Gambino's acoustic tracks. The co-signs he's gotten from Justin Bieber, Post Malone, Rich The Kid, Mr. Carmack and Ta-Ku show how many different corners of music are fucking with him, and that combined with him being born into money and therefore having no motivation to do music other than love for the art form could lead him into making some incredible shit in the future.

[Overdose (2016)](https://soundcloud.com/kingvory/sets/overdose-hosted-adrian-swish-dj-radio)

- [Break Bread with Bryson Tiller](https://soundcloud.com/brysontiller/break-bread-feat-king-vory)

Even if you haven't heard of King Vory, you've definitely heard him. I say this with absolute certainty because unless you were living under a rock last year, you heard Bryson Tiller's breakout single ""Don't"". [Two minutes and twenty-five seconds into the track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7cVLE4SaN0&amp;t=2m25s), you can hear King Vory's pitched-down vocals. They've been together since way back and they were together when Tiller wrote and recorded ""Don't"". 

King Vory's debut tape dropped this Summer and it's a very promising project with a lot of gems on there. It features Chicago's Lil Bibby, Atlanta's Johnny Cinco and Cali's AD (twice), showing that Vory is building connections all across the country. Some records on here are straight up RnB jams and some others are just hard as hell but overall, although his delivery changes, Vory is melodic on every beat on here in varying degrees. If Bryson Tiller's Trap Soul was an RnB record with some rap joints, Overdose mirrors it, focusing more heavily on rap and dipping into RnB sporadically.

[Red Teenage Melody (2016)](https://soundcloud.com/night_lovell/sets/red-teenage-melody)

- [Guidance (feat. Nessly)](https://soundcloud.com/night_lovell/guidance-ft-nessly)

Like Trapo, Night Lovell is another example of a surprisingly deep voice for a teenager. However, he uses his in a different to the Wisconsinite. Lovell raps mainly in a slow flow, complementing the hard hitting production he consistently gets. However, slow never means boring, as his delivery is perfect for the vibe he aims for with his music and is never short of energetic. You're always waiting for the next bar and that next bar is never predictable.

His 2016 project shows development from his debut, as Lovell sheds a threatning sound for a more approachable vibe, and is often guilty of switching his slow flow for more common and en-vogue ways of riding an instrumental. I personally prefer his first project (and that seems to be the dominant opinion among his fans), but I applaud his intentions of growing and developing as an artist. I still got a lot of tracks out of this album and his willingness to hone his craft has left me looking forward to future releases.

- [Talk (ICYTWAT Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DokszoiLh1Q)

During last Fall, no unsigned artist had more hype behind him than Carti. ""Broke Boi"" was one of the hottest street singles at the time, he was with the buzzing Awful Records before joining A$AP and was coming up next to Ian Connor, who was at the time known for being the biggest name in streetwear and fashion who was running with A$AP Rocky, Kylie Jenner and Kanye West, and not a disgusting rapist. However, ""Broke Boi"" came and went, none of his releases after it got anywhere as big, and there was no fleshed out mixtape to keep eyes on him. There is still no album or tape out, and time will tell if he's taking his time to perfect his debut project or if he's been dicking around and wasting time.

Probably the biggest name on this list at the moment (if Carti can get his hype back, that title would undoubtedly belong to him). With a [Drake feature](https://soundcloud.com/roywoodsofficial/drama-feat-drake) on his debut EP and a contract with OVO, Roy Woods has the Drake stimulus package working full force for him right now. However, his second project and debut album (last month's Waking At Dawn) came with no features. His attempt at a completely solo debut album produced a mostly well-received record and a very exciting sign of things to come.

Like fellow Chicagoan Chief Keef, the general opinion is that Lucki has been on and has fallen off all before being legally allowed to drink. Buzz around Lucki (then Lucki Eck$) started building around the time his debut, titled ""Alternative Trap"", dropped back in 2013. With a slow, yet playful, soundscape, Lucki rode his beats effortlessly, with realistic bars about his life: high school, women and drug-dealing. He rapped about the things he did, and the veracity of his bars becomes glaringly obvious if you look at the evolution of his sound: his once happy-sounding beats became slower and slower, his delivery became increasingly slurred and unclear and his lyrics became less about dealing drugs and more about taking them. His health seems to be suffering and most fans think that so is his music. However, in my personal opinion, the music is good, if not better than it was. It's not incoherent, it's a window into the life of a drug addict and he's sounding like basically no one else.

- [Michigan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erHuJdYylIo)

Kevin Abstract is artsy, daring and in search of his own sound and lane. His sound is a reflection of someone who doesn't know what he should be and who's still finding himself, which is natural in someone his age. He dropped his debut at eighteen and has been working on the follow-up basically ever since, perfecting it while dropping loosies and working with his band Brockhampton, with whom he released a very solid and daring project this year. In his work, Abstract has showed no fear of boundaries, with forays into different flows, different beats, and different subgenres, be it rap, RnB or even basically indie-rock. Not allowing himself to be constricted by musical walls makes Kevin Abstact very interesting to listen to and keep tabs on and that could be a trait that makes his next project something truly remarkable.

TempusRerumImperator,2016-07-31 19:04:06+00:00,Crooked Hillary's Official Rapsheet Part 2:,"**Filegate**  

 The Clinton’s used the FBI to target political opponents. On June 6, 1996, The Los Angeles Times reported that the White House sought confidential FBI background documents on fired White House Travel Office chief Billy Dale. The next day, the White House admits it ordered FBI files of more than 330 people, including dozens of Republican leaders, saying it was working off an “outdated list” of people who had applied for access to the White House. Eventually it is discovered that about 1,000 people’s FBI files were obtained by Clinton officials.  

**Linda Tripp**  
One of those people whose FBI file was obtained by the White House was Linda Tripp, who blazed onto the national scene when she released to Independent Council, Ken Starr, secretly taped conversations she had with Monica Lewinsky about the sexual conduct of the President. Tripp’s connection to FBI files also include her witnessing fellow employees copying FBI files onto White House computers when she worked in the Clinton White House. (The Washington Times, 9/4/98) Tripp is also at the center of conspiracy theories involving Vince Foster’s suicide. Tripp had worked in the early Clinton administration in 1992 as executive assistant to Bernie Nussbaum, then the White House counsel. Tripp first surfaced in the original report on Foster’s death by former independent counsel Robert Fiske. Fiske said in his report, that Tripp was the last person to speak to Foster before he committed suicide. It was also Tripp who provided testimony on what happened inside Foster’s office after word of his death surfaced, again leading to questions of impropriety.  

Tripp also is the original source of information regarding Kathryn Willey’s reported claim that Clinton had kissed and fondled her, claiming to be the first person to talk to Willey after she left the Oval Office.  
•In June 1996, White House security head Craig Livingstone, a political operative and former bouncer, illegally obtained over 700 FBI files of mostly White House personnel from former Republican administrations.  
•On the 9th, White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta offers a public apology for the White House’s obtaining the FBI files: “Mistakes were made. It is inexcusable.”  
•President Clinton later offered a direct apology and calls the FBI files controversy a “completely honest bureaucratic snafu.”  
•FBI Director Louis Freeh said on June 14, that he and his agency were “victimized.” He also says that the White House acquisition of the files represented “egregious violations of privacy.”  
•The Washington Post reports on the 16th, Secret Service officials say the tracking system they used for White House passholders could not have generated the supposedly outdated list that the White House claimed it used to request FBI files on the now more than 400 former passholders.  
•White House places personnel security office director Craig Livingstone, directly responsible for obtaining the FBI files, on administrative leave.  
•House Government Reform and Oversight Committee begins hearings on FBI file affair on June 19th. Livingstone tells officials that the office holding the files was often left unsecured and that people with the lowest level security clearance were allowed access to the room. ABC News reports that Livingstone himself did not get proper security clearance until more than a year after he began his job as head of security.  
•Attorney General Janet Reno calls on FBI to expand its probe to determine how and why White House obtained files on former Reagan and Bush administration staff members – later she reverses her earlier call for the FBI to lead the inquiry, and announces that Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr should investigate how the White House acquired the FBI files in an improper manner.  
•New documents on June 25th, show that a total of more than 700 FBI background files were improperly obtained by the White House.  
•Craig Livingstone resigns from the White House staff on June 26th.  
•Anthony Marceca informs the Senate Judiciary Committee on June 28th, that he is taking the Fifth Amendment and will not answer any more questions concerning the White House acquisition of FBI background files.  
•The diaries of the Dick Morris’ call girl, Sherry Rowlands, noted that Mr Morris described Mrs Clinton as the prime mover in the scandal when confidential FBI personnel files on leading Republicans were taken to the White House and scrutinised by political fixers. “It was Hillary,” Mr Morris replied when Miss Rowlands asked who was to blame for the scandal. “She ordered them. She’s a paranoid lady; she did it.”  

Hillary Clinton’s elitist attitude and behaviors have continued after leaving the Whitehouse.  

Perhaps the most flagrant behavior of Hillary was her response to the 2012 attacks on the US mission in Benghazi, Libya resulting in the deaths of four American citizens, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.  

Clinton responded, “What difference, at this point does it make?” in a 2013 Sentate hearing.  

I say it makes allot of difference to freedom loving Americans. It makes allot of differece to those families who lost loved ones in the attack.  

**Benghazi Attack**  
Why did Secretary Clinton deny requests for additional security at the consulate prior to the attack?  

Why did the Whitehouse and State Department represent the attack as a spontaneous protest over an anti-Muslim video?  

**Were they covering up a CIA presence in Benghazi smuggling weapons from Libya to anti-Assad rebels in Syria?**  
http://www.aim.org/guest-column/former-judge-hillary-clinton-part-of-libyan-weapons-trafficking-conspiracy/  

Following the attack in Benghazi, Hillary lied to the families of the slain Americans, telling them the attacks were a response to a YouTube video. She later denied that she ever told the Benghazi victims’ families that the video was to blame. Charles Woods, father of Tyrone Woods said that Hillary told him, “We are going to have the filmmaker arrested who was responsible for the death of your son.”  

**Approved Drone strikes, some of which killed American citizens, and hundreds of civilian casualties.**  
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/23/us-justification-drone-killing-american-citizen-awlaki
http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article44849.htm  

It was discovered by the House committee investigating the attack on the US mission in Benghazi that Secretary Clinton violated government rules by exclusively using a private email account kept on her private computer server in her home during her four years at the State Department.  

In typical Clinton style, Hillary lied. Clinton’s office said she only used one private email address during her time at the State Department, while the New York Times discovered that Hillary used more than one address. Clinton asserted that her use of a private email account was aboveboard and allowed under State Department rules. However, a State Department inspector general report said that Hillary “did not comply with the Department’s policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records Act.” She further asserted that she did not send or receive classified material on the private account. However, a government review of the emails determined that some of the emails were deemed classified.  

In July 2016, FBI Director James Comey announced he would not recommend charges against Hillary because there was no “intent,” which is not a necessity for prosecution. In essence, Comey declared that Hillary was guilty, and despite evidence of “extreme negligence”, she would not be charged. He went on to say, “To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences. To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions.” Though, not for Hillary.   
 
**EmailGate**
It should be noted that James Comey has a long history of cases ending favorable to the Clinton’s,[Jerome R. Corsi, WorldNetDaily] leaving one to wonder about his role as protector of the Clintons.  
•It was Comey, then serving as a deputy attorney general in the Justice Department, who in 2004 limited the scope of the criminal investigation of Sandy Berger, keeping Clinton administration officials out of the investigation. Berger was being investigated for removing classifed documents from the National Archives that should have been turned over to the commission investigating the 9/11 terror attacks. In 2005, Berger plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge and was fined $50,000, sentenced to 100 hours of community service and two years probation, and his national security license was stripped for two years. In the investigation of Clinton’s private email server, emails between Berger and Hillary Clinton showed he had been advising Clinton while she served as secretary of state and had access to classified information.  
•Comey appointed Patrick Fitzgerald as special councel who eventually convicted “Scooter” Libby, a top aide to then Vice President Dick Cheney, of perjury and obstruction of justice in a case based on the accusations of Valerie Plame and her former ambassador husband, Joe Wilson – both partisan supporters of Bill and Hillary Clinton – that Libby outed her as a CIA agent.  

The crony connections between the Clinton’s, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Sandy Berger, and Cheryl Mills (White House Counsel for President Bill Clinton whom she defended during his 1999 impeachment trial), seem to intersect with the Washington law firm Hogan &amp; Hartson, which prepared tax returns for the Clinton’s beginning in 2004 and did patent work for the software firm MX Logic Inc. that developed the email encryption system used in the private email server used by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Berger worked as a partner in Hogan &amp; Hartson from 1973 to 1977, and between gigs working for the Carter administration, the Dukakis presidential campaign, and Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign in 1992. Loretta Lynch worked for Hogan &amp; Hartson from 2002 through 2010. Mills worked there for two years starting in 1990.  


**The Clinton Foundation** 

When Hillary became Secretary of State (2009 – 2013), she promised that the Clinton Foundation would stop accepting donations from foreign governments. However, tax returns disclosed extensive donations continued to be made by foreign governments in 2012 and 2013, while Hillary was Secretary of State.  
EnergizerIn 2010, the Clinton Foundation arranged a $2 million pledge to a power company partly owned by a wealthy blond divorcee – who some say is the frequent visitor to his home nicknamed “Energizer.”  

Very large contributions to the Clinton Foundation and exorbitant speaking fees for Bill Clinton were proven to coincide with favors granted by the State Department and signed off by then-secretary Hillary Clinton.  

**Too Big to Fail… Too Big to Jail**  
 The Clinton’s have profited directly and indirectly from their connections to the “too big to fail” banks (HSBC, Barclays, JPMorgan, Citigroup, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS).  
•HSBC, fined for their role in a massive money-laundering scandal, gave up to $200,000 to the Clinton Foundation. When acting as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Loretta Lynch may have acted in a cover-up, not prosecuting the bank for money laundering but rather allowing HSBC to enter into a “deferred prosecution” settlement where the bank paid a $1.9 billion fine and admitted “willful criminal conduct” in exchange for dropping criminal investigations and prosecutions of HSBC.  
•Citigroup employees have contributed to the Clinton’s $765,192 since 1989.  
•Employees at JPMorgan have donated $423,279 since 1991.  

After leaving the State Department, Hillary joined her daughter and husband as named members of the Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation and the foundation began accepting donations from foreign governments. Clinton resigned from the foundation’s board in April 2015, when she began her presidential campaign.  

**Clinton Foundation and Haiti**  
http://www.wnd.com/2015/10/clinton-foundation-fraud-began-with-exploiting-earthquake/  

The Securities and Exchange Commission charged former Clinton Foundation trustee Vinod Gupta with fraud in 2008. He misallocated $9.5 million from InfoUSA, the database company he chaired, in order to finance credit-card bills, a yacht, personal trips to Cancun and South Africa, and 20 cars. He and the SEC settled for $7.3 million. Meanwhile, InfoUSA’s shareholders sued Gupta for flying the Clintons in the company jet and paying Bill $3 million in corporate cash for consulting. InfoUSA settled with stockowners for $13 million.   

**Bill Clinton and Victor Dahdaleh**  
Great Britain’s Serious Fraud Office accused Clinton Foundation ex-trustee Victor Dahdaleh of paying Bahraini officials £35 million (roughly $52 million) to win sales contracts for Alcoa, the U.S. aluminum giant, with which he was a “super-agent.” Dahdaleh was jailed twice before his trial, but ultimately acquitted when a key witness, Bruce Hall, pleaded guilty to conspiracy but then refused to testify against Dahdaleh. However, Alcoa pleaded guilty to its role in this skullduggery and settled with the Justice Department for $384 million.  

**Sant Chatwal and Hillary Clinton**  
Sikh Indian restaurateur and hotelier Sant Chatwal was a Clinton Foundation trustee. He donated to Hillary’s 2000 Senate and 2008 presidential campaigns, directed millions in speaking fees to the Clintons, and gave millions more to their foundation. During a May 2001 visit to India, Chatwal was arrested for allegedly defrauding the Bank of India of $9 million that he borrowed in 1994. He posted bail, “then fled India, boarding a flight to Vienna, despite an attempt by authorities to detain him,” according to the New York Daily News. In April 2014, Chatwal appeared in Brooklyn’s U.S. District Courthouse and pleaded guilty to conspiracy, witness tampering, and having “funneled more than $180,000 in illegal contributions between 2007 and 2011 to three federal candidates,” including Hillary. “Attempting to buy elections through illegal campaign contributions is unacceptable,” said FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge George Venizelos. “It is also illegal.” Chatwal was sentenced to three years’ probation, a $500,000 fine, and 1,000 hours of community service. Sant Chatwal, Hillary Clinton, and Vikram Chatwal Chatwal’s son Vikram bundled donations for Hillary’s 2008 campaign. Nicknamed the Turban Cowboy, Vikram counted Bill Clinton among the guests at his 2006 wedding in India. In April 2013, Schweizer explains, Vikram was arrested after Fort Lauderdale airport officials “found a half gram of cocaine and six grams of heroin in his underwear.” Vikram Chatwal avoided jail by completing a one-year drug rehabilitation program.  

**Gulnara Karimova and Bill Clinton**  
Uzbek dictator Islam Karimov’s eldest daughter, Gulnara Karimova, considered Bill Clinton “among her friends,” after she co-sponsored a June 2012 Clinton Foundation fundraiser in Monaco, NBC’s Today Show reported. According to a July 2009 cable from the U.S. Embassy in Tashkent, she was “hoping that a connection with him will allow her to establish good relations with the secretary of state” — Hillary Clinton. As another cable explained, “Most Uzbeks see Karimova as a greedy, power-hungry individual who uses her father to crush business people or anyone else who stands in her way . . . She remains the single most hated person in the country.” Alas for Gulnara, she evidently disappointed her father. According to Schweizer, “She is thought to be under house arrest in Uzbekistan.”  

**Amar Singh and Hillary Clinton**  
Indian legislator Amar Singh hosted Bill Clinton in Lucknow, India, in September 2005. Singh, in turn, sat at the head table at 2005’s Clinton Global Initiative gala and, soon thereafter, dined privately with the Clintons at their home. As the Times of India observed, Singh “seems to dote on the Clintons.” Indeed, he donated $1–5 million to the Clinton Foundation — “between 20 and 100 percent of his entire net worth,” Schweizer notes. (Maddeningly, government-disclosure rules often permit powerful people and entities to report donations, assets, income, and expenses in vast ranges. This is totally unhelpful and obscures transparency. This absurd practice should be replaced with frequent and complete reporting, down to the penny.) In September 2011, Schweizer writes, Singh “was arrested under the Prevention of Corruption Act for bribing three members of parliament during a crucial 2008 vote” related to a U.S.-Indian nuclear-technology agreement. Singh never was tried. He was booted from the Samajwadi party, however, ending his political career.   

**Claudio Osorio and Bill Clinton**.  
Claudio Osorio was CEO of Innovida, a Florida-based building-materials company on whose board Jeb Bush served. Osorio was a major fundraiser for Hillary’s 2008 campaign and financially supported the Clinton Global Initiative. While Hillary was at State, Innovida scored a $10 million federal loan to build 500 homes in Haiti after its severe 2010 earthquake. Alas, those residences never were constructed. Osorio was convicted of financial fraud, namely using humanitarian assistance “for his and his co-conspirators’ personal benefit,” prosecutors said. Osorio is currently serving twelve years in federal prison.

Otherwise, ask me anything. I'll be here all day answering any and everything. 

I'll get out ahead of the questions and answer the most popular question first. 

*Why? Are you raising money for anything? Any charity?*

* My motivation was the adventure. There was no cause associated. I wasn't raising awareness or money for anything. At first I felt a little guilty when people would ask me, but I learned to own it. I was doing it because it was there. To see if I could. Humans have an innate desire to explore and adventure and that's what I was tapping into more than anything. After I started thinking about it, I got worried that one day I'd regret it if I didn't do it. The idea of watching the country evolve ever slowly as I moved eastward at 3 mph, *that* excited me.

Tifubyfu,2016-07-25 10:10:14+00:00,TIFU By Getting Stuck In a Forest Fire,"EDIT: Here is the only picture I took of the fire: http://imgur.com/a/UliTP
EDIT 2: Called insurance company. Seems like a normal claim thus far :-/
EDIT 3: Thanks for the Gold!! This is my first time on reddit. I've seen this mysterious gold before. I am going to have to figure this whole biome out. 


Long time lurker. I made this account to post my experiences yesterday. I am so sore all over. 

TL;DR: I got stuck in a forest fire, they hoisted me out with a helicopter. It was my fault. It sucked. Good people helped me. I am okay! 

Okay, so I've rested a tiny bit. I am a little scraped and bruised, but no major injuries. On Saturday, I went hiking in the Los Angeles Forest area to get some exercise and take some pictures. I did a basic map recon before, and found an easy trail right off the highway with a good vantage point. Sunsets are great in the area because of the LA smog and a there also happened to be a small fire in the area, which added a bit of smoke. The fire was small in the day on Saturday, around 3-4k acres. I checked the news prior to departure, saw the fire, looked at basic fire trends and determined that it was small and I was far enough away.

The trail I selected was off of a major highway, and the vantage point I selected was about 5 miles off the highway on a dirt road. The dirt road wasn't bad, by any means, but it had a highly raised dirt/sand shoulder. I could not see the fire from where I was, and the wind was not pushing it in my direction. 

After sunset, I could see the fire in the distance. It was pretty far away, and wasn't fast moving, but one thing I noticed was the insane size of it. It was surreal, armeggedon like. I could only see tiny peaks of flame a few hills over, but the entire horizon was bright orange. At that point, I decided it was time to leave. I was also far enough away that I assessed that the fire was about four hours from me, at the rate it was moving and growing. I decided to snap one last picture and leave.

When I got in the car to leave, I did a quick accountability of all my stuff--camera, phone, wallet, etc. I quickly discovered that I didn't have my wallet. I looked around the car for a few minutes and couldn't find it. Generally, I would have left the wallet and gone home (I have a passport and can easily replace cards), but I didn't have enough gas to get all the way home. I looked at the fire, and the wind was changing direction--my direction. The change in wind direction began pushing smoke, intensely, in my direction, but the speed of the fire remain unchanged. I spent the next hour and change looking for my wallet. 

I decided to stop looking for the wallet when I heard two firefighters yelling in the distance, ""Hey, get your masks on!"" I said ""screw this,"" and figured I could beg for the money at a gas station or just sleep on the shoulder until I figured it out. By this point, I was slightly anxious and trying to beat feet out of there as quickly as I could. I was going too fast on the dirt road. I should have never looked for my wallet; I would have been home by then if I hadn't. The density of the smoke turned everything black--It looked like a steady snow. The visibility, combined with my haste, and ABS got me stuck on the sandy shoulder. It wasn't a bad stuck, and there was no damage to the car, but I was stuck in the sand, and there was this protruding, strong root(s) in the sand.

I jump out of the car, assess the situation and think, ""Okay, thats not bad at all. No damage, just stuck in the sand. I can do this."" I get sticks, logs, the car jack, whatever I can find. I start digging the car out, and the sand is easy to work with, but the roots make it much more difficult. After working with it for about an hour, I swallow my pride and call 911. This is where things start getting really bad. By this point, in the span of hours, the fire has gone from a few thousand acres to over 20,000 acres, and when I call 911, there is clearly a ton of interagency confuesion. 

I explain the situation to 911, they transfer to CHP, who tells me to call a tow truck. I explain the situation further and she tells me they will send a unit. In the meantime, I keep digging--keep trying to get the car out of the sand. It is getting hot at this point, and all I can hear is this intense roaring howl interspersed with violent crackling. I can now very clearly see the fire, but they aren't flames--it's just a giant wall of orange with sinister looking tornadoes and sparks. I call 911 again, and there is a lot of confusion on my location. They can't find me. I try to give them my exact coordinates, but you can't use your phone in 911 mode, so after a terrible back and fourth that took another 20 minutes, they have my lat/long. 

The fire is here now. I am screaming help while I dig. I call 911 again. They tell me to leave the vehicle and run, and I ask for a distance and direction, and they just tell me to ""make all considerations for personal safety."" I was exhausted; it was hot; I couldn't breathe. I get in the car, and just lay down. I drop a pin on facebook for my location and post, ""I am stuck in the Santa Clarita fire."" I pray and relax. I am about 5.5 miles from the highway. I might be able to make it on foot and beat the fire, but thats a road to lose. There was a strange calm at that point.

I call 911 again and get a better operator and she connects me to LAFD finally. They said wouldn't be able to get anyone to my location to help me, so they were going to attempt to mount a ""hoist rescue operation."" They instructed me to wait for the helicopter. I hear the helicopter approach, and at this point I am on the line with LAFD Air Night Ops. Apparently, they have to drop water on the fire around me to be able to mount the rescue. I hear the helo leave after dropping the water, and that was a really tough sound to hear, the sound of a helicopter leaving when there is danger. 

The LAFD explains that they are going to drop a firefighter in to my area and then hoist me out of the fire. I am so grateful, but so embarassed at the same time. They tell me that they are going to drop me eyepro, which thankfully I had, (Oakleys are not douchey!). As they are hoisting the firefighter in, the rotor wash was like none I have experienced before. Every inch of exposed skin felt like it was in a media blasting room, but it was a welcome feeling. The firefighter was hoisted down, after which the helo departed. He put me in the harness, checked my health and then called the helo back. 

We hooked onto the rope and the helocopter took off. It was pretty surreal at that point. It was a beautiful and frightening sight, the massive fire below, as I dangled from a rope, attached to a helocopter, with a stranger. I was hugely embarassed. This was all my fault. After we got enough elevation, they hoisted the rope up and pulled us in. That ride felt like it went on forever. I was thirsty, tired, covered in bruises and scratches. I actually wondered if this was just some sort lucid dream or


They dropped me off at a local ranch and said the Sheriff would meet me in about 20 minutes. Things got very confusing. I was dropped in a pretty remote location, and because of internal confusion, they Sheriff couldn't find me. I called 911 every hour after, each time explaining where I was, but the LASD had trouble believing that the LAFD dropped me in such a remote location, and each time they drove by me, it was at like 100mph and they were at code, and I kept trying to wave them down. After numerous calls to 911 and some sleep on the dirt, I manage to flag down a police car. They get on the radio and yell ""We found him!"" Several LE agencies were looking for me--they just couldn't believe the fire department dropped me in such a remote area.

marisam7,2016-07-22 19:43:15+00:00,Debunking Myths about Islam,"#Myths about the proportion of Islamic Terrorist Attacks on U.S Soil

So I was on Facebook recently and saw a post claiming that, ""Islam has carried out more than 100,000 terrorist attacks against Americans since 9/11"" with no citations what so ever.

Looking at the Facebook group that posted this, I assumed from the fact their profile picture is a stock image of an interracial couple inside of a snipers crosshairs with the caption ***""Race mixing and Liberalism is a mental illness but we have the cure""*** that most people would be able to see this group isn't the most trustworthy source but despite that, the post had hundreds of upvotes and comments. Not from Neo-Nazis and White Supremacists but from average people.

I saw dozens of comments from people like Susan (*A retired school teacher and grandmother from Indiana*) who responded by talking about how the liberal media refuses to even acknowledge Muslims are a problem despite them killing thousands of Americans every day and how when Obama finally dies the lord Jesus will send him to hell for him helping cover up the evil deeds of Muslims. 

Or people like Gary (*A small business owner and NRA member from South Carolina*) Who responded to the graph by making a long incoherent rant where he talked about how when he was a kid during Vietnam the liberals tried so hard to go after our soldiers calling them rapists and baby killers and just because they didn't like the methods didn't mean someone had to them and because they did what they did we won the war and the Vietnamese realized they could never take over America so they didn't try and bring the fight to the US. 

His post then goes on to argue that we need to put someone with balls in the white house who will let soldiers do what they did in Vietnam and when that happens the terrorism will stop. 

Now its very frighting that people like Gary who not only for some reason believe that the U.S won the Vietnam war (which they didn't) and who thinks that the Vietnamese wanted to take over the United States  (which they didn't) but also ontop of that thinks the reason the US won the war is because U.S soldiers raped women and murdered children and that if the U.S started committing war crimes again the terrorism would stop.

Ignoring the fact of how scary it is that a person like Gary is allowed to own firearms. And the fact that [U.S soldiers have raped and murdered children while deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmudiyah_rape_and_killings) The main thing I learned from this post is how people just making up numbers can incite hatred and violence.

I looked more into Facebook and found other lists that actually do go through all the Islamic terrorist attacks. Yet these lists will cite things like: 

&gt; **Nation of Islam member robbing a convenient store in 1975** 

as a terrorist attack. Or 

&gt; **Turkish man who was in prison for bank robbery in New York stabbing a prison guard in 1981** 

as an ""Islamic terrorist attack on law enforcement."" 

Going through these lists more many of the examples they give just didn't happen. They will give a name or a description of an event or a location or a date and when I google the info I don't find any results for it being real or in many cases it did happen but the perpetrator wasn't even a Muslim.

Some of these lists all of which are poorly put together and without any real citations circulating on Facebook and other known Islamophobic websites have even been republished by actual news sources such as [WorldNetDaily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldNetDaily) to the response in the comment sections of paranoid delusional rants by people who use obscure biblical passages and sources of Islamic text to falsely claim Muslims truly worship Satan and Islam translate directly into ""the religion of the devil""

**So I decided to go through the list starting with the World Trade Center bombings in 1993 and create a coherent list of all the successful Islamic terrorist attacks which resulted in at least 1 death that occurred on US soil.** 

I found soon after that it didn't take long to make this list. Due to the fact that since 9/11 there have only been 9 successful Islamic terrorist attacks.

At this point I thought even though [you are 7 times more likely to be killed by a right wing extremist then a Muslim terrorist in the United States](http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/11/30/3725562/you-are-more-than-7-times-as-likely-to-be-killed-by-a-right-wing-extemist-than-by-muslim-terrorists/) and even though [Non-Muslims Carried Out More than 90% of All Terrorist Attacks in America.](http://www.globalresearch.ca/non-muslims-carried-out-more-than-90-of-all-terrorist-attacks-in-america/5333619)
This is just one country. 

So I decided to look at another country with a significantly higher Muslim Population. 

Canada which has well over a million Muslims who make up 3% of its population and instead of doing a small 20 year timeline I decided to look into the entire history of the country to get the most accurate results.


#Number of Terrorist Attacks in Canada by motive.

**Freedomites**

* Number of terror attacks: 300+

* Number of injuries: 6

* Number of deaths: 3

**Quebec Nationalists**

* Number of terror attacks: 64

* Number of injuries: 29

* Number of deaths: 12

**Fenians:**

* Number of terror attacks: 10+

* Number of injuries: 37

* Number of deaths: 32

**Communist:** 

* Number of terror attacks: 10

* Number of injuries: 100+

* Number of deaths: 0

**Sikh:**

* Number of terror attacks: 7

* Number of injuries: 6

* Number of deaths: 324

**Christian:** 

* Number of terror attacks: 7

* Number of injuries: 3

* Number of deaths: 1

**Environmental:** 

* Number of terror attacks: 6

* Number of injuries: 0

* Number of deaths: 0


**Armenian Nationalists:**

* Number of terror attacks: 3

* Number of injuries: 1

* Number of deaths: 2

**Anarchist:**

* Number of injuries: 4

**Jewish:**

* Number of terror attacks: 1

* Number of injuries: 1

* Number of deaths: 0

**So to put this into comparison there are half the number of followers of Sikhism in Canada than Islam.**

**Yet Sikhs have killed 162 times more people in the name of their religion than Islam has in Canada alone.**

Despite this, no one is calling for Sikhs to be deported by the millions.

Now to the people out there saying, 

&gt; ***You only look at terrorism, what about all the other crimes muslims commit!***

#Well lets look at a few places around the world:

**The first place I'm going to look at is the city with the highest Muslim population in the United States,  Dearborn Michigan.** 

Dearborn has a population of around 100,000 people half of which are of Arab Decent.

[*Last year Dearborn had 3 murders and 35 rapes.*](http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/mi/dearborn/crime/)

**Lets look at other cities in the United States with the same population but instead of being populated by Muslims lets look at cities populated by White Christians.** 

Billings, Montana is a city with a population of around 100,000 people same as Dearborn. 90% of these people are white. 

And the city has such a small Muslim population that there isn't even a mosque in it. 


[*Last year Billings had 10 murders and 72 rapes*](http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/mt/billings/crime/)

Just in case that one example was an outliar I looked up a few cities with the same population as Dearborn to compare the crime rate

City | Number of Murders 2015| Number of Rapes 2015
---|---|----
Dearborn MI | 3| 35
Sandy Springs GA| 6 | 40 
Pueblo CO | 10 | 152
Billings MT | 10| 72
West Palm Beach FL |15 | 45

I could keep going but I think you get the point. 

Dearborn Michigan despite having more Muslims liveing there than anywhere else in the US is below the average national crime rate.

[Dearborn  is 16% safer than the average city.](http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/mt/billings/crime/)

And statistically speaking 64% of the people reading this right now are more at risk where they are live currently than if they moved to Dearborn and surround themselves with Muslims.

Chances of being a victim of crime:

&gt; In Dearborn
1 in 275

&gt; In Michigan
1 in 234

But forget about the U.S lets look at cities outside of America. Last time we looked at Canada lets look at the U.K this time.

###**Birmingham has one of the largest Muslim populations in England.**

[One out of every 5 people in the city of Birmingham is a Muslim.](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html) 

It is one of the highest Muslim Populations in the country.

[Let's look at the crime rate there:](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/crime-statistics-for-birmingham-3217262)



City | Crime Rate Per 100 Residents
---|---
Birmingham | 5.15
 UK Average | 6.57
London | 42.53

###But maybe that isn't good enough for you lets look at the rest of Europe:

**Amsterdam has been cited as having one of the largest Muslim populations in Europe. Pretty soon 20% of the city will be Muslims.** 

You would think this influx of immigrants would cause the crime rate to sky rocket right? 

I myself assumed it would when I was researching this and honestly was shocked to see news articles titled: 

&gt; [AMSTERDAM’S 2015 HOMICIDE FIGURES HIT RECORD LOW](http://www.nltimes.nl/2015/12/30/amsterdams-2015-homicide-figures-could-hit-record-low-point/) 

But the fact of the matter is its true that they did. 

* In 2015 there was 15 murders in Amsterdam 

* In 2013 there was 22 murders in Amsterdam

* In 1998 there was 65 murders Amsterdam

The higher the Muslim population has been getting in Amstredam the lower the murder rate gets.

&gt; ***But how can that be?!?! Multiculturalism is a failure just look at the rape rate in Sweden! What about all those Muslims raping children? I read about on Brietbart and infowars!***

Well even if it wasn't for the fact that many news headlines about Muslin Refugees raping and killing people are fake.

And when I mean fake I mean literally Infowars and breitbart just outright reported lies.

Such as the time them (along with many other right wing news outlets) reported the story about Syrian Muslim refugees gang raping a little girl in Idaho. 

[Local officials and police even had to have a press conference afterwards to explain not only did the story never happen but there aren't even any refugees who live in the entire county.](http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/state/idaho/article84829787.html)

And no, none of the right wing news sites ever apologized for spreading false info or even redacted the stories. They still have them up on their site without even acknowledging it was proven to be false.

Reasons like this are probably why so many media watchdog groups and committees into the ethics of journalism have time and time again ranked Brietbart as one of the most dishonest journalist outlets ever created. And when I say ever created they get a lower ranking than North Korean State Run Propaganda Media.

But for the stories that are true where it turns out a Muslim did kill someone or molest a child, even though these cases are rare they still do happen. The only thing the media never talks about is how they **happen at a lower rate than the native born population.** 

If you were to randomly pick 100,000 American Citizens born in the US and then pick 100,000 Americans originally born in other countries. [You would discover that that the number of immigrants who had committed crimes is lower than the number of native born Americans who committed crimes.](http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mythical-connection-between-immigrants-and-crime-1436916798) 

The only difference when a Muslim refugee molests a child and when a Catholic Priest does the same thing. Is that when the Muslim does it you don't see the Catholic Church covering it up. 

[And Muslim groups aren't spending millions of Dollars to lobby against sex crime laws like Catholics groups are.](http://www.ibtimes.com/new-york-catholic-church-spent-2m-lobbying-against-child-sex-abuse-accountability-2376078)

But in response to common claims that multiculturalism is a failure because Sweden has the second highest rape rate on earth and allows refugees in I just want to remind everyone that the rape rate didn't sky rocket in Sweden after they started allowing refugees into the country. [The rape rate skyrocketed in 2005 when Sweden reformed its sex crime legislation to make the definition of rape much much wider. Ontop of that the Swedish police trained to improve the handling of rape cases which led to more victims coming forward to report assaults. This is why the rape rate appears to be so much higher than it is. Even though Criminologists say that the number of rapes that occur in the country aren't above average and surveys from The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights discovered that instead of being the rape capital of the world Sweden is actually below neighboring countries of Denmark and Finland in terms of the number of rapes.](http://2static2.fjcdn.com/comments/Inb4+quot+look+at+their+rape+levels+you+cuck+quot+_473d0e13a7742baf9aa976bb534e1457.jpg)

&gt; ***But the Qur'an is violent!***

Here are a few quotes:

&gt; ***""If a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father.  Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her.""***

&gt; ***""If within the city a man comes upon a maiden who is betrothed, and has relations with her, you shall bring them both out of the gate of the city and there stone them to death: the girl because she did not cry out for help though she was in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbors wife.""***

&gt; ***""You may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you.  You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land.  You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance.""*** 

&gt; ***""When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are.  If she does not please the man who bought her, he may allow her to be bought back again.  But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her.  And if the slave girl’s owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his daughter.  If he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his wife.""***

&gt; ***""If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.""***

&gt; ***“A man or a woman who is a medium or a necromancer shall surely be put to death. They shall be stoned with stones; their blood shall be upon them.”***

&gt; ***""If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you love, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, “Let us go and worship other gods” do not yield to them or listen to them. Show them no pity. Do not spare them or shield them. You must certainly put them to death. Your hand must be the first in putting them to death, and then the hands of all the people. Stone them to death, because they tried to turn you away.""***


* Punishing Women for Being Raped
* Promoting Sexual Slavery
* Stoning Gays
* Stoning Witches
* Murdering Infidels

**These seem like quotes from a barbaric stone age death cult right?**


Well you would be correct because **these quotes are from the Bible.** ^(The same book the Republicans and Trump want to use to govern the country.)

&gt; ***But the difference between Christians and Muslims is Christians don't follow those quotes and would never do that! They don't have child brides or commit honor killing or any of those evil Muslim things!***

Except they do. 

[In Christian Majority Mozambique women can be punished for being raped by being forced to marry their rapists and this is in accordance to the law.](http://allafrica.com/stories/201402270391.html)

[Christians in The Central African Republic execute more people every year for witchcraft in the name of Jesus than all the Muslims in the middle east do according to the UN.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/centralafricanrepublic/12018588/Christian-militias-in-Central-African-Republic-burnt-witches-at-stake-says-UN-report.html) 

[40% of the marriages in Tanzinia involve child brides according to Human Rights Watch.](https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/12/09/ending-child-marriage-africa)

**And honor killings aren't even an Islamic specific concept.** 

[You can find many examples of cases where a Christian father beat his daughter to death with a metal bar because she wanted to marry her Muslim boyfriend.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/23/israel)

[Look at India. Where Hindu and Sikhs are some of the highest perpetrators of honor killings on earth today.](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/honour-killings-are-a-separate-horror/article8381779.ece) 

Even in places like Brazil it was a big problem until recently. Men could be acquitted for murdering their wives up until 1991 on the basis of them digracing their honor, and because of that you would see 800 recorded murder honor killings in a year. Even after the laws were changed, lower courts still ignored the ruling of the Supreme Court and acquitted people like Joao Lopes for a double homicide.

&gt; ***But women in Somalia aren't allowed to drive***

The idea of showing the treatment of women in Somalia as proof that Islam is evil makes as much sense as showing the treatment of women in the Congo as proof that Christainity is evil.

Lets look at a Muslim nation that isn't torn by war as see how they treat women:

Kyrgyzsta is a landlocked country located in Central Asia with a population of 5 million people. In this country close to 9 out of every 10 people are Muslims.

In 2010 after large opposition protests caused the President to resign the Muslim majority population voted and elected [Roza Otunbayeva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roza_Otunbayeva) as the country's new leader. [Roza Otunbayeva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roza_Otunbayeva) is not only a woman but an atheist. 

Why is it that in Kyrgyzsta and Somalia they both read the same holy book ^(The Qur'an) but in one country an Atheist woman would be stoned and in the other elected president. 

It's probably the same reason why in both Italy and the Congo they read the same holy book ^(The Bible) but in one an Atheist woman would be stoned and in the other elected president. 

&gt; ***But still why is the middle east so war torn to begin with? Why can't you get your stuff together and stop oppressing women?***

I wish you could post pictures on reddit but you can't so I'll just link them with a description:

[**Here is a picture of a Muslim woman named Benazir Bhutto she is the former Prime Minister of Pakistan.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benazir_Bhutto) 

[**Here is a picture from the 1970s of some women in Iran wearing Bikinis on a beach.**](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YNjvH23Aq7Q/VhgPqOxaaJI/AAAAAAAAL2A/B7xa-eTe8O0/s640/12.jpg)

[**Here is a picture of women in Afghanistan studying at Kabul University to become doctors in the 1980s.**](http://www.internationalist.org/afghanstudentswww.jpg) (40% of doctors in Afghanistan were female at the time. That's higher than the current presentage of female doctors in the United States today.)

[**Here are women in the Afgan Military posing with their weapons.**](http://www.internationalist.org/afghanwomensmilitiawww.jpg) (This is 30 years before women were allowed to have active combat roles in the United States Military.\)

&gt; ***So what changed? To make it the way it is today?***

* The same thing that changed Latin America to make it a violent cesspool of Drug Cartels.

* The same thing that changed Southeast Asia that allows the rise of anti-government rebels. 

**The United States government came into the region, overthrew their democratically elected leaders and replaced them with Islamic extremist dictators who would sell oil for a cheap price, and denounce the Soviets.**

The Middle East didn't even have Muslim countries before. They were secular nations where people elected leaders. 

In Saudi Arabia the monarchy the country has is literally only 60 years old. They didn't have a King before that they had a President.


* [1953 Iranian coup d'état](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)

And this isn't like a conspiracy on the level of *""The US was responsible for 9/11.""* It is just a common fact. You can read about it on Wikipedia even. [The CIA openly backed and put the groups in power.](http://www.globalresearch.ca/a-timeline-of-cia-atrocities/5348804) They would [fund drug lords.

Remember that picture up there of those women fighting in the Afgan Army? 

At that point in the countries history the leader of it was a man who liked the Russians a lot more than he liked the Americans. 

So you know the the CIA replaced him with? 

[
The Taliban.](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/who-is-responsible-for-the-taliban)

Before these coups there wasn't widespread terrorism. Look at Syria in 1948 and look at America. One of those countries had groups of religious extremists going around dragging people from their homes and lynching them solely because of their race. 

* Those religious extremists were the K.K.K and that country was America.

Look at Afghanistan in 1985 and look at Ireland. One of these countries had groups of paramilitary religious extremists kidnapping and murdering innocent people. Bombing hospitals and public places, killing dozens at a time. 

* Those religious extremists were the IRA and that country was Ireland.

There isn't even a counterpart to compare the groups to because none existed in these countries. No one was doing these things before the CIA got involved. 

&gt; ***But like you said the CIA did the same thing in Latin America and Africa and South East Asia. So why is it only Muslim countries who become terrorists? Why don't those countries have terorrism?***

* [In Myanmar Buddhist Terrorists have been targeting religious minorities and killing hundreds of them](http://world.time.com/2013/06/20/extremist-buddhist-monks-fight-oppression-with-violence/) Though they target all non-Buddists. They have been going after Muslims especially hard [massacring dozens in a single attack.](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/un-dozens-of-rohingya-muslims-massacred-by-buddhists-in-rakhine-burma/)

* In Israel there are unprovoked and well organized attacks by Jewish Terrorists. [Things like the Duma attacks which happened last year where a group of Jewish Terrorists decided to pick  a random Muslim home and firebombed it, killing an 18 month old child and two other people.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duma_arson_attack) Even outside of Israel in the United States groups like [The Jewish Defense League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Defense_League) are responsible for acts of terrorism. Whether it be the time they tried to assassinate a US congressman in 2001. Or time [one of their members massacred 29 people.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_the_Patriarchs_massacre)  

* Hindu terrorism is so common that there is even a word for it. It's called Saffron terror. And not only are [there more Hindu extremists than Muslims.](http://scroll.in/article/718458/most-extremists-in-india-are-not-muslim-they-are-hindu) but [the Indian government considers Hindu Terrorists a much larger threat as well.](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Rahul-Gandhi-told-US-Hindu-extremists-are-a-bigger-threat-to-India/articleshow/7115703.cms)

* For Christian terrorists I could go on and on about this, pointing out examples of groups like The Lord's Resistance Army who are still active in Uganda and South Sudan and who are [still claiming child sex slaves in the name of Jesus.](https://www.rt.com/news/kony-children-sex-slavery-396/) But I'm going to try and put this into numbers. [ISIS has killed a total of 18,800 people \(almost all were other Muslims\) so far.

In that same amount of time [Christian Terrorists in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have killed a total of 300,000.](https://www.hrw.org/africa/democratic-republic-congo)

**Christian terrorists in a single country kill 16 times more people than ISIS has world wide.** 

&gt; ***Why isn't the media talking about this?***

The short reasons is that there isn't any oil in the Congo so no one cares.

**But back to the main point of this post:**

#Islam isn't causing terrorism. 

* If it did, you would expect to see Muslims in Canada reading the Qur'an and bombing buildings

* You would expect that back in the 60s Syria would of had terrorists doing the exact same thing they are doing now.

* You would expect Muslims in Kyrgyzsta not voting for a woman as President.

* And most of all you would expect that if it did cause terrorism there would be more terrorism and violence in Muslim countries as opposed to the opposite which is the case if you compare Muslim communities in the west with non-Muslim communites and compare the Middle East with 99% population Christian nations in Central Africa.

&gt; ***So what is the reason for terrorism then?***

The reason for terrorism is there being nothing to stop it.

If anyone has watched Walking Dead or Mad Max or any post apocalyptic movie then you understand the idea of those raving bands of killers and rapists going around doing whatever they want because there isn't anyone to stop them. 

Now if we put that into a real life scenario what happens is you get ISIS, you get the The Lord's Resistance Army and the Catholic Drug Lords in Honduras with their own Patron Saints and the Atheistic Rebels murdering missionaries in Thailand for being Christians and so on... 

If you are upset about terrorism here is a way you can stop it that way isn't[ harassing Muslims on the street and uploading the video to Instagram.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BHlDJBSAtxc/) The way is actually helping to stop the destabilization of these countries [by telling the U.N to do its job.](http://www.un.org/en/contact-us/)

*-Edit-*

*Thanks to /r/nureng for this*

&gt; ***But I heard that X% of Muslims want to murder infidels and kill innocent people? And force Islam on everyone.***

I've seen this a lot before. Anyone who is reading a poll that claims things like:

&gt; 80% of Muslim Americans told us they want to take over the country.

I urge you to actually find out who did this poll and look into their sample size and methodology because the weird thing is the people who are putting out these polls are always the same people. They are groups like [the Gatestone Institute which has been discredited time and time again as an Anti-Islamic propaganda mongerer.](http://www.alternet.org/investigations/one-americas-most-dangerous-think-tanks-spreading-islamophobic-hate-across-atlantic) They are people like [Frank Gaffney who was literally banned from all of the other conservative think tanks for being to racist and crazy even for them.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gaffney)

And always these polls are never Primary Sourced or Peer Reviewed. How about we look at some actually well established and cited polls.

**Here is one such example below:**

*Some people think that for the military to target and kill civilians is sometimes justified, while others think that kind of violence is never justified. Which is your opinion?*

 | Muslim | Protestant | Catholic | Jewish | Mormon | No religion/Atheist/Agnostic
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
Never justified | 78% | 38% | 39% | 43% | 33% | 56% | 
Sometimes justified | 21% | 58% | 58% | 52% | 64% | 43% | 
Depends | 0% | 0% | 2% | 3% | 3% | 0% | 

Keep in mind that the question was not asking about ""collateral damage"" but rather **targeting civilians**.

* http://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/njiym7x7nkuh2cnawawxka.gif

&gt;Gallup analysis suggests that one's religious identity and level of devotion have little to do with one's views about targeting civilians. According to the largest global study of its kind, covering 131 countries, it is human development and governance - not piety or culture - that are the strongest factors in explaining differences in how the public perceives this type of violence.

&gt;While the majority of world citizens agree that military attacks targeting civilians are never justified, a decade after 9/11, there is a wide range in the level of support for this view. A clear majority in Asia and MENA find military attacks against civilians unacceptable. This is not surprising considering the acute conflicts raging in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, and other parts of the Middle East.


&gt;In contrast, regionally, residents of the U.S. and Canada are most likely to say that military attacks against civilians are sometimes justified. **Americans are the most likely population in the world (49%) to believe military attacks targeting civilians is sometimes justified, followed by residents of Haiti and Israel (43%).**

* http://www.gallup.com/poll/157067/views-violence.aspx

Now if you do find polls that are well cited saying: 

&gt; X% of Muslims in this country want Sharia Law

Then I would encourage you to find out what percent of Christians in that country want Biblical Law.

Because if its the United States the number would have to be over 57% to beat the Republicans.

[**Since 57% of Republicans want Christianity to be the national religion of America according to a national survey done by Public Policy Polling**](http://www.politicususa.com/2015/02/25/57-republicans-dismantle-constitution-christianity-national-religion.html)

**-Edit-**

Looking more into disproportionate representation of Muslims I found that despite Muslims making up 23% of the worlds population [they account for 5 out of the past 12 Nobel Peace Prize winners.](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/) (Which is 42 percent.) 

Just a curious note on how Muslims are earning Nobel Prizes at twice the rate they porponetly should. ",EnoughTrumpSpam,1375

&gt;tied to a root is a lone pink key

&gt;dig to find what waits for thee

The flyer also have the phone number 323-283-8650 which leads to a pre-recorded message that sounds like a bunch of gibberish, but when you reverse it, you get [this message](https://a.tumblr.com/tumblr_oand9fGTPn1r9chero1.mp3) from Grunkle Stan

&gt;HELLO, IT’S GRUNKLE STAN AND I HAVE A RIDDLE FOR YOU. WHAT HAS TWO LEGS DURING THE DAY, FOUR LEGS DURING THE NIGHT, AND, UH, IT’S RED AND WHITE AND, I DUNNO, I’M NO GOOD AT THESE RIDDLES.

&gt;ANYWAY, GO TO THE PLACE, LOOK BEHIND THE NUN, FIND THE THING, AND UH, UH, ALWAYS? BE… MYS… LOOK OUT FOR MYSTERIES!!! THAT IT, DID, DID I DO IT? ALL RIGHT.

We're Rhode Island Bound...

The Salve Regina at Ochre Court where it seems the next clue is at has posted a message on [twitter](https://twitter.com/salveregina/status/756126541181050880) that there is no note on the back of any paintings. 

Stay tuned!

Grunkle Stan has updated his clue from the phone number after some party poopers spoiled the last one. Captured on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ArtemisMyths/status/756214035499061248) by AtermisMyths, the hunt is on for the next location.

&gt;A man whose first name is his last

&gt;A statue honoring his past

&gt;Right behind him by the sign of his park

&gt;A golden head shows light in the dark

Which happens to be near Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, CA, with a statue named after Griffith J. Griffith.

The clue finally [found](https://twitter.com/ramblewheels/status/756230254553817088) by twitter user ramblewheels. It was a mini golden Grunkle head! Clue details coming soon!

It's invisible ink! We'll have to [wait](https://twitter.com/ramblewheels/status/756237345108754432) for the person who found the clue to decide to share its message.

The papers mention a place that appears to be in [Century City](http://www.secretsinplainsight.com/wp-content/uploads/Century-City-Eye.jpg)

Full clue yet to be accurately decoded yet.

&gt;50 + 50 THAT'S THE CITY 

&gt;FROM ONE ANGLE IT'S QUITE PRETTY 

&gt;YOU'LL FIND A BOW TIE AND ONE EYE, AT HIS HEAD IS A RECTANGLE                                                                            

&gt;STONES BY STAIRS ATOP THE TOP RIGHT ANGLE 

&gt;THE STONE WITH THE UV SWIRL CAN GLOW 

&gt;FIND THE BLACK POUCH THAT'S BELOW

Is the best translation of the invisible ink clue found at Griffith Park so far.

The voice of Dipper himself, Jason Ritter, is on [his way](https://twitter.com/JasonRitter/status/756251437840162816) to find the next clue!

Even Ariel Hirsch is [getting in](https://twitter.com/_merp_derp_/status/756254017068556288) on it!

Jason and Ariel, along with some help, located the spot! Inside the black pouch was a flash drive.

Everyone is waiting for the holder of the flash drive to reach a computer and share its contents.

On the USB drive was a simple [audio file](https://soundcloud.com/user-187491043/nextclue) that reveals only students at CSSSA can find the next clue.

&gt;Students, scour the sub level. You'll know it when you see it.

The 6th clue was [photographed](http://musingsofapointlessexistence.tumblr.com/post/147329513728/highlights-from-my-brief-trip-to-the-sub-level) on accident a week ago!

The picture is hexadecimal, and when translated to decimal, we get the following coordinates
&gt;37°49'19.0""N 122°13'59.0""W

Which just so happen to be Piedmont Park!

No luck yet. Even with a hint from Alex and Ariel, our intrepid heroes have yet to find the next clue!

With a helpful map randomly [appearing](http://i.imgur.com/ofp2bUR.jpg) they clue has been found. Inside a treasure box below a root with a pink key tied to it was a cryptex which opened with the word PINES.

It directs people to take the key to 1825 N Vermont Ave in Los Angeles and use it to open PO Box 27128

The keyholder, [omgmei](http://twitter.com/omgmei) will be traveling to Los Angeles tomorrow to open the box!

Everyone is holding their breaths to wait for the dawn of a new day to continue towards the next clue.

Fans have swarmed the post office to wait for the keyholder to arrive and claim their destiny.

[Picture time!](https://twitter.com/TheMysteryofGF/status/756624624507650048)

Inside the PO Box was a bag of puzzle pieces and an envelope containing Stan Bucks.

Hopefully we'll have some new people solve the next clues as we continue on the hunt.

Intrepid puzzle solvers have taken solace in the House of Pies and are currently assembling the massive puzzle.

After bouncing from the House of Pies to a nearby Denny's, a small group has taken the puzzle to a private location and holding it there until they get their sleep. Meanwhile, several new bodies in the area are eagerly waiting to help solve the puzzle.

Alex gives another clue to help those struggling with the puzzle as they finally get set up at

Emerald Knights Comics &amp; Games

4116 W Burbank Blvd, Burbank, CA 91505

Puzzle solving still underway. Several people from yesterday have taken charge and decide they can't leave the puzzle in the hands of strangers. They have devised a system that favors them and allows people who show up a chance to solve the puzzle for a small amount of time.

We have a word! CORNER in a backwards Bill Cipher Font.

Alex left a [clue](https://twitter.com/_AlexHirsch/status/757041849026482176) to the layout of the map to help them out even more.

Progress on the puzzle progressed slowly. EK Comics is closing so it will be moved to one of the people's houses then tomorrow will be shifted to Meltdown Comics at 7522 Sunset Blvd in Los Angeles.

Bored while waiting for things to progress? In the meantime, solve your own [Cipher Hunt puzzle](http://www.jigsawplanet.com/?rc=play&amp;pid=0adf906d7096) based off the hint Alex gave the team earlier. See how easy it is for yourself!

The majority of puzzle solvers on location voted to keep the puzzle whole and on display locally. Only the edge pieces will be kept by those working on it and also given to previous clue finders for some reason.

After yesterday's debacle, the new and current puzzle holders have gotten serious. They will split into two groups at Meltdown Comics. One that actually wants to solve it and the other that just wants to goof off and talk to the internet. They should be just about finished setting up to start the day.

Originally scheduled to start at 11, the puzzle has arrived at 1PM and is being set up. They have the current space available until 6PM

No one there thought far enough ahead regarding battery life and data usage to give a stream. Meanwhile, Jason Ritter has shown up to eat the puzzle.

Thankfully someone finally started streaming and we can see if today is any better.

A high quality Twitch stream has been set up as the group continues to focus on the actual task at hand. Several letters are being discovered.

People have taken the images from the physical puzzle, cut them out, and put them together in a [browser based puzzle solver](https://pocketpets.itch.io/cipher-hunt-puzzle-web) you can use to solve the real puzzle!

Day 3 is almost done. It will pick back up tomorrow back at EK Comics by 2PM PDT.

Correction, there's talk of not securing EK Comics. We have no idea what's going on due to lack of communication.

Finally, using the power of the internet, the sole holder of the puzzle overnight has made excellent progress. It will be moved to EK Comics today at 2:30 PM PDT

Puzzling solving continued as Jason Ritter appeared once more to gauge their progress. Meanwhile, in his Fortress of Solitude, Alex Hirsch has given the group not one, but TWO new clues of the full puzzle's picture.

No streams with audio because of way too over-concerned parents. I'm surprised they let their kids watch this Illuminati show in the first place.

Clue seems to say Rodney, possibly the Gnome's name that Bill Cipher is hovering above.

There's now a [digital version](http://themysteryofgravityfalls.com/fqvxdrczygwxfjhrrqwxt/) of the puzzle to solve and find the real clue! Each visitor gets 1 of 10 complete mini puzzles that form the full thing.

The clue's location was guessed by [easykehl](http://imgur.com/a/ROJMe) and we're back on track! Next stop is Confusion Hill!

BUT! There's still a reason to finish both the real puzzle and the digital one. Solving the full puzzling in will life will let all fans be able to see the unaired original pilot to Gravity Falls! Solving the digital one will give us cut scenes from several Gravity Falls episodes!

There's some confusion at Confusion Hill when the next clue was obtained but in the jar was another riddle leading to Stanley St in Oregon. They are still on the hunt!

After stumbling around and finding, then dropping the clue, they told they messed up, the bolt was found. Inside a clue leading to Salem, Oregon!

The infamous hacker known as 4chan beat EVERYONE to the clue and stole it in the dead of night. Or the middle of the day. People left behind paid good money to enter the park. Hope they enjoy their visit.

&gt;THE ANSWER'S WRITTEN IN THE TREES.

A polybius cipher was the clue

Now everyone's eyes are on you

Reedsport, Oregon was since discovered

Now's the statue's time to be uncovered

The statue was found late at night with a treasure box full of wonder and mystery but by morning, a land dispute saw the police arrest Bill and haul him off. He currently resided strapped to a tree in Bicentennial Park, still in Reedsport, Oregon.",gravityfalls,1095

I was notified in Feb.2016 that I won. Prizes were a 50"" TV, $25 gift card and a [Bud Light E fridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRYT1oHxmWk). 

It's now July and I still have not received it. I called the promotion company who told me to call ‪#‎Anheuser‬-Busch. I have placed 4 phone calls where they took my info and said someone would get back to me with some information. No calls. After the 1st phone call, they know me by name. What the heck #AnheuserBusch? , waited a few weeks and called again, ""we're looking into it sir"".  Waited a few weeks and called again, ""we're looking into it sir"", and again  waited a few weeks and called again, ""we're looking into it sir"". The supervisor has emailed the distribution company. I asked if someone could call the distribution company and they said their only contact with them was a generic email and the distribution company said it was out for delivery...3 weeks ago. No one can tell me where it is. I don't want to sound ungrateful, I just don't want this stuff dropped on my front porch when I'm not home.

I think they should stuff the fridge with some swag when I get it.. If I get it. I even did some public shaming on Facebook, twitter and instagram.

Frustrating.

As far as I know, of course, and it's not like I can get there everyday anyways. I don't have a car and riding on a bike is a bit, well, hard. I can't check everything, but I don't see any on the map. It's a huge problem, it's hard to play and I think I'm not the only one. Saw alot of empty map posts on this sub, while people in Washington, Los Angeles have so many stops they don't even check them all.

sjchoking,2016-06-26 22:57:36+00:00,How a 50 team NHL alignment and expansion should look be.,"Now that Las Vegas is a confirmed team the NHL will have 31 teams. To expand to 50 this is the route I would take. 

The first thing I would do is revive teams that have been defunct which are the Quebec Nordiques, Hamilton Tigers, Hartford Whalers, Kansas City Scouts, Cleveland Baron and Altanta Thrashers. 

For the next 13 expansion teams I first looked at the most populated cities that have a team in NBA, NFL, and MLB, but not the NHL which is only Houston. Then cities with at least 2 teams in NBA, NFL or MLB: San Diego, New Orleans, Baltimore, Seattle, Indianapolis. Then most populated cities with at least 1 team: Sacramento, San Antonio, Portland, Salt Lake City, Orlando, Oklahoma City. Then I threw in Saskatoon because I needed another Canadian city in the West. 

The season will be expanded to 106 games. With 4 games(2 home, 2 away) against each division opponent and 2 games(1 home, 1 away) against the other 45 teams. Also,the playoffs will be expanded to 32 teams.

For alignment of the divisions I decided to group teams into 2 Conferences(East and West) with 5 division of 5 teams within each conference. Then for divisions I grouped teams geographically and culturally and ignored some rivalries.

**West**

*Canadian West Division*

* Vancouver Canucks
* Calgary Flames
* Edmonton Oilers

I decided to watch a documentary last night after seeing a post about hidden oil rigs in Los Angeles. I was thought about the Clinton Body count and decided to try and find a good documentary about it. After 3 or 4 videos I finally found one that was excellent. I ended up falling asleep halfway through the program, but saved the video to my YouTube account so I could send to my mom today since we had a conversation about it yesterday. I just went back to my YouTube account to send it to my mom and the video has been deleted. There were quite a few comments on it and quite a few views. At least 200,000. What gives? 

Btw is was an excellent documentary and extremely descriptive talking about Whitewater fraud. It also went into the drug trafficking trade that the Clintons were involved in with Arkansas. I really want to finish the documentary. It sucks that I can't now. It was a little over two hours long and had an older gentleman narrating the story. If you guys have seen this documentary or know what I'm talking about, please link or send PM the link so I can finish it. I'd also like my mom to see it.

(Update) I found the video. This one is shorter than the one I was watching last night, but this is the video I was watching. Case solved. Thanks r/conspiracy for helping. Here is the video below

**********PLEASE SHARE!**********

From Nomi in LA, California...(as reported via FB, no changes made, but not my post.)

Dear friends,

Our tiny little Los Angeles ballot supervising team, credit mainly to our lead Julie Tyler, just did something really big.

Here goes.

Provisional ballots have to be counted last, mainly to avoid duplicate votes. They make up an enormous amount of ballots this election cycle--50% of them--and they began their count on Sunday, June 19th, just two days ago.

We noticed that out of the first 4,000 provisional ballots pulled, 1,000 of them were snagged because they were cast as ""Democratic"" ballots instead of ""NPP/crossover Democratic"" ballots. If you are NPP and received a Democratic ballot, you fell under the umbrella too.

For the record, I have never even SEEN an ""NPP/crossover Democratic"" ballot. Throughout the whole campaign, we, and hundreds of thousands of others, apparently, assumed a Dem ballot and a crossover Dem ballot were the same thing. Anyway, my guess as to why so many miscast ballots rolled in was either due to a misinformed poll worker, or the voter insisted on getting a Democratic ballot thinking they would be safer that way.

After spending so many hours supervising ballots, the main reason I've trusted the efficiency of it is because of their unwavering commitment to honor the voter's intent. So where did that go?

The concern of 25% of the provisional votes being tossed aside due to a formality was immediately reported on Sunday afternoon.

Yesterday, our little group banned together outside in heartache and frustration. Then something interesting happened. The chief executive took us into a little area down the hallway on the 5th floor, where we received the groundbreaking report:

""I have a bit of good news for you. I want you to know that we looked into it, and we agree that this issue falls under the category of voter intent. We want you to know that we have decided to count every Democratic ballot cast by an NPP voter."" -Aaron Nevarez, Chief Executive Assistant of the Los Angeles Voters Registrar

Now that 66,500 NPP voters' Democratic ballots will be counted in Los Angeles as of around 1:00pm yesterday, this could mean the recovery of up to 580,000 uncounted votes in California. That's an eighth of the votes of the state. We have 16 days to get the word out to Secretary of State Alex Padilla and every county in California, who need to follow LA's lead and get those votes in.

On a personal level, nothing will replace the wave of chills over my body and the tears that came when we heard the news. We continue to show, ask questions, take notes, have meetings and conference calls, get angry, make headway, take steps backward, but all while continuing to say: ""This is not okay. Our system can do better.""

Never ever underestimate the power of people vehemently pursuing love and truth.

OUR VOICES ARE THE REVOLUTION.

And no, this is will not be on the news. So please share it.

Love,
Nomi",SandersForPresident,5004

Edit: 

To clarify: 1 in 4 of the provisional ballots they came across were regular Democratic ballots cast by people who were ""supposed"" to cast ""NPP / crossover Democratic ballots"", which apparently are different. The person who wrote this is calling on us to get the word out to other counties and continue the fight to count all provisional ballots; please honor their effort by heeding that call.

&gt;Like, to repeat myself, the rampant hate and violence in the far right. &lt;User&gt; is making a statement about fighting back. It's a distinction I wouldn't want to see in this sub, but hardly a statement calling for rampant violence, and hardly a statement calling for rampant violence against a particular group of people.

This, obviously is contrived bullshit. &lt;user&gt; explicitly stated that she wanted violence even if it made her look 'radical'. Also, a cucked user was in support of this violence and said that she wanted to see me hanging from a lamp post. (Admins won't do shit obviously). Shortly afterwards she deleted her comments, but she has a similar comment in AMRS out [here](http://archive.is/GgHdS)

Anyway, the mod didn't like the fact that I was against violence, and after arguing for about an hour she temp banned me and told me to make this write-up with sources, of the left being violent. So here goes:

So &lt;user&gt; and the mod;s beliefs aren't limited to Reddit. They're spreading all over the left. As we saw, Cuckington Post advocated violence against Trump supporters. 

[Source](http://www.infowars.com/huffpo-columnist-advocates-violence-against-trump-supporters/)

To quote the article:

&gt;It’s not liberal politicians or masses that historians identify as the spark underlying the modern movement for LGBTQ equality… It was the people who took to the streets during the Stonewall Uprising. It was the Watts Rebellion, not the Watts Battle of Ideas, that exposed the enduring systemic neglect, poverty, inequality, and racism faced by that community. Similarly, it was the LA Uprising, not the LA Protests, that led to significant changes in the Los Angeles Police Department.

To sum it up in the words of Infowars:

&gt;In short, change is impossible without property damage, looting, assault, and murder.

The cucked user stated:

&gt;This isn't a hate sub. And they're right. The right has bombed abortion clinics, murdered minorities and homosexuals, perpetuated domestic violence and is more than willing to see our people starve. A violent left is a natural conclusion of what the right has been doing for decades.

Bernie4Ever,2016-06-10 08:29:13+00:00,"Already 1 million ballots have been declared invalid in California, 2.5 million still uncounted","According to the California Secretary of State Alex Padilla himself, as of Thursday afternoon, **more than 6 million ballots have already been counted**, and it is estimated that the number **will climb to 8.5 million** From the [LA Times article](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-california-primary-20160607-htmlstory.html):

&gt;More than 2.5 million ballots were left uncounted on election day across California, a process that could take several days or longer and leave close races in limbo.  
&gt;&amp;nbsp;  
&gt;Secretary of State Alex Padilla posted a report late Thursday on unprocessed ballots. Most of that total -- about 1.8 million -- were mailed to voters but returned only on Tuesday.  
&gt;&amp;nbsp;  
&gt;Six million ballots have already been counted from the statewide primary. The uncounted tally would push total voter turnout to about 8.5 million, or around 47% of all registered voters.  
&gt;&amp;nbsp;  
&gt;Los Angeles County had more unprocessed ballots than anywhere, about 616,000. San Diego County reported 285,000 uncounted ballots.  
&gt;&amp;nbsp;  
&gt;A portion of the unprocessed total are provisional ballots -- designated for voters whose registration status can't be immediately verified on election day. If a provisional ballot is later found to have been cast mistakenly, it may not be counted.

&amp;nbsp;  
But at the same time at 7:31 PM on Thursday, there were 1,703,000 Republican valid votes and 3.550,000 Democratic valid votes which makes **a total of 5.2 million recorded valid votes**.  
&amp;nbsp;  
But if more than **6M ballots had been already processed** at that time **and only 5.2M valid votes recorded**, that means that **more or less 1 million ballots must have been declared invalid.** Don't forget that sentence in the article:  
&gt;""If a provisional ballot is later found to have been cast mistakenly, it may not be counted.""  

&amp;nbsp;  
#Hey wake up all! 1 million votes (probably for Bernie) have already been thrown into the trashcan!  
&amp;nbsp;  

And this continues as we speak! As I mentioned [in a comment in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/4ndw22/25_million_ca_ballots_still_left_to_be_counted/), I have noticed **that the number of uncounted ballots is continuing to decrease steadily but the total of the counted ballots only increases very little.** Just by looking at the numbers from time to time, I am estimating that the number of counted ballots increases at a third of the rate of the decrease of uncounted ballots.   
&amp;nbsp;  
#This is continuing with the 2.5 million still uncounted ballots!  
&amp;nbsp;  
To verify how much votes are being stolen, let  us measure it in a very simple way: let's take the [official counted ballot number](http://vote.sos.ca.gov/returns/president/party/democratic/) as being published and time-stamped ""**reporting as of June 9, 2016, 4:49 p.m**"":  
- Bernie = 1,528,853  
- Clinton = 1,977,908  
- sum of other candidates = 32,650  
&amp;nbsp;  
Let us also keep the [official number of the unprocessed ballot report](http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/statewide-elections/2016-primary/unprocessed-ballots-report.pdf) as being published and time-stamped ""**Updated: 06/09/2016 5:16 p.m.**""  
Unprocessed ballots = 2,586,331  
&amp;nbsp;  
The measures are not too far apart in time. Please note that **the 2.5M uncounted ballots number mentioned by Secretary Padilla matches perfectly the number in the official report** that is time-stamped just before Secretary Padilla's speech. We can then be pretty sure that the other numbers he mentioned are also correct. **I will go and get the numbers on a regular basis and post them here.** Thus, we will be able to compare these measures each day for the next days and **we will see how many votes were stolen from Bernie.**

We are former Los Angeles gang members and social activists who are now trained community interventionists working in the same neighborhoods we came up in. We work to break the cycle of violence that we once helped to create by developing protocols to restore communities.

A few years ago, we were approached by folks who wanted to make a documentary to tell our story. **That documentary, *LICENSE TO OPERATE*, premiered today** on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, Xbox, and Vudu. The film is also debuting globally in Geneva July 6-8 at the *Reviewing the State of Safety in World Cities Conference*, organized by the UN. **Check out the trailer: *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIkzA4U7UbE***

Pete Carroll, Head Coach of the Seattle Seahawks, was instrumental in helping to bring this group together. [Here he is speaking about it on 60 Minutes.](https://youtube.com/Y-wIAL0Dfsw?t=7m2s)

Over the last few years, professionals from the public safety, local and regional municipalities, numerous universities and emergency responders have credited our work with aiding in the significant decrease of violent crimes in the neighborhoods we serve. Here’s a little more about each of us: 


* **Alfred Lomas** – Gang interventionist, former gang member from South Central Los Angeles, which he also now covers.
* **Aquil Basheer** – Founder of the License to Operate movement and the Professional Community Intervention Training Institute which officially trains/certifies interventionists and other professionals to do this work.
* **James Lipetzky** – Director of *LICENSE TO OPERATE*
* **Reynaldo Reaser** – Executive Director of R.A.C.E. (Reclaiming America’s Communities Through Empowerment), Gang interventionist and former Raymond Crip now covering LA’s West Athens Neighborhood

We’re also here with **Officer Stinson Brown** (LAPD, Gang Intervention Liaison – Criminal Gang/Homicide Division), who has been a change agent in the collaborative mindset between interventionists and law enforcement. We are all proof of what can happen when everyone works together for a greater good.

Jaksim,2016-06-06 16:05:41+00:00,There was nobody quite like my Uncle Ford. Hopefully there never will be.,"The first time I ever saw Uncle Ford I was only ten. I didn’t even know I had an uncle until he showed up one day at the edge of our fence with a suitcase. Most of his body was covered by a heavy brown coat, far too warm for the weather. He never approached the house. He simply spoke to my father at the edge of our property and then he left.

I asked my father later: “Who was that man?”

He didn’t try to bullshit me. “That’s your uncle. My half-brother. Ford Domini.”

My dad said the reason he didn’t tell me about Uncle Ford was that he didn’t want me to think poorly of his father. My grandfather, David Domini, was an Italian immigrant who had come to America in the forties. Ford was born in 1956. Shortly after Ford’s birth, Ford’s mother died and his medical practice fell apart. My grandfather, penniless and destitute, was forced to give Ford up for adoption. My father wasn’t born until ten years later, after grandfather had remarried. Dad said that his dad always wished he could have found Ford again after he was back on his feet.

After Ford visited our farm the first time, I didn’t see him again until that summer, three months later. In June of 1993, Ford showed up again at the edge of our property, with the same suitcase and coat. Father wasn’t there when he arrived, but I knew to greet the man.

“You’re my dad’s brother, aren’t you?”

“H-H-Half-brother. But y-yes, I am.”

“How come you never showed up til now?”

“I’d been traveling. I n-n-never even knew I had a n-n-nephew til now.”

“You okay, mister?”

“Y-yes I am. I have a bit of a speaking impediment. I… apologize.”

“Ford! I wasn’t expecting you this early!” My father was jogging up from the fields, where he had been hard at work slashing the weeds.

Ford was a very tall, broad shouldered man. His face was tanned and wrinkled, and showed many visible scars and scrapes. His face turned a bright scarlet when my father spoke.

“Y.. yes. I apologize. The work dried up q-quicker than I had anti-… anti-…” Ford struggled with the word. “It dried up faster than I thought...”

“No need to apologize. We can always use the extra help on the farm.” My father turned to me. “James, Uncle Ford is going to be staying with us for a while. He’ll be sleeping in the barn.”

I took Ford’s suitcase and led him up the cracked clay path that led to our barn. Ford remained quiet for the duration of the walk. When we got there, I showed him where the hay would stay the driest if it rained, and pulled out the cot stashed behind the stalls. All the while, Ford hunched awkwardly in the low entrance to the barn.

“We aren’t tending any cattle or goats this year, so you’ll have the barn to yourself.”

He nodded. He was still wearing the heavy brown coat.

“Aren’t you hot, wearing that old thing?”

He nodded again, slowly. With a cautious, deliberate manner, he removed the coat from his shoulders. I realized that the coat was not meant to keep him warm, but rather was to cover up his body. Sprouting from his sides were not two, but four arms. The second set started just below the armpits. They were smaller and thinner than his other arms, but they all moved in conjunction as he folded up his coat. I gasped.

“I-I-I’m sorry if my app-appearance is disturbing to y-y-you.”

I stood in shock for a moment. Ford unfolded his coat and began to put it back on.

“No no! It’s fine! I was just surprised. I apologize for my manners.”
Ford smiled a half smile and set the coat down. As I left the barn, he unpacked his suitcase for a stay that I assumed would last a few months. It ended up lasting for several years.

Ford didn’t talk much for his first few weeks on the farm. It was just as well – the three of us spent most of our days working in the fields, weeding and preparing the ground for planting, and most of our evenings were spent sleeping off the day’s work. The first time I had a conversation with Ford was in late July; it was raining, which prevented us from working the fields. Around midday, my mother had me bring Ford supper out in the barn.

I hadn’t been back to the barn since Ford had moved in, but he had spent a lot of time there. He had redecorated. Various diagrams and papers hung from the walls of the barn. Many depicted human and animal anatomy. There were homemade wooden carvings decorating the boxes and shelves in the barn.
Ford quickly stood when I entered, slyly closing a book that he had been reading.

“Nah, don’t worry. Mom just wanted me to bring you supper.”

“Th-Thank you James.”

“What’s with all the pictures?”

“They’re… They’re from medical books. Human a-a-anatomy, and the like.”

“Huh. What’re these carvings?” I held up one of the homemade carvings. It was of a normal adult man, except he had three arms, the third of which reached straight out from an extended stomach.

Ford snatched it from my hand. “J-j-just a hobby. Like the pictures. Human sh-shape fascinates me. I always wanted to be a doctor.”

“Like your dad?”

“Huh?”

“Like Grandpa. Dad said he was a doctor.”

Ford laughed a gravely, strained laugh that devolved quickly into coughing. I nearly jumped. Ford’s usually quiet and melancholy tone shifted.

“He was a plastic surgeon. Hardly a doctor. Couldn’t even k-keep his business afloat.”

I placed Ford’s dinner in front of him. He ate, all four arms working into the rotation of shoveling food into his face. I stood and watched him for a few moments.

“Do you remember him?”

Ford stopped with a spoonful of grits half way up to his mouth. “Y-y-yes. Of course. I l-lived with that asshole until I w-was ten y-years old.”

“Oh. Dad made it sound like he gave you up for adoption when you were just a baby.”

“G-gave me up for.. for adoption?”

“Yeah, that’s what dad told me.”

Ford’s face paled. His lips dropped into a frown. “No. he didn’t p—p-put me up for ad-d-doption. He fucking sold me!” He was yelling.

I backed away toward the door, frightened. Ford’s face relaxed and he stepped towards me, the arms on his right side outstretched.

“No, wait! I’m s-sorrry. But my brother was mistaken when he told you that. My f-father sold me to a f-f-freakshow when I was ten.” Ford was calm. “I guess my f-fa-ther never told him that.”

We stood in silence for a moment. I stared at the ground, not knowing what to say. Ford stared at his nearly empty plate. He dropped his fork onto the plate, the dull clang breaking the silence.

“James, do you th-th-think your father would want to know who your grandf-f-father really was?”

“What do you mean?”

“Would my brother want to kn-know the t-tr—truth?”

I hesitated, wondering what exactly Ford meant. “Yes, I think he would.”

Ford gave the same knowing nod he always gave.

That evening, Ford confronted my parents and me in our kitchen, and he told us the story of his life. He told us the truth about my grandfather, he told us about his birth - he told us about his life in the freak show.

The story started the same way my father told it. David Domini (my grandfather) moved to America from Italy in 1944. Belle, his wife and Ford’s mother, came with him. He spent the first five years studying at Stanford Medical School, and when he got his doctorate, he went into the field of reconstructive plastic surgery. Contrary to what Ford had said, it sounds like my grandfather was quite the doctor – he specialized in constructing and attaching prosthetic limbs for those injured in near-fatal accidents. However, by the 1950s, his practice had expanded to include cosmetic plastic surgery – nose jobs, tummy tucks, you name it.

They lived in Los Angeles, where, thanks to David’s skilled hands, they were heralded as minor celebrities. In 1955, Belle learned that she was pregnant with Ford. The way Ford told it, this was just another link the chain of good fortune that had fallen in the laps of the Domini’s since they came to America.

Ford was born on February 29th, 1956. The delivery was particularly difficult. It lasted twelve hours, bringing Belle intense physical and mental stress. When the delivering surgeon placed the baby in her arms, she screamed at the four armed child squirming in her arms. Ford told us that she died shortly after of blood loss resulting from the birth. He claimed that his first memory is of her screams–

‘It’s all wrong! This can’t be my baby!”

Ford told us that my grandfather blamed him for Belle’s death. He became drunk and distraught and his practice fell apart over the next ten years. Ford spent those ten years alone. Having been deemed too freakish for normal society, Ford was kept chained up in the attic, with the only window boarded shut by my grandfather. He was home-schooled and brought all of his meals by a maid who had been paid off for her silence. As far as the LA elites knew, David Domini’s child was born dead.

Despite his contempt for Ford, Ford told us that grandfather was never violent, but always very clear about his disdain for Ford. He regularly told Ford he was a mutant, a monster – that he should never have been born. Ford told us that he grew used to the verbal abuse after a while, but that he was crushed by the crippling loneliness. Apart from his father and the maid he saw for a few hours a day, Ford was separated from the living world for the first ten years of his life. His one solace was a hole in the boards that covered his only window. Through it, he watched neighborhood children playing in the street.

Ford told us that he remembered looking at the kids and feeling alone. Not just because he couldn’t play with them, but also because they looked so different than him. They all had two arms – there wasn’t a soul in the world who could understand Ford.
It was his idea to join the freak show; because he needed to find a sense of belonging. When his father mentioned the existence of such a group during one of Ford’s lessons, he was adamant he wanted to join one. Eager to rid himself of his son’s burden, my grandfather contacted a man who ran one of the most unscrupulous traveling freak shows in the country. The man, Alabaster Consten, purchased Ford from my grandfather just a few days later.

My grandfather moved to a small town in Giliman County, Colorado, where he remarried and had my father. He reopened a small medical practice in town, and lived in the very house I grew up in until his death in the late eighties. My father and grandmother never heard anything about his past life, other than the occasional mention of Ford’s existence.

Things were not so easy for Ford. “Consten’s Marvelous and Terrifying Creatures” was a traveling freak show – and it was brutal and disgusting. Ford was one of many under Alabaster Consten’s thumb. There was a bearded polish woman, two dwarves from Germany, a psychologically and physically scarred man known only as “The Lizard Man”, as well as a few who came and went. Alabaster was a cruel man quick to beat and maim the freaks. Ford told me that Consten didn’t think of him or the others as humans – he thought of them like cattle.

Although they were like him in many ways, Ford still felt quite lonely around the other freaks. Of all of the freaks, Ford was treated the best. He was the main attraction. His act was complex and dangerous. 

After the German Dwarves left the stage, he entered by climbing upside-down on a series of trapeze and ropes. When he touched the ground, Alabaster threw him a series of increasingly dangerous objects to juggle – flaming rings, knives, etcetera. But his greatest trick, the climax of his performance, was the water tank. The other freaks would emerge from backstage and tie him up with thick, rough rope. Then they would throw him into a deep tank of water that the cheering crowd could see into. The knots binding him were numerous and tough. It took all of Ford’s arms working at once to free him before the air drained from his lungs. He worked with the wet rope, underwater and unable to see, as the crowd cheered at his every mistake. His biological advantages were not always enough to save him. He occasionally failed, leaving the other freaks to pull him out of the water before he drowned. The crowd met this failure with boos and thrown drinks and popcorn containers. Alabaster met this failure with a swift and painful beating.

For fear that he would receive a beating, Ford usually did his act perfectly. As a result, Alabaster usually left him alone. Most of the freaks had to do the maintenance jobs that came along with the show – cleaning, setting up tents, and tending to the animals. But Alabaster didn’t make Ford do any of that, because he was the main act. This star treatment led the other freaks to resent and distance themselves from Ford.

Ford told my parents and I that he felt hated by the people who watched the show, because he was different, but he felt hated by the other freaks because he wasn’t different enough.

He stayed with the freak show until he was 25. He spent the subsequent thirteen years traveling the country. The whole time, he was looking for another person that he could connect with. Another person like him.

“Well?” My father was dozing in his chair, and my mother had long since gone to bed. At the end of Ford’s story, it was almost 2 in the morning.

“W-w-well what James?”

“Did you ever find anybody? Like you?”

Ford crossed all four of his arms, forming a bundled mess in front of him. His head drooped and he slowly moved it side to side.

“Not yet. Not yet.”

Uncle Ford stayed with my family through the winter. By springtime, Ford had started the surgeries. He would find injured animals – wild ones, or various animals from our neighbors or the local townies, and perform lifesaving surgeries on them with medical supplies he had my father order. He stitched together open cuts, mended broken bones, etcetera.  He didn’t charge any of the townspeople for what he did, saying it was his pleasure to help the animals.

The people from the town were charmed by Ford, despite his deformity. Ford was always gentle and kind to them, and most of them appreciated the free veterinary services. There was even a girl from town who took a liking to Ford - a brunette woman who worked for the post office. They went out a few times, but I don’t think that Ford was much of a ladies man.

Although they found his hobbies unusual, Ford grew closer with my parents all the time. He and my father spent hours in the fields, planting and fumigating the corn. They took up playing cards in the afternoons. In the evenings, Ford and my mother would dance to old records. They’d move slowly together, Ford’s right hands on her left hip, a left hand on her right, and a hand holding hers out in the air. Dad never looked jealous when they danced, only happy that the family was all together.

It seemed like Ford had finally found a place where he could be at home, with my family and I.

But then… it was like a switch flipped. As the summer and fall of 1994 went on, Ford grew distant. All at once he stopped offering surgeries to the townsfolk. He still helped us out in the fields, but he never came into the main house in the evenings anymore. When my father offered to clear out our basement so he could live with us, Ford turned him down.

He started locking the barn door. Ford stopped talking to any of us. The most he would say was “hello” or “e-excuse me”. My family and I tried our best to get him to open up, but he resisted all attempts. He spent all his time up in the barn, by himself. He still treated the wild animals that got hurt on our property. But he had gotten worse at it. More often than not, I would see animals crawling around with messy stitches, many still bleeding or more mangled than when they came into the barn.

One day I heard a rabbit crying in the fields. I found it dragging a mutilated body through the dirt. It had undergone some form of operation from Ford - I could see the characteristic blue thread he used underneath all the dried blood. An extra, non-functional hind leg had been stitched to its back. It whimpered when it moved.

I brought the distorted rabbit to my father, who promised he’d bring it up to Ford. My dad put the rabbit out of its misery. I remember that it was struggling when he first picked it up. But then all at once it stopped. It didn’t even whimper when he raised the gun to it. I think it wanted to die.

My parents grew worried about Ford. By winter of 1994 he never 
left the barn. My parents considered calling the police and having him removed, but my mother worried what might happen to him if he was taken to jail. Ford had already had a hard life – he clearly needed help.

On Christmas that year, Ford finally left the barn. We were eating breakfast in the house, and we all saw him exit at once. He was wearing his big heavy coat and carrying his suitcase, which was overflowing with papers. Snow whistled around him, and he shook despite the heavy coat. We watched as he walked down the clay path to our back door, where he knocked. My mother let him in.

We stared in silence. Then Ford spoke.

“I’m s-s-sorry, everyone.”
Tears formed at my mother’s eyes.

“What’s happened to you?” My father asked him, grabbing him by the shoulder.

“You have all been very g-g-g-good to me. B-b-but I th-think I have to go.”

“Why?” tears were streaming down my mother’s face.

“You all aren’t like m-m-me.”

“What are you talking about?”

Ford was crying now too. “You are… aren’t like me. You’re n-normal, and I’m n-n-not. Nobody could ch-change that.”

“Ford, that’s not fair. You can’t just leave us because we look different than you!” My father was yelling.

The room was tense. Everyone was deeply sobbing. All the Dominis stood there and cried for a while. Finally, it was Ford who broke the silence.

“I’ve done something b-b-b-bad.”
My father asked him what he meant.

“I’ve d-d-done something bad. I’m so sorry everyone.”

“What did you do Ford?”

“I didn’t want to be the only one.”

“What did you do?”

“It’s… The b-b-barn.”
Ford was red in the face. All of his arms hung at his side and tears poured down his cheeks. He looked at me.

“I didn’t want to b-b-be al-l-lone anymore.”

My father opened the back door and walked towards the barn. We stood in silence and watched through the window. We watched him climb the clay path through howling snow. We watched as my father opened the door and stepped inside the barn.

Moments later, he came tumbling out onto his knees, and vomited. He sprinted towards the house. I’ll never forget my father’s face. It was white as the snow around him. He burst through the back door.

“I’m s-s-sorry brother. I’m so sorry.”

My father turned to my mother. “Call the police. Don’t let him leave.”

“But Jack-“

“Call them!”

Ford didn’t even try to leave. He just stood in our kitchen and sobbed. My dad went into our den and grabbed his rifle- the same rifle he had used to shoot the rabbit I found. He loaded it then stepped back into the blizzard. My mother called the police from the other room.

I stood alone with Ford in our kitchen. We watched through the window in silence as my father stepped back into the barn. We heard a single shot from the gun, and then only the sound of the snow and wind outside.

When the police arrived, they searched the barn. The walls were covered in the carcasses of animals that Ford had captured – Rabbits, birds, frogs, a few stray dogs and cats. They were all wrong. They had parts sewn onto to them – arms, legs, ears, tails – that didn’t belong. Most had an extra set of limbs sewn on either side of them in a sick imitation of Ford’s extra limbs. The animals were dead from either blood loss or infection.

The floor was covered in dried blood and filth. The police found, in one corner of the barn, a pair of dirty boots and a soil covered shovel. They later matched this soil to a local cemetery in town, where several graves had been found manually exhumed in the middle of the night. Ford had been digging.

But I saw with my own eyes the horror that caused my father to wretch outside the barn. While the police were on their way, Ford led me up to the mouth of the barn and opened its jaws to show me what he had done.

“I d-d-didn’t want t-t-to be alone anymore. You understand r-r-right?”

There was a young woman – early twenties. Brunnette. It was the woman from the post office. The one who had always liked Ford so much. She was naked, save for metal restraints on her ankles and neck that led to chains on the wall. Dried blood caked most of her body. On her sides were two rotting pieces of flesh – arms that Ford has undoubtedly ripped from other corpses in hopes of creating a second copy of himself. They had been sewn on with blue thread. They were black and green with decay, which was quickly spreading to the rest of her body. She was dead. There was a bucket near her that had clearly been used as a bathroom, and refuse from food that suggested she had been imprisoned there for several weeks. The police arrested Ford. He pled guilty to grave robbing, animal abuse, kidnapping, and murder. He received life in prison.

My father never talked about what he saw, except once in 1999, after we had received word from the prison that Ford had killed himself. Dad told me that when he entered the barn the first time, the woman was still alive.

My father rushed to her side moving to unlock her metal restraints. 

She asked him to stop. 
He told her that he was there to help. 
She said that it was too late. She said she didn’t want to suffer anymore.

That’s why my father got the gun from the house. 

I don’t think Ford actually wanted to hurt anyone. He was deeply sick and disturbed. But mostly, he was just alone.

There was no one in the world like Ford Domini. Hopefully there never will be again.

**Progress Pic**: 16 to 21...http://imgur.com/a/mSiXp


**Introduction**:

Hey guys, I just want to share my story with you all and hopefully inspire some of you to take control of your life and pursue fitness and confidence. Below I share my beginning and current stats along with information about the dieting protocol I utilized along with exercise protocol I experienced with. Please feel free to comment and I will do my best to answer more questions if the interest is there.

**Fitness has changed my life.**

Growing up, I was bullied mercilessly. I still remember times when I was strangled in public and no one stood up for me. I was laughed at and beat up so many times, was the youngest in my class for the majority of my childhood years and also one of the skinniest. I was suicidal and severely depressed up until my early teen years. 

I began working out in my room when I was around 12 with just a push-up set and no idea how to train, but as I pursued fitness, I realized that it was a venue for me to rise above and become someone who I wanted to be: outgoing, confident, energetic, positive and happy. It has brought me all those and more.

My physique began to transform, and when I turned 17 and entered college, I began pursuing it as a lifestyle. It had developed into a passion. I also got NASM-certified at 18 and began training clients of all ages, developing great relationships and having the opportunity to change lives through training like I never would have imagined.

However, up until last year, I was still in a mental shell. I suffered from severe social anxiety and would get panic attacks when I was in a situation and deciding whether or not to attend a social event. I grew up in a very traditional Asian family and was cultured to be afraid of the world. 

This past year, I pushed myself to attend huge **raves solo and sober and forced myself to meet new people as I always wanted to experience the scene (I love EDM). I documented some of it in the video and hope it can inspire some of you all out there. These were some of the most exhilarating experiences of my life.**

**Next Steps:**

**Starting a youtube channel and inspiring and reaching more people through fitness has been a dream of mine the past few years and is the next step for me.** I have been approached by many people regarding fitness, so I feel a big calling to start a channel to share my journey and want to encompass fitness, confidence and progressing in life. My goal through fitness is not just to improve myself, but also to impact, change and inspire others to pursue fitness and a happier life.

In the future I would like to open my own gym and may try my hand at competing in the NPC or in powerlifting competitions. I am also developing my training business as I have had success training clients in person and am branching out in the Los Angeles area. I may pursue further schooling in the future for physical therapy or medicine. 

Due to school these past few years, I did not feel I could commit fully to developing a quality channel. I busted my butt in college and achieved high honors, but now I am pursuing this endeavor to hopefully inspire more people throughout the world through my passion for fitness. 

Here are the stats to my transformation and my info:

**Beginning weight, height and age**: 140 lbs, 5’9, 16 years old

**My current weight, height and age:** 185 lbs, 6’ and 21 years old

**Current credentials:**

-Certified as a Personal Trainer, corrective exercise specialist and fitness nutrition specialist by the National Academy of Sports Medicine: CPT, CES, FNS 

-Bachelor of Science: Phi Beta Kappa in Human Biology Exercise Physiology

-Fitness Model with Naturally Fit Agency

-Owner at DavidWangFitness

**Detailed Diet and exercise routine history:**

-Consistently tracking macros for 1023 days straight at this point and modifying as necessary

-In the beginning, I was extremely strict with my diet, eating every 2 hours, packing a massive cooler with me to work daily and was even ridiculed for doing this. But it helped me stay on track towards my fitness goals. I have learned a lot through education since this point and how to modify my diet further to adjust to situations, but meal prepping and sticking to whole foods the majority of the time has been a big part of my diet plan.

-**Calories consumed**: From 16 - 17, I consumed around 3000 calories a day as this allowed me to make significant noob gains. However, I modified my caloric intake as I saw fit based on my progress. If my weight was stalling or I was not seeing strength gains, I slightly increased my calories to allow for a slightly greater surplus. However, I aimed to always stay fairly lean. I gauged this by my overall definition (mostly abs) and weight. If I wanted to get leaner, I tracked macros and adjusted accordingly to allow for a caloric deficit and gauged progress by weight and how I looked. 

-**Supplements consumed**: Whey protein, creatine, beta alanine, fish oil, BCAAs, multivitamin. All natural stuff. I have never used a pre-workout in my life as I feel these are unnecessary and often have a ton of stimulants like caffeine and ingredients and can cause dependency. I zone in for my training sessions 10 - 15 minutes before I train and meditate, visualizing success and preparing for intensity. The mind and focusing 100% on your training goals to me is far more powerful than a pre-workout supplement.

-**Programs followed**: When I first began training (before 16), I had no knowledge whatsoever about program design…would knock out tons of push-ups in my room. Led to shoulder impingement and elbow tendonitis from improper training (not enough pulling to balance the pushing). This made me start learning how to train smart and helped me develop a passion for the body.

I currently structure my own training split as I have found what works best for my body, which is DUP (daily undulating periodization) style training. However, around 16 years old, I trained for athletics and plyometrics, following volume and explosive based training for basketball. 

Then, I began similar protocol to starting strength to build strength, but stuck with lower reps for big compounds and hypertrophy rep ranges for accessories. Over time, I developed more knowledge and began modifying rep ranges for strength and hypertrophy protocol based on my progress and goals. Today I primarily stick with DUP.



-**Beginning stats for bench, squat and deadlift**: 

Bench: 95 lbs for 1 rep

Squat: 95 lbs for 3x5 superset with step-ups 3x5

Deadlift: ~135 lbs

**Current stats for bench, squat and deadlift:**

Bench: ~260…I typically stick with incline bench for 225 for reps…3x3 or so due to bench causing issues for me the in past due to previous shoulder impingement. But I have been recently incorporating it back into my routine.

Squat: 420…2x3

Deadlift: 525…2x3

**Thank you all for taking the time to read this post and I hope it inspires you guys to take control of your life and settle for nothing less.**",Fitness,3192

OBJesus,2016-05-25 23:46:20+00:00,Dear /r/NFL: Everyone hates you [OC],"#""Fuck You /r/NFL""  - /r/NFL 

[Inspired by this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3cbauy/hey_rnba_almost_everybody_hates_you/), I started browsing some team subreddits over the past year. I have noticed that a lot of them, unsurprisingly, feel the same hate towards /r/NFL. Most team subreddits have least one post about why they hate /r/NFL, or why this sub hates on their team. A lot of team subreddits feel this sub singles out their team in some way. So I thought I would research to see how extensive the /r/NFL hate goes among team subs. Here are the results:

gideonvwainwright,2016-05-12 05:43:12+00:00,Do you want Bernie to win? Then he needs to win California. A conservative statewide advertising campaign would cost more than $5 million. Please donate.,"I apologize for linking NBC/Comcast establishment propaganda, but there are kernels of truth in this article. http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/bernie-sanders-weakened-heading-golden-state-n572541

&gt;Despite notching two wins this month, with more likely to come, Sanders is running lower on cash than expected and replaced his top official in California Wednesday. 

…


&gt;Meanwhile, Sanders officials say they ""probably"" won't spend more on television advertising in the notoriously expensive state, which some California political experts say is virtually a declaration of surrender.

&gt;In another sign of trouble, a senior aide says the campaign is likely to stop producing new TV spots all together. That, after the campaign has cut more than 264 different TV ads.

&gt;**In Kentucky, which votes Tuesday, Sanders' campaign is reusing two old ads and letting himself be outspent by Clinton's campaign $178,000 to $93,000**, according to ad tracking data from NBC News partner SMG Delta.

&gt;Sanders' online fundraising machine has in the past allowed him to outspend Clinton in almost every contest he wanted to. But there are increasingly signs that that once seemingly bottomless well of donations is drying up.

&gt;Sanders raised only $26 million in April, way down from the $46 million he brought in in March and the $42 million he collected in February.

&gt;Meanwhile, Sanders was spending an average of about $40 million per month during the first quarter of the year (April data is not yet available), forcing a downsize to meet lower revenue. Last month, the campaign laid off hundreds of staffers and overall headcount has been dramatically reduced from its peak.

&gt;The cash crunch comes at a bad time. With some of the nation's largest media markets and its biggest population, California is the most expensive state in the country in which to buy TV advertising - but it's also perhaps the most important.

&gt;**""If you're behind in the polls and you're not advertising on TV, it's tough to win** no matter what you're running for,"" said Doug Herman, a Los Angeles-based Democratic strategist.

&gt;But **Sanders and his aides say major broadcast spending is unlikely**, though they have already dropped $555,000 on cable in the California and Oregon.

&gt;""We'll see,"" said Tad Devine, Sanders' top strategist and ad-maker. ""For many weeks we have talked about barnstorming California as our communications strategy, and I think that's probably what we're going to do. But we will always reserve the option to do other things as well.""

&gt;Sanders told the Sacramento Bee Monday that he wasn't sure TV would be worth it, adding the campaign was ""in reasonably good financial shape.""

&gt;**Even a conservative statewide advertising campaign would cost more than $5 million, operatives say.**

&gt;**In 2008, Obama spent $6.2 million in California, while Clinton dropped $5.6 million**, according to the data compiled by the University of Wisconsin Advertising Project.

José Efraín Ríos Montt (Spanish pronunciation: [efɾaˈin ˈri.os ˈmont]; born June 16, 1926) is a Guatemalan politician who was President of Guatemala from 1982 to 1983. An army general, his time in office was marked by the Guatemalan Civil War. Years later, he served as president of Congress. In 2016 he was sentenced to 80 years in prison for genocide and crimes against humanity, for actions and policies he carried out against the Ixil Maya people during the Civil War.[1]

Dear all,
My son showed me Reddit yesterday and I found this page and wanted to express to you all a perspective that I think we do not hear any time on the news. I apologize in advance if my language is not so good, but I have my son helping me.

I was born in Guatemala. I was my parent's only daughter. We did not have so much as running water. Life was very simple. My father wanted a better life, but we knew we did not have the money to come to America. Instead, we first made our way to the capital of my country to find work. My father was a farmer and it was impossible for him to make any extra money - we had only enough to survive.
My father got a job in a factory. He was not as happy as before. Work was hard. He sometimes came home and beat my mother, but I respect him because he was working hard for our family. Sometimes a man has to be a man, and I tell my son this. He has to take what is his because it is not given in our world.

In 1982 the strong leader Efraín Ríos Montt took over our country and put us on correct path. My father got a promotion and we were making money, finalmente. We were even told by the great U.S.A that our leader was a great man - President Reagan said it! It was put on posters all over town! I finally got to buy nice clothes. It was a dream. We didn't even have to leave our native land in order to feel this good life.

A few years later our president was overthrown by cowards. My father disappeared. We never saw him again. We fled north, to Mexico. We lived like refugees. It was a terrible change in life. I sometimes wished I had never experienced those few good years because it made it so hard to go back to poverty. My father had worked so hard and for what? My mother was not a strong woman, and so I had to do my best. I found someone who knew about the United States and we applied to go there. Somehow we got in. We got into what we always was told is the greatest place in the world.
I helped take my mother there, to Los Angeles. It was not easy at first, but it was better. We could find work here. Taxes were even less than Guatemala! We had a community here of people like us. I gave birth to a son who works hard and goes to school, someday he will be a doctor, I hope! (my mom still says that... I'm studying business lol)

What I see in America today is too much weakness and it is what reminds me of the bad times in my home country. Mr. Trump reminds me of my father and the leader under which my father was able to make something of himself. Today I see people who want to punish those hardworkers like my father, rather than work hard themselves. I think too many people in this country forgot what hard work is like. They forgot life is not always easy. All we can ask is to be given the opportunity to work hard. When my father was given that opportunity he made the best of it. When I got to this country I was given that opportunity and I did the same.

I am not rich and my life is still hard. We live in only a one floor house. But we have people around who love us. My son has opportunities here. I do not fear for my life or his. It is because this country is strong that we have this. If Hillary win the election, I do not think my life would change so much now, but I worry for my son. I worry the country will begin down a path that will make the people of this country weaker. They will forget how much hard work it takes to guarantee the good life in this country.

I am an American citizen now and this will be my first election. I ask my son for help in researching and he has shown me to Mr. Trump. I understand he is sometimes sounding like a mean person, but for me this is not a big problem. I respect that he says what he is thinking, even if I may not always agree. He is a man, and this country needs a strong leader like that, one who will not let us forget the meaning of hard work. I do not want to be led by cowards. The first time that happened to me, I lost my father.

I know the news would not show my story so I wanted to tell it to you all. Thank you for this country. I love it and I will vote for Mr. Trump this year! Thank you!

lipstickpizza,2016-04-30 12:05:32+00:00,Production timeline of a film: Batman Begins,"Hello all, like many of us who have love for film this is hopefully for people who are also fans of how a film is produced from the ground up. Taking advantage of an off day and lack of social life, I invite you to join me on this timeline of this week's recap of how **Batman Begins (2005)** was made.

I'd like to thank Jett from batman-on-film.com for his comprehensive updates that aided me tremendously in researching all this.

*Note*: *I decided to skip the drama of everything that happened after Batman &amp; Robin to this film as you can arguably write a novel of the development hell this character endured during that time. I will also try to make this as chronologically reported as possible.*

**2003**

**Jan**: In the first significant story since the cancelled project of Wolfgang Peterson's 'Batman vs Superman' (BvS), [Variety breaks the news](http://variety.com/2003/film/markets-festivals/batman-captures-director-nolan-1117879566/) Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia) had been hired by Warner Bros. to bring the Dark Knight back to the big screen.

*""All I can say is that I grew up with Batman, I've been fascinated by him and I'm excited to contribute to the lore surrounding the character,"" Nolan said. ""He is the most credible and realistic of the superheroes, and has the most complex human psychology. His superhero qualities come from within. He's not a magical character. I had a fantastic experience with the studio on 'Insomnia,' and I'm keen to repeat that experience.""*

The news came as a bit of a surprise due to publications reporting Nolan had recently turned in a script for a film about Howard Hughes to Castle Rock, with Jim Carrey in mind to star. Though he could have decided to go in another direction after seeing the Martin Scorsese biopic 'The Aviator' had gone into production. Nonetheless, after years of anguish for Bat fans, there was finally hope for a new Batman film to grace the big screen soon.

**Feb**: Confusion surrounds the Christopher Nolan project almost immediately as industry sources claim the Darren Aronofsky/Frank Miller 'Year One' film is still in development despite Nolan adapting a new Batman film for the 2000s.

ZEntertainment reports *""The Nolan Batman will be a totally original project. No Year One, No Frightening, No Beyond, No Triumphant. Where the storyline will go is left up to the new screenwriters, whose names are top secret at this point.""*

Meanwhile, Nolan is in the middle of searching for a screenwriter who will bring his Batman to life. Nolan meets with a host of writers including Andrew Kevin Walker (BvS) but no news on who gets the job. There is speculation Nolan handles the script-writing duties himself.

**Mar-Apr**: Variety reports Halle Berry has signed on for Warner Bros. 'Catwoman' and will play the titular character. This film will be standalone and will **not** be involved with the Christopher Nolan planned film in any way.

Variety and ComicsContinuum report David Goyer, who will also direct the third installment in the Blade franchise, has been tapped to write the story for the Nolan film.

Alan Horn, president and COO of Warner Bros. announces a rough detail of what to expect for the Batman film and in a surprising turn of events, a Batman Vs Superman film that is reportedly still in development.

On Nolan's film - *""First Batman origin story has Bruce witnessing the murder of parents, enraged and guilty he turns to crime before he becomes a crime-fighter. Builds the Batcave and mobile, hires Alfred, studies martial arts, etc.""*

On BvS - *""'We will do it.' He says it's 'dark and mean-spirited' but really, really good. The plan is to have Superman and Batman origin stories released within the same year (starting in 2005). Each movie (I think he said there would be three of each?) will deal with the Superheroes' origins and began to establish their relationship to each other which will set up 'Superman vs. Batman' to follow the backstories.

Superman and Batman find themselves at odds in 'Superman v. Batman' when Bruce goes out seeking bloody vengeance on the murderer of his new bride, Jennifer. Superman opposes him, fights him to the near death - then it's discovered that the guy behind Jennifer's murder is also this big baddie in Superman's circle and they unite to fight or something sweet like that.""*

[SuperHeroHype](http://www.superherohype.com/cgi-bin/news/batman.cgi?newsid1049952636,45233,) reports Christopher Nolan's first meeting with an actor regarding Batman was with David Boreanaz (Buffy, Angel).

Warner Bros. targets a release date for summer of 2005.

Christopher Nolan is also reported to be doing double duty on an adaptation of Christopher Priest's book 'The Prestige' starring Jude Law, with his brother Jonathan. Warner Bros. and Disney are in process of [negotiating distribution rights.](http://www.superherohype.com/cgi-bin/news/batman.cgi?newsid1049952636,45233,)

Darren Aronofsky announces his next film will ""not include Batman"", thus [ending the long speculation of his 'Year One' project.](http://www.aintitcool.com/node/15088)

*May-Aug** 

Message boards around the internet erupt at the news of Ashton Kutcher (That 70s show, Dude Where's My Car?) is in talks to play the Dark Knight. Also reported is the film will feature the youngest Batman on film, furthering fears of Kutcher nabbing the role.

[AiCN reports](http://www.aintitcool.com/node/15259) Heath Ledger (A Knight's Tale) met with Nolan in Los Angeles for Batman.

Nolan, inspired by the Christopher Reeve casting for the Richard Donner film, wants a relatively ""unknown"" actor for Bruce Wayne.

The Ashton Kutcher reports pick up steam as E!online and Dark Horizons all but confirm Kutcher to be the new Batman.

*""When now out director Brett Ratner got close to casting SUPERMAN this year, he tested and retested Kutcher, who apparently did well. The 'known mostly as a comic actor and that's even a stretch' Kutcher seemed to want Bats over Supes (who wouldn't?) and is now close to being announced as the lead in the flick to be directed by Christopher Nolan.""*

*""Essentially, the studio has had another 'Ratner' situation on their hands, because the director wants someone, and the studio wants someone else. That someone the studio wants is Ashton Kutcher. Thankfully, it's not as big a deal as the whole Superman thing [which has been madness], because in this place everyone gets along - and from what I hear Kutcher is the new Batman. Done deal.""*

Warner Bros. is reported as ""sold and high up"" on Ashton Kutcher as Batman but the reason the deal isn't done is Christopher Nolan insisting on an unknown actor to play the role. Warner Bros. extends the deadline for casting to the end of Summer 2003.

Fan's fears are calmed as Kutcher signs a 2 year extension on That 70s Show, effectively ruling him out scheduling wise for a Batman film.

A fan film [""Batman: Dead End""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOB13T6Zmh8) written and directed by indie Director Sandy Collora makes the rounds at Comic-Con and hailed by some as ""the greatest depiction of Batman on film"".

[MoviePoopShoot](http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/interviews/index.html) releases interview with Guy Pierce (Memento) with the actor denying involvement in the Nolan film.

*JH: You starred in Christopher Nolan’s acclaimed film, MEMENTO. Now word is he may direct a BATMAN film. Have you two talked about you possibly trying on that character. Would that hold any interest for you?

Guy Pearce: I don’t think so. (laughs)

JH: Not in your nature to do a superhero movie?

Guy Pearce: Not at this stage in my life. If I was ever going to do it, Chris Nolan would be the person I would do it with. But no we haven’t had any of those discussions.*

**Sep**: With the deadline approaching, the casting search reaches peak levels as screen tests are scheduled for various actors at the Warner Bros. Burbank lot.

The HollywoodReporter and Entertainment Weekly report the list of names for the next Bruce Wayne/Batman has been narrowed to the following names: Billy Crudup (Almost Famous), Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko), Hugh Dancy (Black Hawk Down), Joshua Jackson (Dawson's Creek), Christian Bale (American Psycho), Cillian Murphy (28 Days Later), Eion Bailey (Almost Famous), Henry Cavill (The Counte of Monte Cristo).

Warner Bros. finally has their Dark Knight:  **BURBANK, CA, 11 September 2003**–- Christian Bale has been cast in the starring role of Bruce Wayne in Warner Bros. Pictures' upcoming Batman movie, to be directed by Christopher Nolan and produced by Emma Thomas. The announcement was made today by Jeff Robinov, President of production for Warner Bros. Pictures.

Principal photography on the film is expected to begin in early 2004. The movie is written by David Goyer and Nolan, and will follow the early career of The Dark Knight.

Said Nolan, *""What I see in Christian is the ultimate embodiment of Bruce Wayne. He has exactly the balance of darkness and light that we were looking for.""*

Robinov stated, *""Now that we've found the best person to play Batman, we are really looking forward to moving ahead with the rest of our casting, and are excited about the exceptional group we are assembling.""*

**Oct-Dec**: Morgan Freeman meets with Christopher Nolan for a ""Doctor/Scientist"" role and Anthony Hopkins is [considered for the role of Alfred.](http://www.aintitcool.com/node/16403)

Pinewood/Shepperton Studios gives notice it will lend the lot to a film called ""The Intimidation Game"" for filming in 2004. Many speculate this is what the Batman film will be titled.

Latino Review reports Welsh designer Lindy Hemming (Topsy Turvy, GoldenEye) will handle the costume directing duties.

**November 25, 2003** - Per Variety, Sir Michael Caine has agreed to play the role of Alfred Pennyworth in Batman:The Intimidation Game. Caine also spilled the beans on the [development process of the film](http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/12/10/aragorn-vs-batman): *""Batman is being made in England, but it's also being made quite differently,"" Caine advised CHUD's Smilin' Jack Ruby. ""I had a long conversation with Christopher Nolan before I accepted the part. I only knew him from Memento and I didn't know him personally. ... The short answer was, he wants it to be more natural. I find a lot of these comic book heroes boring because they are invincible. If you're bulletproof, where's the jeopardy for the hero? You can't gas him, you can't kill him, what's the point? And he is making a very, very natural Batman. I remember one phrase he said to me, I said, 'Well, he's very powerful and strong.' And he said, 'Yes, he is Michael, but not because of Kryptonite, it's because he does pushups.""*

Cillian Murphy joins the film as The Scarecrow/Jonathan Crane. Murphy had tested for Bruce Wayne and though he didn't get the role, Nolan had favored his test so much so that he decided he was perfect as the creepy villain.

**2004**

**Jan-Mar**: Production schedule announced with locations in Iceland, London and Chicago.

Morgan Freeman, Katie Holmes, Liam Neeson and Ken Watanabe join the cast as Lucius Fox, Rachel Dawes, Henri Ducard, and Ra's Al Ghul respectively (press release): *Oscar-nominated actor Ken Watanabe has joined the cast of director Christopher Nolan's highly anticipated film about the origins of the Batman legend. The announcement was made today by Jeff Robinov, President of Production, Warner Bros. Pictures.

The project is scheduled to start production in London in March.*

The role of Jim Gordon is up in the air as Chris Cooper had turned down the role offered to him by Nolan.

**February 26, 2004**: Cinescape reports the real title of the film is '**Batman Begins**' which Variety later confirms.

**March 3, 2004**: A complete surprise out of left field reported by IGN first. Gary Oldman has been cast as Lieutenant James ""Jim"" Gordon. Via press release by Warner Bros. - *""Batman Begins,"" director Christopher Nolan's highly anticipated film, has commenced production in Iceland, with Gary Oldman joining the all-star cast. The announcement was made today by Jeff Robinov, President of Production, Warner Bros. Pictures.

**Apr-Dec**

Warner Bros. formally announces the release date for Batman Begins as June 15th 2005. There are questions regarding why the studio decided to release it on a Wednesday instead of the normal Friday for blockbusters.

The first image of [Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne](http://christian-bale.org/gallery/albums/Movies/Batman%20Begins%20%5B2005%5D/Filming%20-%20April%203%202004/09.jpg) on set emerges.

[Entertainment Weekly](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513l0nJTOAL._SX379_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg) nabs the first mainstream interview with the new Batman himself. Here's an excerpt: *MUSTWORTHINESS
Because -- all together now! -- he's Batman. That, and a hell of an actor. The Wales native went from losing 63 pounds to play a haunted insomniac factory worker (in Brad Anderson's forthcoming psychological thriller, ''The Machinist,'' due Sept. 24) to bulking up and strapping on a utility belt to be the Caped Crusader. (His secret: bread. ''That was what I craved most of all.'')*

*WHAT HE'S DOING NOW
Teaming with ''Insomnia'' director Christopher Nolan to do something no one has done before: rebooting a major film franchise only eight years after it petered out. The movie reintroduces one of the most beloved superheroes in the pop-culture canon, so look for explanations on everything from where the Batmobile came from, to how Bruce Wayne's parents died, to why he has such a close relationship with Lieutenant Gordon (Gary Oldman). ''What attracted me was Chris and the knowledge that what was being aimed for was a reinvention of Batman lore,'' says Bale, taking a break halfway through shooting the film in London.*

**July 27, 2004**: Production continues on to Chicago, where the vast majority of Gotham City scenes will be shot for three weeks.

**July 28, 2004**: The [first teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu2ecPMX0kI) for the film is released online.

Variety reports David Goyer has struck a deal with Warner Bros. for a story deal regarding the sequel to Batman Begins. It should be noted Christopher Nolan is not yet signed for any followup(s) to the film.

Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard will handle [dual duties on the theatrical score.](http://www.soundtrack.net/news/article/?id=535) This will be their first collaboration after a failed attempt on 'Secret Window' due to timing constraints.

**September 15, 2004**: After a lengthy shoot beginning in Iceland, principal photography will end within a couple of days with the final scene being shot in London (Bedforshire) and at Cardington Hangar, the site of 'the Narrows'.

*In the same week of the news regarding Christopher Reeves' death, Brandon Routh is chosen to play the last son of Krypton in Bryan Singer's upcoming Superman film.*

Speaking of Routh, his deal is for a three picture deal with an option for a fourth should a Batman/Superman team up film is still in the pipeline at Warner Bros.

With 'Begins' moving on to the post production phase, there is talk already on what direction the sequel could go on. Guy Pierce and Jude Law are heavily rumored to be circled in as D.A Harvey Dent as well as Australian actor Lachy Hulme (The Matrix Revolutions) rumored to be the iconic Joker (if he is in the film at all).

**December 3, 2004**: The first official [poster of Batman Begins is released.](http://posterwire.com/wp-content/uploads/batman_begins_teaser_a.jpg)

The first [full trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYYRjVof6TU) for the film drops online.

Previous Batman George Clooney comments on the new film: *""I'm quite sure it will be a heck of a different movie from mine and fun to watch. I'm happy they're focusing on the Dark Knight. They're doing it the way it should be done.""*

**Jan-Jun**

The cancelled Aronofsky/Miller 'Year One' screenplay leaks online to mixed reactions from the fan community on the street punk version of the Dark Knight and in particular the character of 'Big Al' is singled out as the source of most of the divisiveness.

In an [interview with the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/31/business/media/video-sales-abroad-aregood-news-in-hollywood-shhh.html) producer Charles Roven gives the production budget of $180 million and that Warner Bros. is banking on a big return for home video sales once the stink from Schumacher's 'Batman &amp; Robin' is off this film.

Warner Bros. is reportedly thrilled with the test screening of the film held for execs with Christopher Nolan on hand.

Batman Begins will be released in select Imax theaters around the United States.

A bit of cross promotion occurs as a [10 minute preview](http://facedl.com/fvideo=axxwnkiwewawn) of Batman Begins premieres during the broadcast of the WB show 'Smallville'. [The second and last trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neY2xVmOfUM) for Begins also premieres.

David Goyer confirms the two characters to join the sequel will be Harvey Dent and the Joker. No further word if Dent will be Two-Face in the film. Liev Schreiber and Crispin Glover's names are added to the rumor mill.

As 'Begins' makes its worldwide press release tour, the first wave of critical reviews are hugely positive with praise for its unique take on the superhero genre, the direction and for Bale in the role of Batman. The bad taste left on critics by B&amp;R is officially washed by this film. In addition to critics, Adam West [gives his approval for Begins.](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2005-06-21-batman-flashback_x.htm)

**June 15, 2005**: Batman Begins is released and has a first day Wednesday total of $15 million at the box office. For weekend totals, Begins pulls in $71 million in the states and an international opening at $42 million.

CNN reports Warner Bros. is none too pleased with Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise' antics at the domestic premieres/junkets for the movie and will likely move forward in a sequel without her.

Christopher Nolan comments on the inevitable sequel: *""If David's writing it, Christian's still Batman, and everyone else is returning....me not returning would be like the only student of a graduating class skipping the big day to wash the car"" said the British helmer.

He dropped some other hints such as ""Like Begins, one clear cut villain isn't the plan [though]"" and the likelihood of Robin appearing ""The studio wasn't interested in Robin. We weren't either. This is a young Batman, so Robin's a few films....not for a few pictures anyway. Dick Grayson's still in a crib somewhere. I seriously doubt I will even be involved when Robin's in the franchise"" says Nolan.*

Christopher Nolan's next film announced as ""The Prestige"" effectively killing rumors of a direct sequel move to 'Begins'. Bale and Caine will follow Nolan into production which also kills rumors of a Batman sequel moving on without Nolan. Although the director has yet to sign a deal, his brother Jonathan Nolan (Memento) signs on to work on the project with David Goyer.

Batman Begins ends its theatrical run with a worldwide gross of $374 million, making it the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind 89's Batman. Warner Bros. touts the success of the film and looks forward to the sequel.

In less than a year after release, 'Begins' collects an impressive [total of $167 million in DVD sales.](http://variety.com/2006/film/news/wb-mulls-superman-redux-1200342128/)

Christian Bale wins ['best hero' at the 2006 mtv movie awards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5kHTJcjZpw). When the cast of Superman Returns presented the Best Hero Award to Batman Begins star Christian Bale, he turned to Routh and said, ""Sorry Superman, but Batman's the badass."" Bale also promised fans there will be more Batman films and called his wife, Sibi Blazic, ""my personal Wonder Woman.""

** July 20, 2006**: Absolute pandemonium on the internet as Heath Ledger is announced to play the Joker. Exactly two years from today the world will know if Christopher Nolan's risky move was the right one or a complete bust...


Whew. That was quite the morning keyboard workout. Hope those who took the time to read this enjoyed that overview. If this picks up some stream I'll try to make this a weekly thing. I was planning to do one on *Park Chan Wook's* **Oldboy (2003)** but the sheer amount of translating and reading Korean articles will probably delay it quite a bit. I'm also open to suggestions.

MrFavs,2016-04-23 00:31:44+00:00,This is Jon Favreau. There are many ways to see The Jungle Book. Here's some info to help you decide what's best for you.,"Hi, this is Jon Favreau.    
Thanks to all of you who came out to see the Jungle Book.  Its warm reception around the world is extremely appreciated. Thank you.

&amp;nbsp;

I’m posting because a lot of people are asking which of the seemingly endless list of formats I recommend to see the movie in. Let me start by saying that the answer’s different for everybody so I’ll try to cover as thoroughly as possible what the best thing is for each taste.

&amp;nbsp;

There is a very exciting new technology out there right now, and Jungle Book is the first film that has been released in the format. It’s called **Dolby Vision 3D**.  Unfortunately, there are only a handful of theaters that have it.  It’s a laser projection system with extended dynamic range. The black levels on the screen are extremely deep, the contrast levels are much higher and the brightness of the screen make for a 3D experience where the glasses disappear.  I think this technology is a game-changer and I applaud Dolby for this breakthrough and look forward to it being more widely available.

&amp;nbsp;

Here are the places where it’s currently available:    
**Los Angeles:** El Capitan Theatre    
**New York:** AMC Empire 25    
**Chicago Area:** AMC Hawthorn 12    

&amp;nbsp;

Internationally- Four locations:    
**Two in The Netherlands** (JT Eindhoven &amp; JT Hilversum)    
Cinesa La Maquinista in **Barcelona**    
The Cinelpexx in **Linz, Austria**    

&amp;nbsp;

You can find out more about it here: http://www.dolby.com/us/en/brands/dolby-cinema/the-jungle-book.html

&amp;nbsp;

If you’re a fan of the big-screen format, **IMAX** has a laser projection system that’s extremely robust and many people that I talk to consider this their top choice.  If you want a more intense experience with a clean bright image and the cutting edge IMAX sound system, then this is a great way to go.  Although the black levels are not as true as the Dolby Vision, the laser projection counteracts the dimming effect of the 3D glasses and I think it is a fantastic premium way to see it that I highly recommend.  If you haven’t checked out **IMAX with laser**, you should definitely give it a shot.    
Unfortunately, there are relatively few locations of these projection systems around the world. IMAX has made it easy to find them through this site: http://www.imax.com/news/experience-jungle-book-imax-laser

&amp;nbsp;

Another format that I am very impressed with is **Cinemark Ultra 3D**. It boasts an extremely bright image that counteracts any dimming associated with traditional 3D. My experience is that the screen size is impressive and the quality is very high. Again, another great choice but not yet widely available. Here’s a link to their current locations: http://www.cinemark.com/cinemark-ultra-3d

&amp;nbsp;

**RealD** is the most common 3D format and they have an exciting new technology to offer as well. The **Ultimate Screen** is available in a few theaters and is designed to deliver a brighter and more uniform image. This means that the dimming effect from the glasses should not be a factor. There is also no hot spot often associated with silver screens used in 3D and the image should be more uniform regardless of seat location.  You can read more about the Ultimate Screen here: https://www.reald.com/#/ultimatescreen    
Here are the current theaters where you can see Ultimate Screen:    
**Burbank, CA** – AMC Burbank 16 – Auditorium 7    
**Boulder, CO** – Century Boulder – 29th St Auditorium 8 &amp; 11    
**Beijing, China** – Wanda Plaza – Auditorium 5

&amp;nbsp;

From here on it’s a matter of personal preference.  **Standard IMAX 3D** has the advantage of a larger screen and many locations.  The key here is to pick your seats wisely.  The closer you are to the projector, the better your experience is going to be.  I would be careful in any 3D environment not to be in the front of the theatre if you’re not towards the center because it can compromise the viewing experience.    
It should also be noted that this particular film was shot digitally and there’s no grain that has to be dealt with in the blow-up and so the large screen projections are exceptionally clean.

&amp;nbsp;

As far as Dolby goes, Atmos sound has an added benefit as we did a **Fantasound** mix.  For more information on the history of Fantasound: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasound    
In short, Walt Disney had developed a new sound system for Fantasia where speakers had to be set up in theaters and it was an immersive experience where the music surrounded you.  It became untenable because of the technical challenges to install the sound system in theaters and was soon abandoned. Here we tasked ourselves with updating it using today’s technology to explore what Walt had set out to do.  Because of the way the Dolby Atmos theaters are speakered, what Disney at the time had to spend a lot of effort and time to do now already exists in theaters and we took advantage of that by mixing the orchestra properly and doing a proper Fantasound mix.  So if you see the film in **Dolby Atmos sound**, you are also hearing a Fantasound mix. 

&amp;nbsp;

If you prefer 2D then your standard DCP is pretty solid in most theaters, but Extended Dynamic Range definitely ups the image quality quite significantly and is well worth seeking out.  Dolby Vision is available in 2D in more locations than its 3D counterpart.    
Here’s a page that can guide you to theaters: http://www.dolby.com/us/en/brands/dolby-cinema/the-jungle-book.html

&amp;nbsp;

If you’re seeing the film in 2D, I’d say the seat location is not as vital as in 3D.

&amp;nbsp;

I hope this clarifies things more than it confuses. I encourage you to read the comments below and to discuss because others might have a different take on each of these formats and specific locations that might give you a better indication of what viewing experience might be best for you.

&amp;nbsp;

It’s a very exciting time to be a filmmaker as well as an audience member. There are a lot of smart people putting a lot of effort into making the theater-going experience exceptional. I look forward to these new formats being more widely available and encourage those of you who can to seek them out and see for yourself.",movies,4469
barvader,2016-04-21 17:49:33+00:00,What were the hardest and easiest championship runs? A statistical analysis.,"There are a lot of things that contribute to the difficulty of a team's playoff run: seeding, conference and luck. I looked through every championship run since 1984 (first year with 16 teams in the playoffs) to rank their difficulty.

SRS measures a team's margin of victory throughout the season, adjusted for strength of schedule. I added together the SRS of the four playoff opponents the champion faced. Let's take a look:

*Why are playoff runs from the 80's so easy?* When the league first expanded to 16 teams in the playoffs, the league only had 23 teams, meaning that playoff runs would often contain series against losing teams.

*Where did you get all the data?* basketball-reference

*How does this compare to this season?* If Golden State wins the championship this year through the expected path (HOU, LAC, SAS, CLE) they will face a combined SRS of 20.2, fifth hardest all time. If San Antonio does it (MEM, OKC, GSW, CLE) they will face 20.78 total SRS, fourth hardest all time.

*So is the west harder?* In addition I wanted to test the hypothesis that Western Conference runs have been significantly harder than Eastern Conference runs over the past few years. I added up the opponent SRS in the first *three* rounds of both finalists for the past five years:

*SRS of conference run*

2015: GSW (8.57) vs CLE (6.89)

2014: SAS (14.01) vs MIA (1.17)

2013: SAS (7.11) vs MIA (1.49)

2012: OKC(11.02) vs MIA (7.24)

2011: DAL(11.66) vs MIA (12.33)

Other than 2011, the team coming out of the west has had a harder run to the finals, sometimes ridiculously harder. 

*So?* While no playoff system can be perfect, I think the one the nba uses is broken, as can be seen if you look at this year's bracket. There are largely thought to be 4 true contenders this year GSW, SAS, OKC and CLE. These are the top four teams by SRS (10.38, 10.28, 7.28 and 5.45 respectively.)  With our current playoff system, San Antonio fought their way to a better record than Cleveland, yet in order to win a championship they will have to likely beat the three other contenders, while Cleveland will only have to beat one.

A playoff system should give teams with a better record an easier path to the championship. Otherwise the regular season is meaningless. I think this broken playoff structure is contributing to a poor competitive environment for the rest of the year, with teams preferring to rest starters than win games. I think it is because we have a playoff structure that does not provide a reliable enough reward for winning.

And while it's likely that over long time-frames conference strength will even out, within a single season it does not even out, it provides teams from the weaker conference a better chance to win the title independent of what they do in the season, and that is unfair and anti-competitive.

I would propose a draft: First seed gets to choose from among seeds 9-16. Then second seed among those left, etc. This would give a complete reward for winning, independent of conference. And I believe it would solve the travel issue, as teams would be unlikely to draft opponents that would cause them undue travel strain.

tldr; The chart above shows what were the hardest championship runs based on playoff opponent strength. Then I went on to test the idea that winning from the west is harder (it is) and made a point that our current play-off system is broken because of conferences.

*EDIT:* To clear up confusion. The big chart at the top considers all four playoff opponents. The second chart where we are comparing conferences, only considers the first three opponents.",nba,1314

A quick description of what you should expect to see below...

&amp;nbsp;

First, you should see the horizontal bar graph displaying the distribution of respondents by fandom.

Then, you will find four sets of tables and graphs for each series below:

1. A table and pie chart displaying the predicted outcome of the series among all respondents (this does not take into account series score)
2. A table and bar chart displaying the predicted outcome by series score among all respondents
3. A table and bar chart displaying the predicted outcome by series among fans of the higher seeded team
4. A table and bar chart displaying the predicted outcome by series score among fans of the lower seeded team

I have also included the head-to-head season matchup for each series at the beginning of each set of tables/charts.

Last, there will be some initial observations of the data. I welcome deeper analysis and discussion in the comments!

I apologize to mobile users in advance. I'll see what I can do in the future to make it more mobile friendly if possible. 

&amp;nbsp;

Enjoy!

DillWithIt,2016-04-09 16:53:26+00:00,California voters: Do NOT register as American Independent. Possible disinfo campaign. AIP is the opposite of Bernie. Other registration concerns....,"I guess it bears repeating.... 

On social media recently, I've seen many comments and posts saying, ""I registered American Independent in Ca so I can vote for Bernie! Team Bernie, woo hoo!"" Sometimes you see someone just say they switched their registration to Independent. Either this is disinformation being spread by the other side or people are legitimately making serious registration mistakes. The legit mistakes have occurred in this state for a long time.

The American Independent Party in California is a far-right white supremacist group of nutbags. Past positions include being on the wrong side of the segregationist argument, for example. Pretty sure if you can read this, you don't want any part of them. If you do not wish to state a party preference, you need to explicitly say, I don't wish to choose a party affiliation. In CA, this is called No Party Preference.

Also, if you are a Los Angeles voter, please call the registrar and ask for a more useful registration results page like other CA counties have. I think fraud is going to go down in L.A. if the registrar does not give voters a means of printing the web site results as proof of their registration at any given time. Today's results have no information to identify the voter. This is unique to Los Angeles as far as I've seen. No one will have any proof of their registration if late breaking unauthorized changes happen. I had a very weird response when I tried to gain awareness for this issue and get them to make a change, including talking to people in the office who refused to give me their name or department. The assistant to the registrar is a former cop. Pretty sure he is the one who gave me his name as ""Prince"" without a last name. He was questioning me like a perp, not treating me like a constituent with a concern. He kept trying to find inconsistencies in my complaint or concerns and I got three unique excuses for all the ways the website functioned -- all massively defensive and inconsistent with what I see on other county pages. I've seen results pages from four other counties that are NOT like this, including neighboring Orange County. Los Angeles County is the biggest block of voters in the state.

harmonygrits,2016-04-05 18:06:40+00:00,"Godspeed, Funhaus","Well, friends, it’s been fun.

This Friday will be my last day at Funhaus. Before I get into the why, and the what, and the WHAT!? of it all, I want you all to know that I’m making this move of my own volition - I’ve not been asked or forced to leave, and I don’t have any bad feelings about Funhaus or Rooster Teeth. I’ve had an amazing experience in my brief time as part of the Rooster Teeth family, and I’m definitely going to miss working with all of the incredible talent, both in Los Angeles and in Austin.

So, what’s going on? Since I started working with Adam, Bruce, James, Lawrence, and Peake at Inside Gaming, I’ve been constantly asked “But what’s YOUR job?” I don’t edit. I’m not usual on-screen talent. I only regularly play a few video games. 

As the Director of Programming, my job is to schedule all of our shows across all of our platforms, fill holes in that schedule via creative development, and discover how and why videos perform the way they do. However, what I love doing is working with shows, channels, and personalities who aren’t reaching their full potential and building (or rebuilding) amazing content with them. Over the last few months, I’ve come to the realization that Funhaus doesn’t really need that any more. Together we’ve built a brand with the very best shows and a continually growing audience that loves what we do. After over 3 years of working together, everyone on this team knows how to make a great online entertainment channel. I’m ready to move onto another challenge, where I can flex some of the work muscles that haven’t been used in a long time. 

I want to thank everyone at Rooster Teeth and Fullscreen. I’ve learned so much in the last year, and it’s been a true pleasure working with companies that actually love what they’re doing, that value the content they produce, and that have a real vision for where they want to go. I’ve also met the brightest, funniest, most creative people I’ve worked with so far in online entertainment, and I know they’re going to be incredibly successful. 

I also want to say that it’s been a joy and an honor to work with everyone at Funhaus. It’s a really rare and wonderful thing to be able to work with people with whom you share simpatico; people who have a collectively agreed creative direction and aesthetic. Most of all, I’ve been lucky to work for so long with friends I both respect and admire. Gentlemen (and lady): it has been a privilege playing with you.

Finally I want to thank you guys and gals and non-identifiers who are reading this. Without an audience, we wouldn’t have a job. Without fans, we wouldn’t have feedback. Without a community, we wouldn’t have support. Every time we get to leave our dungeon and go to RTX or PAX, it’s been overwhelming to meet you all and hear your stories. Please believe me when I say we just couldn’t do what we do without you. Also: goddamn your fanart is so good. Goddamn. Fanart, goddamn.

Ok, let me ask and answer some questions you folks may have:

**What are you doing next?**
I’m staying in Los Angeles, and I have my next opportunity lined up. Although I’m not prepared to say where I’m going yet, I can tell you it will be online and I’ll definitely let you know via Twitter when I’m ready.

**Is Friday the last day we can see you?**
Nope. Since we record in advance, there will be a few videos dribblin’ out over the next few weeks. Plus, some stuff we recorded WAY in advance will drop in the future, and I’ll be in that.

**Wow, this is pretty self-indulgent.**
That’s not a question. And you, sir or madame, are an asshole.

**Who are you again?**
My name is James Willems, nice to meet you.

**Where can I find you?**

dielaughing89,2016-04-04 02:39:17+00:00,"[Update] My son (4M) wants his birthday party theme to be ""Shimmer and Shine"" (girl theme). Hubby and I are Okay with it, but everyone else is telling us we shouldn't.(26F) (34M)","Link to original:    https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4a0ti5/my_son_4m_wants_his_birthday_party_theme_to_be/


My son's birthday party happened yesterday, and overall, it was good. 



A few days after the OP, my SO, daughter, mom, and I took my son to Party City to buy the decorations for his party. My mom is not comfortable with my son liking ""girly"" things, but I thought if I took her and saw the smile and excitement on his face that she would come over to the dark side. So, we get to Party City and I pretty much let the kids roam around, this is their domain and they will reign here. Unfortunately, there were no Shimmer and Shine decorations to choose from. So I asked my son if there was anything else he would consider since Shimmer and Shine didn't appear to be an option. He looked down the boys isle, and the girl's isle and he picked Peppa Pig. I was like ""Cool, decision made, let's get the stuff an go."" (I hate shopping. Like, for anything)


My mom was trying to convince my son to go with Jake and the Neverland Pirates, but my son was like ""Nah, I don't like Jake, I want Peppa Pig."" And I kind of just told my mom, ""that's it, he made his choice"" and she gave up and pursed her lips and walked away a few steps to let us finish buying the decorations. 


Anyway, come party time, literally NOBODY gave a damn lol. My parents were too busy cooking some carne asada, arroz, with frijoles, two kinds of really good, hot red salsa, and guacamole (they bought 30 lbs of meat for a party of about 50 people---WAYYY to much! But more for me I guess lol). My family was hovered around the food, and the kids were running around riding their bikes, trying to fly, taking turns with those prank jelly beans that could either taste like something normal, or some nasty alternative. I spent the day catching up with old friends and tending to the guests where I could. The party was small, because I hate huge parties, they are exhausting, but Nick (my son), seemed to have the perfect amount of kids running around with him.


The only thing that bugs me is that my brother was making comments to my son about ""asking mommy for some tampons."" I swear to God I wanted to smack the shit out of him. He thinks it's funny but it's not. I just told him to shut up and had my son run off with his buddies. I don't get it, I just don't get those comments (especially if they are addressed to little kids).  I think it's because he embraces more of that ""soy del rancho (i'm from the ranch)"" mentality than I do. He listens to narcocorridos (like Mexican country music is the best way I can explain it, feel free to correct me), and does all the stuff your typical chunti from Los Angeles does (again, someone translate what that means because IDK what they are in English lol). Anyway, I'm still in good terms with my brother, I understand he's flawed, but I'm sure I am too, and I still love that asshole no matter what. I'm working with my son on how to react when people make comments about his tastes in different things. I figure if I can't change my brother, I can change how Nick is affected by that stuff (and limiting time with his uncle when he's an asshole).


***Clarification: My brother is a good person, but like I said before, flawed, as are the rest of us. I'm sure I have terrible qualities myself that people would crucify me for. He did some college but chose to work instead after a year of college to help my parents out. He bought his first car on his own, helps my parents with bills, and even gave me money so I could move out on my own (saving up for a downpayment is hard, but the monthly payments are fine). He always takes my kids to amusement parks with his, and gives them things I wouldn't be able to because I struggle financially more than he does. It's not all financially based though. He is a happy dude who just wants to enjoy life with his friends, and wants to be surrounded by his family. He would give every ounce of himself for his family. I love him and am thankful for him, but I can still call him out on his shit, like he does to me. He's just more about being a man's man. I am more about being whoever you want to be and not being ashamed of it.  


Also, Peppa Pig isn't girly to me, but I guess compared to like TMNT, and Avengers, it's more tame, and maybe even meant for younger kids (at least for my family). I don't care what he watches as long as he's not running around screaming bad words and picking up bad manners or sexual stuff. ***



TL;DR : Son chose a Peppa Pig theme instead, party was good, nobody cared. My brother is still making asshole comments toward my son",relationships,1841

zachHu1,2016-03-18 01:42:44+00:00,URGENT! Volunteers needed to help GOTR in time for upcoming deadlines.,"A few hours ago, I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/4avh36/important_strategy_discussion_and_instructions/) post about my GOTR (get out the registration) plan for this sub. The plan was well received, so, now let's implement it! I am looking for volunteers to help GOTR on the ground, and/or manager the GOTR efforts in certain states/regions. We need volunteers everywhere, but ASAP in Wyoming, New York, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Indiana, and Maryland. We also need volunteers in Puerto Rico (ideally he/she speaks Spanish), Kentucky, West Virginia, Connecticut, Oregon, New Mexico, the District of Columbia, New Jersey, California, and South Dakota. Here is what those jobs entail...


**REGIONAL MANAGER**


1. Helping the registration drive volunteers get a hold of registration forms.


2. Helping the volunteers organize registration drives.


3. Familiarizing yourself with state and county specific rules on voter registration, and providing guidance to all the volunteers when necessary.


4. Helping me recruit volunteers for each college.


5. Conducting your own registration drives at colleges in which you cannot find a volunteer. (This one is definitely optional, but would be a big help.)


6. Informing me when volunteers join and quit so I can update the database. If you are interested in becoming a regional manager, pm me your phone number, email address, and location. Please note that this will be published on Reddit. Ideally, I’d have at least one manager for each state. Therefore, expect to be bumped between states and even regions at the beginning until I can match people up as best as possible with their location and time commitment. (Someone who is able to commit less time would get committed to Wyoming before Los Angeles, for example.)


**GOTR VOLUNTEER**


1. Collecting the registration forms for the registration drives.

2. Actually organizing and conducting the drives. 

3. Returning the forms to your county elections office. 

4. Providing guidance and encouragement for people registering.

IMPORTANT: If you want to become a volunteer, please, please PM me!!! At least for now. Later, when we get regional managers and an actual public document on this, you can contact the managers instead. (Still, in order to create a central database, managers will have to communicate this information to me.)


In order to organize a sophisticated GOTR campaign, we are going to need a lot of volunteers. Currently I only have two regional managers out of 37 needed minimum! I don't even know how many foot soldiers we need, but it will probably be in the thousands. I'm not going to sugar coat it, being a regional manager will be a big time commitment. Please though, Bernie needs you. PM me your phone, email, location, and your top two states you'd like to manage in if you are interested.


Thanks,

Zach

If we don't do well in Michigan, the question will be, in exactly what kind of big state can we? I am seeing so many Berners in the northeast and on the west coast who are, today, passing out flyers on a bus in San Francisco or baking cookies with Bernie's face on them in Connecticut. Not. Going. To. Matter. If we don't do very well in Michigan. This is crucial. 

I could be preaching to the choir here, but we need to get this message out on social media. Go on Twitter. Post to Bernie groups on Facebook. Make memes about it and invade the Dank Meme Stash. The majority of the troops are clueless and they need to be clued in, fast. This train is gonna hit a major bump if we don't win Michigan on Tuesday and if that happens, all the Bernie murals in Los Angeles won't mean a thing in terms of securing the nomination. 

People need to phone bank. This is intimidating, so impress on them WHY it's so important. Face to face voter contact is the gold standard in getting out the vote, and phone banking helps the campaign know who to make contact with. Also remind them that most people are very nice, particularly now that we're not in the earliest contests anymore where people were getting calls daily for months. Remind them that the Bernie Dialer is automatic so it's basically the easiest thing in the world. And Michiganders need to canvass. Boots on the ground wins elections. We need a massive door to door effort this weekend.

The show will go on if we do well in Michigan. Folks can go back to organizing marches and bake sales and whatever else after that. But not now. Now it's all hands on deck for Michigan. People have to know. Let's make the push. 

And for the love of god, this is more important than Keith Ellison or fun Tweets or anything else. This is how you win elections. You grind it out. Time to grind.

*Michiganders (or really anyone), use the berniefriendfinder.com to find your friends on Facebook who ""like"" Bernie. Post on their wall if you can, or PM them a reminder that the primary is Tuesday and it's super important they get out and vote.

The 2015 MLS Champions were the Portland Timbers. The New York Red Bulls won the Supporter's Shield (best regular season record), and Sporting Kansas City won the US Open Cup. Vancouver Whitecaps won the Voyageurs Cup (Canadian Championship).

------------------------------------------------------------------



**The Future**
-------------------

To update folks on changes from last year, we have seen more clarity in the expansion process. [Atlanta United](http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/07/07/2d/a5/atlutd_icon.jpg) and Minnesota will be joining next year. [Los Angeles FC](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/685155252987809792/OZXvgFYq_400x400.jpg) will be following them in 2018. Miami is a few years behind them, but Beckham's Miami franchise is rumored to be in investment talks with Qatar Sports Investments, owners of PSG. With their help, the floundering franchise may finally start to get off the ground.

Discussion is already underway for the next round of expansion. Sacramento and San Antonio look to be the closest things to locks in this next round. Following them is St. Louis. If they can find ownership, they are virtually guaranteed a slot in MLS. The fourth and possibly finally slot is likely to be a battle between Detroit and Carolina. The former has seen some fantastic grassroots support for a local semi-professional team. The latter has two strong candidates in Raleigh and Charlotte who will be fighting to represent the state at the highest level.

------------------------------------------------------------------

**Current Format:**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MLS consists of 34 games run through the months of March to October. There are currently 20 teams that compete within the league ([listed in the comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/48dame/2016_guide_to_mls/d0ip2gl)).

While there are several unique elements to MLS, I have highlighted only a couple of the unique elements. Oddities like allocation money, the Superdraft, and re-entry draft have a relative minor impact on games and can be learned about later. I'd rather keep things relatively simple for now.

**Salary Cap:** 

The Salary Cap is one of the most unique elements of American soccer. Compared to European sports where teams can spend relatively freely, this cap provides a maximum spending limit for teams (around $3.5 million a year). The main reason this was put in place was to prevent the collapse of another American soccer league. Part of the downfall of the downfall of the North American Soccer League came teams drastically raising their spending on players to the point of financial collapse. With a cap in place, the league was able to ensure teams spend within their limits to ensure financial survival while also keeping down the price of player salaries.

In order to allow teams to grow and attract better talent, MLS passed the ""Beckham Rule"" in which teams can sign up to three designated players who contracts each exceed $457,500 (this threshold increases annually). This allows us to bring in big talent. There is the option for ""young designated players"" who are 23 or under. They have a much lower salary cap hit.

**Parity:**

The other major benefit of the salary cap is that it provides a form of parity not found in any of the other major leagues. Since MLS was founded in 1996, ten separate teams have won the MLS Cup. Only two teams (LA and D.C.) have won more than two titles. Within MLS, your team has a theoretically equal shot of winning the title as any other team within the league.

**Conferences:** 

In MLS, teams are evenly split between the Eastern and Western conference. In any given season, you play each team from the opposite conference once and teams from your own conference either twice or three times. Due to the difficulties of travel, we do not have a balanced schedule. To put this into context, the distance between Vancouver, Canada and Orlando, Florida (the two furthest teams) is 4228.1 Kilometers. The distance from Dublin, Ireland, to Jerusalem is only 4080.8 Kilometers. A balanced schedule is difficult financially for teams and takes a physical toll on the players.

**Playoffs:** 

In MLS, winning the MLS Cup is seen as more prestigious than finishing first on the table (the Supporter's Shield). Under the current format, the top 6 teams from each conference qualify for the playoffs. The playoffs can be thought of as an elimination tournament in which teams are still split between conference. The top two teams from each conference receive a ""bye"" - they are exempt from the first round of play and enter the tournament in the second round. 

The first round is a one game knockout round where the losers go home and the winners advance to face the two teams on ""bye."" 

The second round consists of two-legs much like traditional soccer tournaments. 

The two winners of the second round advance to the conference championship where they square off over two legs. 

The two conference winners then face off in the final for a single elimination match.

**Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup:** 

This tournament is named after Lamar Hunt, an owner who co-founded the North American Soccer League, was a charter investor of MLS, owned American sports teams in several leagues, and who founded and owned three MLS teams when the league began. He, also, financed the Columbus Crew's stadium, the first soccer-specific stadium built for professional soccer in America. Without his backing, MLS would never have taken off. In honor of this pioneer for American soccer, the United States Soccer Federation named the tournament and cup after him in 1999.

While MLS is a young league, many would be surprised how long the U.S. Open Cup has been in existence. This year marks the 102 year of existence for this cup. The tournament has seen several generations of American soccer dominance - from Bethlehem Steel (5 titles) in the 1910's to the Philadelphia Ukranians (4 wins) of the 1960's to the Seattle Sounders (4 wins) of the present. The tournament is open to all American teams -whether amateur, semi-pro, or professional- and the winner is guaranteed a spot in the CONCACAF Champion's League.

Note: Canadian teams do not take part in this. They compete in the the Voyageurs Cup.

**Trades:**

While transfers are the norm in the rest of the world, trades within MLS are far more common. A team may trade a player to another team for a draft pick, another player, a money, an international spot, or other incentives. The player rarely has a choice in a trade.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What's new this year?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In the off-season, MLS announced a new investment in ""general allocation money"" to go along with the ""targeted allocation money"" announced this past July. Over the next two years, MLS teams will be awarded $800,000 annually that can be used to buy down player contracts to fit within the league's salary cap. This money can also be traded for players or other forms of MLS currency.

In essence, this allows teams to sign players who normally would count as designated players and then buy down their cap hit. To make this clearer, anyone who makes over $457,500 annually in MLS counts as one of a team's three designated players. With Targeted Allocation Money (or TAM), a team can sign a player for $600,000 annually and spend $200,000 of their TAM to buy him down below DP level, saving these slots for bigger, more expensive players.

What's the purpose of this? MLS is very invested in their salary cap as a means of keeping expenditures low and maintaining parity. This new TAM allows a team to bring in better players whom might have been to expensive to fit into the salary cap previously.

Along with this, MLS announced an additional $125,000 in for Homegrown Players Funds for teams over the next two years. Homegrown players are academy signings whom do not count against the salary cap.

Yes, MLS rules are confusing and make very little sense at times.

F.A.Q.
--------

(I can update this with new questions.)

*Why is there no relegation/promotion?*

* Unfortunately, it is not economically feasible at present. The fear is that if a team gets relegated, fans will stop coming to matches, and the owner will fold the team. The average American sports fan is used to supporting the best teams in the world at their sport (NFL, MLB, NBA, etc.). We aren't at a point yet in popularity or financial stability where the risk of promotion/relegation is worth taking. I do hope to see it within a few decades.

*Why does MLS run spring to fall?*

* It's the same reason that Scandinavia runs spring to fall. The northern part of our country gets bombarded with snow in the winter unlike most of Europe. Even in March, a handful of MLS cities are still covered in snow. This would kill attendance. Plus, we don't want to compete against the NFL, NBA, and NHL.

*Isn't MLS a retirement league?*

* Not at all. Some teams rely on signing big named and old players. For every Ashley Cole or Andrea that is signed, several young or in their prime players join the league. Of the several players who joined my team this off season, only one was 30 or above.


*Why is the Supporter's Shield less prestigious than the MLS Cup?*

* In part, America values playoffs far more than the regular season. Also, the unbalanced schedule makes it an unfair comparison between teams. Where's the fairness in playing the Union three times compared to playing LA three times? The East is typically worse than the West, meaning Eastern teams have a better shot at winning the Shield.",soccer,1761

Calling and canvassing in South Carolina is nice as all, but in regards to delegates...Texas is the prize. We can severely cut into any Hillary advantage by getting close in Texas, and a Bernie win in Texas on Super Tuesday would destroy any of the Clinton campaign's gains.

So, how can we close the gap and stun everyone on Super Tuesday?

whynotdolphins,2016-02-18 01:37:25+00:00,I went through and wrote down who every team had the opportunity to draft since 2003. Wolves fans beware.,"**The Idea**


My buddy and I were talking about how the Wolves passed up Steph Curry twice in the 2009 draft (they drafted Rubio at 5, Jonny Flynn at 6 with Steph going at 7) and how much different the Wolves would look right now. So I thought, I wonder what other teams could have had.

**The Rules**

*The player the team “should have” drafted has to be taken five spots or less later than they could’ve drafted him. This ensures the scouting opinion is consistent with the league. For example, the Wolves would much rather have Jimmy Butler (No. 30 pick in 2011 draft) than Derrick Williams (No. 2 pick in 2011), but the entire league had the opportunity to pick Butler and whiffed. So it wasn’t a case of ineptitude by the Wolves not drafting Butler, he’s just an outlier the whole league missed on.

*This isn’t a world in which the players just go to one team. Example: The Pistons drafted Chase Budinger at No. 44 in 2009 and the Wolves (I’m sorry Minnesota!) drafted Nick Calathes at No. 45. The Cavs drafted Danny Green at No. 46. In my hypothetical team building, I would give Green to both the Pistons and the Wolves, since they both had the chance to draft him. Each team exists in their own little draft universe (insert “time is a flat circle” meme).

*I’m starting with the legendary 2003 draft class because that’s just when I started following the NBA at a serious level.

*I’m just doing the first round.

*If a scrub was drafted, followed by five scrubs, I just ignored it. Or if everybody is retired.

*I’m not redoing the 2015 draft, because I don’t think rookies can be judged with less than a full season of experience. Just a personal belief.

**Keep in mind**

I know, I know. If player X went to crappy situation Y, then player X wouldn’t have developed into a good player. Each player needs the right situation to prosper. I know that. This is just meant to be a fun “ooohhh look what we could have had!” type of post. Please don’t take it too seriously and be *too* mean to me.

Ok, let’s get started. The player in parentheses is the player the team actually drafted. The number next to each player is his draft order. Bolded names are players the teams actually drafted that I couldn’t find a better replacement for. I’m starting the Wolves, because, well….

&amp;nbsp;


**Minnesota Timberwolves**

PG — Steph Curry 7 (Ricky Rubio 5)

SG — C.J. McCollum 10 (Trey Burke 9) or J.J. Redick 11 (Randy Foye 7)

Wing (I cheated, I know) — DeMar DeRozan 9 (Jonny Flynn 6) or **Andrew Wiggins 1**

PF — Tristan Thompson 4 (Derrick Williams 2) or Kenneth Faried 22 (Donatas Motiejnas 20) or **Kevin Love 5**

C —DeMarcus Cousins 5 (Wesley Johnson 4) or **Karl-Anthony Towns 1**

&amp;nbsp;

Wow. Could have had Boogie and Steph very easily (they were taken IMMEDIATELY after the Wolves picks). This is my favorite what-if team. I let it be a dealer’s choice for SG and PF. Whatever style you prefer to run would dictate which one you start. I do that a lot with other teams in the list, too.

Now I’ll go in the reverse order of the worst records of this year’s teams.

I had completely forgotten about Mouhamed Sene. The only think I know about him is a joke Bill Simmons made in his draft diary column about how Ray Allen poured another glass of scotch upon seeing his team draft a player that wouldn’t help him.

&amp;nbsp;

edit: Added Golden State upon the request of several. Because sure, they need Reddick and PG, too.

&amp;nbsp;

edit 2: I've seen a lot of ""We didn't draft X"" comments. What I tried to do was say each team had the chance to draft some player, but they didn't. So the Celtics came away with Kelly Olynyk, the 13th pick in the draft (via trade from Dallas) so they technically didn't draft him, but they still came away with the 13th pick in the draft and they *could* have had something else. Hope that reasoning makes sense.

&amp;nbsp;

edit 3: added Spurs and Thunder &amp; correct Eric Maynor. He was not the No. 2 pick in the draft.",nba,1318

Spooleo,2016-02-09 04:53:06+00:00,Goodbye to Funhaus,"Sometime in the next week or two will be the last time that I do the loop through the doors at Funhaus. After months of soul searching and deliberation I've decided to move on from Funhaus and Los Angeles. I'm not being fired or laid off. I'm moving back home to be closer to my family, friends and to chase my own personal dreams. What most people don't know is that I've been lonely and unhappy living in LA for a long long time now and it's time for me to shut my eyes and take a leap towards bettering my life.  

* First of all, I want to say that this is **100% my decision** and isn't anyone else's fault so I ask that you please don't go blaming the guys or RT and if you see anyone that is, you send them over to this post. **I love the guys.** We've had some of the best of times together and have gone through all kinds trials over the years and I'll always consider them to be my brothers. Hell, they're the biggest reason I even stuck around as long as I have. I can't believe how much we've accomplished with the channel and am super proud of us. Without them I'd have been bumbling through my life thus far.  

* Lastly, thank you guys, the fans. You are all seriously the best. You're the other main reason I've hung around for as long as I have. Whether you like me or not, y'all have given me the confidence to be me which is a truly amazing feeling. As an extremely awkward and shy introvert, it seriously blows my mind everyday that any of you even like me at all, let alone are fans of me. So, thank you all so SO much for that. I &lt;3 yous.  

* I know many of you will have questions and I don't expect everyone to understand my reasons for leaving, and it'll probably fail miserably, but I hope you can at least respect my decision. Anyways, here's some answers to a few other burning questions:  

**Where are you going?**  
Moving back home to the Pacific Northwest. I seriously miss the rain!  

**Are you moving to another company?**  
I currently don't have another job lined up, but will be on the hunt once I'm back home!  

**Will you keep streaming?**  
Don't worry Spoole Boyz, I won't be abandoning you! I absolutely love streaming and while I'm not going to become a full time streamer, I fully intend to keep streaming as much if not more than I do currently.

I wanted to do a write up in how I paid off my CC debt in a year, because every post I see about people paying down large portions of debt after a major job promotion or raise or change had no meaning to me.  I needed to find a way out of credit card debt that was accrued over a large period of time without having to depend on a windfall or major life change, and the majority of the success stories I found were from people already making 6 figures, or had changed jobs multiple times to triple their income.  Here's how I did it with a simple 2% cost-of-living raise and a low-mid income.

**Income/COL Stats (Begin January, 2015)**

**Beginning Cash:** ~$1,000 (Dec 31, 2014)

**Location:** Southern California, 45 min. North of Los Angeles

**Income:** $55,000 ($1,480 Take Home every 2 weeks)

**Raises:** 1x 2%, effective April

**Rent:** $775 (2 BR Apt, $1550 split with partner)

**Gas:** $3.15 - $3.85 / gal

**CC Available:** $12,400 (4 cards)

**CC Debt:** $10,000 (81% Used)

**Avg CC APR:** 22%

**Credit Score:** 630

**Car**: $455 ($250 car, $205 insurance)

**Phone:** $105

**Step 1 – IMMEDIATE Reduction in Monthly Costs**

**TV (Saved $130/month)**

I dropped my DirecTV bill ($150+ a month) at the end of 2014.  I had to pay a couple hundred bucks for the cancellation, which was fine, as I saved that much after a month and a half of no service.  With the internet a practical necessity, and Netflix/Amazon/Hulu, I substituted $150 in cable for what is relatively $18, since I consider the free Prime shipping to far outweigh what we pay (as a household) for the service.  We also barely watch Amazon streaming, so I don't consider this paid TV for this purpose.   I also found an antenna on sale for about $40 purely so I could watch some sports.

**Phone (saved $50/month)**

The first thing I did was call and change my phone plan.  I was grandfathered into unlimited data as long as I had stayed with the rate that I had been paying.  However, when I looked at my usage I found that, primarily because I'm usually connected to WiFi, I was using less than 3GB of data a month.  Switching from my old plan that was around 7 years old, I went from $105 a month to $54 a month.

**Insurance (saved $50/month)**

While I had various driving related issues on my record, my insurance for my leased civic started at around $205 a month for the year.  I was about to start shopping around, wherein I found that by switching companies I could save around $60-75 a month.  However, due to some bad history falling off, safe driver, etc, my insurance ended the year at about $154, and they've been great in helping me take care of some issues I had along the way, so I didn't feel the need to change.  I would say, though, that anyone looking to save money should shop around, as switching companies will result in a money savings the majority of the time.


**Step 2 – Planning and Preparation**

**YNAB – You Need a Budget ($65)**

I spent money to buy YNAB.  It's a tool that was highly touted, and since I didn't really need some of the features of Mint, and YNAB was so user friendly (the phone app is too easy), I figured the $65 would not be really frivolous, but instead would be a valuable asset on my road to recovery.  Being able to track every dollar I spent was not necessary sometimes, but having the underlying responsibility and commitment to myself in the background forced me to change the way I viewed my money.

Also, using the Reporting function on YNAB let me SEE my progress month after month...ok to be honest I checked it like every few days...but SEEING the progress helped keep me on track.  I watched the trend move month after month, and this is what I saw at the end: https://i.imgur.com/bLlQ1dK.png

**Excel – Short Term Predictions**

I created a spreadsheet in Excel that tracked all of my cards separately as well.  While YNAB does allow you to budget, it does not effectively help you plan down to the days of the month.  With payment due dates, bills, etc, I needed a way to not only TRACK my money, but to PREDICT where my accounts would be on any day.
This would prove absolutely crucial, as it let me make massive payments without fear of overdrafting or any other bad news pop ups.  There were times when my checking account was as low as $20.  This didn't really matter, though, because I knew where my money would be days and weeks later with no surprises.

**Come Up with a Payoff Plan – Snowball, Avalanche**

I needed to decide how I was going to tackle this debt first.  Through a series of taking care of partners, bad choices, and various life events, I went from having a 785 credit score and 9% APRs to about a 630 and maxed out 19%-25% APRs.  I messed around with unbury.me for a little bit, and determined that the course of action would be to tackle the highest APR first.  However, my plan wasn't all the way conventional.

Balance, APR - $2,000, 23.99%

Balance, APR - $2,200 22.90%

Balance, APR - $3,586 19.99%

Balance, APR - $2,200, 22.90% (Cash Rewards Card)

**Create TINY Emergency Fund - $1,000 Break Glass for Disaster**

First thing I did was change whatever money I had over to my checking account, and put $1,000 in a savings account.  This is something I did not touch for the entire year, thankfully, even after paying for car maintenance, fun times, or gift buying, or anything else that came my way.

**Zero out 401k Contributions – (Employer Profit Share, NO 401K match)**

Since my employer doesn't do 401K matching, I had no incentive to keep putting money into my 401K.  If this service is available from your employer, do not stop contributing to your retirement funds.  I did it solely because there was no extra money to be gained in the short term.  If I had matching, I would have saved money elsewhere (like food, see below) and still maintained retirement contribution funding.

**Create a Budget**

I used YNAB to set up a budget to TRY to stick to.  I set a lofty goal of paying off $1,000 in credit cards every month, and worked my budget DOWN from there.  I had the complete understanding that I would probably not hit this mark, but it forced me to find out where I didn't really need to waste money.  I would barely make this work by the end, through a series of monthly ebbs and flows, but only as an average.  I hardly ever hit the $1,000 mark.
This would entail paying off $1,000 across all cards.  Effectively this would be about $175-200 in minimum payments, and the rest of the $800 all to one card.  I often would miss this goal.


**Step 3 – ACTION**

**How to Control Spending – Using Cash Back Rewards Cards ONLY**

Even though I had the idea to pay down my highest interest first, the first thing I did was put my first big payment onto my cash rewards card to clear up room.  I opened a Capital One Quicksilver with a 1.5% cash back reward at the end of 2014, and made it an effort to use this card for 95% of my purchases.  I also have a Chase Freedom that has 5% cash back on rotating categories, which I would swap out to use during certain times of the year.  This was moreso a mental thing, as it let me feel like I was actually earning throughout the year, even though I was paying every dollar I had to my name to credit debt.  Additionally, I netted just around $450 in cash back rewards by Dec 2015.

**How to Control Mental Stability – Won't Always Hit the Goal**

As the months started to wear on, I had to change my budget little by little.  I knew by month 3 that paying $1,000 straight to credit cards every month wouldn't work.  Luckily by being paid every 2 weeks instead of twice a month, I knew that there would be a month in the middle and end of the year that I would be paid a third check.  I used the majority of these checks to ""catch up"" on payments.

**How to Control Emotional Stability – Allow yourself some joys in life**

VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF HOW I SPENT MY FUN MONEY: https://i.imgur.com/FddeIrY.gifv

Knowing that having a goal to pay this off in a single year was going to put me far away from some fun things, I focused on and took some liberties whenever something would come up.  I would do cheap happy hours with coworkers, I would still buy cheap fun things ($20-40 board games that I can play with my GF, a gadget here or there), and I would definitely allow myself to go out to dinner or go on date night with my GF a few times a month.
Using YNAB tracking, I realized that I STILL went to eat out to the tune of $300 a month.  This, for all intents and purposes, was frivolous fun money.  There was no need to spend this much if I had truly cared to reign it in, however food and service in Southern California is not cheap, and I was determined to enjoy myself and my friends and my GF throughout the year. 

If I had been in uncontrollable debt, or anything more than what I was, I would have cut out eating out to once a month.  Luckily my situation was controllable, and I allowed myself the flexibility and peace of mind to swap certain things for the possibility by a month or two.  Ultimately, I still paid off my cards in under a year.


**Step 4 – Watching the Weight Fall Off**

**The Beginning**

The first milestone was in March, when I was able to completely pay off my first credit card.  This was a major relief, and an acknowledgement that I may actually be able to pull this off.  After this first card was down, all I thought about was the next one biting the dust, and the next, and the next.

**The Middle**

My next payoff was in June.  Again, I wasn't hitting my $1,000 mark every month.  The realization of that in the beginning allowed me to maintain some sense of self, not feel 100% beholden to the debt schedule, and when the milestones hit, they felt FUN instead of RELIEVING.  Once I hit this point I really felt like I had it all in control.

**The End**

By November I made my last payment.  My last.  Payment.  $10,000 in UNDER a year.  I spent some money, I had some fun, I enjoyed myself and my friends, and I paid off the entirety of my credit debt.  Un.  Believable.

At the end of the year as my debts started to become $0, I noticed a major influx of credit line increases and credit score increases.  In the span of that year my APRs dropped, my credit score rose by about 80 points, and my available credit was nearly doubled, all WITHOUT a phone call, an email, or any effort to do so.  The credit card companies are DIRELY missing the thousands of dollars I've been paying in interest, and they want me BACK.  They have repeatedly raised my credit limits and dropped my interest rates over the past couple of months.


**Year Beginning/End**

Jan 2015 – 630

Oct 2015 – 705

**Cash Back Rewards**

$450


**FINALE**

In short, I was able to pay off $10,000 in credit card debt with a $55,000 salary (2% raise) in SoCal in a year by immediately removing paid TV, changing my phone plan, and lowering car insurance.  I set aside a credit card to use for all purchases that had 1.5% cash back, which gave me some gift money for Christmas, and let me feel like I was earning throughout the year even though I was paying out every dollar I had.

Throughout the year I let myself understand that some months I would only be able to afford 60-70% of my goal, but that was ok.  In the end it all worked out.

I hope this helps someone who is on the fence or who often gets discouraged by stories of people with 6 figure incomes who can't control their wealth any more than we can.  IT CAN BE DONE.  And it might be easier…and ""funner""…than you think.

**EDIT**

Couple things.  First off, I would not always suggest that one should cut all retirement savings in the hunt for debt resolution.  There were a couple factors that went into me making this decision, one being that my APRs on my credit cards were astronomical.  I would suggest spending some time looking into your personal situation and what your company and/or personal gains/losses would be before forming your plan.

Secondly, thanks for all the positive responses!  As for the negative responses telling me ""oh yeah just pay off $10,000 in a year thaaanks""......I get it.  It's the internet.  Understood.  Please save your breath and your fingertip typing tire tread.  I simply made this post to give a take on an Average Joes mental and physical tackling of a very common problem, and honestly to call it what it is, lifestyle.  I'm just hoping to let people know who were in my situation or in my state of mind a year ago that it's possible to get it taken care of, even in an average situation.

Thirdly, LOL I am not a shill for YNAB.  It just seemed to be a better fit for me than Mint.  I spent some time on PF reading and looking at people's stories before I chose it.  The main point of this for me was that it held me accountable!  Having this little app on my phone requiring me to put all my expenses in, looking at charts and budget tables every week, and seeing negatives where I overspent was like having a little gremlin on my shoulder every time my wallet came out!  It was instrumental is changing my perception of money...MY money...the money I earn!  And deserve to keep.

**EDIT - Clarification on Take Home/Budgeting Clarity**

People seem to be asking about my take home a lot, and I think it's a very valid point to hammer home.  I was bringing home $1,480 * 26 = $38,480 / $55,000 = about a 30% withholdings (taxes, health, etc).  Again, this was at the beginning of the year, and I got a COL increase of 2% a little over quarter of the way through the year.

**As I mentioned in the OP, I get paid every two weeks, NOT twice a month.  This equates to 26 paychecks per year.  What I did was budget to the tune of two paychecks a month ($1,480 x 2  = $2,960) and not factor in the extra check that would come around in July and in December.**  The third paycheck on December 31 paycheck would end up not mattering in this instance, as I had already paid everything off by the beginning of December, however the third check I got in July went to car registration ($200), GF's birthday spending (Aug), some fun activities, and an extra payment dollars towards the card (I believe I put in an extra $500 out of this?  Along with the monthly.  Whatever was left over (wasn't a lot) I let sit in my account so it had more than $20 :).

Had I not gotten this extra payment, I still could have spent the same in August and finished the pay-off in December, however **this wasn't extra cash.  This was a budgeting decision.**.  I decided to budget only off of $35,520, not my annual take home of $38,480.  This was primarily an emotional facet, as the money was coming to me either way, but in an effort to reel in my spending habits, and to experience some joy over the Summer, I chose to not budget for that third check in July.

**EDIT - Excel Tracking Example**

http://i.imgur.com/wnpwfwX.png

**Excel File Dropbox Link**

https://www.dropbox.com/s/bv38oxylouziuap/Account%20Balance%20Forecast%20File.xlsx?dl=0

This is a portion of how I tracked my ACTUAL cash flow in/out, regardless of budgets/budgeting software.  **The budgeting software helped me allocate, while Excel helped me track.**  I hesitate to post the full document, as I'm not sure how useful it would be to anyone else's situations, but I'd be willing to help someone get one together for themselves if it would mean getting them on the right path to debt resolution TODAY.

I'll attach a screenshot of one of my Excel sections that I used to forecast my money.  I also did this in the same worksheet for all of my credit cards.

As it may be confusing to some, I'll break it down a little bit.  You'll see in it that I have a salary paid, rent and bills paid, and then future forecasted payments (in gray).  We'll have the Chase payment (this was minimum +~$5), the Cap One payment (this was THE card I was paying down at the time), plus a Quicksilver payment for a large amount.  This Quicksilver one was NOT paying down debt!  It was simply paying down the amount I had used during the month of March, as I used that card for 90%+ of my purchases to accumulate cash back rewards.  This is how I tracked not only where my money was going, but where it would be on a day-to-day basis.

**This also REALLY helped me see how much money I DIDN'T HAVE!**  By March 26 I would have $3,500+ in money in my account.  Normally this would be telling myself hey, I can definitely afford to buy something worth a couple hundred bucks!  But no.......now we see by April 3, literally a week afterwards, my account would only have $193 in it.

Again, this is just an example of how I did it.  I would set it up differently depending on needs, accompanying software, and personal setup.",personalfinance,2755

I want to let you know that this is actually me and not my stoned ghost (see:http://imgur.com/gpVpsZJ ).  I’m not actually dead!  Woohoo!!   

Cheech &amp; Chong consist of myself and my comedy partner Cheech Marin.  We released albums, movies and toured the country in the ‘70s and ‘80s.  Our most famous movie without a doubt that people recognize us for to this day is “Up In Smoke.”  The reaction to “Up In Smoke” was incredible and it is a movie I am most proud of.  I directed Up In Smoke, Cheech &amp; Chong’s Next Movie, Nice Dreams, Still Smoking, Far Out Man and The Corsican Brothers.  We have been credited as pioneers of the legalization of marijuana and the popularizers of cannabis in pop culture. 

Something you may not know about me is that I was also in a band signed to Motown prior to being part of Cheech &amp; Chong and we had a hit record and even played with the Jackson 5 once before they were famous called Bobby Taylor &amp; The Vancouvers.  

Recently I’ve been working in my shed a lot making pipes and art in my house in the Pacific Palisades in Los Angeles.  I have been out of jail for over a decade after being incarcerated in 2003 as part of Operation Pipe Dreams for the selling of bongs.  I was on Dancing With The Stars a year ago, which was really fun.  I made a web talk show over the summer and I'm going to be making more videos.  Cheech &amp; I are still very good friends.  2015 and the near future is almost like the completion of this plot arc of a movie I've been playing a character in my entire life and I am now seeing the dream of full cannabis legalization, actually come true.  It's amazing and we have truly come a long way.

That being said, I want to make sure you know man that I am going to give you no filters here Reddit, you’re going to have to take my answers harsh and uncut.  Feel free to ask me anything, let’s start this AMA man.

I recently published a paper calling for police killings and deaths to be tracked as health data, and I’m here to answer your questions!","Hello, reddit!

I’m [Dr. Nancy Krieger](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nancy-krieger/), Professor of Social Epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. My research focuses on how people’s health can be influenced by the conditions in which they are born, live and work, including how economic policies and systems, social norms, social policies, and political systems can affect health. My research also focuses on health inequities and how we can improve monitoring of health inequities, that is, unfair, unnecessary, and preventable differences in health status across social groups.

In a [new paper released on December 8, 2015 in PLoS Medicine, “Police Killings and Police Deaths Are Public Health Data and Can Be Counted,”]( http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001915) my research team and I proposed that all law enforcement-related deaths—including people killed by police as well as police killed in the line of duty—be treated not just as criminal data but as a “notifiable condition,” and that they be reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) by public health and medical professionals and published on a weekly basis as are a host of other conditions ranging from poisonings to pertussis to polio.

It is time to bring a public health perspective to this problem from a standpoint that emphasizes prevention and health equity. These deaths, like other violent deaths, are not a matter for criminal justice only. Their health impact includes and extends beyond those killed and their families to the broader communities in which these deaths occur and society overall.

To support our case, we presented data showing that, over the past 50 years, black men in the US have faced significantly greater risk than white men of being killed by police. In 1965, among black and white men ages 15-34 across the U.S., blacks were eight times more likely to be killed by police than whites; by 2005, blacks’ excess risk had declined, but was still three times higher than that of whites, on par with current estimates. We also found variations in risk across U.S. cities over time. New York and Cleveland have been particularly risky cities for blacks; in both cities, between 1960 and 2011, depending on the year, blacks’ risk of being killed by police ranged anywhere from 5 to 19 times higher than that of whites.

EZmisery,2015-12-15 20:37:11+00:00,Dad's Tapes: The Child Star,"My dad was a detective in the Los Angeles area for over forty years.  He worked right up until the day he died (which was last month.)  He specialized in interrogating perpetrators, especially the psycho or difficult ones.  I was going through his things and found a box of tapes.  They were all labeled with case numbers and dates.  I think they must be the official recordings of the interviews he conducted.  I have been listening to some of them and they are more disturbing than you can even imagine.

I am going to share one of the transcripts with you.  Please only read if you are able to handle some really fucking creepy shit.  I am going to call my dad “Danny” since that’s what he went by.  I’ll try to also write notes about the different sounds that happen.  My notes will be in parentheses.  I miss you, dad.

___________________________________________________

**Danny:** Good morning, Ms. Davis.

**Ms. Davis:** Is it morning?  

**Danny:** Yes ma’am.  It’s exactly seven forty five AM.  

**Ms. Davis:** Oh, yes.  Of course.

**Danny:** Would you like to tell me about what happened?

**Ms Davis:** I can try.  Are you recording?

**Danny:** Yes ma’am.  We have to record these interviews.

**Ms. Davis:** Oh my.  Well I don’t mind being recorded.  I’m used to it, you know.  My sister and I – we were child stars.  Like real ones!  We got recognized on the street all the time.  We had tons of fans and got letters and presents.  I still have a big white bear one of my fans sent me.
 
I started acting in films when I was six.  My sister was only four.  I guess you could say our parents were “show parents.”  Looking back I think they were trying to live through us.  They never got to be stars so we were like their little substitutes. 
 
I don’t have too many memories of that time in my life.  I was very young after all.  But I do remember spending hours in hair and makeup.  I was a pretty well behaved as a child I think.  I tolerated the fake eyelashes and outfits.  My little sister, Missy, was less well behaved.  She was always crying and squirming around.  But once that camera turned on, we were both perfect.
 
I don’t act anymore.  As you probably know, most child stars don’t have film careers as adults.  Once we stopped being cute the industry didn’t want us anymore.  For me it was the age of eighteen.  No one was interested in my talent after that.  I can’t lie, I was pretty sad.  I loved being pampered and treated like a super model.  Missy, on the other hand, hated the lime light.  She was so happy when we stopped acting.
 
Anyway, I live with Missy in our childhood home.  Our parents died when we were twenty two.  They left us quite a bit of money, so I don’t work.  Missy is in school for social work.  She’s always been such a sweet soul.  She is going to help so many people with her degree.
 
I’m getting off topic.  I now have a little girl of my own.  She’s four and a half.  Her name is Lissy.  She is so stunningly beautiful I really want to get her involved in acting, but Missy doesn’t think it’s a good idea.  She reminds me how difficult our childhoods were.  But I think it was good for us!  It taught us how to be outgoing and patient.
 
Lissy is a bit of a handful.  She cries a lot and whines.  Missy says it’s normal but I think she needs a little structure in her life.  And the life of a child star is definitely structured!  You wake up, get ready for the shoot, spend all day on camera, and then finally go back to sleep.  Missy and I barely had time for ourselves and hardly ever went to school.  Missy wanted to go but our parents were very strict about our filming schedules.
 
Wow, I am such a space case!  I totally forgot your question!
 
**Danny:** Don’t worry, ma’am.  I asked what happened last night.
 
**Ms. Davis:** Oh yeah.  Sorry!  I’ve always been so forgetful.  Anyway.  Last night Lissy and were watching some of Missy and my old movies.  I told Lissy all about how her aunt and I were child stars, and she seemed really interested in seeing the videos.  I mean, what little girl doesn’t want to be famous? 
 
I decided to show her our most popular film, which was the first one we ever made.  I think it was so popular because we were brand new on the scene and people were amazed by our talents.”
 
**Danny:** (At this point dad’s voice breaks just a tiny bit)  Are you saying you showed your daughter your…movies?
 
**Ms. Davis:** Of course!  Doesn’t every star show their children their movies?
 
Anyway, Lissy and I were watching and she giggled the whole time.  The film is pretty simple so she could understand what was happening.  It was an easy shoot – it was just us girls in the bathtub.  We played with the bubbles and laughed a lot.  Then we got out of the tub and our dad dried us off.  It’s called “Sissy and Missy have Bathtime.”
 
Once the video ended Lissy wanted more, so I played her a few more.  She liked the ones with us alone the best, although I showed her some of the films we made with co-stars.  She didn’t like those as much.  It was probably because Missy had a few crying scenes in those.  We watched “Sissy and Missy Get in Trouble” and “Sissy and Missy Play Dress-up.”  And a few others.
 
So then Missy walks in on us watching the movie with Mr. Friendly-
 
**Danny:** Mr. Friendly?
 
**Ms. Davis:** Oh yeah!  Mr. Friendly was one of dad’s friends.  He was very nice to us.  After the shoot we got lots of candy and stayed up all night!  I guess Missy didn’t like him very much, because she ran into the room while we were watching and started screaming.  She said, “What the fuck are you doing?” (The woman was using a mocking tone for her sister’s voice)
 
I told her the truth, I swear I did.  I said, “Lissy wanted to see our movies!” 
 
Missy looked furious.  She kept yelling, “I thought you said you destroyed these tapes!”
 
**Danny:** We thought those films were destroyed as well, after the trial.
 
**Ms. Davis:** They got rid of the tapes they found, but mom and dad had a whole stack of duplicates under the floorboards.  I kept them because I hated to think of my childhood acting career being destroyed!”
 
**Danny:** Ok ma’am, so what happened next?
 
**Ms. Davis:** Well, Missy kept screaming at me.  She yelled and threw things.  She threatened to take away Lissy!  She said I wasn’t a good mom!  She said I was just like our mother, which is ridiculous.  I couldn’t believe she said those things.  I am a great mom!  I just want my daughter to feel like a star too!  So I turned her upside down.
 
**Danny:** (My dad pauses for a long time) What does it mean to turn someone upside down?
 
**Ms. Davis:** Oh, silly me.  I forget that not everyone knows that term.  It’s an acting term.  When an actress isn’t performing right, our parents would turn her upside down.  We had lots of sisters who became upside down.  They still live with us, it’s just now they live in the garden.”
 
**Danny:** How do you turn someone upside down?  (I don’t know how my dad remained calm)
 
**Ms. Davis:** You stab them.  (She starts laughing)
 
**Danny:** Are you saying you killed your sister?  (My dad’s voice is hard to hear over her laughter)
 
**Ms. Davis:** She was going to take away my baby girl.  I made her upside down.  She can sleep in the garden with the rest of them.  She never understood how important it was to be a star.  She deserved it!  I am a good mom.
 
**Danny:** (Dad stays silent for a solid minute) Is there anything else you’d like to tell me?

**Ms. Davis:** You know, you look a lot like Mr. Friendly.  You’re handsome.  I bet you’d make a good actor.  Have you thought about acting?

**Danny:** No ma’am.

**Ms. Davis:** Well you should think about it.  My daughter is getting into acting, you know.  You two could make a great movie.

outliering,2015-12-13 08:19:43+00:00,"I'm an Uber Driver in Los Angeles, and I won't soon forget my last passenger","Coming from the Midwest, you anticipate that you're going to run into some unusual people and things out in this city. Los Angeles definitely doesn't disappoint. Whether it's getting held at gunpoint outside of my apartment,  or seeing a homeless man get run down in the streets in Thai Town, all are things that I'm not used to seeing coming from Indiana. 

I'm dime a dozen out here. I came to Los Angeles to pursue the arts like every other schmo around. The trick about this city is finding a job where you can actually keep afloat while maintaining some sort of flexibility so that you can accommodate the volatile life of auditions and meetings. Uber and Lyft are the perfect solution. When you sign up for both platforms to drive, you're told that you'll likely get some unruly folks, and what to do in said situation. I carry a small knife on me, and even though you're not supposed to have a weapon, just try and think of how much of a disadvantage you're at if someone is sitting right behind you. If you need proof, watch that video of the (former) Taco Bell executive psycho wailing on the Uber driver in Orange County....yikes. 

I've been driving for both services for about a year, and I've never really had an incident. Sure, a drunk UCLA student tried to punch out my backseat window on a Friday night, but we've all been there, right? Everything changed recently, and I haven't driven since my encounter with the person I'm going to tell you about, and I met her 2 weeks ago. 

11:45 PM on a Wednesday night. Out here, it doesn't matter what night it is, people are out and about, and you rarely have to wait long for a ride. I was parked on Santa Monica and Cahuenga when I got the request. ""Pick up Carol located 0.4 miles away."" Let's do this, Carol! I arrive at the address given, but no one is outside. Not unusual. I begin messing with the radio and getting the AUX cord set in case Carol wants to play some sweet jams, and that's when the rear right side door opens. I look back, and I'm confused. Carol is old. Like, early 80s at least. Odd to see someone in this demographic this late on a Wednesday evening, but I've had others in the age range, so I write it off as not a big deal. ""How's it going tonight, Carol?"" I ask. No response. She struggles in, and shuts the door behind her. I glance in my rear view mirror and study her face. No emotion whatsoever, almost as though Will Smith had just flashed the Nueralyzer in her face. ""Where are we headed tonight?"" No response. Can she hear me? Does she not speak English? Then my phone beeps, ""New Destination Entered: 1900 N Vermont Ave."" I throw the car into drive.

It's not a lengthy car ride, but I figure I'll try one more time. It's usually pretty easy to gauge if someone wants to chat or not. ""Are you from Los Angeles?"" I ask in one last attempt. I glance in the rear view mirror and she's staring right at me. Her gaze is piercing me. In a deep, shrill voice she answers ""I wouldn't worry about that."" Okay, lady. I get it, I'll just drive you to your destination. 

We're a ways off from the destination she entered when she speaks up ""Drop me off at the next corner."" I look up in the rear view mirror, her eyes still upon me, and I ask ""Are you sure? We're still a mile---"" ""JUST STOP AT THE NEXT CORNER"" she snaps at me. I pipe the f*** down.  My full blooded Norwegian father didn't command that kind of attention when he would speak up in a room. I wanted her out of my car, so I was happy to oblige and stop. I pull off on a quiet corner a few blocks off of Fountain Ave. I slightly turn my head to look over my right shoulder to say something like ""Have a good night,"" but as I turn my head, I see that she's leaned up in between the seats, just inches from my face. I freeze. I can't speak. I can't look at her, only down at the median in between the drivers and passenger seats. 

Her breathing is something I'll never forget. It was deep breaths in such a strange cadence. Almost like an irregular heart beat. She put her pointer and middle fingers on my shoulder, and my eyes finally meet hers. I'm terrified. Her touch was ice cold. I was wearing my Colts hoodie, and her fingers felt almost like ice directly in contact with skin. Her eyes weren't black, wide open, or any other cliché' of a maniac, but sad, almost motherly. My terror shifted. Before I could say anything and before she stepped out of my car, she said three words that forever changed my life. ""Take the stairs."" 

I stared back at her with a look that said, ""excuse me?"" She didn't repeat herself, but leaned back and away, and exited my car. I sat there watching her slowly waddle away into a beat up apartment building, and then out of my sight. What the HELL was that? I wasn't going to give anymore rides that night. I turn off the app, and drive back to my apartment in Koreatown. Currently that's where I'm sitting, my head still in my hands trying to comprehend what happened. 

I stumbled in to the back door of my 8 floor apartment building that night. I live on the 7th floor. This place has been standing since the late 1940s. By the time I come in it's around 12:30, and not even thinking, I hop up the back stairwell. Usually I'm lazy as hell, and take the rickety old elevator. I get to the fourth floor when I hear it..... SCREEEEECHHHHHH BAM BAM BOOOOOMMM!!!! 

An engineer had done repairs the day before, and I remember the note slid under our doors from the beginning of the week. April, a BEAUTIFUL girl on the 8th floor had hopped on the elevator to get her laundry out of the dryer, right at the same time I had gotten home. Two of the main cables snapped, and the elevator crashed violently down to the ground floor. Fell 7 stories. April's family came and got her stuff a week ago, and I'm still thinking about Carol's warning.

**Backlash**

A customer I don't recognize walks in and comes straight up to me. Big guy, probably 6'4""-6'5"", mid 30's light hair, baked skin, t shirt, beat up jeans and work boots. This is his story.

&gt;Customer: Hey man, whatsup. I was in here a few years ago and I got this Spyderco knife, yeah that one. Been using it since, but last week some one comes onto my site and breaks into my tool box. Dude takes my knife and tries to use it to break the lock on my truck. Dunno how you do that. But he jams the knife into the lock and the thing breaks! Blade snaps back and stabs him in the leg! One of my guys hears him screaming and we all come over to see this dumbass with my broken knife blade in his leg. Couldn't stop laughing! And he says he we gotta pay him or he'll call the cops! They got a good laugh outta the security tapes!

&gt;Me: Thats....okay. So what did you actually want?

&gt;Customer: Oh yeah, wanna another one of those knives. Actually, do you have like, six? The guys want one too.

&gt;Me: Probably. Are you sure don't want something stronger?

&gt;Customer: Nah man, long as when it breaks, it stabs the other guy.

I told him we couldn't guarantee that, but I'd only charge him for 5 as his broke. He seemed a generally exuberant fellow but that put him over the moon. All in a days work. Or something.

**The Scary Little Girl**

I was doing inventory and stock checks one weekend morning when a friend of mine came in. He shared my passion for all things blunt or bladed, and I knew him well enough to trust him to walk around behind the counter and investigate items at his leisure. A customer came in, an almost irritatingly cute Asian girl probably just shy of five feet. I started over to her with a traditional ""Howarya?"" (one word - no reply necessary or even expected) greeting when my friend makes a beeline for her. This can pretty much only be entertaining, and I figure I can throw something at him if the situation gets out of control or he says something too stupid.

&gt;Friend: Hey! How can I help you?

&gt;Girl: Um, I don't know. I'm looking for something for protection. A friend of mine got mugged recently.

My friend proceeds to tell her about the various stun gun and pepper spray options. I keep an eye on them an extra minute to make sure he doesn't zap one of them or something, then go back to checking inventory. I can hear him chatting her up a little, but I'm not really paying attention when he comes over to me.

&gt;Uh, Kyen, can you help me out here? This kinda didn't go the way I thought it would.

I turn around and the girl has a 600,000 volt stun baton, pepper spray, and a hand ax with an ~~articulated~~ individual knuckle guard. Think smallish ax with brass knuckles for the handle. 

&gt;Me: Hey, Friend tells me you have some questions?

&gt;Girl: No, I think I'm getting these.

Keep in mind this girl is tiny. The ax is longer than her forearm, and the stun baton isn't the usual subtle little device most people like for protection. It's about ten inches with electricity arcing around it.

&gt;Me: Did I hear you say you wanted this for protection? This is all a bit much for any day to day carry. Also, bladed weapons aren't good for self defense unless you really know how to use them. ""Any weapon you don't know how to use belongs to your enemy.""

&gt;Girl: I just want to look scary. Do you think people will be afraid to come near me?

&gt;Me: Well yeah, you effectively scared off Friend and I couldn't do that throwing knives at him. That ax isn't street legal though.

&gt;Girl: It's going next to my bed.

I shrugged, gave her a quick once over on the laws and maintenance around the baton and pepper spray, and rang her out.

Friend came over to me after she left.
&gt;Me: Decided not to ask her out? She's cute, you can probably still catch her.

&gt;Friend: Next to her bed. She's putting the ax next to her bed. No I'm not going to f***ing ask her out!

frugaljuicer,2015-10-30 21:03:39+00:00,"Me [25F] with my boyfriend [30M] of two years, wants me to pay him $4k because I accumulated it ""unfairly""","When I started dating my boyfriend I was living at home still. I made about $40,000 but live in Los Angeles and decided to stay with my mom until I built up an emergency fund, saved for a car, and worked a little on a down payment for a home (I eventually plan to leave LA for somewhere more affordable). I was living at home for free. 



After dating my boyfriend for a year, he started insisting we move in together and get our own apartment (he was renting a room at the time).  I told him I do not want to spend more than $800 a month for my half because otherwise I will be living month to month and won't be able to save. We found ton of decent places for $1,200 or so, which would easily fit my budget. Instead, however, he really only wanted places  $2,000+ that have lots of amenities. I stood my ground and refused to pay over $800. 



He eventually suggested we get one of the places he wanted, but he'll make up the difference and I can stick with paying $800 a month.  I was initially reluctant, but he is an attorney who makes $90,000 a year and having a nice apartment is important to him for image reasons.  We split almost everything else 50/50.  We each pay for our own gas, cell phones, clothes, but split utilities and groceries in half. 



Fast forward to now. We've been living together for a year. He recently saw my Mint account on my phone and saw I have about $50,000 across all of my accounts ($25,000 in retirement, $20,000 in savings, and $5,000 in checking). He is absolutely furious. He said I have been taking advantage of him by paying only $800 in rent by pretending to be poor. Apparently he has only about $3,000 in savings and $5,000 in an old 401k. 


I saved a majority of my money while living at home rent free for two years and contributing as much as possible to retirement during that time. Currently, I put about $400 a month into savings and still add to my retirement accounts.  I sort of understand why he is upset, but I also think I had the right to say I don't want to pay above the $800 a month.  He could have easily lived in one of the cheaper places I wanted (they weren't sketchy or anything). 


Now he wants me to give him $4,000 to make up for the fact I haven't been paying half the rent. He also wants me to pay $1,100 a month going forward.  Honestly I don't understand how he's saved such little money when he makes $90,000! His car is paid off (I gave it to him because I bought a newer one and his dad paid off his $80k law school loan with a family inheritance).  He does eat breakfast and lunch out everyday and belongs to an expensive gym, but I seriously doubt that accounts for it.  I admit I never told him how much money I had, which I probably should have. How unreasonable am I being about not wanting to pay the $1,100 a month? Our lease isn't up until next September.

It taught me many lessons, including moderation and respecting the knowledge of my elders. It’s a story I have fondly titled “the reason I can’t drink apple juice”.

&amp;nbsp;

So, first and foremost, by show of hands – who loves apple juice? I envy all of you who have metaphysically raised your hands, because I too used to love apple juice, until the summer of ’99. My family had taken a trip out to Los Angeles and we had spent an amazing week out in the sun at Universal, Disneyland, etc. 

&amp;nbsp;


We also had the opportunity to go shopping. Now that I’ve graduated as a business major, I’m a bit more cynical when it comes to shopping, but when I was seven years old I didn’t really understand the deeper concepts of brand imagery. I just knew that from the second we walked into that store, I wanted them.

These fucking beautiful, fresh2deth, white sneakers. I just remember walking in the front door and seeing these dank sneakers on a pedestal and I knew that I absolutely HAD TO HAVE THEM. Now, when a seven-year-old boy wants white sneakers, the rational thing to do is to tell him to shut his lopsided ungodly mouth, which is precisely what my mother did. *“No, Slooots, that’s a terrible idea – you’re a disgusting little critter and they’ll be brown within days, if not hours.”* But nonsense, I said, I HAVE TO HAVE THEM. I told her, *Mom, you don’t understand… These are the most beautiful sneakers I have ever seen in my life.* Fast forward about twenty-one and a half minutes, and we were walking out of the store – me, with the sneakers on my feet, and my mom with a pained look that evidently showed that I would not shut the fuck up until I got my way. I know, I was a shitty little kid.

&amp;nbsp;


When we walked out of that store, and I had my gleaming white sneakers on my feet, I felt unstoppable. I felt as though I had unlocked life’s secrets. This must have been what God felt like on an average Tuesday morning.

&amp;nbsp;


I wore those sneakers for three straight days, and I took such good care of them that they were pretty much pristine when we stepped back on the plane on the day of our departure. The whole ride to the airport I was merely dreaming of the moment when I would arrive to school with my new peasant-crushers and truly ascend to the elementary bourgeoisie.

&amp;nbsp;


Now, I’m not really sure why, but we got upgraded to first class for some reason on our flight back. I just remember sitting down and thinking to myself that this chair was rather large for a person of my stature. The flight attendant was going around asking people for their drink orders. When she got to me, she said, “sir, can I get you anything to drink?” 


&amp;nbsp;

Oh damn. She just called me sir. Shit just got REAL.

&amp;nbsp;


Apple juice, at that point in time, was my favorite drink. Slightly chilled, one cube of ice (no more, no less) – to me, it was like the nectar of life. So yes, I said, I’d like an apple juice please thank you. And so it began.


&amp;nbsp;


The flight attendant, obviously dazzled by the rays of sunshine emanating from my feet, came back around and, seeing that my first juice was empty, asked if I would like another apple juice. Always the cost-conscious middle-class white Anglo-Saxon protestant, I inquired about the price. When I learned that in First Class, juice was free, I felt empowered to order two more.


&amp;nbsp;


After finishing my fourth apple juice, my mother said to me, *“don’t you think you should slow down on the apple juice?”*


&amp;nbsp;


Nonsense, mother, I replied. I mean, what was she thinking? I’m a seven-year-old leader of the free world, sitting in first class, drinking my favorite drink, wearing my brand new sneaks. I’ll have as many I ~~damn~~ dang well please.


&amp;nbsp;


Fast forward about thirty minutes and the plane was reaching its cruising altitude and I was reaching the double digits of apple juice consumption. The problem came, however, when the plane did as planes are wont to do. To quote the infamous Lil Jon – WE HIT TURBULENCE.


&amp;nbsp;


So, as it turns out, maybe eight apple juices was in fact a few too many. I puked. Everywhere. All over my new shoes, completely ruined them. And, to this day, I cannot drink apple juice. It makes me remember two things - the soul-crushing moment that I realized that my mother is invariably right more often than she is wrong, and the loss of the shoes that gave me more happiness than anything else in this life or the next.


&amp;nbsp;


**TL;DR - Ignored Mom's advice, bought white sneakers, ignored Mom's advice, drank apple juice, ignored Mom's advice, puked apple juice onto aforementioned sneakers**

Click here.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/3hgbr3/update_ryan_adams_tweeted_about_my_music_to/?)

I make music as Christopher the Conquered. Just over 1 week ago, Ryan Adams tweeted a photo of my new album (unreleased, it doesn't come out until next year) with the text: ""You guys @ctconquered is the real deal. This record is blowing my mind!!!"" Here's a link: https://twitter.com/TheRyanAdams/status/627930152379351040

He also posted it on Instagram with: ""This is a crazy and incredible record. Holy shit. Congrats @ctconquered"" Here's that link: https://instagram.com/p/55LLUtTDBl/


First of all, I need to say I am very thankful to Ryan for sharing my music. There's nothing in it for him, so it's just very sweet of him. So thank you, Ryan!

I have never met Ryan Adams. I played a show opening for the wonderful Natalie Prass and gave her an advance copy of the cd. It seems to have made its way from Iowa (where I live) to Los Angeles, where Ryan lives. Therefore, I owe Natalie a thank you, as well!

Obviously, I was very surprised to see these posts, and after overcoming the initial shock, it occurred to me that I should try to quantify the effect of these posts. We'll call it the ""Ryan Adams bump"". :)

So, 1 week later, what's happened? Well, I'm not playing on the late night circuit or anything like that, but I did get a lot of interest in my music. Here's how the last week has played out:

* Website Page Views - 2489 Views
* Youtube Videos: 1653 New Views
* Soundcloud: Single from Album - 572 Plays
* Facebook: 82 New Likes
* Instagram: 40 New Followers
* Twitter: 31 New Followers
* Spotify: 28 New Followers
* Email Newsletter: 12 Signups
* Internet Sales (Not including iTunes, Spotify, etc. - that takes a while to get those numbers): $86


I took a look at the analytics for what I could above (website, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter) and for the rest I can basically speak anecdotally.

* My website was averaging about 30 page views a day before the posts. The day of the post, I got 999 page views. It's been dropping exponentially since then, about to be back to it's ""normal"" state. We'll see if the overall average ups a little.

* YouTube videos saw a 701% growth over the previous week! Whoa.

* The single off the album on Soundcloud had pretty much tapered off after its release in April around 900 plays, get a couple a day since the mid-June. It had 950 plays right when Ryan posted, that jumped up to 1572 within one week.

* Facebook was a 179% growth in likes from the previous week. Not bad.

* Instagram is hard to tell, definitely a jump in follows, though!

* Twitter analytics, interestingly, say that my increase was in line with growth since the beginning of July...I did play a big festival then...I would've expected a noticeable bump here.

* Spotify followers had definitely tapered off, so that was a noticeable boost! Now that I have over 250 followers though, I can verify my artist profile and get analytics on that...not sure if I'll be able to look back at this time period though. 

* I had zero email signups and zero internet sales the week before this, and honestly, my weekly averages had been close to zero for a while. So definitely a bump there. It'll be interesting to see how revenues from digital music outlets are affected.



Now I did get two other pieces of press in this week, one on Noisey.Vice.com and one on PureVolume.com (a new music video). So it's not clear that all of the increases are due strictly to the ""Ryan Adams bump"", but undoubtedly he gave me a lot of momentum. And experience tells me that those other press bits wouldn't amount to much.

What I'm curious about is if these numbers could be extrapolated to predict the effect of being personally advocated for by a celebrity? Taylor Swift (whose album 1989 Ryan Adams is currently creating a cover version of in the style of The Smiths) has 100 times the number of Twitter followers that Ryan does. Would it be reasonable to expect that if she posted about my music, I would see 100 times the above numbers in impact?

**Anyone else have experience with having your music posted by people with loads of followers?**

Anyway, thanks again to Ryan Adams, and if you want to hear the title track from the album he is touting, you can here: http://www.christophertheconquered.com/im-giving-up-on-rock-roll-single-2015/

art36,2015-08-07 13:28:54+00:00,The Top 50 Albums for the Past 50 Years According to /r/music,"Hi /r/music,

Last week's thread [I post a year, users comment with what they think the best album released that year is.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/3fadru/i_post_a_year_users_comment_with_what_they_think/) was a huge success with over 3,000 comments which sparked lots of interesting discussions and thoughts while reflecting on the past 50 years in music. Over the past week I've taken the time to create a table to reflect the results. I've included the top album for each year as well as 3 'honorable mentions.' I have a spreadsheet saved in Google sheets that I plan on sharing later on with some more thoughts.

themightyheptagon,2015-07-28 15:35:09+00:00,"All of the characters in ""The Big Lebowski"" are aware that they're characters in a movie...except Donny.","[SPOILERS]

*The Big Lebowski* sure is a strange film, right? It's got all the elements of a great absurdist comedy: a narrator who talks to the protagonist and breaks the fourth wall, [a film within a film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHAGbD3dlhE), an intricate plot that revolves around a nonexistent mystery, and more quirky characters than you can shake a stick at.

The characters in the film are all the more memorable for the fact that they all seem to have blundered onto the set from different movies. In no particular order, we have:

* An aging hippy who gets roped into a ransom negotiation.
* A hot-tempered, gun-toting Vietnam veteran.
* An egotistical billionaire philanthropist with a dark secret.
* A sexy artist who behaves like a classic *noir* femme fatale.
* A cowboy.
* A seductive part-time pornstar.
* A sociopathic pederast bowling champion.
* A trio of lovably psychotic pop musicians who believe in nothing.
* A painfully ordinary man who just wants to go bowling with his friends.

Notice anything off about that last one?

First off, let's get one thing out of the way: the Coen Brothers clearly get a kick out of blurring the line between reality and fiction in this movie. Like I said, we have the very meta use of a Narrator who addresses the audience *and* the other characters, we have the protagonist imagining himself as the protagonist of a completely separate movie (complete with another set of opening credits), a fictional writer (Arthur Digby Sellers) of a real TV series (*Branded*), and a fictional porn film (*Logjammin'*) that plays in-universe.

For another thing, they're also clearly amused by the idea of setting up a complex plot that ultimately turns out to be a string of random coincidences and wacky misunderstandings. In true absurdist fashion, the ultimate twist of the movie is that **there is no twist**.

*The Big Lebowski* is what happens when a group of characters all become aware of their own roles in a story that doesn't have a coherent plot, conflict or resolution. All of them are desperate to keep the story going, but they all have very different ideas about what kind of movie they're *really* in—and they're all adamantly convinced that they should be the focus of the movie.

The Dude believes that he's the freedom-loving hero of an *Easy Rider*-type counterculture film, unaware that the audience is too busy laughing at him to cheer him on. Walter believes that he's the protagonist of a serious drama about traumatized veterans, unaware of how hilarious his rants about Vietnam really are. Jeffrey and Maude both believe that they're in a *noir* film (Jeffrey as a villain, Maude as a femme fatale love interest). Bunny believes that she's in a porn film. The Nihilists believe that they're the protagonists of a Tarantino-esque crime drama where the bad guys are the stars. The Stranger adamantly believes that he's in a Western, even while wandering through 1990s Los Angeles. And Jesus Quintana acts so loathsome because he thinks that he's the main villain, which makes it so much funnier when he just vanishes from the movie without a trace.

Donny, though? Donny always seems to be out of synch with the other characters because **he's the only one not trying to act out a role**. He always seems so perplexed about the chaos around him because he's not looking for a plot to follow...he just wants to live out his life in peace.

Even Donny's troubled relationship with Walter subtly hints at this: every time that Walter utters his famous line (*""Shut the fuck up, Donny!""*), it's because Donny says something that would be perfectly logical for a real person to say, but *illogical* for a character in a scripted film to say (e.g. pointing out something that the audience already knows, asking a question that the audience already knows the answer to, making a comment that breaks the flow of dialogue, etc.). Walter loses his temper whenever Donny says something that doesn't advance the plot...because Donny isn't aware that there *is* a plot. By constantly shushing him, Walter is trying to edit the movie while it's still happening.

At times, Walter comes as close to saying it as he possibly can without spelling it out in capital letters.

*""Forget it, Donny! You're out of your element!""*

*""You have no frame of reference here, Donny. You're like a child who wanders into the middle of a movie and wants to know...""*

There are other, subtler touches that further drive it home:

* Da Fino mistakes The Dude for a fellow detective, showing that he's also confused about the movie's genre.
* The Stranger is aware that he has a duty to introduce The Dude, but he frequently loses his train of thought...as if he's working with an incomplete script, and has to improvise some of his lines.
* The Stranger's opening question, ""What's a hero?"", is an acknowledgement of the fact that ""Hero"" is just a role in a story, and that anyone can assume that role.
* Arthur Digby Sellers' son Larry ignores Walter and The Dude when they try to interrogate him. As the son of a writer, he knows that fictional characters can't hurt him if he refuses to acknowledge them.
* Karl Hungus and his friends ""believe in nothing"" because they know that their world is a scripted fantasy.
* The role of pornography is an ironic joke. Characters in pornographic films have no existence or personality outside of their sex lives, just like the characters in this movie know nothing but their chosen roles.
* Walter throws Jeffrey Lebowski out of his wheelchair in an attempt to prove that he's not really a paraplegic, because he knows that he's just an actor pretending to be paraplegic.

But the event that **really** hammers it home is the death of Donny at the film's climax. Donny's death (via a random heart attack) is made all the more surreal by the fact that it violates almost every narrative rule in existence: it happens with no warning, it doesn't advance the plot, it's almost comically mundane, and it happens to the least significant character in the movie. That's because Donny's death is completely unscripted; it leads into the end of the movie because it throws the entire movie into disarray.

As bizarre as it may sound, Donny's death works very much like death does in real life. As in life, death often happens without warning, it's not always dramatic or meaningful, and it often compels us to mourn for people who we don't believe to be particularly significant to us.

Donny's funeral scene even hints at this. Walter finds himself at a loss for words when he attempts to eulogize Donny, because he knows nothing about him beyond his role in the plot. When pressed, the only fact that he can come up with is that he likes to surf. We don't see any of Donny's family at the funeral because, as a minor character, he has no existence beyond his limited role in the story. When giving his eulogy speech, Walter falls back on ranting about Vietnam because—given his role as ""haunted 'Nam veteran""—that's **the only thing that he knows**.

After the cruelly random death of a buddy, Walter and The Dude are finally forced to acknowledge the directionless nature of life in a scripted film, and they resolve to stop looking for a plot and start enjoying their time together. That's why they finally abandon the cloak-and-dagger shenanigans in the final scene and go off to enjoy another round of bowling together.

With his final speech, the Stranger assures us that The Dude's life *will* continue, even without an arbitrary plot to give him something to strive for. The Dude may not have an epic quest to undertake, and he may not have a villain to vanquish, but—like all of us—he has a life, and he can do nothing but live it. Hence, even after the story's over, life goes on. 

And The Dude abides.

**TL;DR**: Donny is the only character who doesn't act like he's from another genre, and he seems clueless because he isn't trying to resolve the plot. His death throws the movie into disarray because it's unscripted, and it forces Walter and The Dude to acknowledge that the plot has no real meaning.",FanTheories,1577

MasterStevans,2015-04-18 14:23:52+00:00,Interesting WWE PPV facts,"**WrestleMania I**  
    
  
* The event was viewed by over one million fans through closed-circuit television.  

* Moments before the event started, a group of Hell's Angels on Harley Davidson motorcycles managed to get past Madison Square Garden security, entering the backstage area through the loading dock, determined to see the show. Despite the event being completely sold out, WWF management accommodated their request, and brought in a few extra chairs for them.  
  
* WWF announcer 'Mean' Gene Okerlund volunteered to sing the United States national anthem, after the originally scheduled celebrity singer was a no-show.  
  
*   All in-ring performers for the main event have been inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.  
  
* On the original pay-per-view broadcast, Survivor's ""Eye Of The Tiger"" and Cyndi Lauper's ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" were used as the entrance themes for Hulk Hogan and Wendi Richter respectively. To avoid paying music royalties, WWE excluded these songs from all video and DVD releases of the event.  
  
* Future ECW and WWE wrestlers Tommy Dreamer and Nunzio were both in attendance.  
  
* This WrestleMania, so far, is the only WrestleMania not to feature a match with the WWF/E Championship on the line.  
  
* Vince McMahon originally wanted to call this show ""The Colossal Tussle"" before Howard Finkel came up with the name ""Wrestlemania"".  
  
* According to Hulk Hogan, Mr. T almost quit the show hours before show time. T was concerned that Piper and Paul Orndorff - who really disliked him - would take advantage of him and embarrass him. T then threatened to leave because security would not allow his entourage into the arena. Hogan convinced the security to allow all of T's friends in and made sure that T did not leave the building.  
  
* The match between King Kong Bundy and S.D. Jones is said to have set a record of 9 seconds for the shortest match in WWF history. However, the match, in real time, actually runs for at least 20 seconds.  
  
* There is a myth that Wrestlemania was originally going to be called Hulkamina (because the whole show was based around Hogan).  
  
* Wrestlemania was almost became a flop due to poor ticket sales until 7-10 days before the event.  
  
**WWF The Wrestling Classic**  
  
* This was the first WWE PPV to air nationally on pay-per-view. WrestleMania aired on pay-per-view only in selected areas.
  
  
**Wrestlemania II**  
  
* 250,000 PPV buys  

* Shortly after the previous year's WrestleMania, Vince McMahon secretly pitched an angle where 'Superfly' Jimmy Snuka would turn heel, starting a feud with Hulk Hogan that would culminate in a steel cage match between Hogan and Snuka at WrestleMania 2. Hogan declined, reportedly saying ""I don't want to wrestle with that crazy maniac."" Soon after, Snuka left the Federation in August 1985, and would not return to the company until WrestleMania V.  
  
* Roddy Piper said he considered his boxing match with Mr. T to be the worst match of his career.  
  
* The only WrestleMania event to be held on a Monday, instead of the traditional Sunday. It is also the only wrestling pay-per-view to emanate from three different venues on the same night.  
  
* The Hulk Hogan vs King Kong Bundy match is the only steel cage match in WrestleMania history.  
  
* Roddy Piper truly resented Mr. T because T was an actor with no wrestling ability. Their real-life dislike for each other was written into the show.  
  
* A couple of days prior to the event, Bobby Heenan was in a hospital in Tampa, Florida, having an MRI done. Heenan was discovered to have two fractured vertebrae, which doctors said would require two bone pieces to be taken from his hip and placed in his neck. The night before WrestleMania 2, WWF bookers told Heenan that if he didn't make it to Los Angeles for King Kong Bundy's main event match against Hulk Hogan, Heenan would be fired. In Heenan's words, ""I left the hospital, flew from Tampa to L.A., went to the ring, worked the match, took a bump for Hogan. After that, I immediately caught a Redeye back to Tampa, went back to the hospital, and they said, 'Where have you been?' and I said, 'I went to L.A. to wrestle.' They said, 'You're nuts!' I said, 'No, it's my neck.' So you have to do what you have to do sometimes.""    
  
* According to Roddy Piper on his podcast, Mr. T botched the finish of their match by completely missing what was supposed to be a knockout punch on Piper, who sold as planned by flying through the ropes to the outside, despite the punch not connecting at all. Having to improvise a new finish on the spot, an angry Hot Rod flung his corner stool at Mr. T, hitting the shocked ""A-Team"" actor with full force.
  
**Wrestlemania III**  
    
*  400,000  PPV buys

* Andre the Giant drank 14 bottles of wine before his main event match with Hulk Hogan.  
  
* In an effort to boost the live attendance numbers, the entire state of Michigan was excluded from pay-per-view access for this event.  
  
* Future WWE Champions Rob Van Dam and Kevin Nash were in attendance.  
  
* Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan was so sure Andre the Giant (whom he managed at the time) was going to beat Hulk Hogan for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship that he demanded to have a new world heavyweight title belt made that would fit Andre's waist. A belt was made (which accordingly cost $37,000 to make), and it was shown off a few times before Wrestlemania 3. That night, Hogan beat Andre to retain the title, so Andre never wore the new belt, and it was never shown again.  
  
* Aretha Franklin was stuck in traffic moments before WrestleMania III went on the air. Breaking free of the traffic jam, she rushed to the Pontiac Silverdome and performed ""America the Beautiful"" without a sound check.  
  
* In this event they claimed Andre had not lost in 15 years which is false, he had lost a number of times.  
  
* Although the match was billed as their first meeting, Andre The Giant and Hulk Hogan had faced off at Showdown at the Stadium, and had numerous matches in Japan. Hogan had also  bodyslamed Andre a number of time before their Wrestlemania III match.  
  
* Jimmy Hart's fear of Jake Roberts's snake was genuine. Hart was so afraid of having the snake put on him that Roberts had to really hold Hart down. Hart strained his neck.  
  
* Samantha Fox was originally supposed to hold the crown during the match between Junkyard Dog and Harley Race. But she cancelled for unknown reasons. She was replaced with The Fabulous Moolah.  
  
* The WWE has always listed the attendance for this show as 93,173, thereby making it the indoor attendance record for any sporting event in United States history. This figure is inflated, as the actual attendance for the show is somewhere around 78,000, which is still the attendance record for the Pontiac Silverdome. The actual biggest WWE attendance recorded is Wrestlemania 29 (80,676) followed by Summerslam 92 (80,355).  
  
**Survivor Series (1987)**    
  
* 325,000 PPV buys  

* This event aired on Thanksgiving, the same day that the NWA aired their annual ""Starrcade"" event. In order to increase their buy-rate, the WWE threatened that any Pay-Per-View provider that provided ""Starrcade"" instead of ""Survivor Series"" would not be allowed to air the upcoming ""WrestleMania"" event. WWE got 325,00 buys and JCP/NWA only got about 20,000 buys.  
  
**Wrestlemania IV**  
    
* 650,000 PPV buys  

* This WrestleMania featured 16 matches, making it the WrestleMania with the most matches.  
  
* Due to the length of the event, this was the only WrestleMania to appear on two VHS video cassette tapes.  
  
* Final WWF PPV appearance for Butch Reed, who left the WWF shortly after this event, upset that a promised feud with Randy Savage was canceled. He later joined the NWA (which would become WCW), and was vocally critical of the WWF and its booking of African American wrestlers.  
  
* Future WCW and WWE wrestler Chris Kanyon, future ECW, WCW and WWE wrestler Lance Storm and future ECW and WWE wrestler the Blue Meanie were in attendance.  
  
* Ted DiBiase was originally scheduled to win the WWF Championship Tournament. But when the Honky Tonk Man refused to lose his Intercontinental Championship to Randy Savage, Vince McMahon decided to appease the Macho Man by having Savage win the WWF Title. The Million Dollar Championship was created for Ted as a direct result of this.  
  
**Summerslam (1988)**  
    
* 500,000 PPV buys.  

* Brutus Beefcake was originally supposed to be the challenger for the Intercontinental Championship. He was attacked and had his head cut open by ""Outlaw"" Ron Bass's spur after a match on ""WWF Superstars of Wrestling."" This development came after boxes for the Coliseum Video VHS release were printed, on which Brutus appears as the named challenger to The Honky Tonk Man. A corrective sticker, declaring The Ultimate Warrior as challenger, was placed over Brutus' name. The main reason for the change to the match was because, according to an interview he conducted in 2005, Beefcake claimed that the Warrior threatened to leave the WWF if he didn't get the title shot, and so Beefcake stepped aside and made the best of it, which resulted in his storyline injury.  
  
**Survivor Series (1988)**    
  
* 310,000 PPV buys  
  
*  This was the only Survivor Series to feature Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels on the same team.
  
**Royal Rumble (1989)**  
  
* 165,000 PPV buys.  
  
* This was the first Royal Rumble on PPV, Royal Rumble in 1988 was TV special.  
  
* The 1989 Royal Rumble was expanded to 30 Superstars in the main event match even though The 1988 Royal Rumble had only 20 Superstars that previous year.  
  
**WrestleMania V**  
  
* 767,000 PPV buys  
  
* The Blue Blazer (Owen Hart) and Shawn Michaels made their  Wrestlemania debut.  
  
* Future WCW and WWE wrestler Chris Kanyon and future ECW, WCW and WWE wrestler Lance Storm were in attendance.  
  
* The Ultimate Warrior nearly seriously injured Bobby Heenan when he gorilla pressed him. Warrior did not bother to drop Heenan safely, instead simply letting him crash to the mat.

Existing facilities, corporate sponsorship (a fairly new model at the time), a Soviet boycott, a large population that went to the games, and converting the newly built facilities to other uses helped me LA such a success.  

After that, the IOC took a larger chunk of money from advertisement and as the Olympics became popular again, they had more power to make deals that benefited the IOC rather than the cities, so later Olympics seemed to make less on average if they made any at all.

wellyesofcourse,2015-03-18 13:45:41+00:00,/u/Antranik describes his four year journey battling the LA Parking Violations Bureau... which is actually owned by the Xerox Corporation and not the City of Los Angeles,,bestof,4767
Antranik,2015-03-17 17:41:58+00:00,TIL: The LA Parking Violations Bureau is actually run by Xerox. Jeff Galfer has spent 4 years trying to get a Class Action lawsuit started for us and has given up due to the threats from Xerox and the roadblocks run by judges with conflict of interests.,"Link is here and I think everybody here should read this: https://www.facebook.com/nomoretickets/posts/917361671637046?fref=nf&amp;pnref=story

&gt; FINAL UPDATE:

&gt; As you all know (at least many of you), I have been fighting this case since December of 2011 (when I received multiple late fees on a ticket I had appealed in August of 2011). When I didn't hear anything from my appeal and was still charged late fees, it was clear that something was going on with this institution. Over the years, we learned A LOT about how they run the parking bureau. We learned that Xerox is contracted by the city to run the entity known as the Los Angeles Parking Violations Bureau. We learned that Xerox not only collects the ticket money from you, but also decides whether or not you are guilty (during the initial review of the appeal's process). We learned that Xerox gets incentives for drawing out the time it takes to collect on tickets. We learned that Xerox was not paying for mail forwarding - meaning - if the ticket went to the wrong address, they really had no interest in making sure it got the right address. We learned that Xerox calls the shots and the City is really their monkey boy. The city is often times ignorant to the practices of Xerox.
&gt; 
&gt; After we filed the class action and went after them in court, we hit multiple patches of bad luck. Our first judge's husband worked for Xerox and had to resign from the case. The second judge we received firmly believed (out of the gate) that citizens should not attempt to interfere with corporate interest. To this day, we find no other reasoning in the judgement that can clarify his position - essentially that everyone in LA is negatively affected by this, but we are not allowed to collectively take a stand against them. We can only assume his bias is for that of corporation good, citizens secondary to the good the corporation brings to the City.
&gt; 
&gt; So, we were shot down left and right. When the time came to settle (to avoid a trial), we were able to get Xerox and the City of Los Angeles fighting against each other for the first time. Xerox was furious because it was the first time they were not calling the shots. Because of this, the first mediation collapsed and things were looking very good for us.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, in between the first and second mediation, the judge got very angry - at everyone. He was not happy for the way Xerox handled the first mediation, but he was very clear that he didn't want this to go to trial. So, he decided to make a bunch of summary judgments against us. Again, we couldn't (to this day) figure out why he did this. There was really no rational argument aside from he did not want this to go to trial and he had to stop us.
&gt; 
&gt; At that point, we lost ALL of our power. Last week, we decided to settle the case out of court. As much as I felt the case should go to trial, Xerox was very clear with their threats. If we went to trial, they told me they would sue me for ALL of their costs - essentially taking away everything I own and making me homeless. This was a clear and calculated threat and one that was used against me in order to get my lawyers to back down. And unfortunately, there was nothing I could do. This was not my fight any longer.
&gt; 
&gt; Having said that, some policy changes have been agreed to as part of this case. Here they are:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. They have done away with most of the policies that allow an automatic upholding of the ticket on initial review.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. You automatically receive a penalty waiver and late appeal if a notice is returned as undeliverable.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. The California court has now held in the other case that Xerox is not allowed to perform initial reviews. This is subject to a pending appeal.
&gt; 
&gt; The City, in response to our suit, made multiple policy changes. The critical issue of Xerox performing the initial review is now subject to an appeal in another case in California State Court. Essentially, a California judge said it is absolutely illegal for Xerox to run the appeal's process. Xerox appealed. And so it goes. Another waiting game.
&gt; 
&gt; At the end of the day, I tried. And I spent 4 years trying. And as of now, I'm leaving the fight.
&gt; 
&gt; If Xerox loses their state court appeal, I would suggest going after this individually. If you can prove there was malpractice here, you'll have a good chance to go after them then (when the state of California officially deems their place in the appeals process is illegal).
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you all for the support. I wish you the best of luck with your individual cases.
&gt; 
&gt; Onwards and Upwards,
&gt; 
&gt; Jeff

**History:**
-------------------------------------------------------------------


In order to bring the World Cup to the United States, the United States Soccer Federation agreed in 1988 to bring a new professional soccer league to the country. The league began play in 1996 with 10 teams in a season in which D.C. United won the opening title. ([Check out these hideous 1990's jerseys)](http://www.dcunited.com/sites/dc/files/image_nodes/2013/10/96mls_uniforms.jpg). The teams were:

* Colorado Rapids
* Columbus Crew
* D.C. United
* Dallas Burn (now F.C. Dallas)
* Kansas City Wiz (now Sporting Kansas City)
* Los Angeles Galaxy
* New England Revolution
* NY/NJ Metro Stars (sadly now New York Red Bulls)
* San Jose Clash (now San Jose Earthquakes)
* Tampa Bay Mutiny (notably owned by the Glazers who now own Man U)

The Chicago Fire joined the league in 1998 alongside the Miami Fusion in a season in which the Chicago newcomers won the MLS Cup as well as the US Open Cup. The following year (1999), Columbus opened their stadium, the first professional soccer-specific stadium in America, at a time when teams were sharing the facilities of other professional sports teams within America.

However, hard times fell on MLS in 2002 when the league was forced to fold Miami and Tampa Bay in order to save money, having lost an estimated $250 million in the league's first five years of existence. Despite this set back, the league continued to grow as Chivas USA and Real Salt Lake entered the league in 2005. In 2006, the San Jose Earthquakes relocated to Houston and were renamed Houston Dynamo.

In 2007, David Beckham shocked the American soccer world by arriving in LA. That same year, Toronto FC became the first Canadian team to enter the league. Their entrance more or less marked the beginning of supporters' culture within the league as the team played to a sold out crowd of passionate adults despite a lackluster performance on the field. 

San Jose re-entered the league in 2008, retaining the name and legacy of the previous San Jose Earthquakes. From this point on, MLS began expanding more rapidly into cities with ravenous soccer support. Seattle Sounders entered the league in 2009 and set a new standard for fan support with their legions of supporters. Philadelphia Union joined the following years and helped establish supporter culture on the East Coast through the rowdy supporters' group the Sons of Ben (SoBs). Portland Timbers and Vancouver Whitecaps joined in 2011, expanding the new supporters phenomena further while create a fierce rivalry with Seattle (the Cascadia Cup). Montreal Impact immediately followed in 2012.

The arrival of Clint Dempsey in 2013 marked the beginning of a major return of American players that includes Michael Bradley (Toronto), Jozy Altidore (Toronto), Maurice Edu (Philadelphia), Jermaine Jones (New England), DeMarcus Beasley (Houston), and several other national team players have returned to the league, with many in their prime.

In the world of expansions, New York City and Orlando City begin play this year and look set to raise the standards of expansion teams. New York City has brought in David Villa, Frank Lampard, and Mix Diskerud while Orlando has silently brought in a very solid team around playmaker Kaka. City brings unprecedented wealth to the league while Orlando seems set to have a great fan base and a strong Brazilian presence. On the flip side, Chivas USA folded this year after a tumultuous period in MLS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Future**
-------------------

As for the future, Atlanta and a new LA team are set to join the league in 2017 while Miami is a likely candidate to join shortly after. Sacramento and Minnesota are battling for the final expansion spot this round after unprecedented success in the lower leagues. San Antonio, Indianapolis, Las Vegas, and Jacksonville look set to battle it out for future expansion spots.

Now is a fantastic time to begin following the league as it continues to grow at an amazing rate.

------------------------------------------------------------------

**Current Format:**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MLS consists of 34 games run through the months of March to October. There are currently 20 teams that compete within the league (listed in the comments).

While there are several unique elements to MLS, I have highlighted only a couple of the unique elements. Oddities like allocation money, the Superdraft, and re-entry draft have a relative minor impact on games and can be learned about later. I'd rather keep things relatively simple for now.

**Salary Cap:** The Salary Cap is one of the most unique elements of American soccer. Compared to European sports where teams can spend relatively freely, this cap provides a maximum spending limit for teams ($3.1 million a year). The main reason this was put in place was to prevent the collapse of another American soccer league. Part of the downfall of the downfall of the North American Soccer League came teams drastically raising their spending on players to the point of financial collapse. With a cap in place, the league was able to ensure teams spend within their limits to ensure financial survival while also keeping down the price of player salaries.

In order to allow teams to grow and attract better talent, MLS passed the ""Beckham Rule"" in which teams can sign up to three designated players who contracts each exceed $350,000. This allows us to bring in big talent. There is the option for ""young designated players"" who are 23 or under.

The Players' Union and MLS are currently under negotiation for a new Collective Bargaining Agreement which will likely see a significant increase in the cap starting this year.

**Parity:**

The other major benefit of the salary cap is that it provides a form of parity not found in any of the other major leagues. Spain is primarily a contest between the top two teams with Atletico sneaking in occasionally. The EPL is a contest mostly between five teams. The Bundesliga has now entered an era of dominance by Bayern. 

Since MLS was founded in 1996, nine separate teams have won the MLS Cup. Only two teams (LA and D.C.) have won more than two titles. Within MLS, your team has a theoretically equal shot of winning the title as any other team within the league. In comparison to other leagues, you do not have to accept your team being forever midtable. D.C. United is the best example of this parity. In 2013, D.C. finished at the bottom of the table as by far the worst team in the league. The following year, United rebuilt heavily and finished on the top of the Eastern Conference.

**Conferences:** 

In MLS, teams are evenly split between the Eastern and Western conference. In any given season, you play each team from the opposite conference once and teams from your own conference either twice or three times. Due to the difficulties of travel, we do not have a balanced schedule. To put this into context, the distance between Vancouver, Canada and Orlando, Florida (the two furthest teams) is 4228.1 Kilometers. The distance from Dublin, Ireland, to Jerusalem is only 4080.8 Kilometers. A balanced schedule is difficult financially for teams and takes a physical toll on the players.

**Playoffs:** 

In MLS, winning the MLS Cup is seen as more prestigious than finishing first on the table (The Supporter's Shield.) Under the current format, the top 6 teams from each conference qualify for the playoffs. The playoffs can be thought of as an elimination tournament in which teams are still split between conference. The top two teams from each conference receive a ""bye"" - they are exempt from the first round of play and enter the tournament in the second round. 

The first round is a one game knockout round where the losers go home and the winners advance to face the two teams on ""bye."" 

The second round consists of two-legs much like traditional soccer tournaments. 

The two winners of the second round advance to the conference championship where they square off over two legs. 

The two conference winners then face off in the final for a single elimination match.

**Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup:** 

This tournament is named after Lamar Hunt, an owner who co-founded the North American Soccer League, was a charter investor of MLS, owned American sports teams in several leagues, and who founded and owned three MLS teams when the league began. He, also, financed the Columbus Crew's stadium, the first soccer-specific stadium built for professional soccer in America. Without his backing, MLS would never have taken off. In honor of this pioneer for American soccer, the United States Soccer Federation named the tournament and cup after him in 1999.

While MLS is a young league, many would be surprised how long the U.S. Open Cup has been in existence. This year marks the 102 year of existence for this cup. The tournament has seen several generations of American soccer dominance - from Bethlehem Steel (5 titles) in the 1910's to the Philadelphia Ukranians (4 wins) of the 1960's to the Seattle Sounders (4 wins) of the present. The tournament is open to all American teams -whether amateur, semi-pro, or professional- and the winner is guaranteed a spot in the CONCACAF Champion's League.

Note: Canadian teams do not take part in this. They compete in the The Voyageurs Cup.

**Trades:**

While transfers are the norm in the rest of the world, trades within MLS are far more common. A team may trade a player to another team for a draft pick, another player, a money, an international spot, or other incentives. The player rarely has a choice in a trade.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

F.A.Q.
--------

(I can update this with new questions.)

*Why is there no relegation/promotion?*

* Unfortunately, it is not economically feasible at present. The fear is that if a team gets relegated, fans will stop coming to matches, and the owner will fold the team. The average American sports fan is used to supporting the best teams in the world at their sport (NFL, MLB, NBA, etc.). We aren't at a point yet in popularity or financial stability where the risk of promotion/relegation is worth taking. I do hope to see it within a few decades.

*Why does MLS run spring to fall?*

* It's the same reason that Scandinavia runs spring to fall. The northern part of our country gets bombarded with snow in the winter unlike most of Europe. These past two weeks, my state got around 15 inches or so of snow. Even in March, a handful of MLS cities are still covered in snow. This would kill attendance. Plus, we don't want to compete against the NFL, NBA, and NHL (credit to /u/hatetom for this point).

*Isn't MLS a retirement league?*

* Not at all. Some teams rely on signing big named and old players. However, others are quietly bringing in young players. For example, my team (Philadelphia) signed a 23 year old Venezuelan striker on loan from France. Other teams like New England build their team around youth. Very few teams in MLS build around aging has-beens.

*The players are going to strike?*

* Players are seeking a raise in minimum wage ($36,500 a year) and free agency. Under MLS, players do not have the option to freely sign with any team they wish when without a contract. Plus, they can be traded against their will. These are the two major demands from players.

*Who plays possession football?*

* No team necessarily plays the heavy possession found in top European teams. However, Real Salt Lake, Portland, and New England focus on positive soccer that often relies heavily on possession. Off the top of my head, Vancouver, Seattle, and Dallas also play free-flowing soccer that is fun to watch.

*Who has the best youth systems?*

* I would give that to LA, Philadelphia, and Dallas. LA and Dallas have brought along a lot of good talent into their team through their academy. Gyasi Zardes, one of LA's top players, came through the academy and the team. Since Philly is only 6 years old, there has not been enough time to see the academy bear any fruit. However, the team has created proactive steps such as building a high school for their players to allow them to play more often. Plus, Rene Meulensteen was brought on in the short-term to, among other duties, assess the effectiveness of our academy.

*Who has the best fan support?*

* The obvious answer is Seattle with an average attendance of 43,734. However, they do benefit from playing in a football stadium with a capacity of 67,000 and being one of only two major sports teams in Seattle worth watching. Outside of Seattle, Portland, Kansas City, Toronto, and Philadelphia have absolutely fantastic support.

*How can I watch MLS?*

* MLS has a list of channels that broadcast games abroad [here.](http://www.mlssoccer.com/international-tv-listings) Otherwise, there are always streams.",soccer,3253

damselnmentldistress,2015-01-06 02:03:20+00:00,34 [F4M] Los Angeles - Seeking Practice Boyfriend,"DAMSEL IN (MENtal) DISTRESS SEEKING PRACTICE BOYFRIEND

Hi!  I’m hoping to find a single, 25-45 year-old male (actually, any gender will do) to be my practice boyfriend. Let me explain.  Someday I hope to have a healthy “real” relationship and am currently in intensive, expensive therapy to help with that.  My therapist suggested it would be easier to sharpen my shiny new relationship skills if I am actually in a relationship while under her supervision.  But I recently decided to get sober and, according to AA wisdom, I’m technically not supposed to date for a while.  A Catch 22. Luckily I’m a lawyer who loves to find (create?) loopholes, hence, this ad. 

What I Need From You:
&amp;nbsp;

* To go on 1-3 hour dates with me once or twice a week for a month, then suddenly start spending every waking moment with me so my therapist can work with me on slowing things down
&amp;nbsp;

* To text me on an inconsistent basis, with frequent one word, ambiguous replies to my heartfelt questions so I can practice managing the grave anxiety that causes me (bonus points if you use lots of emoticons)
&amp;nbsp;

* To reinforce my good behavior, so if I ask you to do something in a non-manipulative way, you have to do it
&amp;nbsp;

* To keep “secret” pics of your super hot ex-girlfriend in places I’m likely to find them, for exposure therapy purposes
&amp;nbsp;

* To be really affectionate with me in private, but then act cold and disinterested in public, and especially around your friends- Also be prepared to have multiple conversations about this
&amp;nbsp; 



What’s In It For You**:
&amp;nbsp;

* I will pay for 75% of the meals we have together (I need it to feel at least 25% voluntary)
&amp;nbsp;
  
* You’ll get to go to couples therapy on occasion
&amp;nbsp;
  
* I will put you on a pedestal and shower you with praises (until I demonize you – but hey, my therapist will be there to make sure I don’t rage too hard!)
&amp;nbsp;
 
* Great companionship for about 6 months (or, if you don’t think its great, then you’ll at least get an experience that makes your next relationship seem awesome)
&amp;nbsp;

* If you’ve been an asshole to women in the past, this will make up for some of your bad karma
&amp;nbsp;



A Little About Me:
&amp;nbsp;

* I’m 34, so closer to 20 than 50
&amp;nbsp;

* I’m a good mix of spice and nice, virtue and vice (and apparently can talk like Dr. Seuss, should that entice)
&amp;nbsp;
  
* I’m decently attractive…  I could probably lose 30 pounds, but I have really big boobs that still stick out farther than my paunch, so yay! 
&amp;nbsp;

* I have a rad Chihuahua that I like to dress up in mini sombreros and other outfits.  I once did an urban photo shoot with her in front of LA street art, and the pictures looked eerily similar to engagement photos
&amp;nbsp;

* I make 6 figures (most of which goes to therapy and school loans, though it makes living with my parents slightly less shameful – or maybe more)
&amp;nbsp;

* 80% of my ex-boyfriends have maintained friendships with me.  Only one tried to get a restraining order.
&amp;nbsp;

 

Who This May Appeal To:
&amp;nbsp;

* People past the age of 30 who have never had a girlfriend
&amp;nbsp;

* People from foreign countries who don’t understand American dating culture and have lost dates due to unintentional faux pas
&amp;nbsp;

* People with Asperger’s
&amp;nbsp;

* People who want to make an ex jealous***
&amp;nbsp;

* Mental health professionals who want to work overtime pro bono
&amp;nbsp;

* Compassionate folks who want to help a girl out
&amp;nbsp;

 

 
**Notice sex is not on here. But we can probably cuddle if you’ll be big spoon.
&amp;nbsp;
 
***Will likely only work if the ex is a more distressed damsel than me.

AMA!!!","My name is Nigel McGuinness. Well, at least that’s what I’ve been called for as long as I can remember, so we’ll stick with it. After graduating with a degree in chemistry I spent the majority of my adult life pursuing my childhood dream of being a professional wrestler. I had a modicum of success, wrestling all over the world and on national TV before a couple of tragic twists of fate spelled the end of my in ring career. I still do some commentary and match making for my home promotion Ring of Honor. I made a documentary about my retirement tour funded entirely through a Kickstarter project, and am now working on getting a new project funded called LA Fights, which is a six episode TV series completely evolving the professional wrestling genre influenced by mma. I live in Los Angeles, I surf, I do magic, I write a weekly blog and pay the bills as an assistant editor on the awesome hidden camera magic TV show on TruTV called “The Carbonaro Effect.”

KiltedCajun,2014-10-28 14:22:23+00:00,"BMW, Sprint, my car tuner, and myself all trying to troubleshoot an issue, while driving at highway speeds.","Just over a year ago, me and two of my friends made an attempt at breaking the Transcontinental driving record by driving from New York to Los Angeles in under 31 hours and 4 minutes. A few days before our attempt, we were shaking down the car (2010 BMW 335xi) and other systems, but we were running into issues with the fuel cutting out above 6000 RPM and getting a Check Engine Light, throwing the car into limp mode. The guy that built the piggy-back computer for the car is in California, the guy that knows my car is in Ohio, and we're driving through Virginia on our way to New York. 

We pulled a bunch of data from the car and had emailed it to the tuner and BMW. Both of them were curious to see what exactly the car looked like and acted like when it was happening, so we attempted to setup a GoToMeeting to be able to show them the computer and give them the opportunity to make changes on the fly. Well, that didn't work too well. Sprint's 4G service is spotty at best, and every time you hop towers, your IP changes, so it was causing issues with us staying connected.

Since I was in the passenger seat, I was able to VPN into my house from my phone and turn up a Juniper SA Virtual Machine I had, which allowed us to create a Secure Meeting, and I was in turn able to configure the SA to allow connections from multiple IP's so it wouldn't drop us off. Finally, after 30 minutes of messing around with it, we get it configured and setup so everyone can monitor the car between Roanoke, VA and Harrisonburg, VA. 

We've got the BMW guy and the Tuner on the handsfree in the car when my phone beeps, it's a Tier IV Sprint engineer calling me back. I conference him into our other call so he can follow along with us because he thought it was really cool what we were doing and so he could help if we ran into any issues with the network. 

I-81 was very empty that day, so we basically turned it into our own personal test track. We were making a lot of runs from 60-70 up to 110-120 to trigger the issue, the car guys were doing their best to figure out what the problem was, and the Sprint engineer was keeping an eye on usage on the towers we were going to be handing off on to inform us if we were going to have any issues with bandwidth or connectivity. We were waiting to make a change until we hit a tower that was nearly empty so we knew that if we had a problem, we could pull over right then and have enough bandwidth to pull down config files and everything else. 

We finally figure out what the issue is and made the changes to the piggy-back so it wouldn't happen again. After a few more runs to make sure it was cleared up, we ended the meeting. 10 minutes later the Sprint engineer calls me back to give me his personal cell phone number and to tell him that if we had any issues while on the run with the cellular network, to give him a call and he'd see what he could do. 

I was just looking over the data again from that run, including the stuff from the drive to New York, and it reminded me of just how weird it was to have that many people on a call troubleshooting a car that never dipped below 57 MPH the entire time, and the only reason we got down to 57 was to put the correct load on the engine. 

And just so you know, no... we didn't beat the record. One week after our run, another group of guys made an attempt and they did beat the record, which now stands at 28 hours 50 minutes. We only managed 31:17.",talesfromtechsupport,1382

After making the front page of TIL the other day, there were many who requested that I do an AMA, so here I am!  If you want to know a bit about me, here is a short bio:

Max Hardberger received his MFA in Fiction and Poetry from the University of Iowa before working a series of odd jobs including: English teacher, crop-duster, newspaper reporter, private investigator, and oilfield ""Mud Engineer"" in Guatemala during the Guatemalan Civil War. He currently works as a maritime lawyer, novelist, and vessel repossession specialist. In other words, he steals ships back that have been corruptly seized and hidden in seedy ports around the world and then returns them to their rightful owners. Max has been featured in interviews, articles, and book reviews by The Guardian, BBC News, Fox News, Men's Journal, NPR, and the Los Angeles Times. He has also had two separate television specials air about his exploits on The Learning Channel and American Heroes Channel.

Good morning! I'm making some overseas calls this morning but I'll be sure to answer all questions.",IAmA,1128
Jdcrunchman,2014-09-28 16:57:55+00:00,"I’m the person who showed Steve Jobs the blue box, I am Cap’n Crunch. Ask Me Anything!","Hi everyone,

My name is John Draper, you may also know me as Cap’n’Crunch. I’m ready for all your questions! 

Here's my proof: https://twitter.com/jdcrunchman/status/516269921005604864

Here’s a nice story about me:

The esquire article had come out,  and came to the attention of Woz, who contacted me through a trusted friend,  and he wanted me to show him how to use the blue box. His box was digital, but rock solid frequencies. I told him it would never work, but on some phones, the carbon mikes in the phone smoothed the waves so it would barely work, perhaps one time in 10. He wanted me to show him how to call the pope. After many tries,  we got the Vatican, it being 4:30 in the morning in Rome, he told them he was Henry Kissinger,  then the sec of State,  and wanted to confess.

I actually got busted because a careless friend who knew my phone number got busted for using the Woz box. My conditions for giving out my number, was that they had to memorize it,  no problem for blind people.  One such person Richard Ceasar violated my trust, which was during the time the federal government was raiding some of the phone phreaks they could catch,  but could never find me,  because there was no reference to me.  A big Grand jury investigation resulted from the Esquire article.  Woz's box set off all kinds of alarms in the 4A switch was how they busted Richard.

I had met Steve jobs many years before he started Apple. I was closer to Woz then jobs because Woz was an engineer, as I was. He actually got me an employee discount to the HP35 a post fix calculator I used in colleges when he was working for HP. I was the envy of my class at De Anza College in Cupertino where I was taking engineering courses.

This was after I showed Woz and jobs the blue box. Jobs stated there would be no Apple computer without the blue box, and this is true, because the initial money Woz needed came from selling them, which went into laying out and producing the printed circuit for the apple one.

Right after Woz developed the Apple one, I had to serve my time at Lompoc Federal prison. Lompoc was a minimum security facility located near Vandenberg Air Force Base. There were no fences or walls. But very clearly marked signs that said ""out of limits"". Before going in, I arranged a system for making free phone calls. That had to be arranged before actually getting to Lompoc. They only allowed collect calls, and no 800-number calls, and there wasn't even a dial on the phone. All I had to do was to call to a certain number that would ""except"" the call.

I had phone freaking classes in jail. They were disguised as electronic classes, right under the noses of the jailers. We had very little supervision from the jail guards. I had modified an FM radio that would tune into the guards frequencies, so I can tell when they were coming.

By the time I got out of Lompoc, Steve had just finished designing the Apple II.  It was a convention in Los Angeles where Steve was demonstrating the Apple II for the first time.  Steve invited me to join him at Apple. This was a time when you weren't really assigned a job, but you could pretty much work on what you wanted to work on, as long as it promoted and enhanced the sale of the main product. Woz suggested that I build a telephone interface to the Apple II. This was an era where smoking was permitted in the workplace. They set up an annex building near their main office where Steve, myself, Randy Wigginton, and a few others working on the Apple peripherals. I threw Mike Scott out of my office for smoking, he was CEO of Apple then.

The telephone interface board was called the Charlie board. It could send and receive  any tones, or tone pairs.    It also had software controls for controlling the hook switch, and other functions regarding controlling the telephone. Tones were generated in Software using a 256 byte sin table and tone tables defining the frequencies.

Steve Jobs decided not to market the board, because it could be used for ""illegal things"" because of it's high flexibility, but the main reason, was because it was illegal to connect directly to the telephone line. Company provided a ""interface device"" that would allow one to connect directly to the telephone. Rental of the device was $250 a month, and was unfeasible to require customers to use this. Expensive device for the phone board,  so it was never marketed. After I delivered the phone board to Woz, left a note on his desk with a cassette tape with the software, and asked him to try out. I wrote a simple interface program which would allow you to enter in a phone number and dial it. As a prank, Steve modified the program, to call Steve Job's home phone number over and over again and let it run all night.  I go into the office, and Steve really laid it on the thick and heavy. He then lit up a big fat cigar and puffed it in my face as revenge. I got so sick, I couldn't work for the rest of the day.

I went on to write EasyWriter, the WordPress program,  because I needed a program to write documentation to FORtH,  a language I was writing with the grace of the Forth Interest group and I as designated to write it for the Apple II. I was urged to market the word processor program. we couldn't copy the disks fast enough to keep up with the sales, and I was still in jail, at a Work Furlough program where they let me attend the Faire.  I wrote all of it while in in jail,  they would let me go to an office during the day under very close supervision,  and before going back to jail I would print a fresh copy of the source code (in FORTH) and study and modify the code at night. It was an ideal (but unorthodox) programming situation. I would go back and type in the modifications,  run it through this cool debugger I wrote. Then after testing,  I found very few bugs,  and started writing the next session,  and repeat until it was finished. I did it in 3 months of my 4 month stay at Alameda County Work furlough facility.

The word processor was very popular for the Apple II and made it's appearance at the 4th West coast computer faire. It made number two on the Soft Talk magazine hit parade. IBM started sneaking around, trying to locate software vendors to write a word processor for the IBM PC. They contacted Microsoft, and they contacted us. We beat out Bill Gates, and got out word processing program functioning much earlier than Microsoft, so IBM bundled EasyWriter with every IBM PC sold. There were some shady dealings with my publisher, which resulted in a lawsuit, and a major loss of my royalties.
 
I went off to do different things,  living off the royalties of EasyWriter Until IBM stopped publishing it.  Recently,  I learned I have a degenerative spine disease which was the main reason for my health issues,  I had one surgery in 2009 for my lower back,  another one in 2010 for me neck, and this most recent surgery took 9 hours where the doctors put 4 large screws in my spine.

Insurance company covered most of the expense,  but learned a lot of items I need for recovery are not covered and are fairly expensive.

My apologies if this goes against any admin rules, but I know Reddit does wonderful things.

My father, Jin S. Kang was last seen leaving my sister's apartment (his temporary residence) near the 400 block of Occidental, between 3rd St. and 6th St in Koreatown, LA on Friday, September 5th at around 11 am.

Weight: 142 lbs

Distinctive features: ""H"" tattoo on his left right finger, ""G-J"" tattoo on his right shoulder

Missing persons report has been filed:
Rampart LAPD: 213.484.3403
Case number: 140217024

Reward will be offered for any information that will help the police and my family track him down.

It's been over 35 hours since he left home. He didn't take his wallet, cell phone, or the house keys so we have no way of tracking him. He just moved to LA a few months ago for hospital treatment. 

Thank you

**Update #1:** Thank you for your support Los Angeles Redditors! I'm blown away by the support, thoughts, and love from my fair city.

My family is checking local Los Angeles area hospitals, morgues, and homeless shelters. We will check these locations again tomorrow.

No local hangouts: He's only been in Los Angeles for several months, mostly in hospitals and at my sister's place. He doesn't have any friends, but he did take occasional walks around 3rd St., Occidental Blvd., and 6th St. but could never get very far because of his weakened stated. He also doesn't drive.

Thank you thank you.

**Update #2:** Created the inevitable 'missing person' flyer. Thank you L.A.!
http://imgur.com/VK3WWIC (this is prettying freaking surreal).

**UPDATE #3!!:** Redditor ""2Days"" may have found my father on the corner on FAIRFAX. My sister and brother are headed there now. Will update!

**Update #4!!!:** CONFIRMED - MY FATHER HAS BEEN FOUND! Redditor ""2Days"" gets all the love and respect in the world. I can't say thank you enough!!!  

My dad traveled 5 miles west over the course of 48 hours without any money. He's extremely HUNGRY and didn't get much water so we are going to give him some medical attention, food, and water. I have a lot of questions, but for now I can only be relieved.

I want to thank EVERYONE in REDDIT/LOSANGELES for the amazing support I've received. Without YOUR up votes, without YOUR kindness, without YOUR actions, this would have never, ever happened. I have a newfound respect for anything and everything LA. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!

**Update #5** People have been PM'ing a bunch of questions and rather than replying individually, I'm putting it up here. 

**A.** **Why** **did** **your** **dad** **leave?** Depresssion? Alzheimer's? Drunk and confused? He hasn't said much but we are going to get him a full evaluation so it doesn't happen again. We've left him at home countless times because everyone in the family works. He does take small walks around the neighborhood and never expected him to land 5 miles west -- no car, not very mobile, no friends, no $$$

**B.** **Your** **dad** **is** **not** **malnourished!** OK, agreed, he was just hungry, tired, and sunburned. I've changed the main text to reflect this. I apologize for sensationalizing it.

**C.** 2Days is a hero. My dad didn't make an effort to even try to get back home and I would have NEVER thought to have looked to Fairfax Blvd. We looked all over KTown and DTLA

**D.** **What** **do** **the** **tattoos** **mean?** Tattoos were related to my dad's thuggish life growing up in post-Korean War South Korea. The letters have no meaning, other than that they were tied to an ""initiation"" process.

**D.** **Reward?!** Yes, I'm mailing him a snail mail check reward. **2Days** **refused**, but I'm sending it to him anyways. I'm also sharing the more intimate process of my dad's recovery w/ him through PMs.

***
**Kobe Bryant and the 40-mile bike ride**
***
Interesting tidbit from an article on the Clippers’ Blake Griffin, by ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne:

Blake Griffin needs to know if the story is true. Ever since he first heard it last July, he’s been obsessed with it.

""The first night we all got into Las Vegas last summer for the USA Basketball camp, I heard Kobe went on some 40-mile bike ride at night through the desert,"" Griffin says. ""Forty miles? At night?  You think it’s true?""

Before I can answer, Griffin continues:

""When I found out about that bike ride, I was so tempted to ask him if I could go next time.""

This is my favorite part about Kobe: you assume this story is true.  Forty miles in the desert?  You don’t even question it.

…in this moment, all Griffin wants to talk about is whether or not Kobe Bryant really got on a bike and rode 40 miles through the desert last July.

""I love that stuff,"" Griffin says. ""I love all those stories.""

The story Griffin heard turns out to be true. And it goes something like this: Bryant told his longtime trainer, Tim Grover, that he wanted to add in bike training to his summer conditioning. Grover researched a trail in Las Vegas, rented three bikes — one for Bryant, one for himself and one for Bryant’s security guard — and on the night before the first day of practice, they each put on headlamps and headed out to the trail and rode.

""We finished up around 2 a.m."" Grover said. ""And we were back in the gym working out by 7:30 in the morning.""

And that’s just it.  To Blake Griffin, and most of the NBA, these are just stories.

To Kobe Bryant, that’s a Tuesday night.
***
**He decided to lose 16 lbs for the Olympics in 2012**
***
Kobe has never been out of shape, but he decided to change himself as a precautionary measure. He told the Guardian:
""With summer basketball leading directly into the season — and I'm expecting to play until next June — I have to take some load off my knees. I've got to shave some of this weight.""
***
**He'd make high school teammates play one-on-one games to 100**
***
Kobe played a bench warmer to 100 multiple times when he was in high school.
In Kobe's worst game, he still won 100-12.
***
**He used to practice by himself without a ball, says Shaq**
***
Shaq wrote in his book:
""You'd walk in there and he'd be cutting and grunting and motioning like he was dribbling and shooting — except there was no ball. I thought it was weird, but I'm pretty sure it helped him.""
***
**He goes through super intense workouts on game days**
***
From ESPN's Rick Reilly:
""Among a dozen other drills, Bryant does suicide push-ups. At the top of the pushup, he launches himself off the mat so hard that both his feet come off the ground and his hands slap his pecs. He does three sets of seven of these. This makes me turn away and whimper softly.""
***
**He watches film of himself at halftime**
***
According to ESPN's Jackie McMullen in 2010:

""He often corrals teammates, fires up the laptop, and shows them precisely how they can carve out easier shots for themselves.""
***
**Caron Butler**
***
Caron Butler says he's grateful he spent a year in Los Angeles as Kobe Bryant's teammate and work out partner. 

""I say that's the best thing that ever could have happened for me personally for my career,"" Butler said. ""To play alongside a guy like that, see his preparation, see what it takes to get to that level, that's why I was able to be so good in Washington because I took everything I learned from him under his wing."" 

Butler played in 77 games in 2004-05 with the Lakers. He averaged a then career-high (by a tick) 15.5 points and then career-high 5.8 rebounds. His free throw shooting improved, too. 

""Work ethic,"" Butler said. ""He comes to the gym 6:30, 7 in the morning, gets shots every day, a rhythm. Afterward hits the weight room, works out in the summer, studying film, critiquing guys, watching their tendencies, picking things up ... Just studying the game with him taught me a lot."" 

Butler and Bryant talk every couple of weeks, and when Butler was traded to Dallas, Bryant was quick with a call. 

""He told me he was happy for me and happy to see me in a situation to be able to legitimately compete for a title,"" Butler said. 

But Wednesday will be a different conversation. 

""You always hear that he's ready to compete,"" Butler said. ""He's happy but at the same time once we get on the court all bets are off with Kobe. He's going to bring it, then hug me afterwards. That's how it is. It's business.""

""We had the day off, but they said we could get some shots up if we wanted, so I decided to head over to the gym with [Oklahoma City teammate] Jeff Green. 

""Kobe [Bryant] was the only guy on the bus to the gym, and that spoke volumes to me -- he's the best player in the game, yet he's always willing to come work on his game, so that kind of motivated me and Jeff,"" Durant said. ""He went by himself, he got a lot of shots up, and by the time he was done you could see he had gotten better over that hour. Like I said, it was a big inspiration to me and Jeff.""

He reported Thursday that he arrived at the gym early, early in the morning for a hard workout,but once inside, he discovered he wasn't alone. 

""3rd workout done. Let me tell why I LOVE KOBE JELLY BEAN BRYANT! I get to the gym at 6:45 am, the Black Mamba is there since 5:30! Go Lakers!!!""

“The first time I began to understand why he was the best was in the pre-season. In a game against the Wizards, Kobe broke the wrist on his shooting hand. He was always the first person to practice every day, arriving at least an hour and a half early. This would infuriate me because I wanted to be the first person to practice, just as I had always been at Villanova and Piscataway High in New Jersey. To add insult to injury, I lived only 10 minutes from the practice facility — while Kobe was at least 35 minutes away.

“I am ashamed to say that I was excited the day after his injury because I knew that there was no way that No. 8 (as former Laker point guard Tyronn Lue called him) would be the first to practice, if he would even be there at all.

“As I walked through the training room, I became stricken with fear when I heard a ball bouncing. No, no, it couldn’t be! Yes it could. Kobe was already in a full sweat with a cast on his right arm and dribbling and shooting with his left.”

“You know it was so funny, my first experience when I was out in LA, me and Kwame Brown got traded to the Lakers [in Summer of 2005]. We were playing a pick-up game before the season started, we were playing 3-on-3, and it was game point.

“Kobe had the ball and it came off, Kwame knocked the ball away from him.

“Again [this was] a pick-up game, September, nothing on the line. And the ball rolled to half court.

“Kobe then ran to half-court, dived under Kwame’s legs with the ball for about 10 feet, picked the ball up, came back down, made some incredible move, then hit the game-winning shot to end the pick-up game.

“I walked off the court, and I called my mom, and I said, “I think I’ve just seen the second best player ever [behind Jordan].”

“But then around him, you understand that nothing he does is by accident, that all this is a result of hours and hours and hours of preparation. So that when he gets into a situation in a game, in a playoffs game, in a Finals game, his confidence comes from his prepration.

“He once told me at a halftime of a game, he was struggling, I think we were playing Seattle [Sonics] and he was struggling, and I asked him, “How do you feel?” and he said, “I feel great! The second half… the second half. Hey Prof, I work too hard. These shots HAVE to fall eventually because I’ve worked too hard, I’ve shot too many shots.”

“So his belief in himself… when we look at it and see it as arrogance, some people see as may have too much confidence. It’s really just a result of how hard he works, of how much preparation time he puts in his game. That once he steps on the court, he really believes that he will be successful. And that’s what I think I took away from him more than anything else, it’s that your belief in yourself has to come from your confidence and your preparation.

A lot of ppl wondered why Bean spoke so highly of me last yr. First day of camp Mike Brown tried to throw me in the fire right away. Made me &amp; Bean 1 on 1 partners for the whole first practice. What Mike Brown didn’t know is that’s what I was waiting for. That whole day we went head up. At one point it damn near came to blows bc Bean will do anything for an edge. So he was elbowing me on the low for separation &amp; I couldn’t let that go as a competitor. As a man. The refs were too scared to call the foul bc he was intimidating them all practice. But at then end it was all love. The respect is mutual. Gave me some pointers that are priceless. It’s a misconception on Bean. Ppl think he’s a sucker…hard to play with. It’s just that he expects the most of his teammates bc he works so hard. Easily realist hooper I’ve met. He never lies and I respect that. #ClosestThingtoJordan #HeNeverSleepsEither#ImOut

**Robert (The USA Trainer)**

The night before the first scrimmage I remember I was just watched “Casablanca” for the first time and it was about 3:30 AM. I lay in bed, slowly fading away when I hear my cell ring. It was Kobe. I nervously picked up.

“Hey, uhh Rob, I hope I’m not disturbing anything right?”

“Uhh no, what’s up Kob?”

“Just wondering if you could just help me out with some conditioning work, that’s all.”

I checked my clock. 4:15 AM.

“Yeah sure, I’ll see you in the facility in a bit.”

It took me about twenty minutes to get my gear and out of the hotel. When I arrived and opened the room to the main practice floor I saw Kobe. Alone. He was drenched in sweat as if he had just taken a swim. It wasn’t even 5AM.

We did some conditioning work for the next hour and fifteen minutes. Then we entered the weight room, where he would do a multitude of strength training exercises for the next 45 minutes. After that we parted ways and he went back to the practice floor to shoot. I went back to the hotel and crashed. Wow.

I was expected to be at the floor again at about 11 AM. I woke up feeling sleepy, drowsy, and almost pretty much every side effect of sleep deprivation. Thanks, Kobe. I had a bagel and headed to the practice facility.

This next part I remember very vividly. All the Team USA players were there, feeling good for the first scrimmage. LeBron was talking to Carmelo if I remember correctly and Coach Krzyzewski was trying to explain something to Kevin Durant. On the right side of the practice facility was Kobe by himself shooting jumpers. And this is how our next conversation went — I went over to him, patted him on the back and said, “Good work this morning.”

“Huh?”

“Like, the conditioning. Good work.”

“Oh. Yeah, thanks Rob. I really appreciate it.”

“So when did you finish?”

“Finish what?”

“Getting your shots up. What time did you leave the facility?”

“Oh just now. I wanted 800 makes so yeah, just now.”

My jaw dropped. Mother of holy God. It was then that I realized that there’s no surprise to why he’s been as effective as he was last season. Every story about his dedication, every quote that he’s said about hard work all came together and hit me like a train. It’s no surprise to me now that he’s dunking on players ten years younger than him and it wasn’t a surprise to me earlier this year when he led the league in scoring.

**Excerpt from Shaq Uncut (/u/teenageboy69)**
***
""Kobe stands up and goes face-to-face with me and says, ""You always said you're my big brother, you'd do anything for me, and then this Colorado thing happens and you never even called me."" I did call him. ... So here we are now, and we find out he really was hurt that we didn't stand behind him. That was something new. I didn't think he gave a rat's ass about us either way. ""Well, I thought you'd publicly support me, at least,"" Kobe said. ""You're supposed to be my friend."" Brian Shaw chimed in with ""Kobe, why would you think that? Shaq had all these parties and you never showed up for any of them. We invited you to dinner on the road and you didn't come. Shaq invited you to his wedding and you weren't there. Then you got married and didn't invite any of us. And now you are in the middle of this problem, this sensitive situation, and now you want all of us to step up for you. We don't even know you."" ...

***
**Kobe Goes to the Movies (from Lee Jenkins/SI) (/u/ij_reilly)**
***
Years ago, upon returning from the horror flick Saw II, Bryant described for Lakers trainer Gary Vitti a scene in which a victim awakens to find a contraption locked around his neck lined with nails pointed at his head. A videotape explains that the victim can unlock the device with a key, but it has been surgically implanted behind his right eye, and he can only extract it with a scalpel. He has a minute before it closes over his face and kills him. ""I think I could get that key,"" Bryant said.
***
**SHAQ (/u/johnazoidberg-)**
***
He was so young and so immature in some ways, but I can tell you this: everything Kobe is doing now, he told me all the way back then he was going to do it. We were sitting on the bus once and he told me, ""I'm going to be the number one scorer for the Lakers, I'm going to win five or six championships, and I'm going to be the best player in the game."" I was like, ""Okay, whatever."" Then he looked me right in the eye and said, ""I'm going to be the Will Smith of the NBA.""
***
**Dawgs**
***
Kobe is a scientific dawg. He works out every day, practices every day. Most of the other stars are just dawgs, not scientific dawgs. 

Me, I’m a freak-of-nature dawg because of my size. LeBron could be a scientific dawg like Kobe, but he’s not, he's got a lot going on like I did, so that’s preventing him from being one. 
***
**The Pandas Friend**
***
What are your thoughts on Kobe? 

I thought you'd never ask. We'll be on the plane, playing cards. Kobe will walk up, stop the game and say, ""Ron, come to the back of the plane."" Then, he'll show me some tape and say, ""Look at this. Here's what you need to do."" I'll go back to my seat, and then he'll walk up to Shannon Brown, stop the card game and do the same thing. And it doesn't matter if you're sleeping. He'll wake you up and show you things you've never thought about. He puts so much time and passion into the game. I have no problem following somebody who's worth being followed, who works as hard as me. I will follow Kobe anywhere.

**First Half Match Updates**

**0'** [](//#whistle) The anthems are sung, and we're underway in a very wet Natal.

**3'** [](//#info) First half chance of the match and Aguilar crosses, it takes a deflection going off but isn't spotted. There is a very large Mexican presence in Natal and they can certainly be heard.

**9'** [](//#net) Hector Herrera has a shot from range and sends it over the bar.

**10'** [](//#net) Layun has had a bright start to the game and tries to cross for Peralta but N'Koulou intercepts the cross.

**12'** [](//#flag) Mexico have the ball in the net! However Dos Santos is adjudged to have been offside despite him not being offside. Very tight decision.

**15'** [](//#info) Cameroon have offered little in attack but they've earned a corner now.

**16'** [](//#flag) And Cameroon put the ball in the net, but as the ball is played back in, Cameroon were to slow to retreat despite them putting it into the net.

**22'** [](//#net) **POST!** - A great run from Assou-Ekotto down the left sees him cross it into the box for Eto'o who scuffs his shot into the ground and it bounces it up to hit the post.

**24'** [](//#net) An almighty scramble in the Mexico box. Moting watches the ball come all the way in from a long corner, and he fails to make solid contact, players then start to pile onto the ball from both teams, and Chedjou eventually fires the ball wide after beating 3 players on the edge of the box.

**27'** [](//#net) Free header for Mexico. Marquez nicks the ball away from Moreno behind him who would have surely have scored.

**30'** [](//#flag) Mexico have **another** goal disallowed. They have a corner and Moting flicks it on to Dos Santos at the back post who puts it into the net, however he is called offside. Very controversial. 

**42'** [](//#info) Pretty quiet for the last 10 minutes. 

**45'**[](//#flag) Peralta is given as offside after a superb cross from the right wing.

**45'** [](//#clock) 2 minutes added on. 

**HALF TIME - MEXICO 0 - 0 CAMEROON**

I live in Los Angeles, born in New Orleans, raised in West Virginia, and spent a good deal of time in New York doing theatre. You probably know me as Sam Merlotte in *True Blood*, and I'm really excited about *The Fault in our Stars,* which comes out in theaters June 6, and a small independent movie called *The Aftermath*, which I made last summer and which we're still putting the finishing touches on (you can help [support it here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1179859399/the-aftermath-starring-sam-trammell) ). 

I'm looking forward to taking your questions about everything from True Blood to stage acting to surfing - Victoria from reddit's going to be helping me with getting started today, so ask me anything!

https://twitter.com/SamTrammell/status/471413680957964289

Thanks so much everyone for submitting your questions. I have two little boys to feed now. So I have to go. Please go see The Fault in Our Stars June 6, and then True Blood starts a couple weeks later. And I look forward to coming back and talking this fall.",IAmA,2025

This isn't even including the [$2,644,678.00 in PAC spending](https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00248716&amp;cycle=2014) by Comcast so far this year.  [(Where that $2m went.)](https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgot.php?cmte=C00248716&amp;cycle=2014)  For an explanation on why this isn't corrupting and why money is speech and why corporations are people I would encourage you to look up Citizens United vs FEC, 2011.

If you want to get money out of politics you have some options for getting involved:

Getting money out of politics ([and why it's important that we do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5kHACjrdEY)):

 * [Move to Amend](https://www.movetoamend.org/)  *""We, the People of the United States of America, reject the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United and other related cases, and move to amend our Constitution to firmly establish that money is not speech, and that human beings, not corporations, are persons entitled to constitutional rights.*""

 * [Represent.us](https://represent.us/) seeks to pass a law ending corruption in politics by way of ""[The American Anti-Corruption Act](http://www.anticorruptionact.org/)"" which would end lobbying, mandate transparency for PACs and SuperPACs as well as imposing spending limits on political action committees.  (**Thanks to /u/Battlingdragon for the URL correction**)
 
Tracking money in politics:

 * [Open Secrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/)  *""OpenSecrets.org is your nonpartisan guide to money's influence on U.S. elections and public policy. Whether you're a voter, journalist, activist, student or interested citizen, use our free site to shine light on your government.""*
 
Electoral reform:

 * [FairVote.org](http://www.fairvote.org)  *""FairVote educates and empowers Americans to remove the structural barriers to achieving a representative democracy that respects every vote and every voice in every election.""*

------
I would suggest that you call up your representative and express your feelings on Net Neutrality (Even if your representative *isn't* on this list) and explain that you're a voter, you're politically active and how s/he votes and acts on Net Neutrality or the Comcast/TWC merger will effect your voting and donations in the future.

lukotheboss,2014-03-07 11:20:34+00:00,"Gonna fuck with me? Alright, that's cool. Meet Roxy.","This happened about a month ago. The neighbor kids were having a party down the road, which was a common occurrence. They are 8th graders, so they don't know how to... people yet. 

I arrive at my moms house coming from a visit from my university which is about an hour away. The kids notice this and start walking up my street, which is a cul-de-sac. They approach me, and my new car. They start making snide comments about how I have such a nice car, and how it would be so terrible to see something happen to it. I shrug it off, tell them to go back home, and go inside. The reason for my visit is because she hasn't been feeling well, so after coming inside I quickly go back outside to run to the store and lo and behold the kids are laying down in my lawn. They immediately run as soon as they hear the door. Now, I had been annoyed because of the Los Angeles traffic which I had been stuck in, so this was the last straw. I go back inside, wait for 10 minutes and then silently sneak out the back door with a leash for my 140lb Great Dane, Roxy. Now, Roxy wouldn't ever hurt a soul, but she loves to run. I walk through the side gate with her and peer over the gate. There they are. This is glorious. I let more of them accumulate and I burst through the gate, with Roxy right by my side. The look on their faces was absolutely *priceless.* We chase them down to the end of the street, which is only about 100 yards. 

I walk Roxy home, and then return to the kids house and ask for a parent. I explain the situation, which they are disgusted with. They call the other children's parents and they all go home.

All in all, it was a fun night. 

TL;DR: 8th graders be trippin in my yard, big dog be scary, mom gets soup. 

Edit: [here](http://imgur.com/AHgKhoz) is Roxy. She's laying down and stretching, this was the only photo my mom had of her on her phone. I'll take another when I go home tonight.

da_mOd,2012-12-22 20:18:49+00:00,Jarvan's Ultimate still bugged...Nobody cares :(,"Hey fellow summoners,

in may 2012 i opened a thread in the german lol forum(board?) in which i complained about several bugs Jarvans Ultimate has. Since his release he was my main but i stopped playing him, cause his ult feels very inconsistent when the enemy Riven just shield dashes out of it. (yeah screw you riven players....)

For all german speaking league players.
 Here is the thread with over 350 upvotes:
http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=691759

So Jarvan was released in April 2011. Since then his Ultimate had more Bugs than any other Skill in the  game.

So basically every Champion who ignores unit collision can walk through his Ultimate 
(i should say sometimes, or occasionally, sry)

That means: Fizz, Hecarim and every Champion who buys phantom dancers now -.- ლ(ಠ_ಠლ) 

Champions like Vayne and Riven who **CANNOT* dash or tumble through terrain do so vs Jarvan's Ultimate

BUT there is more ;)

3. Sometimes you press R and jump, but wait there is no Wall :O

4. Sometimes you press R and there is a Wall but Jarvan just thinks....
          hmmmmmmmmm....NOPE i don't want to jump (✌ﾟ∀ﾟ)☞

5. Sometimes you jump and create the wall (yeah that happens when you yell Demaciaaaaaa! at your pc) your Ult just does 0 dmg.

6. And sometimes your Ult works (pretty rare though)

And WHEN your ultimate finally works this happens...
http://elohell.net/images/chill/74803a8603670f9a38e6a85a063a7c17.gif

-----------------------------

So 350 Upvotes later and several attempts to contact Riot,
Zenon answers this in the german forum:

""There are european, north-american and korean pro-players, who play jarvan very successfully in the Jungle and/or on the toplane.
His Ultimate is very powerful. Our liveteam looks very closely to the statistics to recognize how good/balanced a champion really is. If Jarvan needs help we would have fixed him a long time ago.""


WTF ZENON. I MEAN WTF!??!??!?!?!
When i read this answer i literally wanted to slap Zenon in the face -.-

1 Year later and after the season 3 patch Riot introduced-----------------&gt;----- Wait for it------&gt;

Phantom dancers remake :D

This Itemchange is like kicking Jarvan in his manly testicles.
I really don't know if Riot even noticed that they spit Jarvan in the face and walk away while laughing at him and leaving him like that:
http://imgur.com/wE6W7  (Damn paint skills...)

So this is no QQ. I am just sad that Riot spits in Jarvan's face and they don't even notice that is Ultimate is useless cause it is working like the unit collision with minions.

Im really sorry for my english and my enunciation. But i am really getting mad cause i don't like spit in my face either and seeing Jarvan like that just makes me sad....

I hope Riot will change the way his Ultimate works.
Thank you for your attention.

**TL:DR:** Riot neutered Jarvan with the new season 3 patch (PD ignores unit collisions and several HoG nerfs, finally no HoG at all). Furthermore his cataclysm is the skill with so many bugs i stopped counting...



***Edit1:***

@Ezreal the designer of Jarvan: If you don't fix his ultimate and how it works i promise it to all Jarvan players out there. I will fly from Germany to Los Angeles and i will kick you in your balls, so that you feel what Jarvan feels for 15 months (sry for my language...) But seriously. Are you just too lazy to remake his ultimate? I am complaining about this for over a year now and i really think that Riot is just ignoring his screaming...**He is a prince! Riot should treat him like one.**

oceloteWorld,2012-10-09 02:54:22+00:00,Season 2 Finals personal experience: ocelote.,"Hey guys. Ocelote here from the hotel.

Ill be sincere letting you know that reading all the stuff im reading thru these days is making me not feel comfortable.
Community is missunderstanding everything quite a bit, and I would like to clear things out.

Some of us work hard, bringing a professional behaviour to the table, trying to reach the goal of making eSports something that everybody knows, talk about and even practice in a daily basis... And then? The catastrophe happens. Internet issues, discussions about some teams cheating, rumours surrounding us.... All this, killing the purpose of reaching professionalism. And all this, in the S2 Grand Finals. Disaster.

Im in eSports for quite long already, and thru these years I developed my knowledge in a way that I actually understand when, how and why things happen around Gaming, and thats why Ill give my honest oppinion about this topic:

1. First of all, I wanna make clear that no company behaved like Riot until now. They are giving everything for Gaming. They actually care about what people has to say, either proplayers, amateur or even casual ones.
2. No company put in practice the ideas Riot is bringing until now. Let's Open our eyes for a moment, do we realize where were the groupphase and brackets being hosted? We were right in the Stapples Center. One of the very most known and valuable places in California. Where Los Angeles Kings stadium (NHL), ESPN headquarters, Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers stadiums (NBA) are hosted. Near by Los Angeles Convention Center...
3. So much on the line.
5million prizepool year? Probably multiplied for Season3?
We are living a dream, we are living the beginning of the change.
4. The meta changes however the community wants to. As one of the most important reasons buffs/nerfs and changes are done is the feedback from the community.

When it comes down to this event:

1. Proplayers got treated extremely well. Before, meanwhile and after the games. We got everything covered, with a good hotel, good meals, cabs/shuttles, tickets to visit fun stuff, rioters taking care of us, chance to practice before playdays... Im pretty sure every professional competitor will agree with me on this one.
2. Remember when internet went down? Me, from a reliable source, can ensure u guys that the internet troubles were, not at all, Riot's fault. There was literally nothing Riot could have done better. But that's something Riot will never say. That's not the way they handle things. And that's definitely something laudable.
3. Remembering when internet went down again, it comes to my mind what Riot did. Instead of finding excuses to cover themselves, they rushed a way to make the customers happy. Ordered pizzas for everybody there, gaveout stuff and entertained the crowd however they could. (props aswell to every shoutcaster that was casting by then) Deman, Jatt, DJWheat; not counting Phreak, Rivington and Rachel.

About cheating:

1. Cant really blame players for using their senses in a moment when everything is on the line. (implying iG probably did it versus us). Nobody cant say ""I wouldnt do it"", cause even tho thinking about it with a cold mood u would never do it, who knows in a moment like that, where you just want to win. 
Im not defending them, im just saying that in those moments, when emotions make you shake, sometimes you can't even control yourself.
Lemme put it this way, If a football player had a chance to score a goal with his hand, wouldnt he do it?
He knows it's bad, and probably he woll blame himself afterwards, But in that moment, everything is engaged in a different way.
2. Riot commited the mistake of making able that to happen, but believe me,mthat wont be a problem in upcomming events. That mistake wont be repeated, for sure.

All these points are meaning that we should really lend a hand right now. Have patience, wait and see.

Grand Finals are soon, And I can put my hand on fire knowing that everything will run smooth. Be sure Riot won't commite twice the same mistake, ever.

Im not gonna be playing there, as u know already, as we got owned in groupphase by better teams. But Ill be watching the finals LIVE, as the respect for this sport and my opponents keep me here. So no, Im not gonna take the early flight and Im gonna make sure I enjoy one of the best shows in eSports, ever.

See you there.
ocelote.




TL;DR: lend a hand, Riot is doing good. Dont be so hard on them and help this to grow with positive feedback. Work together to make this grow. See u in the finals.

&gt;
&gt;It was the government’s second big raid in recent months after a similar investigation in May involving $452 million in possible fraud in Medicare, the health program for the elderly and disabled.
&gt;
&gt;The accusations include billing the government for unnecessary ambulance rides in California, writing prescriptions for patients in Dallas who did not qualify for them and paying kickbacks like food and cigarettes to patients in Houston if they attended programs for which a hospital could bill.
&gt;
&gt;**The investigation is part of an effort by the Obama administration to find health care savings.**

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/05/business/medicare-fraud-charged-against-91.html?src=recg
&gt;
&gt;Arrests were made in Houston, Dallas, Brooklyn, Baton Rouge, Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami. The largest crackdown occurred in South Florida where 33 people were rounded up and charged in connection with health care fraud cases totaling more than $230 million. In Texas, the president of Riverside General Hospital in Houston and his son were also charged.
&gt;
&gt;**Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius added that new provisions in President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act made it more difficult for fraud to be committed.**
&gt;
&gt;**This fraud sweep is the latest in a series of raids conducted since 2007 by the strike force. Over the past five years 1,480 suspects have been arrested in Medicare fraud cases totaling $4.8 billion dollars.**

Romney went way, way out of his way to go after PBS in his debate. Yet, as uber-liberal rag Forbes Magazine notes:
&gt;
&gt;For fiscal year 2010, federal funding for PBS through CPB accounted for about 12% of PBS’ revenue. In terms of dollars, that works out to about $300 million. There’s not much wiggle room to be had: the money that actually goes to CPB is split according to a mostly statutory formula. For 2015, Congress has budgeted $445 million for CPB. That’s less than 1% of the budget. Way less. It’s about 1/100th of a 1%.
&gt;
&gt;I’m not disparaging cutting waste: cutting waste is good. But with a deficit as large as the current one, if you’re going to focus on cuts, we should focus on real cuts. By the numbers, cutting funding for PBS won’t save the budget. Not by a long shot.

If the goal is for voters to get lost in sophistry and talking points spin, then Team Romney has done well. But when it comes to producing ACTUAL results, the $4.8 billion in fraud the Obama administration has cracked down on is FAR more impressive than the fear-mongering that Romney is doing over borrowing ""money from China "" in order to keep PBS going.

This is George Carlin as Cardinal Glick during the DOGMA shoot in Pittsburgh, circa 1998.

The first time I met George Carlin was May of 1997 at the Conan O'Brien show, back when they used to shoot it in New York City. I was there to promote CHASING AMY and when I found out Carlin was gonna be on the same show, I nearly shit myself. He'd always been a hero and a role model to me, so I brought a DOGMA script along in hopes of asking Curious George to play Cardinal Glick - the marketing maven behind the Buddy Christ. 

But shortly before the show, Brenda - George's wife of 36 years - lost her battle with liver caner. Ever the professional, George kept his Conan booking, but you could tell he was heartbroken. I didn't bug him with DOGMA that night.

I'd meet the master again a month later at the Four Seasons in Los Angeles. He'd already read DOGMA and we were grabbing lunch to talk about whether or not he wanted to be in it. He said he was into it but had one request.

George asked if Cardinal Glick could have a bandage on his finger, which would hide George Carlin's wedding band. Because, he said, he wasn't ready to take it off just yet.

Everyone in the world with the slightest interest in League of Legends should pay close attention to the matches happening next weekend in Los Angeles.  Pre-Season began in August 2011 at Gamescom, Cologne, Germany won by CLG Prime and completed with the Korean Regional Finals in Seoul, South Korea won by NaJin Sword last weekend.

It has been a long road and many air miles for all of the teams involved travelling the globe with almost every corner of the world represented.  Peoples lives will  have changed during this season and I can not express the excitement I feel for it, I may just be hyperventilating come day one.

[Hello](http://imgur.com/ixik6)

We're a group of friends born and raised in downtown Los Angeles.  We've always been big music fans trying to pursue our dreams.  It started out with working at record shops, to dj'ing clubs, and writing and producing mash up style tracks from our friend's bedroom.  We love that classic party hip hop from the Beastie Boys, Run DMC to 2 Live Crew... we also love house.  A few songs we've done are ""Like a G6"", ""Rocketeer"", ""Girls on the Dance Floor"", ""Live My Life"" and ""Turn Up The Love"".  Our online fam was really what made the dream come true, so we recently put together a music video featuring fan submissions from all around the world for ""Turn Up The Love"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQ97_vcsKuM

And oh yeah, we love that [Dirty Bass](http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/dirty-bass-deluxe-version/id530381880)

We've got the whole crew in the house - Kev Nish, Proghress, J-Splif and DJ Virman. We're going to be popping in and out throughout the day and answer as many questions as we can.  AMA!

duffmanhb,2012-09-07 06:44:51+00:00,"I'm a Republican, and I just need to rant. Feel free to downvote, I just need to type it out and post it somewhere.","I am... I'm not a fan of big government, telling me how to live my life. It's strange how far my party has gone. It's no longer the ""Republican party"" it's a different beast. Being a Republican isn't just about the government deregulating private business and lowering taxes for the wealthy, it's also about the Federal, and even state, government minding it's own business, and letting the people be truly free. This Republican party isn't for the people, because somehow they believe life is about purely economic growth and everything else shouldn't fall under the Republican umbrella.

Listen, I don't want it telling me to at what extent I can love someone. I don't want it telling me what I can do with my body. I don't want it telling me what faith I should follow. I don't want it telling me how to run my business. I don't want it to fight wars I don't want. I don't want recording every email I send. I don't want it watching every move I make, for my own protection. I don't want it telling me what days I am allowed to drink alcohol. Finally, I don't want it to tell me how late I can stay out in my backyard with my friends. I don't want any of it. 

These are basic Republican principles. Well, at least they were... As a west-coast Republican that moved further east, I found myself hiding the fact that I considered myself Republican. The type of Republican I saw outside of southern California, and all over the news today, is not the Republican I align with. This Republican party thinks all their problems can be solved through deregulation and lowering taxes. There is not a single ounce of human element in it. In fact, when it comes to social issues, they are the anti-thesis of Republican. They want control on people's lives, but less on the economy. After a lot of denial, I'm now realizing that the Republican party of today isn't representing the people of the USA as much as it's corporate interests. 

They don't no longer see the value in national goals, unless they have a direct private industry financial return. To them, now, they would be willing to close a museum because it's not turning a profit. Completely disregarding the benefit a museum offers it's community in the long run.

Two days ago, I was on the fence. I hated Ryan (as much as I hated Palin), but did like pre-campaign Romney (again, as much as I liked McCain). I know he was/is a liberal Republican, much like myself. I figured, he is just playing politics, and flip-flopping on his beliefs just for the campaign. I figured he would revert back to his core beliefs, and lead properly.

Today that all changed though. I'm confident I will be voting for the Obama ticket this year. It hit me like a ton of bricks when I compared the two audiences from the RNC and the DNC: The DNC really represented the average American across all spectrums, whereas, the NRC was clearly conservative white upper-middle class. These are the two differences in images they are trying to convey. One side is about concern for the entire country, while the other side is more concerned about a specific niche of the American population. 

Hmmm... That's about it. I just really had to rant about that. I'm so sick with the Republican party, I am praying there will be a divide in the party where I will no longer feel alienated on the national level. Today people's head explode when you say you are a liberal Republican, but forget that only 20 years ago, we elected a conservative Democrat. The two aren't mutually exclusive. But apparently it is now, and I hope that I can finally have a viable Republican candidate that doesn't feel like they have to conform to a specific, non-negotiable, party rule book. 

Okay, I'm done. Just ranting.

**EDIT: Okay, I feel like I need some clarification:**

On the 75 speed limit thing, since tons of you are dwelling on that one thing. The Federal government does regulate that, indirectly, the same way it regulates the drinking age. It withholds federal road funds that the state desperately needs to maintain the federally built roads. 

Obviously speed limits should be enforced, but to give a blanket speed limit is ridiculous. I'm confident the locals will know what is the best speed limit. Believe it or not, aside from the occasional asshole who really doesn't care about the speed limit any ways, people don't drive faster than they feel comfortable with. Also, I'll use the example of Las Vegas to Los Angeles. It's pretty much a straight line with a few people on the road. I think CA and NV would have a better idea of what the speed limit should be. 

It wasn't a great example, and in retrospect shouldn't have included it. I just got back from Las Vegas, so it's something that is fresh in my mind.

About the Libertarian thing: No, I'm not Libertarian.  I believe that we as a collective society can achieve great mutually beneficial things when we all come together. More than that, there are things an individual or small collective simply can not do, like landing on the moon. Libertarians rather leave this to the private sector. There are many things that the private sector simply can't do with it's limited capital, nor would want to do with it's capital.

Also, the Libertarians suggest simply suing another state when the other is poising the water supply that goes down stream. As we all know, courts can be tied up for decades before anything gets done. There obviously has to be a central power that controls those specific interstate issues (as our Fed was intended to focus on).


Also, no, I'm not Democrat. Being a rational liberal Republican doesn't make you a Democract, however, it could slightly be argued today that I could slightly be a Democrat thanks to the extreme right shift in our political spectrum. But at the end of the day, I do think Democrats do rely on the government more than necessary. 

One example, for the sake of brevity, is unions. Democrats love unions, but in today's day and age, they really do more harm than good, generally (there are exceptions Reddit, even though I know you hate when people speak in general terms). Unions have their place when a large chunk of the work force in an area relies on a single industry. Then, when whole economy of a town relies on a single company, it's easy for the corporation to abuse the workers rights, and gouge them, because the people have no other option for work. Here it makes sense. But in most cities, it does not, especially when there are a number of other options for employment. 

Take for example the police union. Why do they need a union? They do more harm then good, since a major part of their existence is to protect police, including ones that do wrong. They say, ""Hey, if you fuck up, we will do whatever we can to make sure you land on your feat."" Which is a leading reason why cops get away with what they do. The unions have a team of lawyers protecting them, ensuring they get paid leave, and doing their best to keep them on the job. The same goes with teachers unions. The unions do their best to keep bad teachers in school, and don't let the bad ones get weeded out. Ever know any one that works for a construction union? In some cases, the workers can't even touch certain things. So if they have to do something as simple as moving something small on the yard from A to B, they have to bring a guy over, he spends 15 minutes moving it, then goes home. He also get's paid for the entire day.

What do these two groups need protecting from? In most cases, they can find work elsewhere. If they want to do be a teacher or police officer, they should do their best to do a good job, and not rely on the union to protect their ass when they fuck up.

Another example, I don't agree with when it comes to Democrats, is the need for countless regulation. While good intentioned, the amount of increasing regulation and red tape continues to raise the barrier of entry as a small business owner. Today, it's incredibly expensive to start a company, compared to years before us. While I understand regulations can help, I do think many of them simply hurt small businesses and entrepreneurs, and the regulations should be more focused on big business that can afford it. 

Ask any one that started a business 30 years ago. You could work a summer, and with your saved up cash, could start yourself a viable small business. In this example, from a friend of mine,  was an auto body shop. We were talking about it a few weeks ago. We talked about how today, he would never be able to start that business which lead him to large amounts of wealth, because you'd need at least 200,000 dollars to just cut through the red tape, while being under the burden of high debt. 

This is another reason I'm losing hope the Republican party. They are for deregulation, but only deregulating big business, and not even caring about the vital small business. Small businesses are the ones that spur innovation, and create new competition. I highly doubt Apple would exist today if it had to cut through the amount of regulation and red tape of today. This goes for a lot of companies. Big business does benefit from deregulation, but not nearly as much as small business would. The party just likes to talk about small business, but doesn't actually do anything for them (unless of course, they arbitrarily get a benefit from a deregulation of a big business).

A year ago when a video I directed, [*Sexy Saxman*](http://youtu.be/mKSyPoxzT6w), was upvoted to the number-one spot on Reddit for a day, I was exhilarated! I had never thought millions of people would be into something I created. The next morning I figured it'd be business as usual, but thanks to all the love and attention my YouTube channel got, so many doors opened up for me. I was finally able to focus on my passion, which is directing music videos for my favorite artists, creating shorts, my own music, and eventually make a living off [my YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/mikediva).

I got a chance to collaborate on another video that got frontpaged, [DubStep Guns](http://youtu.be/hDlif8Km4S4), with my friends Corridor Digital.

I was also fortunate enough to direct commercials for [EA Sports](http://youtu.be/govyq9f2djo) and [CAPCOM](http://youtu.be/WFW9-b50GAk)

My [latest music video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVfU1DY73Tk) is for one of my favorite artists, Kill The Noise, on Skrillex's label, OWSLA. It took me four months to finish and holy shit, RollingStone reviewed the clip saying:

&gt; Diva's vision is a dystopian, zombie-filled future Los Angeles where gore and neon splatter the screen and a band of warriors embark on a video game-esque quest to kill the big bad guy – each of their blows in sync with the bass line.

As you can see I've been busy! I'm currently working on collaborations with Epic Meal Time, Smosh, and more!

I tested out of high school and joined the Army when I was 17. Two years later I was a machine gun team leader in an urban assault Stryker unit known as ""Bull Company."" We served a 15 month deployment from Aug 2007 to Nov 2008 as the only conventional task force running kill-or-capture raids in a district of Baghdad known as Sadr City. Our mission was to hunt down high value targets in the Mahdi Army and secure the north western flank of Sadr City from their influence.

On the 23rd of March one of the largest and bloodiest battles of the war broke out right there in Sadr City. The Mahdi Army rose up to overthrow the occupation. Our rules of engagement were lifted, and both sides went to town. Open street fighting lasted for nearly three months. Thousands of people were killed and wounded. That includes some two-hundred Americans and countless civilians - and it barely made a headline back here in the west.

At that point Iraq was considered ""old news"" and the politicians didn't want to talk about the war. 2008 was an election year so the ratings were more important than the truth. Both sides had something to lose if any word of battle made it home. The most attention it got back here was a 60 Minutes segment about high-tech UAV's - one which completely overlooked the actual fight. Other than that, were just a few back-page articles that never made it into print, and blog posts later on down the road as it solidified into a niche subject.

Instead, the biggest headlines that spring were the impending Twilight sequel, American Idol hiring a new judge, and Elliot Spitzer getting caught with a prostitute.

I recently wrote a book about my experience during the battle, and I've teamed up with some other vetsto get their stories out to the public. Together we're trying to raise awareness for what happened and some of my friends said an IAMA might help. While it would be totally cool if you want to head over to Kickstarter and pre-order a copy of the book, I'm not here to pull a Woody Harrelson. I just want to get the word out about what happened in Sadr City, help people get a more complete picture of what really happens ""on the ground"" during modern combat, and answer any questions you may have about... well... anything at all.

Answers to the five questions:

**How did the opportunity to meet M.J. come about?**

When I was thirteen, my stepdad's co-worker (at the Ultramar refinery in Wilmington, CA - though they may have been Diamond Shamrock back then, I can't remember when they changed names - and they ended up being Valero before he retired)/friend had a tragedy occur in his family. His young, mentally ill wife decided it'd be a great idea to toss her two young children off the side of a bridge, into the Los Angeles River, and then jump in herself. The youngest of the two boys, Craig, sadly didn't survive. Mikey did survive, as did his mother.

The story got a lot of media attention in Los Angeles and Michael Jackson requested to attend the funeral, was welcomed, and did attend. I attended, as well, since my stepdad was close to the kids' dad. Michael Jackson stood near my stepdad and I during the graveside service. I remember him being very thin and shorter than I had expected. He also smelled good, more manly that I'd expect. His voice was deeper and more ""normal"" than it was during interviews/public events.

http://www.scribd.com/doc/14283749/Michael-Jacksons-Humanitarian-Efforts-19792003

Several months later, he invited Michael Sr. (the kids' dad/my stepdad's friend &amp; co-worker) and his family &amp; friends to visit Neverland Ranch. My stepdad asked if I wanted to go and said I could bring a friend or two. I asked my best friend if she wanted to go with me and bring her younger sister (who was a year younger than us). Their parents said it'd be okay. (Her sister ended up not going, as she got sick the day before we went.) A couple weeks later, just before Thanksgiving, we went! 

**How long and how well did you know Michael?**

Didn't. Met briefly, as stated above. 

**Did he ever act inappropriately towards you?**

Nope, nor did he act inappropriately toward any of the kids who repeatedly went back to the ranch. He was also very kind, from what I heard, and never acted oddly.

**How did your parents feel about you hanging out with/meeting M.J?**

They thought it was a great opportunity and my stepdad actually accompanied me. Michael Jackson was not at the ranch while we visited, but it was during the time when he was married to Lisa Marie Presley. I remember a grey cat that was following me around and one of the staff members told me it was her cat. That was neat.

**What did you do while there?**

When we got there, the adults all had to sign consent forms and NDA paperwork. We had to check in all cameras (cell phones weren't prevalent in 1995) and recording devices. No pictures or recordings were to be taken on the grounds. So, unfortunately, I can't provide you with ~*awesome photographic proof~* or anything. Sorry.

We were all loaded on a tram and taken along a winding tree-lined road to the main house.

First, we took a mini-tour of the house (holy memorabilia and art collection, Batman!), rode the train around the grounds (we didn't get to go through ""the zoo"" area, but we did get to see an elephant getting a bath and see a staff member feed a giraffe from the train), spent time in the arcade before lunch (BBQ picnic out on the main lawn behind the house). 

After lunch we watched Ace Ventura 2 in the private movie theater (there was a private room with a bed and a couch that had a window into the theater, so a few of us older kids hung out in there, got bored and ended up wandering out to the rides), then we all rode the rides a lot (spent a lot of time on the bumper cars) before we got to raid the candy ""store"" and ""bakery"" building, where I got a bunch of suckers and cookies that were branded with the Neverland Ranch logo (see pictures). 

We were all taken in groups on tours of the house, while dinner was prepared. IT WAS AWESOME. I don't think I've ever seen so many video game cartridges in one area, outside of a game store. Like, seriously, an ENTIRE WALL FILLED. The entire group then had dinner in a formal dining area. I don't remember what we had, though. Spaghetti or something like that. 

After dinner, all the kids were given gifts. Younger kids were each given the new-at-the-time color-shell Gameboy and a few games, older kids were each given a top-of-the-line Sony Discman and a bunch of Michael Jackson CDs. My friend very humbly asked for a Gameboy for her little sister and they were happy to give her one and two games, which was very nice of the staff to oblige. 

We then took the tram back to the parking area and drove home. Many people were invited back multiple times after that, but I never went again, due to always being busy with school or extracurricular activities. It was fun, though, and I have fond memories of the day.

**FAQ:**
- Why didn't I eat the cookies? They're shortbread, I hate shortbread.    
- Where did he touch me? He didn't and molestation jokes are boring (especially after the first dozen).    
- Did I meet his kids? No, this was prior to the kids being born (1995).    
- How old was I? 14 at the funeral, 15 when I visited Neverland Ranch.    
- Did I spend the night? Nope.    
- Do I have more proof? Sorry, but due to the circumstances of the situation (NDAs, camera confiscation, etc.) you're gonna have to just enjoy the cookie pics &amp; the AMA or move on with your day :)

WinningNothing,2012-04-19 03:52:02+00:00,"For what it's worth, I ""won.""","Throwaway as my other account is capable of giving away my identity. 

I'll try to make this as short as possible. For the past 11 years, beginning two months after I graduated high school, I've worked for the same company. I busted my ass and worked my way up the proverbial ladder. Not so much to a powerful position, but to a more than just good paying position. 

I worked a sales position for a fairly large company, but one that also dealt with a very narrow vertical market. Throughout the 7 years in this position, I busted my ass. 100+ hour work weeks were common. I never made it back home to visit family during holidays during these years either. I was always too busy working. The only thing that padded this was the nice bonuses and commission that I regularly got, even though I was too busy to actually use it. 

Fast forward to a little less than a year ago. I was requested to drop everything during a sales integration project and head back to corp HQ. Thinking that I was about to close this project, they were lining up another one and hopefully giving me another raise/promotion. 

It was a Tuesday morning. Upon arriving to the office, I was ushered into the CEO's office. There waiting was the CEO, COO and CHRO (which I didn't even know existed. They sat me down and plopped a fairly thick binder in front of me. Inside of it were about 500 printed pages of miscellanious screenshots from my facebook, [/r/atheism](/r/atheism), misc atheism blogs etc etc. Basically anything atheistic was highlighted and notated. 

I was informed that ""several"" of my fellow employees, including my few superiors, did not feel safe or confident working with me any longer after they found out I was a ""threatening"" atheist. My employment with the company ended after about a half hour of discussion and me just being floored with everyones level of ignorance. There was no use battling stupidity here. Even worse, there was no severance. 

I spoke with a close lawyer friend back where I lived (Los Angeles) and ended up discussing my situation with all of the partners in his law firm. They thankfully took my discrimination and wrongful termination case. 

Turns out that one of my co-works who I was friends with on Facebook discovered my religious status as ""Atheist"" on facebook and started spreading the word. At some point (probably when my LCD died) IT installed ""SpectorSoft"" on my laptop which supposedly took screenshots based on keywords or specific times, catching all my pro-atheism related viewings. 

My then ex-company tried to settle outside of court. Most likely because they realized they uber-fucked up. They tried to play it off as my co-workers not feeling ""safe"" around me. I refused to settle and began burning up my savings on lawyer and court fees. 11 months later, after tons of deliberations, court dates, conference calls, recordings, etc. The court ruled in favor of me. I will be compensated very nicely and all my lawyer fees will be paid for by my ex company. Just in the nick of time for my birthday tomorrow. 

I still accidentally have the laptop they gave me last year. Not out of spite, I just forgot to return it. I'm thinking of flying out to the company's headquarters, renting a Ferrari and dropping the laptop off in person. 

Cheers to you /r/atheism. Unfortunately there's a decent amount of arrogance here, but its usually outweighed by logic and reasoning. Thanks for being there for me even when you didn't know I needed it. 

As for my future, I've actually been working with a large chunk of my old clients. They jumped ship from my old company after they found out I left. I'm working for myself now and it's going great so far.

TL;DR - Fired for being an atheist and making my bible belt coworkers ""afraid"" of me. After almost a year of legal mumbo jumbo, the court ruled in favor of me. I have lots of monies coming to me now.

HighTimesMag,2012-02-07 19:41:48+00:00,We Are the Staff of HIGH TIMES. AUsA!,"Hey everybody,

We are the editorial staff of HIGH TIMES magazine, bringers of the budflap, correspondents of cultivation and all things marijuana, and it's just swell to be traversing in this forest of fellow ents today to answer your questions.

After getting a few AMA requests, this seemed like a perfect opportunity to talk to you directly and also let you know what we've been up to lately. For starters, we just relaunched the magazine in January with a sweet new design (here's a preview of the April issue, which we're really psyched about: http://i.imgur.com/gi7aP.jpg), we recently got back from an *eventful* 24th Annual Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam, and now we're flying out and setting up for this weekend's 1st Annual High Times LA Medical Cannabis Cup, where California dispensaries, patients, national experts, celebs, and general proponents of pot like yourselves come together for the same cause. Also, the best medical marijuana strains are going toe to toe à la Amsterdam, Wiz Khalifa will be dropping by for a special honor, and some other notable friends of ours will be popping in too. (What's that, a link and promo code for the event? Why sure!: http://medcancup.com/los-angeles/buy-tickets/. Use the promo code 'REDDIT' for 10 percent off.)

Shoot us your most pressing cannabis questions, show us some pics of your grow, tell us what you think of the mag, of the culture, of the future of cannabis and what can be done to move closer to sensible policies in the U.S. and worldwide (marijuana has never been a more important issue than it is today). But more importantly, let's have some fun in 4:20 fashion.

We'll be back at Noon PST to start answering questions. Keep them coming!

EDIT: Senior editor Bobby Black, in his usual roguish ways, is answering from his account (bobbyblack420) as well.

FINAL EDIT: Thanks for a great AMA, guys. We'll be answering a few more but it looks like we've only got a couple more hours before we fall off the main pages. We enjoyed your questions and hope our answers were suited well to them. It looks like we're going to do this again sometime soon, andrewsmith1986 has asked us to do one on r/IAMA. It'll be interesting to talk to a wider audience that's not necessarily pro-pot, and flex some of that legalization debate muscle. We appreciate the uptokes and words of support. Please pick up or flip through an issue of the new relaunch, we worked hard on it and we'd love to see your ent-fluence permeate our pages. We are working hard to help the legalization front, and hope you'll stand by us in the process. Have a great week, and hope to see you in LA this weekend!",trees,1119

I just got back. AMA","Well the title is a bit misleading because I actually quit my CAREER, broke up with the girl I was going to MARRY (eventually), and then moved to a new city where I knew nobody except my roommate before I actually left.

On May 3rd I left Denver Union Station at around 7pm and returned July 4th around 2pm after traveling the entire US (north,south,east,west) via train and using couchsurfing.com for places to stay.  

I bought two Amtrak US Rail passes (45 day and 15 day) and planned each stop on my trip only a day or so in advance - and sometimes even from the station.  I traveled to Chicago, Milwaukee, Wausau, St. Paul, Seattle, Portland, San Fran, Los Angeles, Sante Fe, Kansas City, St. Louis, New Orleans, Atlanta, Washington D.C., and Boston.  I returned to Denver from Boston.

The whole trip I used a website called couchsurfing.com and never once had to pay for a hotel or hostel.  I stayed with a US diplomat on leave from Saudi Arabia, CEO of an insturance company, a forager, a Los Alamos nuclear physicist, a lobbyist, a retired bass player, a spiritual guru, a group of hippies... to name a few of the hosts I had the pleasure of staying with.  (It was fun talking about Wikileaks with the diplomat for sure)

Everyday I lived out of my suitcase and backpack.  Everyday I was somewhere new and meeting new people; people I had to stay with for long periods of time in some cases.  

During my trip I was almost mugged, had a knife pulled on me (separate incident), got tonsillitis, went sailing, fell in 'love', drank way too much in new orleans, drank just enough everywhere else (go local brewed), got lost in a swamp, got attacked by a cougar with loads of tequilla (not the animal hah) and more.

I've been back for a bit now and it is still VERY weird.  Nothing seems familiar and all the 'things' I once held dear to me now mean almost nothing.  In fact in the 7 days I've been back - this is my first time on the computer and the only thing I can think of is how weird this all feels.  In fact, in the two months I was gone it seemed like almost eight months - time slowed down in an extreme way.  My roommate said to me when I got back how quickly time had flown, and all I could think of was how I completely forgot what he looked like. 

If you have any questions about train travel in the US, couch surfing, or my trip AMA

EDIT - I'm 27/m

EDIT - As requested - http://i.imgur.com/O2AXL.jpg can I get a green circle of approval from a mod now? :D

EDIT - I'm sorry for all the good questions that I am missing :(  It's hard to get to all of them.  I click on the orangered and try to respond - sometimes I click away and then reddit is like ""good job you read all those now they are thrown into your dead pile"" and I have a new page.  If you really want me to answer something you can pm me or just delete your question and post it again.

Lastly - To everyone who's pm'd me saying all these really nice and genuine things - I sincerely appreciate it.  I'd like to give back to the community in anyway I can so if there is something you think I may be able to help you with - feel free to let me know in a PM and I'll get back to you in the morning.  To everyone else - I had fun answering your questions and I'll finish up some more in the morning before I'm shuffled into the archives ;D  GNight!

EDIT - This got crazy didn't it.  Never expected this much discussion and I'm really grateful to have been able to help you guys in any way that I could with your desire to travel - or questions about cs and amtrak.  For everyone that is calling me their hero and an inspiration - I sincerely thank you for the flattery - But I have to say it wasn't that you saw me as these things, it was that you saw a part of yourself in the decisions I made.  If you're not happy with your life and your situation, you have the power to change all of that by just making the choice to do so.  If you have any other questions just send me a pm - I'm so exhausted from sitting in front of my computer... it's been hard to sit on here for a long period of time after not being on in so long. 

I made a promise in some of my pm's and replies that I'd write out a book of my travels for you all and so that's what I am going to do... I just don't know quite how to do it. Expect it to be in the vein of an adventure tale, since that's what I enjoy writing in my spare time. Till then...

Thanks again everyone.

I created this subreddit [Onward](http://www.reddit.com/r/Onward)

This subreddit is merely a place where people can post their future travel plans and their reasoning behind it. It's a place for support for those who feel too timid about going out into the unknown, a place for congrats on those who managed to make the decision to do so, and a place where we can all be brought together in what is a combined human experience. Onward!

Edit: I think many people are missing the point. The point is that we don't want paid DLC that is going to split the community into groups of who does or does not have that DLC. You obviously can't join a server if its running a map you don't have. Bad Company 2 gave all its users the DLC for free. Now, I can see EAs reasoning about it from a console stand point (So that they still make a little money off of used games), but there is absolutely no reason for this on the PC. Obviously, you can't buy used PC games. EA, if you won't do this for everyone at LEAST do it for the PC community.

no1113,2011-04-03 07:45:15+00:00,IAMA person who gave a complete stranger CPR.  This is what happened after . . .,"I had an audition at a movie studio.  I showed up at one of the entrances to sign in.  There were numerous people in the small room I was in.  A lady walked toward the exit door to leave.  She went out of the door.  As she left, out of the corner of my eye, I saw her take a few stutter steps.  I turned toward her, she stuttered a little more, and then she fell face first into the concrete sidewalk without sticking her arms out to brace herself from the fall or anything.  A pool of blood started forming on the concrete underneath her face.  I looked around, and no one else had noticed that she fell.  I notified the guards that were there.  They looked at her bleeding on the ground, motionless, and said they weren't allowed to help her for ""liability reasons"".  I said ""WHAT!?""  I went down toward her and turned her over.  Her face was broken and a mask of blood from the impact of the fall upon the concrete.  I looked at her, and remember thinking to God ""Okay, God, if this is the moment you're going to pick to give me aids or some disease cuz I'm going to try to help this woman, then fuck you.  You're an asshole."" and I immediately started giving her mouth-to-mouth CPR - her blood all over her mouth and nose and everything.

I used to be a lifeguard, and had CPR training, but the intensity of the moment caused me to forget that, when giving someone CPR, you have to COVER THEIR NOSTRILS.  I opened her mouth, took a deep breath, and blew as hard as I could.  Because I wasn't covering her nose, however, the air I breathed into her mouth forced every bit of blood and mucus to gush out of her nose and into my face and mouth.  I spit out her blood from my mouth, covered her nostrils this time, and continued giving her mouth to mouth.  I alternated mouth to mouth with chest compressions until an ambulance arrived and they took over.

I called around and found out what hospital they had taken her to and showed up to see if I could talk to her and see how she was doing.

I was told she had died.  She did not make it.

I decided to leave my name and number in case any family called or came by for her so that they could at least possibly have some closure knowing what happened, and know that someone had tried to help her when she was in trouble.

I received a call from her family, and was invited to her memorial service.  I was honored to have been invited, and decided to attend.

They had the memorial at a silent movie venue - which was really very neat.  While there, various people went up and spoke about the lady and who she was - which I thought and felt was very fascinating to hear about the personality of this person whom I had never known.

After everyone had gone up and talked, the person overseeing the ceremony took a deep breath and said ""Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is the moment that will be the most difficult for all of us here.""

. . . and he went on to begin introducing ""the last person to see her alive . . . a stranger who saw another human being in need, and jumped to help . . . ""

Before I knew it, and totally unbeknownst to me, I was actually called up to the front of the stage to speak in front of everyone who was there - all the friends and family of the woman - and . . . and just . . . speak . . . talk about . . . something . . . 

I, of course, was at first at an immediate loss since I had no idea who the woman was.

She was older, but the photo on the pamphlet was of a very, very pretty lady - a beautiful face.

I started speaking about how ironic it is . . . that we live in such a huge, metropolitan city, with one of the biggest populations in the U.S. (Los Angeles), yet . . . for all the many people that are here . . . there is a LOT of anonymity . . . and people DON'T go out of their way to help one another . . . a huge paradox . . . So many people, yet we're all alone.

I didn't know the lady . . . but I felt connected to her . . . 

and as I started speaking about her . . . it was very, very strange, because up until that point, the ceremony had actually been quite joyous and happy and upbeat (everyone that went up and spoke about her mentioned how she was such a joyous person, so we should all celebrate this occasion and NOT be down about anything) . . . 

as I started speaking about this woman I had never before known, it was very weird because . . . I started feeling this incredible welling up of very real emotion coming up through me that, try as I did, I simply could not keep down . . . 

and I just started bawling in front of this entire group of strangers about a woman I had never met in my life before that time.

And the entire group . . . ended up bawling with me . . . 

I felt kind've . . . guilty I guess for kind've turning the entire ceremony from one of overall jubilation . . . to one of crying and heaviness (I tend to do that to most rooms I walk into it feels) . . . but . . . well . . .

I cannot say I wish I wouldn't have had that experience.

It helped me see (even more than I already do) that, for all the b.s. and horror and selfishness in our lives, on this planet . . . we are creatures with a lot of love . . . inside of us . . .

It seems difficult to show it and express it sometimes . . . but it's there.

Sorry for making this IAMA so long.  Didn't intend to.  Thank you for reading it.

**TL;DR - I gave CPR to a woman who I had never seen before in my life who fell near where I stood.  She died at the hospital after I tried to help her.  I was invited to an uplifting wake where many shared positive stories about her.  I was called up to share a few words and, when I started speaking about her, I ended up crying profusely and made everyone else there cry as well.  I still felt very honored to have been able to be there, however.""**",IAmA,1147
begreen123,2011-01-24 20:10:31+00:00,Six years ago my wife and I sold everything and bought a 90ft tunnel oven to make cookies. We're now shipping between 1 and 4 thousand pounds per week.  AMA,"I'm a business owner and entrepreneur and I haven't worked for someone else since I was 19. I'm doing this AMA so that I can answer any questions you may have about being in business or starting your own company.  The cookie business wasn't my first, nor most successful but it is the one I'm proudest of. Some background:

My adventures started when I was 6 with my own Fire Department in Cleveland, I would pull my red wagon up and down the street with a step ladder, fire extinguisher and garden hose looking for fire (until I got discouraged &amp; spent my time building forts). At 9 I ran a multi-route, paper route and hired other kids to deliver for me. By 19 I was eager to ""begin life"" and I dropped out of Bradley University in Peoria. Shortly after that I started my first ""real business"": it was a burglar alarm for apartments. I developed &amp; manufactured the product and sold them by hiring an off-duty detective from the local police force to give “security presentations” in luxury apartment buildings. We would use the party room, he would present statistics, speak about crime and the responsibility of protecting property and I would give a product demonstration and collect orders. A friend would go the next day and install the alarms. This worked out well as I had low overhead &amp; was making a good income.

Some amount of “beginners luck” helped me along the way, the first product that I ever developed with the intention of mass producing was chosen as one of the 100 most important products developed in the world the year that I developed it. This was in 1977, back in the “mechanical” age. Since then, I've developed impact recorders, mechanical accelerometers, temperature recorders to monitor the shipment of perishables, and a widely employed derailment detector to stop subway derailments before they become catastrophic. 

Currently I run a business that employs 30-40 people and we produce everything ""in-house"" near Los Angeles. We are selling high quality dog treat &amp; nutritional supplements in about 2,500-3,000 stores nationwide, a disposable poop scooper (we produce about 20 million annually) and the best chocolate chip cookies you'll ever eat which I started because I missed the 70's style cookies that made the original Famous Amos a Los Angeles sensation. My cookies are currently being sold in about 200 stores and we're shipping anywhere between 1,000 and 4,000 lbs per week.

Not directly business related but things you may find interesting. I was on “[What’s my Line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What's_My_Line%3F)” and got to hang out with [Soupy Sales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soupy_Sales) for an hour, I inspired a front page article in the New York Times regarding corruption and I've coached entrepreneurs &amp; spoken to groups when invited. I’ve been very fortunate in life &amp; see my overall purpose as propagating happiness through my cookies &amp; being of service to others, if I can contribute anything here feel free to ask. 

I've been very impressed with Reddit and the community and this inspired me to do an ""AMA"".  Hope you find it useful.

hobviously,2010-12-02 19:07:39+00:00,(Update) I am the guy who saved a lady from drowning and was then sued by her. Our case is to be tried on Judge Judy.,"First, very sorry for those who messaged me that I did not reply to. I have been very busy with work and family issues.

**[TL;DR of first post:](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ecphi/i_saved_a_girl_from_drowning_she_then_sued_me_ama/)** I am an excellent swimmer, I saved a lady from drowning and she later sued me for it. The case was thrown out but I still spent $3,500 in legal fees because of her. 

I want to say that after some discussion and thinking, our case will be tried on the television show Judge Judy. Me against her. Well, that's still not done for, she still needs to accept, but the person I talked to seemed very confident. 

When I posted my first Iama, a lot of people recommended that I take legal action against her. However, I really did not want to spend more money and time on it. Some people recommended small claims, but I still wasn't ready for it. However, this Iama did make me feel angry about the whole deal, an anger I hadn't given much thought to recently. Therefore, I decided to do something.

On monday, I filed the form on Judge Judy's website, never expecting to hear more about it. I filed in my details and wrote what happened. On tuesday, at 9AM, I received a phone call. He was working for the show and asked me how I was. He seemed quite excited. Then, he confirmed some of the details, making a few jokes and always being friendly, then asked me to summarize the case (again). I added some details, such as me being black and the lady white, and he seemed even more excited.

He asked me if I had filed a case in small claims, I told him I did not yet because I did not want to go through the trouble. When he asked why I waited so long to do something about it, I said I had decided not to sue because it was too much trouble, then decided to see whether small claims would be worth it. He said I had an excellent case and asked how much I would be suing her for. When I said $3,500, my legal fees, he said I should sue for $5,000, the maximum allowed, including $1,500 for defamation and my trouble. Then, he very quickly described the show. I have watched it often and knew most of it. Then, he told me they were interested in filming and diffusing the case. I said I was interested, but wasn't absolutely sure and had some doubts. He laughed some more, dismissing them one by one, then said:

""Here's how it works: you get $5,000 no matter what. No matter what happens, no matter if you win or lose, you get $5,000 from us. And you'll get the plane tickets back and forth, as well as two nights in a four-stars hotel in Los Angeles.""

I told him it was very generous and asked ""what the trap was"". He laughed again and told me there were ""no trap"", that he had read some more about my case from newspapers and that he was "" sure I would win my case in front of Judge Judy"". He then described how the show would work, then asked if I wanted to. I told him I did.

""Alright: here's what you're going to do. You need to file the case in small claims. Then, you need to serve her the paper. Use registered mail. In your case details, ask the full amount and be brief, but complete. Explain what happened. Then, serve her, and fax me a copy of the case's papers. After about ten business days, you will get some papers to sign and send back.""

""Okay, that's great, but what if she doesn't want to sign these papers and be on the show?""

""Oh believe me she will.""

""What if she doesn't want to?""

""She'll sign the papers. Believe me.""

We talked some more, he answered some more question I had (taping, time...) and then we hung up. I filed the case in small claims wednesday and mailed her a copy of the documents today (by the way, filing in small claims is much much easier than I expected and only took 20 minutes. The employees were very helpful as well). If she accepts, I expect that the case will be tried sometimes next year, for the next season of the show. Well, I did not think I would be on the show one day :).

I must admit I am quite nervous, but at the same tiem excited and, why not, about to make $5,000. So there it goes, thank you to everyone who encouraged me to sue and recommended small claims as a legal solution. I am still hoping very bad that she accepts, kind of afraid she doesn't, but even in that case, I have decided to take her to small claims anyway. I am decided!

There it goes, AMA!

**UPDATE 12/11** : We are officially going to be on Judge Judy. She accepted!",IAmA,1441
mcampbe,2010-04-11 19:48:56+00:00,"My brother saved a girl from a rapist last night, help me show him some respect.","He was a college football player and is a redditor. He is about 6'5 &amp; 220lb. He is currently at USC and was up studying late Saturday when he heard a scream outside his window. He ran out thinking he was going to break up a fight, but found a man on top of a woman in an alley. He chased down the man and thoroughly gave him a beating and waited for the police. 
My brother is a great guy and I thought since he frequents Reddit this would be a great way to show him my respect.
I am posting this from my phone, so please forgive any bad grammar.

edit: It looks like a lot of people think this is a attempt to troll, it is not and I'm not from 4chan. If you know how to find police reports I can give you the place, date, and time to verify I'm not trolling. My brother did a brave thing and I wanted him to see that people admired what he did. A friend of his died from a stab wound to the stomach in south padre island, TX doing a similar thing a couple of years ago, so I imagine it would take a lot of courage.

Hi, I am his brother Robert. I appreciate the upvotes and it was a really awesome experience to see this on the front page. Kinda takes the bitterness away from a nasty memory.
That being said if you have access to police reports I would love to know, not to disprove trolling accusations, but rather to make sure that that prick gets what he deserves.
Here are the details The crime occurred last night between 3-4 am. The area of arrest was veteran ave and regent st in Los Angeles Culver City area http://maps.google.com/maps?q=culver+city+ca&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Culver+City,+CA&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=KWzCS6_fHoeTnQeY1MXzCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=image&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CA4Q8gEwAAthe attacker was a 5'7'' hispanic man, drunk, possibly on drugs he was in the process of ripping off her clothes but was completely clothed when I came up and so I am sure that no rape occurred. I am thankful that several people came later to help me hold him down and call the cops and console the girl. I also realize I am extremely lucky that he didn't have a knife or gun. I do have to admit also that it was an amazing feeling to tackle that little pecker to the ground (being a washed up football player it felt a little too good). I have a ton of respect for cops bc it took everything I had to not beat the life outta that guy.
The arresting office was LAPD pacific area - I just called in to get info and they said that the guy is in jail and the DA is filing it under attempted rape and that I will be subpoenaed to court to testify. I asked for a report and he said they ""will make me privy to the report when it is available""
Let me know if you have better luck. Thanks Reddit, I appreciate the love.

edit 3: I don't understand why so many people have downvoted my brother's post. My brother didn't use excess force, he defended himself from someone that didn't want to be arrested for rape.
