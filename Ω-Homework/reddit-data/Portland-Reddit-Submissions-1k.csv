WinesburgOhio,2021-02-26 16:59:29+00:00,"You cannot imagine the relief I feel with my large, local bookstore (Powell's in Portland) opening up their 2nd floor today!","As an avid walker and reader who lives near Powell's in Portland, I used to regularly browse through that book store multiple times a week. There are plenty of other decent bookstores in the city, but Powell's simply has the best collection due to its tremendous size. 

Well they shut down on March 14, but they did reopen the 1st floor (*they have 3 floors*) a few months ago which was great. Plenty of precautions and whatnot, but it was wonderful to be back in there. The 1st floor, however, is about 1/3 a kids/YA section and the majority of the rest is fiction and gifts. As fun as it is to browse their fiction books, including their legendary sci-fi section, what I really longed for was the non-fiction sections on the 2nd floor. 

Yesterday Powell's announced their 2nd floor is opening up TODAY! It's a sense of relief and pure joy to be able to go back up there today. I just had to share this with some folks who would understand.

**EDIT:** Thank you, thank you, thank you for the huge support! I've never had a post take off like this, so all these upvotes and awards have been amazing. That being said, actually getting to hang out on the 2nd floor of Powell's on Friday afternoon was a far bigger highlight of my day!",books,6441

HasSomeSelfEsteem,2021-02-24 07:27:30+00:00,A Fallout game set in the Pacific Northwest would offer some terrain variety to a series overflowing with radioactive desert,"I hope you guys aren't sick of posts like this, because  my ideal fallout setting would be the Pacific Northwest. I think the PNW would be an interesting setting because it's so different from the landscapes we're accustomed to in the Fallout series. Rather than a vast empty desert upon which nothing grows, the wasteland of this game would be verdant forest teeming with mutant life. This landscape is inhospitable to humans, and as such what people remain stay close to cities. Large population centers, genuine cites, make up the vast majority of human settlement. In this fallout there are cities, and then there is wasteland, there is almost no non-urban human dwelling. What few towns fight through their daily hardships in the dense forests have become insular and entrenched in their strange ways, hostile to outlanders and making pacts with forces deep in the forest.

\*The Forest\* is the dominant wasteland terrain in this game, acting as the open desert in earlier instalments. The trees and soil are all irradiated, so that even being in these forests gives the player some dose of radiation. Because of this few venture into the woods, and few know what tread upon the glowing moss. The only true city in this part of the map is Victoria. Once a thriving trade community, Victoria has gone silent. No one knows what has become of Victoria or her people, but the answers may be borne on the voices that carry through the trees. The most dangerous part of the game world, comparable to FO4's Glowing Sea, is the Olympic Peninsula. Already intensely rugged before the war, \*the peninsula\* is a hostile land of nuclear jungle and otherworldly forces. Among the high peaks, and in the deep glens, bizarre and terrible monsters tread, and to venture there is a fools errand.

While the west of the map is dominated by inhospitable wilderness, the east of the map is where the cities of game lay. A part of Fallout I've always loved is that the communities feel like places people actually live in. People go to bars, eat in restaurants, and generally do more than just survive. In the far south of the map we have Portland. Portland is the largest of the Oregon city states, many of whom have already joined the NCR. Portland's status as an independent entity is contentious, as many see joining the NCR to be the surest route to true security. North of Portland we have Cascadia, a lose confederation made up of the cities of Tacoma, Everett, and Seattle. This confederacy is loosely connected politically, but pools its resources towards a singular navy. This navy's main purpose is to repel the pirate attacks which originate from the lawless islands of Puget Sound, mainly the San Juan Islands. In the far north of the map there is Vancouver, a ghost city razed by the United States during the annexation of Canada. The remnants of the Washington state ferry system make up an essential part of the Cascadian economy. Transportation via these ferries is much more efficient than driving caravans along broken roads, but is also more dangerous. These massive boats act as both cargo ship and dreadnought.

I'm unsure what the central conflict would be, but I think the general world is  fun and weird in a way that works well with the grim setting of Fallout. I think some a dense forest would be a welcome change after a series that has fixated on sand.

And if for no other reason, radioactive orcas eating you if you're stupid enough to fall off the boat.",Fallout,2637

NachoPichu,2021-02-04 00:38:55+00:00,Human remains identified after 42 years as Portland man,"Pretty cool story out of Portland, OR. Another win for DNA through geneology.

PORTLAND, Ore. — After more than 40 years of questions, a set of human remains now has an identity, the Oregon State Police announced on Wednesday.

""The unidentified has been identified,"" authorities said in a Facebook Post that detailed the cold case.

The skeletal remains of a man that were first discovered by hikers at the bottom of Multnomah Falls in September of 1979 have now been identified as that of Freeman Asher Jr.

Police say the relatives of Asher have been notified of the discovery and they are working on releasing his remains to their care.

According to police, a few possessions were found that day on September 14th as well, including clothing, eyeglasses, and hair that authorities said indicated the person ""may have been of African American biological origin."" An anthropologist with the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. analyzed the remains that year.

However, it would be more than two decades before they were re-examined in 2006. Four years later, in 2010, a DNA sample was uploaded to the CODIS database, though it never yielded a match with a missing persons case. Following that, a Clackamas County forensic artist created a composite drawing that included the personal items that were found at Multnomah Falls.

A grant awarded to OSP in 2018 allowed the agency to perform ""innovative DNA techniques on unsolved unidentified skeletal remains cases."" Two years later, a DNA Phenotyping and Genetic Genealogy report listed a possible name for the remains found -- Freeman Asher Jr.

Police say he still had relatives in Portland and was thought to have moved to the city around 1976. Through extensive interviews and a search for relatives, police learned that Asher disappeared and was presumed dead by most of his family.

A sister of Asher's in California agreed to a DNA test for comparison, and with the sibling relationship genetically confirmed, authorities were finally able to properly identify the remains on January 29, 2021.

""We are dedicated to solving the unsolved and bringing closure to families’ missing a loved one. The unidentified will never be forgotten,"" said OSP in a statement on the case.

State police said multiple agencies worked together to make the identification, including the Oregon State Medical Examiner’s Office, Smithsonian Institute, Clackamas County Sheriff's Office, Multnomah County Sheriff's Office, Portland Police Bureau, Parabon Nanolabs and San Fernando Police Department.

Loganach,2020-11-16 18:52:50+00:00,My ex-housemate was potentially a serial killer...,"This is a convoluted story, so bare with me as I try to convey everything I can recall about what led me to the conclusion that me ex housemate could have potentially been a serial killer, or serial killer in the making...  


It was the summer of 2015 when I moved in, and at first appearances my housemate/landlord Mike was somewhat normal, if not a bit socially awkward and dysfunctional. When I was signing the papers he was adamant that I should never go into the basement; which I thought was odd, but I really needed a place to stay, and, well, people have their little quirks, so I just chalked it up to that at the time.  


As I got to know Mike, and our cohabitation continued, I learned more about the depths of his dysfunction... firstly that he used Meth; now I don't automatically judge people based on vices, but I was surprised at the extent of his use. He was probably the first person I knew who used Meth and balanced a full time job, enjoyed a decent amount of success... The reason this is important to the story is that when he would be around the house, drinking and using Meth, he would start to run off at the mouth. He would often ""joke"" that if I smelled Lye coming from the basement, not to think anything of it. I think it was probably the third time he said this that I asked why he keeps saying that, and he said ""I use chemicals to clean up after the bodies"" with a wiley grin on his face. I tried to chalk that up to a bad sense of humor, but it didn't sit right with me. He was also very particular that I let him know of my coming and going, and my work schedule... I remember him being shocked and uncomfortable one day that I ended up taking off of work, because he didn't realize that I was home. I remember that day because there was a lot of clanging, and what sounded like muffled shouting coming from the basement, his car was in the driveway, but he was not in the main house or his bedroom. Other days he would play very loud music that bumped through the whole house, sometimes he would even play NPR talk radio at those volumes... in retrospect I think he may have been trying to mask sounds. He would make remarks about sex workers, saying ""You can do whatever you want, you can choke them or beat them to death and nobody cares""-- I took exception to this, I told him I thought that was messed up... but when he would get tweaking, he'd always come back around to alluding to the same kind of violence, talking about how he was a normal white guy who owned a house and had a good career, so the police would never suspect him. At this point, I start to think that it has gone too far to simply be a joke. I was in a weird position, because money was tight at the time and my options were few. I tried to convince myself that even if he is messed up, he is probably just engaging in outward fantasism... I knew that he would acquire the services of sex workers on occasion, but again, did not judge that activity at face value, but started becoming concerned...  


Then, at one point when I was doing laundry; I caught whiffs of decomposition... The house we were in was in SouthEast Portland, it was relatively new, having grown up in Upstate, NY, I know that animals can be trapped in walls and die, but this was the garage, and there was no animals scurrying in the walls... This was strange, and telling to me. I considered carefully what I would do, and decided I would confront him about the smell... I decided to poise the question in a somewhat suggestive way, by expanding on his ""jokes""-- I told him that he needs to do a better job cleaning up the bodies because I smelled decomposition from the garage. I will never forget his reaction, his eyes widened, and he shot me a sharp glare... somewhere between fear and anger... he stumbled over his words and eventually responded ""What? Really?"" I said yes, really.. and there was a few seconds of awkwardness before he said ""Thanks for letting me know"" and promptly went into his bedroom and shut the door. a few days after that he went into the upper crawlspace in the garage one day, while I was again doing laundry... he called for me and was trying to convince me to come up into the crawlspace... my body locked up and it was like my instincts were screaming at me that if I went up there I would not come back down, I gave some excuse that I can sparsely remember that I had to be someplace, packed up my laundry, threw it in my room, and left.  


He spent a lot of time in the padlocked basement without a doorknob, the only way in was thru the backyard, I wish I would have gone down there in retrospect, to either confirm or dismiss the suspicions once and for all. In the last couple months I had lived there I was privy to more graphic comments about women, and sex workers, explicit talk of sexual violence, and he was using more and more... He once showed me a video he made (he is a graphic designer and artist as well) which featured heavy bondage themes, interspersed with distorted audio of women screaming, and this strange leering figure in a Plague Doctor costume... It was one of those situations where any one of these things alone may be innocuous, but as they accumulated it became suspicious to me.  


It was October of 2016 that I left there, taking off to Oceti Oyate camp during the Anti-Pipeline protests with Standing Rock Lakota... A mix of feeling called to action and having nothing to lose, as I wanted to get out of that house in the worst way. My last night there (I did not give notice that I was leaving) he was drinking and tweaking again... started in on the same conversation, loosely describing murder and sexual violence in the tone of some sort of edgy joke ... I told him he would be caught eventually, not even holding back my suspicion anymore... He reiterated that he was the last person police would suspect, and asserted that they wouldn't catch him. He said this in a very serious and concise way, dropping the pretense he had been using before. I left the next morning...  


This haunted me for months, then a year, then a year and a half... I felt as though I hadn't done anything, the guilt was eating away at me, so I called Portland Crime Stoppers, and put in an anonymous tip describing what I had described here... When I did, the operator started going back and forth putting me on hold because the call had piqued the interest of the police Sgt who was assigned to the call center, so they were asking me detailed questions about his vehicle, his house, the methods he described, etc... it seemed like they took interest. I gave them as much information as I could remember, and left it at that, feeling just a little better that I had at least tried to do something about it...  


Fast forward to recent times, I told my mother about all of this, and she became interested, asking what house this was, and she ended up pulling it up on GMaps, she put up the street view, and I noticed that there was a large enclosed trailer in the driveway that wasn't there when I was, I could theorize why it might have been there, but cannot put together a practical reason for it, or why he'd be using it, unless he was moving or using it to haul things to discard. Admittedly that is pure conjecture, but I couldn't help but wonder... I doubt that I will get closure, or have my suspicions validated unless he does finally get caught and arrested, and I read about it. I have grown up poor, and been around the low-life a lot.

I ended my post by saying “learn to listen”. This also applies to me. I am trying my best to listen so thank you all for speaking.

I have been attending protest since the beginning of June. Last nights protest felt different to me and I felt like there was a crowed of white people ignoring the voice of the black speakers. This was incorrect. 

I’m working to write a better post but need some time, so for now I’m giving this short edit just to get it out now since my post is trending. I apologies. I HIGHLY SUGGEST you read the comment I have linked for better insight.

Herod kept pacing back and forth in his little digital space. He stalked across the wet sand, kicking pebbles and shells and tiny chunks of Lossglass back into the stormy ocean as he walked up and down the beach between two massive chunks of jagged rock that hid the cliffside beach from sight. He kept going over and over in his mind the problem.

They'd done something weird, those ancient scientists. They'd taken the particles they'd known about, taken the subatomic particles they had discovered, and somehow *twisted* them to do what they needed them to do to make the impossible happen.

He knew the information was all right there. That he had all the clues. He had all the information, he had all the data the ancients had possessed. Hell, he had MORE then they had possessed.

But like Victor told him, just because you have the lime, the stone, and the ash, doesn't mean you know how to make concrete that endures seawater. Sure, you know how to make modern Portland Concrete, but now make the older stuff that can even take a railgun round or two.

It was driving him crazy. He'd examined the repeater over and over and over. They had one that as soon as it was turned on it synched up and immediately started moving volumes of traffic. Whole petabytes a millisecond of data just streaming in and out.

But that was the problem.

He couldn't see what was streaming in and out. The data stream, whatever made it up, was as invisible to all of his instruments as radio waves were to the human eye. He knew it depended on large scale quark strange-matter on a bizarre frequency that *should* have made the artificially jammed together particles disintegrate, but no, it just made rapid pulses.

Herod had examined the unpowered repeater and found that the strange matter violated a basic law.

It didn't vibrate. At all. At room temperature there was no atomic movement. It was a lump of sub-atomic strange particles that just sat there like a lump.

In the powered one, it vibrated so fast Herod was surprised it didn't burst into flame and convert into radiation.

But despite the vibration being obvious by direct examination, there was no output from the vibration that he could detect.

Worse, and even weirder, is that the 'lumps' defied another basic rule: 'Observing the state of a sub-atomic particle changes its state' was completely ignored. Not matter who observed it, with what instruments, as many at once, the states never changed.

Herod kicked a chunk of seaweed hard enough to send it sailing over  the virtual horizon.

What was that matter, why did it act the way it did? It was obvious that it was the transmitter/receiver, but transmitting and receiving what? Someone had suggested maybe the particles were paired, causing the other half of the pair to vibrate the same way.

Which meant it was glorified binary code.

It made sense, until Victor had pointed out that new repeaters could be manufactured, but that meant that it was not connected to a pair.

Herod had examined the manufacturing process for the repeaters, and all he got out of it was a headache. It used strange-matter production, which was bad enough, but when he looked up the SolNet archives on what exactly that matter was, all he got was scientific paper after scientific paper examining the clump and coming up with ""We have no clue.""

One paper was summed up with an ancient image macro of a weaselly looking man saying ""It Just Works"" that the smug expression on the long dead man made Herod want to invent time travel just to go back and kick that man in his testicles.

Growling he pulled a comlink out of his pocket and dialed Victor's number.

""Yes?"" Victor picked it up before it could even ring.

""Do you have a moment to talk?"" Herod asked. ""Not one of your clones, you.""

""I'm in the lab. Here, you can rez into the hallway outside the lab and come in,"" Victor said and closed the connection.

Herod dismissed the eVR scenery and appeared in the hallway, moving up to the door and touching it. When it opened Herod went in, still mulling over the problem.

What was the particle, what was the particle cluster, and why did it vibrate the way it did?

Herod was slightly surprised. The only version in the lab was the bearded one, who was sitting in a chair, staring at four stasis cubes. The room was slightly chilly and dimly lit, the light coming from actual emitters in the ceiling rather than light emitting nanites that made the illumination come from everywhere and nowhere.

""Come in, Herod,"" Victor said slowly, his voice hushed.

Herod frowned as he went inside. When he got close enough to see what was inside the slightly tinted stasis cubes he stopped.

Two of the blocks held *dogs*, one held a gooboi nervous system with attendant organs, the last held what looked like a human-dog crossbreed.

""Where did you get those?"" Herod asked, keeping his voice low.

""Another Black Box,"" Victor said, leaning back in his chair and stroking his beard. ""They're part of why I'm in here.""

""Is there another team working on this like we're working on the SUDS system?"" Herod asked.

""No. Just me,"" Victor said. ""Almost all of me.""

""What's the hybrid? A biological sentient?"" Herod asked.

""Allow me to introduce you to them,"" Victor said. He pointed at the one on the far left. ""That is Rex. He's a Eukarya Animalia Chordata Mammalia Carnivora Canidae *Canis lupus -* Black labrador retriever, of the St. John's Water Dog line.""

He tapped the dataslate in front of him on the far left. ""He was owned by Molly Tibbert, of Lewiston, Washington State, United States of America. His owner, who was nine at the time, brought him in to be put in stasis when he showed initial symptoms. She cried as he was put into stasis normally used for astronauts.""

He pointed at the second one. ""That is Beau. Beau is Eukarya Animalia Chordata Mammalia Carnivora Canidae *Canis lupus* *nobilis -* Black Labrador retriever, of the St. John's Water Dog line.""

""Wait, nobilis?"" Herod asked. ""Why nobilis?""

""Because he could talk. He's uplifted,"" Victor sighed again. ""Our oldest friend, and the second species we uplifted. It was a little more difficult than the dolphins.""

Herod just stared. The dogs looked almost identical, Beau just missing white socks.

""His best friend was Kyle Lymner, of the city of Fulda, the country of Germany. Kyle was twelve and Beau was six when Beau started showing symptoms. Kyle's parents had him put in stasis in hopes that a cure would be found,"" Victor continued. He tapped the dataslate. ""That was over eight thousand years ago. It was a vain hope.""

Victor pointed at the upright looking one. ""That's Lance Corporal Robert-44824 of the United States of America Marine Corps, he's a Eukarya Animalia Chordata Mammalia Carnivora Canidae *Canis lupus* *nobilis erectus- black labrador retriever, of the St. John's Water Dog* line. A K-9 Trooper AKA 'dog-boy' of the then current slang. Genetically altered to stand upright, talk, and have closer to human problem solving and intelligence. He was put in stasis upon confirmation that he was sick.""

""I've never even seen one,"" Herod said. ""Why not?""

""If I was to remove him from stasis, he would be in great pain for a day to a day and a half and then would die in agony,"" Victor said. ""He'd probably reach out to me for succor, in hopes I could heal him so that our time together would not end. He would love and trust me almost immediately, without reservation or hesitation, even though he's never met me before. Even as he is dying he will be worried about how *I* feel about *his* death.""

""The Friend Plague,"" Herod said, his voice low.

Victor nodded. ""There were, according to what I learned in the creche-school, six hundred million *Canis lupus nobilis erectus* on Earth when the Friend Plague arrived. Within a year, there were none unless they were in stasis like Robert here.""

Herod gulped, shivering slightly even though he couldn't *actually* feel the cold.

""Now, ask me why we didn't just remove the disease once we had tissue samples and some of them in stasis,"" Victor said, his voice menacing despite its softness.

""Because the disease is already in every tissue cell and is impossible to remove without destroying the cell and the DNA/RNA of the cell,"" Herod said.

""A crude explanation, but I won't give you any demerits for its crudity,"" Victor said, still staring. He pointed at the *goodboi.* ""Meet FIDO-14364235, Eukarya Animalia Chordata Mammalia Carnivora Canidae *Canis lupus mechanica.* He's one of the first created. There's only one as old as him in existence, but I'd have better luck scooping plasma from a star with my bare hands than getting any sample from that one.""

""Am I disturbing you?"" Herod asked, kind of hoping he was so that he could slowly back out of the room.

""No. I come in here when I need reminded that I'm not omnipotent, that despite all my advantages, I'm human even though there's no such things as *only* human, I'm human, and thus prone to all the pitfalls and paradoxes inherent in humanity,"" Victor said. He turned around in the chair, facing Herod. ""What can I do for you?""

""I'm stuck,"" Herod admitted. ""What is the group of particles? We can obvious manufacture them, I've looked at the manufacturing process, but I can't figure them out.""

""You and every other researcher,"" Victor said, stroking his beard. ""There's one thing that should be obvious but is overlooked by everyone. Hell, I overlooked it, if I remember right.""

""What?"" Herod asked, feeling digital goosebumps at standing in what was basically a morgue.

""You can only create those particles in a gravity well of at least point eight two G to a maximum of three point five gee with a electromagnetic field with a strength of point two eight Gauss to point seven one Gauss,"" Victor said.

""You mean, they can only be made in a *planetary* gravity well?"" Herod frowned.

""Well, or one like the Black Box has, or if you use an artificial singularity with the proper spin on it,"" Victor said. ""Otherwise the particles not only won't form but they won't stick together. In nearly sixty-two point three eight percent of the attempts the particles will undergo particle swapping and end up as anti-matter type three AM-Iron atoms.""

Herod just stared.

""The real question is, where does the signal go?"" Victor said. ""I never figure that out, what I figured out was much much different. Unfortunately I got planet-cracked, an event that has somewhat of a adverse effect upon one's memories.""

Herod laughed before he could stop himself.

""So what did you figure out?"" he asked.

Victor stared for a long moment.

""Two things. Two things of such import that the news that it had ever happened would cause massive riots across of all of Terran Descent Human Space, but two things that I guess are going to be discovered here,"" Victor said.

Herod felt as if a cold breeze had moved through the room.

""Two species were wiped out by the Fried Plague, AKA the Andromeda Strain,"" Victor said.

""Felines and canines,"" Herod said. He paused. ""You figured out how to restore them?""

Victor nodded. ""But that, that wasn't what created the catastrophe known as the Crusade of Wrath. What I discovered, what the Imperium destroyed with a planet cracker, cause the Crusade of Wrath.""

Herod frowned. ""I thought the Crusade of Wrath happened because of the death of the Digital Omnimessiah.""

""Is that what they teach now?"" Victor mused, turning his chair around. He pressed a button and the stasis cubes retracted into the wall. There was more whirring and additional panels opened. Robotic gantries moved out stasis cubes, six of them, all with dimly seen naked humans inside.

""What... what... are you claiming you restored a Sleeping One?"" Herod asked, stepping back.

""Not one. Two. A mother and her child,"" Victor said softly.

*Heresy...* bubbled up in Herod's mind, even as he backed up.

""I freed them from the horrors of the Glassing. Undid the Omniqueen's injury to them. Restored their sanity without damaging their minds. I *freed* them from eternal dreamless slumber,"" Victor said, slowly standing up.

Hector blinked as he saw, with more than just his eyes, purple and blue lightning beginning to crackle around Victor's clenched fists, the sparks popping in the human's hair, the electrical arcs buzzing around the human's feet.

""I *did* it. I managed to accomplish something that *nobody* thought could be done, and those prideful idiots of the Crusade of Light fucking *planet-cracked* me right to my face the same day I managed to do the impossible. Planet-cracked me just I repaid a brother, reached redemption after my Fall.""

Herod could feel the stress on the words as he realized that the Black Box had suddenly locked down the room he was in. He was loaded into the local buffers, access to escaping cut off as the hardwired lines themselves were suddenly cut.

Victor turned around, his eyes full of purple fire, purple arcs of energy crackling across his teeth.

""And now I can't *remember* how I did it!"" Victor, no, Legion, snarled. He inhaled as if he was about to continue talking, or maybe just scream, when his eyes suddenly focused on his upraised fist.

""Oh. Oops,"" he said. He closed his eyes and took several deep breaths.

Herod had backed up against the door.

When Victor opened his eyes the purple fire was gone.

The door opened and Herod half fell through, vanishing into the data stream as soon as he could, fleeing for his room.

He'd never believed the tales and the legends and records.

While the media may focus on the MVP award and other prestigious honors, reddit has the distinct honor of awarding the LVP. **[The LEAST Valuable Player](https://images.app.goo.gl/jwXWsKEJUk6LQhNc6
)**. It's a tradition that dates back to 2016-17, when aging Indiana SG Monta Ellis won the inaugural trophy and then promptly disappeared from the NBA forever. In 2017-18, Minnesota SG [Jamal Crawford](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8ai7pl/the_results_are_in_for_least_valuable_player/?st=jsdf3cqi&amp;sh=70ff7ca4) won the (dis)honor with some incredibly bad defensive numbers. Last season, New Orleans SF [Solomon Hill](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/b8xut2/the_results_are_in_for_least_valuable_player/) won LVP by helping to sink a drowning team and accelerating Anthony Davis' decision to fly the coop.  

Before we announce this year's winner, let's review the criteria and caveats:

--- Obviously, the worst players in the league are the ones who sit at the end of the bench and don't get any playing time. However, this award focuses on players who log a decent amount of minutes and consequently affected their team's play the most. Simply put: the more you play, the more damage you can do. 

--- And that actual ""damage"" is important. If you're on a tanking team, no one cares about your poor play; it may even be a positive. I'm also ignoring young players (under 21) who are still developing and can't be expected to be solid players yet. 

--- Similarly, we don't want to judge players within the context of their salary any more than the actual MVP does. We also do not weigh in injuries either. For example, the Wizards would have a hard time competing with John Wall on the sidelines (0 games played, $32M in salary), but we want to focus on players' on-court performance instead.

---

######**dishonorable mentions**

**PG Mike Conley, Utah: 28.6 minutes per game, -0.80 RPM**

We're using Mike Conley to reiterate that the LVP does NOT factor salary into the equation any more than the MVP does. But if it *did*, Mike Conley and his $33M salary may be in trouble. 

It was a disastrous start to the season for Conley. Playing in a new role as a second fiddle to another guard, he could never find his groove. His assists plummeted (down to 4.3 per game), his free-throw attempts cut in half (from 5.8 to 2.9), and he only shot 42.9% from two-point range. That said, he still shot pretty well from 3 (37.6%) and played OK defense, keeping him off our official ballot.

**SF Miles Bridges, Charlotte: 30.7 minutes per game, -2.68 RPM**

Like Mike Conley, Miles Bridges seems like a great guy whom you'd hate to criticize. Alas, that's our exercise here. Caught in between positions, Bridges hasn't been able to figure out his rhythm on offense in the NBA either. He hasn't shot well (33% from three, 48.6% from two) and doesn't get to the line enough (2.0 FTA) to make up for it. The advanced stats get even worse from there (although to be fair, they get dragged down by playing in a bad starting lineup.)

Fortunately for him, Bridges is spared by his youth. At 22, he's technically over our ""21 year old"" threshold, but it still feels unfair to pick on his growing pains as a sophomore. Perhaps in time, he can find a role that can take advantage of his athleticism and talent. But be warned: the clock is ticking. We're taking the kid gloves off soon. Bridges and fellow analytics-allergic Kevin Knox (-7.7 RPM!) will be entering Year 3 next season and will need to step their games up to avoid LVP discussion. 

**SF Kyle Kuzma, L.A. Lakers: 24.6 minutes per game, -0.74 RPM**

Kyle Kuzma can score if need be, but his skill set never made him a natural fit to play third banana to superstars like LeBron James and Anthony Davis. He's not a 3+D player -- he's more of a no-3 (30% this year) no-D player. At the same time, the LVP is about negative impact, and it's hard to find much of consequence here. After all, the Lakers still finished with the # 1 record in the West. Kuzma struggling to find his way is like a tree falling in the woods or a person farting in an empty elevator – ultimately it didn't matter.

**SF Andre Iguodala, Memphis/Miami**

It feels like ancient history now, but this past offseason, the Memphis Grizzlies acquired Andre Iguodala in a trade (under the presumption he may be dealt again.) According to official reports, Iguodala and the Grizzlies MUTUALLY decided that he wouldn't play for Memphis and wouldn't even report to the team in the meantime. Okay. Fine. We'll go along with that.

Still, that situation leaves a sour taste in the LVP headquarters. Memphis turned out to be better than expected, and could have used an extra rotational player. And even if Iguodala wouldn't have helped much on the court, he could have been a valuable mentor for their young kids. That's the least you can expect for a nice $15M in salary. 

---

######**our official top 5 LVP ballot**

**(5) PF Anthony Tolliver (POR, SAC, MEM): 15.6 minutes per game, -3.60 RPM**

I've always had a soft spot for the wise ol' owl, Anthony Tolliver. He's reportedly a great teammate and locker room presence. He also started to develop into an effective stretch four towards the end of this career.

But alas, the end of his career may have snuck up on us sooner than we expected. Tolliver disappointed for Minnesota last season, and completely flopped in his return to Portland. At age 34, he doesn't seem to be a viable rotation player anymore. He didn't play quite enough to merit LVP, but he still played more than he should have.

There's a chance Tolliver comes back next year to serve as a veteran mentor and pseudo-assistant coach somewhere, but it's more likely that he retires. If he does, he'll have played for 10 different franchises in his not-so-illustrious but very respectable career.

**(4) SG Bryn Forbes, San Antonio: 25.1 minutes per game, -0.95 RPM**

The NBA is all about shooting these days, and Bryn Forbes can shoot. He's hit an even 40.0% from three during his NBA career so far, and wasn't too far removed from that this season with 38.8% on 6.0 attempts per game. As a result, his true shooting percentage (57%) was above average. The Spurs lacked spacers, and Forbes fit that bill.

So what's the problem...? Turns out, basketball is more than a halfcourt game. And whenever the ball crosses that pesky midcourt line, Bryn Forbes starts to become a liability. 

At only 6'3"", Forbes is undersized to play the SG position, which is where the Spurs played him 74% of the time (according to basketball-reference.) Partly due to those athletic limitations, he only registered 0.5 steals per game, and blocked a grand total of 0 shots in his 1579 minutes of action. The advanced stats get ugly; Forbes ranks near the bottom at his position in DRPM, DBPM, all the alphabet formulas that you can cook up.

At the end of the day, LVP is about negative impact, and there's plenty here. Forbes is not a bad player in a vacuum, but he did not help the Spurs this year. In fact, their undersized lineup is a big reason why they're struggling so much on defense (25th in the NBA). As a direct result, they're on track to miss the playoffs for the first time in decades. 

**(3) SF Mario Hezonja, Portland: 16.3 minutes per game, -2.79 RPM**

During the entire run of the Damian Lillard - C.J. McCollum era, Portland has struggled to figure out their wing rotation. That would be tested even more this season, with familiar faces like Moe Harkless, Al-Farouq Aminu, and Evan Turner slipping out the door.
The trials and tribulations kept coming like Damian Lillard was Job, as injuries ravaged the Blazers' new depth chart. The team didn't need a star to emerge at forward -- but they needed [*somebody.* Anybody.](https://images.app.goo.gl/yzu1jBoNpAY3DiGC6)

In theory, that player should have been Mario Hezonja, a former lottery pick and a live body with good athleticism and size at 6'8"". Signed this summer for a modest price ($1.7M), Hezonja had the chance to jumpstart his NBA career with a major opportunity on the team. Instead, he flopped like Marcus Smart taking a phantom elbow.

Hezonja's biggest problem is that, at age 25, he still hasn't found his feel on the court. He's not a good shooter (32.8% from three), and doesn't use his athleticism to find his way to the line (1.1 attempts per game.) He was a non-factor (5 PPG, 3 RPG) on a team that desperately needed him to step up. In fact, the Blazers were so desperate for help that they not only signed Carmelo Anthony, but they played him over 32 minutes a game.

Again, we see a real ""LVP"" candidacy here with a direct effect on the standings. The Blazers' getting a big fat nothing from Hezonja was a major part of their struggle to get to .500 this season.

**(2) C Dewayne Dedmon, SAC/ATL: 17.6 minutes per game, -2.51 RPM**

We're not supposed to factor in salaries into this equation, but Dewayne Dedmon's situation merits a mention for context. The Sacramento Kings signed the big man to a head-scratching 3-year, $40M deal this summer (seriously.) Clearly, GM Vlade Divac thought his young Kings were only a few veterans away from making the playoffs, bringing in (and over-paying) Dedmon, Cory Joseph, and Trevor Ariza.

Among the three, Dedmon turned out to be the most disappointing for several reasons. He didn't play well to start the season, and got usurped in the rotation by underrated Richaun Holmes. Rather than suck it up, take a deep breath, and take a relaxing dive in his new Scrooge McDuck money pool, Dedmon started to whine and complain and push for a trade. For a team that was struggling, Dedmon's headache became the *last* thing they needed. Ultimately, they ditched him back to where he came from in Atlanta.

Now, being difficult and being a prima donna isn't enough to get you LVP honors. You have to stink on the court as well. And sure enough, Dedmon started to check those boxes. Billed as a stretch five after hitting some threes in Atlanta, Dedmon lost his shot in the SMF airport baggage claim. He shot only 19.7% from three for the Kings, registering a 47.3% true shooting percentage on the season. His defense is OK, but it's not good enough make up for his poor offensive play. He's not bad *enough* to get LVP, but he hurt his team this year.

**(1) PG Isaiah Thomas, Washington: 23.1 minutes per game, -2.75 RPM**

We've awarded three LVP trophies in the past, and a familiar pattern is starting to emerge. The most dangerous players aren't necessarily the *bad* players; they're the players who used to be *good.* Because of their prior success, they tend to get overplayed by their coaches and drag their teams down with them.

It wasn't too long ago that Isaiah Thomas found himself in the MVP conversation for the Boston Celtics, as his incredible shotmaking helped make up for any defensive limitations he may have as a 5'9"" player. That said, a small player like Thomas is always going to have a thin margin for error to remain a winning player. He needs to be GREAT offensively to make up for his defense. Unfortunately, his offense has not been great since his infamous injury. He can still make shots (hitting 41.3% of his threes), but he's not getting inside the paint and not getting to the free-throw line (1.9 attempts per game.) As a result, his true-shooting percentage lagged to 53.1%, well below league average.

If Isaiah Thomas isn't making scoring efficiently, then what is he doing to help a team win? He's not a great distributor (3.7 assists per game.) He's a very poor rebounder (1.7 per game.) And yes, that defense is still a major problem. According to ESPN's RPM metric, Thomas graded as a -4.2 impact per 100 possessions, the second worst in the league at PG after Trae Young. Basketball-reference lists his ""defensive rating"" at 121. For comparison's sake, the worst team defense in the league still held teams under 116. (That worst team? The Wizards.)

You can make an argument that there's still a place for Thomas in the NBA as a sparkplug scorer off the bench. Alas, that's not how the Wizards had been using him this season. He started 37 of 40 games for the team. Largely as a result of that, the Wizards' starting lineup was atrocious defensively. Fellow starters like Bradley Beal and Rui Hachimura ranked toward the bottom of their position in defensive metrics as well. When your lineup stinks defensively, a good coach may look in the mirror and say: hey, maybe we need a change here. Sadly, quick reactions are not Scottie Brooks' strong suit. He has the type of sloth-like speed that even frustrate workers at the DMV. The Wizards *eventually* dumped IT, but it took far too long to make that shift.

To be fair, the Wizards' options at point guard were limited with John Wall injured. Veteran Ish Smith is mediocre right now, and Shabazz Napier arrived late in the season. Still, the point here is: almost *any* competent point guard (like a Napier) would have helped the Wizards more than Isaiah Thomas. He had become a negative for them. The cold hard truth is that: it's very difficult to win basketball games with Thomas starting. And given that, he is our official **LVP.**",nba,5304

##Portland protests

**Trump’s agents are sweeping peaceful citizens off the streets.** [Oregon Public Broadcasting](https://www.opb.org/news/article/federal-law-enforcement-unmarked-vehicles-portland-protesters/):

&gt;Federal law enforcement officers have been using unmarked vehicles to drive around downtown Portland and detain protesters since at least July 14...Personal accounts and multiple videos posted online show the officers driving up to people, detaining individuals with no explanation of why they are being arrested, and driving off.”

&gt;The tactic appears to be another escalation in federal force deployed on Portland city streets, as federal officials and President Donald Trump have said they plan to ‘quell’ nightly protests outside the federal courthouse and Multnomah County Justice Center that have lasted for more than six weeks.

* There are numerous Twitter accounts of journalists and protestors with video from Portland. One of the best is Zane Sparling of The Portland Tribune. Scroll through his timeline if you haven’t seen the recent video, like [this one](https://twitter.com/PDXzane/status/1284733976582615040?s=20) he took of a Navy vet being beaten or [this one](https://twitter.com/MrOlmos/status/1284417770973626371?s=20) he retweeted of the Portland Police rushing protestors. Here’s a different person’s [thread](https://twitter.com/tuckwoodstock/status/1284734198926852097?s=20) with more footage of local police. And of course, one of the first videos to make headlines (sadly), of federal agents [abducting](https://twitter.com/sparrowmedia/status/1283436911307218948?s=20) a protestor off the street.

**Homeland Security officers are using Trump’s monument order to crack down on protests in Portland.** Trump signed an executive order on June 26 aimed at protecting monuments and statues. The Dept. of Homeland Security then created the “Protecting American Communities Task Force” and [sent officers](https://apnews.com/4435a1f27cf85e087e112ba1224a2f1f) from Customs and Border Protection and other agencies to D.C., Seattle, and Portland. 

&gt;Among the federal forces deployed in Portland are members of an elite Border Patrol tactical team, a special operations unit that is based on the U.S.-Mexico border and has been deployed overseas, including to Iraq and Afghanistan… BORTAC members, identifiable by patches on their camouflage sleeves, are mixed in with Federal Protective Service officers outside the courthouse. 

**DHS is operating in Portland under the guide of protecting federal property.** [Legally](https://www.lawfareblog.com/what-heck-are-federal-law-enforcement-officers-doing-portland), the federal government is within its rights to use federal law enforcement officers to enforce federal law (including destruction or vandalism of federal property). Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf [says](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/07/16/acting-secretary-wolf-condemns-rampant-long-lasting-violence-portland) his officers are preventing vandalism to the federal courthouse:

&gt;Each night, lawless anarchists destroy and desecrate property, including the federal courthouse, and attack the brave law enforcement officers protecting it. A federal courthouse is a symbol of justice - to attack it is to attack America… This siege can end if state and local officials decide to take appropriate action instead of refusing to enforce the law. DHS will not abdicate its solemn duty to protect federal facilities and those within them.

Wolf then lists crimes “justifying” the use of violent, confrontational, unidentified federal agents. However, the crimes prior to the dispatching of federal agents consist only of graffiti incidents and the “removal” of fencing.

*In other words, DHS is using minor vandalism to federal property as a “hook” to authorize CBP and ICE (among others) to act as Trump’s private police.*

&gt;Gov. Kate Brown [said](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/us/portland-protests.html#click=https://t.co/plQJYh1JiV) in an interview that she believed that the protests were starting to ease before the federal officers waded into the scene. 

* Note, also, that none of the DHS leaders were confirmed by the Senate. We have an acting Secretary, acting Deputy Secretary, acting head of CBP, and acting head of ICE. It’s been that way for over a year.

**Oregon officials, including the governor and senators, have told DHS to get out of Portland’s streets.** Gov. Kate Brown made it clear that the federal officers are inflaming the situation, but Wolf refused to pull back. Combined with Trump’s dangerous rhetoric regarding protests, it is reasonable to surmise that escalation is the whole point of these exercises in the first place.

&gt;“Let me be very, very clear, having federal troops on the streets of Portland does not solve the problem and in fact, it escalates the problem,” Brown [said](https://www.kptv.com/news/governor-brown-talks-covid-19-protests-and-schools-in-one-on-one-interview/article_69e6c558-c89b-11ea-9f5e-b3924be016e4.html). “I was very clear with Secretary Wolf about that fact. This is pure politics; this isn’t about problem-solving.”

&gt;“Platoons self-designated and self-mobilized by Donald Trump to be flown thousands of miles into US cities to attack Americans fits the definition of abuse of power in any democracy,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) [said](https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2020/07/federal-agents-portland-border-patrol-chad-wolf-statues/). “The legal justification is absurd—Trump’s occupation has nothing to do with statues. If that executive order is their basis of their authority, they are massively exceeding it and those involved should find their federal employment terminated before this is all resolved.”

**The Trump administration is planning on expanding their federal force into other American cities.** DHS acting Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli told NPR that “we intend to continue not just in Portland but in any of the facilities that we’re responsible for around the country.” White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told Fox News this could happen as early as this week:

&gt;“Attorney General Barr is weighing in on that with [DHS] Secretary Wolf, and you’ll see something rolled out this week, as we start to go in and make sure that the communities—whether it’s Chicago or Portland or Milwaukee or someplace across the heartland of the country—we need to make sure their communities are safe,” Meadows said ([video](https://twitter.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1284906924740423681?s=20)).

**The Supreme Court expedited the implementation of its ruling allowing Vance to seek Trump’s financial information.** While the case can now resume [more quickly](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/17/politics/vance-trump-taxes-grand-jury/index.html), Trump still has the time and opportunity to file additional arguments in SDNY’s district court. Last week, the Manhattan district attorney’s office [accused](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/nyregion/donald-trump-taxes-cyrus-vance.html?action=click&amp;module=Latest&amp;pgtype=Homepage) Trump of deliberately delaying the process to allow the statute of limitations to expire.

**Court filings reveal that Vance is interested in more than just hush-money payments, veering into the hundreds of millions of dollars Trump sunk into hotels and golf courses** in the 2000s. Once he ran out of cash, Trump [took out](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/akzndj/the-manhattan-da-is-going-where-mueller-wouldnt-trumps-money) over $300 million in loans from the private-wealth management office of Deutsche Bank. 

&gt;“The subpoenas seek records, dating from 2011 to the present, concerning transactions that are unrelated to any official acts of the President, and that occurred largely before [Trump] assumed office,” Vance told the high court, adding that his probe goes into “issues beyond those involved in the Cohen matter.”

&gt;Vance’s team also told the high court their investigation is based, in part, on “multiple public reports of possible criminal misconduct” by employees of the Trump Organization.

**The nonprofit that funded Trump’s post-election transition has agreed to shut down in a settlement** with New Jersey’s attorney general for [failing](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-transition-agrees-shut-down-state-dept-official-fined-n1233858) to register with the state as a charitable organization. The State Dept.’s acting Chief of Protocol Cam Henderson was paid by the Trump transition to raise money and will have to pay a fine for failing to register as a fund raiser as required. 

* Note: State Dept. IG Steve Linick was [investigating](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/20/fired-state-department-watchdog-was-probing-protocol-office-270660) Cam Henderson and her deputy prior to being fired by Pompeo and Trump. Henderson has worked in the past as an aide to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

**The Justice Department carried out its third federal execution in four days on Friday, after only putting three people in death over the previous three decades.** The Supreme Court [cleared](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/07/supreme-court-federal-execution-daniel-lee.html) the way for these executions last week, issuing a 2 am unsigned ruling allowing the execution of Daniel Lee - the first federal execution since 2003. All four liberal justices dissented.

&gt;According to his attorney, [Ruth Friedman](https://twitter.com/mjs_DC/status/1283034580442849281), Lee remained strapped to a gurney for four hours while the Department of Justice sought the green light from the Supreme Court. The government then executed him without first notifying Friedman that her client would be killed.

* Further reading: “The Justice Department’s Shameful Rush to Federal Executions. The push to impose the federal death penalty no matter the cost poses a grave threat to the rule of law,” [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/opinion/justice-department-federal-execution.html). 

**Also last week, the Supreme Court ruled that Florida’s law restricting felon voting rights can stay in place,** all but [guaranteeing](https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2020/07/16/us-supreme-court-keeps-florida-felon-voting-law-in-place-1301508) that nearly 1 million Floridians will be unable to vote in the 2020 election because of unpaid court debts. The high court did not explain its decision; Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented.

&gt;“This Court’s order prevents thousands of otherwise eligible voters from participating in Florida’s primary election simply because they are poor,” wrote Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor in a hard-charging dissent. “And it allows the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit to disrupt Florida’s election process just days before the July 20 voter-registration deadline for the August primary, even though a preliminary injunction had been in place for nearly a year and a Federal District Court had found the State’s pay-to-vote scheme unconstitutional.”

Sotomayor ended by [noting](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/sotomayor-blasts-supreme-court-for-upholding-florida-poll-tax-that-excludes-voters-simply-because-they-are-poor/) that the conservatives of the court ruled with opposing rational to block extended voting in Wisconsin’s pandemic primary:

&gt;This Court’s inaction continues a trend of condoning dis-franchisement. Ironically, this Court has wielded Purcell as a reason to forbid courts to make voting safer during a pandemic, overriding two federal courts because any safety-related changes supposedly came too close to election day. Now, faced with an appellate court stay that disrupts a legal status quo and risks immense disfranchisement—a situation that Purcell sought to avoid—the Court balks.

* Note also that Florida does not know how much court debt ex-felons owe. And it has [no intention](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/05/florida-amendment-4-fines-fees-unconstitutional-ruling.html) of figuring it out. The state has forced ex-felons to pay up—then refused to tell them how much they must pay.

##Voting rights

**Voting rights and civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis passed away last week. The Voting Rights Advancement Act has been sitting on McConnell’s desk for over 225 days.** [Rep. James Clyburn](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/19/democrats-demand-expansion-voting-rights-memory-john-lewis/) (D-SC): “It should be the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act of 2020. That’s the way to do it. Words may be powerful, but deeds are lasting.” 

* Opinion: [Do Not Call John Lewis a “Hero” if You Stood in His Way.](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/07/john-lewis-mitch-mcconnell-brian-kemp-gop-voting-rights.html) Republicans like Mitch McConnell and Brian Kemp are the reason the civil rights icon had to keep fighting until his dying breath.


**Trump’s new USPS chief is slowing the delivery of mail, raising concerns over late delivery of absentee ballots during primary and general elections.** In a memo obtained by [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/14/postal-service-trump-dejoy-delay-mail/), USPS workers were told, “One aspect of these changes that may be difficult for employees is that — temporarily — we may see mail left behind or mail on the workroom floor or docks.” 

**Leaving mail behind endangers your vote.** In [34 states](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/15/how-trumps-war-postal-service-could-create-an-election-nightmare/), under current law your absentee ballot must be received by election authorities by election day. If your local post office is overwhelmed with ballots (which is likely, given the pandemic), your ballot could be received late and your vote will not count. 

* Remember, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has been a [top donor](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-usps-head-top-trump-donor-what-does-mean-its-n1231124) to Trump and the Republican National Committee, and he was in charge of fundraising for the 2020 Republican National Convention.

**In the primary elections held so far this year, at least 65,000 absentee or mail-in ballots have been rejected because they arrived past the deadline, often through no fault of the voter.** Those who use mail-in voting for the first time — especially young, Black and Latino voters — are [more likely](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/13/889751095/signed-sealed-undelivered-thousands-of-mail-in-ballots-rejected-for-tardiness) to have their ballots rejected because of errors.

##Trump raking in donor money

**In just two days in March, Trump’s re-election campaign gave Trump’s hotels nearly $400,000 of donor money** for “facility rental/catering services. The campaign has [also](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/17/trump-campaign-is-grift-that-keeps-grifting/) been paying more than $37,000 a month in rent to Trump Tower in New York, which is odd, considering that the campaign’s headquarters is in an office building in Rosslyn.

&gt;According to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics (CRP), Trump-allied political committees and the Republican party have [spent](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/09/how-trumps-business-empire-is-cashing-in-on-the-2020-campaign) a whopping $18.1m at Trump properties since he launched his 2016 campaign. Republican candidates, elected officials and Pacs have ponied up another $1.2m in the same period.

&gt;Donald J Trump for President leads the pack, having spent a total of $14.5m since he began his 2016 campaign, with the Republican National Committee in second place at $1.8m and Trump Victory ranking third at $1.6m, Center data shows.

**Meanwhile, Trump is illegally campaigning on federal property by using official White House press briefings to dump opposition research on Joe Biden.** On Tuesday, the president convened reporters for a press conference purportedly about punishing China, but [instead](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-uses-rose-garden-event-for-extended-campaign-like-attack-on-biden/2020/07/14/cba91838-c600-11ea-a99f-3bbdffb1af38_story.html) spent an hour bashing Biden:

&gt;“Biden was here for 47 years...now he says as president he’s going to do all the things he didn’t do, he never did, he never did anything except make very bad decisions.” ([video](https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1283155449345462275?s=20))

* “Five decades later, Trump is still pushing segregationist policies,” [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/five-decades-later-trump-still-pushing-segregationist-policies-n1233983).

* Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the St. Louis couple who went viral last month when they brandished guns while confronting Black Lives Matter protesters outside their home, [appeared](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mark-patricia-mccloskey-guns-kimberly-guilfoyle-interview-trump-camapign/) at a virtual Trump campaign event on Friday night.

* Trump’s reelection campaign is [conducting](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-campaign-conducting-internal-review-of-2020-spending-irregularities-2020-7) an internal review of spending irregularities overseen by Brad Parscale, the recently-demoted 2020 campaign manager. “Trump’s anger at Parscale has been building since last year after he learned his campaign manager was living a lavish lifestyle built off riches he’d made working for the president.”

Dear Steve,

On June 1, you shared a letter on Reddit’s blog  [“Remember the Human – Black Lives Matter”]( https://redditblog.com/2020/06/01/remember-the-human-black-lives-matter/).  In this letter, you claim “as Snoos, we do not tolerate hate, racism, and violence, and while we have work to do to fight these on our platform, our values are clear.”

As of today, neither you nor any other Reddit admins have shared this letter anywhere on reddit.com. However, [the response to this message was swift on Twitter](https://twitter.com/reddit/status/1267643352851247106), where you were rightfully labeled as hypocritical based on your long and well-recorded history of defending racism and white supremacy on this site. 

Among the many responses was this message from former CEO of Reddit, Ellen Pao. 

&gt;[I am obligated to call you out: You should have shut down the_donald instead of amplifying it and its hate, racism, and violence. So much of what is happening now lies at your feet. You don't get to say BLM when reddit nurtures and monetizes white supremacy and hate all day long](https://twitter.com/ekp/status/1267689503797342208)

Many others shared links and screenshots of your past statements saying [“Open racism and slurs are fine to post on Reddit”](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/12/racism-slurs-reddit-post-ceo-steve-huffman).

The problem of Reddit’s leadership supporting and providing a platform for racist users and hateful communities has long been an issue.  Nearly six years ago, [dozens of subreddits signed the original open letter to the Reddit admins](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/2ejg1b/we_have_a_racist_user_problem_and_reddit_wont/) calling for action.  While [the Reddit admins acknowledged the letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/2m9k6p/maybe_its_time_to_repost_the_open_letter_reddit/cm27j8j/) and said it was a high priority to address this issue, extremely little has been done in the intervening years.

On June 5, you shared this update on /r/Announcements, [Upcoming changes to our content policy, our board, and where we’re going from here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/).  In the post, you stated that there is a need for continued adjustments of Reddit’s content policy to address racism and that this remains a priority.  These continued statements that you hear us, that this is a priority, or that you are working on it are not enough.  It has been five years since your return as CEO and this still remains Reddit’s most glaring problem.

Steve, if you and Reddit genuinely care about the values of standing up to racism and hate, then you need to back it up with real action.  As moderators on this website who have dedicated countless hours to keeping this site running, we call on Reddit to take the following steps:

* **Enact a sitewide policy against racism, slurs, and hatespeech targeted at protected groups.** For too many years, Steve Huffman and the other Admins have stood by and allowed this site to fester with hate in the name of “free speech.”  It is time to enact a specific and detailed policy that protects the disadvantaged members of our communities from hate based on their sexuality, gender identity, ethnicity, country of origin, religion, or disability.

* **Be proactive in banning hate-based communities**  In the past Reddit has only taken action on hate subreddits when they were featured in the news and risked Reddit’s reputation or when they were documented and featured on /r/AgainstHateSubreddits and other forums.  AHS should not have to be responsible for raising awareness of hate subreddits and reporting them to the admins.  This site should take responsibility for keeping its users safe by banning any remaining subreddits devoted to hate and racism and preventing the creation of hateful subreddits in the future. 

* **Be proactive in banning hate users** Reddit needs to not only ban hate subreddits, but must be proactive in banning the moderators of these subreddits and their most active users.  Too often these users have been allowed to stay on this website after numerous sitewide violations, letting them move on to participate in new hate communities and spread their vitriol further across this site.

* **Reddit needs to hire more minorities / women, especially in leadership roles** Reddit needs to hire more women and people of color — particularly in leadership roles in the company — to help shift the corporate culture and policies to be more equitable for all.  In addition, Reddit needs to take adequate steps to protect these employees from harassment. 

* **Reddit needs to hire more community managers** According to Reddit's [job listings](https://www.redditinc.com/careers) there are dozens of open positions that the company is hiring for, and yet not a single one for Community.  Reddit has enacted numerous policies over the years that have been detrimental to the ability of Reddit’s moderators or the broader Reddit community.  Reddit needs more community managers to build positive relations and engagement with the site’s volunteer moderators.

* **Honor Alexis Ohanian's wishes to have his Reddit Board seat filled with a black candidate** - On June 5, Reddit Co-Founder and Executive Chairman [announced that he would be stepping down](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1268943036228292608) from his role on Reddit's Board of Directors.  Alexis requested that his position be filled with a black candidate and we ask Reddit to honor that request.  While you have stated your intent to honor that request, we are asking for an announcement to be made on this decision in the next 3 months.  We believe this is not an issue that should be put off for action years down the road.

At /r/AgainstHateSubreddits, we have laid out the many failures of Steve time and again to stand up to white supremacy on this site [time]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/gv7mtn/steve_spez_huffman_is_finally_claiming_that_black/) and [time]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/a3q6ck/2018_reddit_review_a_year_of_hate_propaganda_and/) and [time]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/84q74p/bbc_calls_out_rthe_donald_for_being_a_thriving/) again.

With a website with the impact of Reddit on the broader conversations being held in communities around the world, this website needs real leadership and real action.

We hope that Reddit will not just share empty platitudes — but will take a meaningful stand against hate, and take these recommendations to heart.

ThatPDXgirl,2019-10-17 08:26:52+00:00,I was murdered February 2012. Had a serious Near Death Experience. This is what happened to me:,"Alright. Haven't shared my whole NDE w/you all yet. It's pretty hardcore. You guys ready for it?

February 2012. I was choked to death by someone I loved. (&amp; still do, if you can believe my ability to forgive). It was horrible struggling for air. Absolutely terrified. A lot of pain. But during the choking I got a mass release of chemicals that actually felt better than any drug any sex anything. I finally said OK I can let go now… So I did.  

Suddenly, every sound got really loud. I could hear everything going on in downtown Portland outside the condo below me. I literally became the sound. I could hear conversations in bars blocks away. It was really weird. I became the sound.  I became the sound of the cars on I405 below me...  

I remember popping (literally) out of my body.  For a moment I could kind of see what was going on in this world still. Then I was gone. In another one. 
 I had 360° vision!   

I could literally see above me, below me, behind me, and every side of me… Simultaneously. How will I ever be able to explain to others what that looks like?! You know? 
So I'm in this black void.  I did not see a light. But I wasn't scared. It was not a scary black void there was an absence of sound but at the same time it was really loud. It was like a cave. Or a womb! Like deep space. There was no sound but the silence was deafening. It was cozy. There were other beings with me; guiding me....but I don't remember in this situation what they looked like. 

Suddenly, I was brought to my “life review”. But I was not worried. It wasn't like a judgment. I guess for a short moment I do actually remember thinking “Oh crap! I'm about to get judged”!!  LOL, but then it was shown to me that it was OK &amp; not to be scared. That it was just like a learning thing. 
 The life-review was a really weird thing. Because it was not 3-D, and it wasn't even like  4D or5D...  almost like everything that has ever happened in my life, from birth to death was right there. Yet also the “opposite” way in “time”, from death to birth, too. 

**It really tripped me out, because there was no such thing as time** . 

It was chaos. It was confusing. Dinosaurs were even there... like a glimpse of even their existence. Everything. Everything that has ever existed was there. Simultaneously!

 This is when I kind of freaked out, because it was really chaotic without time. I literally remember saying to myself:

“No!!  This is not possible! I know there's no such thing as time, but really… There is no such thing as time""!
 I remember ""taking a step back into "", (if I had a body),  but I just kind of pulled back because I was so tripped out. It was at that moment that I literally came slamming into my body and started screaming and crying. Just like a baby being born. I literally came into my body, slammed back into the physical, screaming bloody murder... and I was back. It felt so heavy. 

He was still over the top of me. &amp; He was freaking out. Because he was thinking he was about to go to jail for murder. I was dead for sure, yes. No not just unconscious. 100% positive. 

I still know him.  I'm actually grateful (IN A WAY), that he killed me and gave me that experience as strange as it sounds. As I’m no longer afraid of death. And that’s pretty freakin huge, don’t you think? A perverse “gift”.  And no I am not making excuses for his BS disgusting behavior. Explaining all of that would go away from experience, and is a completely different category and post.

It has 4 “new style” complications around an elaborate sundial/orrery-style display of current sun position. I’ve seen a lot of people on this subreddit mention they were unsure of what the sundial shows exactly. Since I’m a bit of an astronomy dork, so I thought I’d put together a guide of just what it’s showing.

Notes about the screenshots:

* I am in Portland, Oregon, which lies at approximately 44.5N, 122.5W. Local time is Pacific Daylight Time (UTC-7)

* The complications are (clockwise from top left): Activity, weather temp, calendar, and date. All 4 are native in watchOS 6
* I’m using the digital version of the face. The analog one is the same, except for having an analog clock inside the sundial.
* The event at 9pm is the [GSL Code S semifinals](https://tl.net/forum/starcraft-2/551355-code-s-ro4-preview-maru-vs-trap), where Maru and Trap will play to advance to the final match of one of the most difficult video game tournaments in the world.

With that, onto the explanation of the sundial!

https://i.imgur.com/trol1Vf.png

The outer dial shows the 24 hours of the current day. This is in your local time, so 12 on the dial is noon local time, 18 is 6:00pm local time, etc. The needle points to both the current time and position of the sun along the inner ring

The inner ring - the sun track - has dots marking a number of positions. Solar noon is near the top, today in Portland it was at 1:04pm. Solar noon marks the point in the day with the highest solar elevation. You can use the crown to adjust the sundial and check the time of solar noon, sunset, etc. Due to our modern time zone system, this does not occur precisely at 12:00pm local time, and daylight savings time exacerbates this in many locations, including the one I live in.

https://i.imgur.com/ZJj5VDF.png

The lighter part of the sundial marks the daylight hours, and this section is asymmetrical as a result of solar noon not being at 12:00pm. The darker part, of course, is night. Another dot on the sun ring marks solar midnight, the point of lowest solar elevation. That was 1:04am this morning.

https://i.imgur.com/HWe7ZSs.png

As you can see from this screenshot, the sundial color shifts throughout the day as the color of the sky changes. It also subtly shifts from greenish-blue in the morning to purplish-blue in the afternoon.

The additional wedges and dots around sunset and sunrise mark off the different stages of twilight. There are 3 phases: Civil twilight, which starts when the sun is at -6° below the horizon and runs until sunrise in the morning, and from sunset to when the sun at -6° in the evening. Nautical twilight is when the sun is between -6° and -12° degrees. Lastly, astronomical twilight is when the sun is between -12° and -18° degrees. You can read more about twilight standards here: https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/different-types-twilight.html 

That page has a graphic that looks quite similar to the wedge markings on the solar dial face:
https://c.tadst.com/gfx/750x500/twiligh-phases.png

The 4 dots on the sun ring at twilight mark (for morning, substitute sunset/dusk for evening) correspond to astronomical dawn, nautical dawn, civil dawn, and sunrise

Right now it’s close to the equinox, so the day and night sections are about the same size. In the summer, the night section is a smaller part of the dial, in the winter, the day section becomes smaller. At high latitudes, there is no night in the summer: just a single long twilight that goes from sunset to sunrise. At very high latitudes (above the arctic and antarctic circles at ~66.5) there is not even a sunset/sunrise or twilight in summer, just 24hrs of day. The inverse is of course true in the winter. The solar dial face will use your location to show the correct day and night sizes for where you are and what time of year it is.

Finally, the clock dial just shows the current local time. It is attached to the sundial needle, and will always be on the dial opposite of the sun. The clock face is translucent, showing a blurred view of the sundial behind it. The segments around the digital clock face represent seconds. The colors of the complications also subtly shift throughout the day, although unlike the older solar graph face, they don’t turn orange and sunset and sunrise (perhaps because so much of the dial is still blue?)

Finally, enjoy this album showing how the color shifts throughout the day: https://imgur.com/a/Z4eh6fl",AppleWatch,1027

\- Full undergrad cost of attendance.

**When walking/driving outside of buildings:**

\- Each video also has at least 10 fun facts that I feel really define that school. I hand picked these after reading from Fiske's Guide, Princeton Review guide, reviews from students at [unigo.com](https://unigo.com/), and online about the colleges. After reading hundreds of comments about each college, you end up with a ""feel"" for what's unique and what's the same everywhere.

\- Half the vids are in 5k and have drone/walking footage on the main quad, library and student center (I only went to those places so comparisons are easier). The other half is in 4k and being updated with better footage as I get to visit them (it's become a hobby/goal to visit all top 100)

\- \~20 videos have 360 drone footage, if you ever wished you were a bird, you'll enjoy these :)

&amp;#x200B;

**Pro tips for more immersive playback**

1. Youtube tends to default to 720p – 1080p playback, which is too low for 360° video. Click the settings icon on the youtube player and manually adjust to 4k or higher for better quality.
2. Playback on your phone/ipad tends to be much smoother than playback on PC (unless your PC has dedicated graphics card)
3. For the most immersive experience, play back on your computer in full screen mode and scroll down on your mouse. You’ll get about 1-2 notches on your scroll wheel before the page itself starts to scroll down. This is the widest view, press Page Up to go back up to the top of the video and enjoy the wider field of view!

**These 2 college application advice videos should be especially helpful:**

\- Some thoughts and insights after visiting these top colleges: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3da\_vxtEvo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3da_vxtEvo)

\- Advice for the applications themselves, this one is very specific: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFWAuIF-YBg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFWAuIF-YBg)

\- Will be coming out with a video shortly that analyzes the data l collected on the top 150 colleges. I think the college selection process is highly subjective and emotional. I try to strip that away by looking at just the data, which gives a lot more clarity to how one should think about the shortlist process.

**My background:**

I don't offer paid services, just trying to give back.

I was a full ride Stamps Scholar at Georgia Tech and did my B.S. in Industrial Engineering with a M.S. in Econ.

I've been working full time with high school students in a counselor/mentor role for 6 years.

My students have gotten acceptances to UPenn, Columbia, Duke, Georgetown, UCLA, NYU, GT, BC, BU, UGA, and $100+k in annual merit scholarships.

###As teams are either playing their final non-conference game before conference play or are opening their conference schedule with a less than marquee matchup, this week's slate is pretty unremarkable on paper at least. Here's your top 25 schedule for the week (all times Eastern):


No. 1 Clemson at Syracuse | 7:30 p.m. | ABC  
No. 2 Alabama at South Carolina | 3:30 p.m. | CBS  
No. 3 Georgia vs. Arkansas State | 12 p.m. | ESPN2  
No. 4 LSU vs. Northwestern State | 7:30 p.m. | SEC Network  
No. 5 Oklahoma at UCLA | 8 p.m. | FOX  
No. 6 Ohio State at Indiana | 12 p.m. | FOX
No. 7 Notre Dame vs. New Mexico | 2:30 p.m. | NBC  
No. 8 Auburn vs. Kent State | 7 p.m. | ESPN2  
No. 9 Florida at Kentucky | 7 p.m. | ESPN  
No. 10 Michigan: OFF  
No. 11 Utah vs. Idaho State | 4:15 p.m. | Pac-12 Networks  
No. 12 Texas vs. Rice (NRG Stadium in Houston) | 8 p.m. | CBSSN  
No. 13 Penn State vs. Pitt | 12 p.m. | ABC  
No. 14 Wisconsin: OFF  
No. 15 Oregon vs. Montana | 10:45 p.m. | Pac-12 Network  
No. 16 Texas A&amp;M vs. Lamar | 7 p.m. | ESPNU  
No. 17 UCF vs. Stanford | 3:30 p.m. | ESPN  
No. 18 Michigan State vs. Arizona State | 4 p.m. | FOX  
No. 19 Iowa at Iowa State | 4 p.m. | FS1  
No. 20 Washington State at Houston | 9:15 p.m. ET Friday | ESPN  
No. 21 Maryland at Temple | 12 p.m. | CBSSN  
No. 22 Boise State vs. Portland State | 10:15 p.m. | ESPN2
No. 23 Washington vs. Hawai'i | 7:30 p.m. | Pac-12 Network  
No. 24 Southern California at BYU | 3:30 p.m. | ABC  
No. 25 Virginia vs. Florida State | 7:30 p.m. | ACC Network

---
As you can see, there's no  matchup between top 25 teams this week, but at least you won't see any players taking a knee.  Here's a rundown of a few of the matchups:

Clemson vs. Syracuse-Demonstrating that Clemson is basically given a bye to the CFP, Syracuse was the only other ranked ACC team in last week's polls. They lost 63-20 to Maryland.

Florida vs. Kentucky-The upset special of the week. Voters love to rank Florida inexplicably high at the beginning of every season even though they haven't been the same since Urban Meyer skipped town. Mark Stoops may not have the greatest talent on his UK team, but he gets the best out of his players, so this could very well be one for Florida's loss column in yet another 9-4 season.

Virginia vs. Florida State-The Willie Taggart era at FSU has been a complete disaster. What was once the best program in the country has fallen to a Conference USA level of play. Taggart's seat becomes nuclear hot with a loss at Virginia. Don't expect him to last the season.

vadavkavoria,2019-09-09 01:15:00+00:00,"My mom has decided she wants to travel with us, every single time we travel.","I can’t with this woman.

You can read my post history for context but the gist is that my mom has a gigantic problem with me being gay and getting married but will not explicitly admit it to my face. She offered me 10K (that she DID NOT HAVE! And still DOES NOT HAVE!) for her not to attend my wedding and when I called her on her bluff she “realized” she was in the wrong and is working on rebuilding her relationship with me.

I’m at the point where I just want to sit in lesbian silence and not deal with her, but she’s trying. Which brings us to today...

My fiancée and I travel a lot. Mostly for fun. Sometimes for work. We were just in Portland shopping at the Nike company store 2 weeks ago and recently got back from a trip to Disneyland a few days ago. Our next travel location will be for our wedding but we also have some local, national, and international travel already in the books for next year.

So you can imagine my surprise when 1,) she wanted to know how much my Disneyland trip cost (I didn’t tell her, it’s none of her business) 2.) she wanted to know what our next trip after our wedding was (again, I didn’t tell her, it’s none of her business) and 3.) she said, and this is verbatim, “maybe I’ll get to go on the next trip with you guys, and all other trips! Wouldn’t that be so fun!” 

...it would not be fun to go on a trip with a homophobe who literally tried to buy her way out of attending my wedding. 

I asked her if she does the same with my brothers, asking if she can tag along on their trips. She said she doesn’t do that because I’m a girl and “you always stay close to the girl!” Total barf. She should have thought about being close before she went full metal homophone on me a few months ago. 

I let her know that traveling with us was not and will NEVER be a possibility. Cue guilting, fake tears, “you don’t want your own mom on vacation with you?!” No, while I’m banging my wife in the hotel room the last thing I want is your raggedy ass trying to knock on the door to snoop on us. And I told her that. And then I hung up.

The entitlement is mind-boggling to me. I can’t believe she would even think I’d entertain the idea of her traveling with us. She tried to play the “but I’m the mom!” card but being a mom doesn’t absolve you of getting off scot-free when you treat people like shit. Total vomit.",JUSTNOMIL,2088

Rocket_Robby,2019-07-28 13:47:19+00:00,My Custom Hockey League Made Through NHL 19,"Hey everyone, some friends suggested to me that I should show on Reddit what I spent a 100+ hours in the past year working on in NHL 19. I’ve always enjoyed creating custom jerseys, so I decided this year I’d create an entirely new league with 31 custom made teams by me. I called it the North American Hockey Association (NAHA). I replaced all of the southern NHL cities with new Canadian and American city based teams for this league. It was a ton of fun and I figure I might as well show others who’d be interested to see how it turned out. Personal favorites of mine by division are: Halifax, New Jersey, Milwaukee, and Portland. But I’m honestly happy with all 31 of them and expect everyone to have different favorites!

I really wish I was able to bring custom logos into the game....hopefully some year. Also really wish I could make it downloadable to the community like you can in NBA 2K. I did however make the most with what was available to me, whether it was custom logos, classic logos, or ECHL logos. But anyways, feel free to let me know what you think of it!

BridgeCityBus,2019-07-17 07:08:14+00:00,TriMet’s ”worst day of the year”.,"No TLDR, this is just another story of my life as a bus operator. 

Who got stuck in traffic on Friday night?  I’m guessing anyone who was on the roads after about 3pm had a hard time getting home.  My folks, who usually have a 50 minute drive home spent over 3 1/2 hours in their car on Friday evening.

From what I understand, there was a jumper on an 84 overpass around 12th, closing down part of the highway. There was a deadly crash on Stafford road that closed that down (I have since learned that it was a family acquaintance who lost his life). 1-5 had a rollover that caused major traffic and I think shut down part of it. There was a head-on collision on Farmington Road caused by street racing and ending in at least one casualty. This all happened in a short amount of time and caused all of the side streets to back up with tons of traffic, leading to a major gridlock in downtown. Then, as soon as downtown started to clear up a bit, there was a shooting somewhere between 5th and 1st on SW Burnside, shutting down part of the transit mall.  

Oh my goodness, that night’s shift as a bus operator was a hard one!!  Pretty much all of the bus lines were affected. Everyone was running late, some bus lines over an hour and a half late. Usually we are supposed to (and able to) adhere to a very strict schedule that is sometimes by the second. Friday night was not one of those nights.  Instead of paying attention to how many minutes late I was, I tried to keep track of where my leader bus was as well as where my follower may be, just to keep my bus coming at similar time increments. I made sure that I gave myself breaks long enough to walk around for a bit and use the restroom.

With unexpectedly heavy traffic comes super aggressive drivers on the road. Otherwise quiet Portland streets were filled with honking horns, people flipping each other off, and cyclists almost getting run over. It was total chaos!

And of course it was a usual Friday night, with a lot of new faces and fewer of my trusted regulars. Uber and Lyft clogging the lanes when the bars close and sleepy, drink customers I have to worry about falling asleep and missing their stops.

A few highlights of my evening:

I had two wailing, crying children to listen to for about 45 minutes. They were old/big enough to fill the bus with glass-shattering screams. As much as I love the sound of tiny voices on my bus, this was too much to handle on a day like today. I do have an incredible amount of respect for the father, though. He was holding both of his little, tired kiddos on his lap and was calm and reassuring the entire time. His kids were tired and just wanted to be home. He understood this and let his kids express their exhaustion without yelling at them...something I considered for a split second (maybe two). 

I got a mystery liquid on my hand from some dude’s wheelchair as I was securing it. He was drunk and obnoxious and smelled of vomit.  I assume it was vomit. I’m glad I carry a ton of hand sanitizer with me.  During his ride, he asked several other passengers if they could give him weed, causing an older gentleman to come up to me and alert me that there was illegal activity happening on the bus. Hahaha. Oh well. 

I watched as a car tried to drive around me to cut me off (as I was traveling down the road in the ONLY lane, at the speed limit!!), only to drive into the bike lane, run two bikes off the road and almost run over a third. I see a lot of bad driving everyday, most of it I assume is by folks who are unfamiliar with the roads, but no amount of ignorance is an excuse for this behavior. I would bet that this guy’s brand new BMW will be totaled inside 6 months.  I just hope he doesn’t hurt anyone else in the process.

I had someone board my bus to stand way too close to me and ask where to connect to another bus. I looked it up for him, taking precious time off my schedule (that I had finally caught up to), only for him to then change his mind and want to connect to a different bus. So I looked that one up as well. He then decided that he was going to stay put on my bus, even though I told him that I didn’t go anywhere close to where the other lines went. He didn’t sit down, but instead stood right behind the yellow line for the entirety of his ride.  For that 30 minutes or so, I stressed about his intentions or if he would then find himself in a pickle and expect more help from me. This was at the end of the night and most buses on the road were the last for the day of service. Thankfully he got off without an issue. 

Teenagers let off a fart bomb and then sprayed what I assume to be an entire bottle of cheap perfume to try to counter it. It took everything in me to not call them all little assholes and scold them like I was their mama. 

On my deadhead back to the garage after a long, exhausting night, most of my windows were still down (from the fart/perfume shenanigans) as I was heading west across the St. John’s Bridge. As soon as I made that left turn, my bus filled with the smell of the forest floor. A damp, sweet, earthy smell that always makes me feel at home. I let out a big sigh as I felt my shoulders finally fall and my eyes teared up a bit.  It was a memorable moment of relaxation.

For the remainder of my deadhead I sang out my happy songs that are my go-to in moments like this. Some days I will quietly sing or hum “Build Me Up Buttercup” as I drive folks around the city. It keeps me smiling and helps me concentrate on the road. 

When I got back to the garage, I was so happy to see the usual spotter. I’m actually always happy to see him. A spotter is the person who checks you in and tells you where to park your bus at the end of the night. They also empty the fare box and I’m sure have many other responsibilities that I am just not aware of.  He was surprised to see me, as last time I told him that I was going on vacation. It was a very short vacation. He laughed and said, “And you came back just in time for the worst day of the year, huh?”  He has been working all night as buses returned incredibly late and operators were on their last nerve.  I think it would be super fun to be a spotter. They are the first face us operators see at the end of our shift. There is just enough time to share about a minute worth of what happened or how we are feeling. Even that little bit of debriefing can help a tremendous amount, and I bet he hears it all!!

On my way home I stopped at 7 Eleven to pick up some water (we were on a boil notice in my neighborhood). I forgot the water and got two tall boys instead (oops). I’ve gotten pretty familiar with the gentleman who works graveyard shift, since I swing by every other week or so and grab some beer to end my night with. The first thing he mentioned was that his bus never showed up that day and he had to change his plans so he could make it to work.  I asked him what time he was supposed to catch it and where.  It is very likely that it was MY bus, or the one right before me.  Small world!!

That night I enjoyed my two beers in my garden as I reflected on my day. I’m proud of myself for not losing my shit. Turns out I have a lot more “last nerves” than I thought I did. Each bad day at work feels like preparation for an even worse day. If this was the “worst day of the year”, according to the spotter, then I’m pretty confident that I’ve got it in me to do this job for years to come. So BRING IT ON!!",Portland,1015

- McCollum
- Hood
- Blake
- Whiteside

That team has to be in title contention the next 3-4 years. Dame/Blake/CJ as a trio can match up with anyone and you've got Whiteside for Elite Defense. 

The deal would have to be Bazemore/Nurkic for Blake to match salary but as much as Portland loves Nurkic he is not Blake Griffin. You do the deal and go for it now.",nba,2324
xesaie,2019-07-15 02:12:47+00:00,AITA for giving a dying man booze against his children's wishes?,"This is my first ever actual Reddit post, so please forgive any social faux pas &gt;&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, this is an old story, but something that's been bugging me for \*years\*

&amp;#x200B;

Back in the late '90s, I moved down to Portland, Oregon for work.  When I first got down there, I was subletting a place from a friend of the family, let's call him ""E"".  E had been a friend of my dad's since elementary school, and they were still quite close.  He was also a man of vices - a recovering alcoholic, and a not-recovering chain pipe smoker.  Both of these things relate to the story to come.

&amp;#x200B;

So about a year after i started renting from E, his cancer came out of remission, and it was BAD.  Like 6-9 months to live bad.  As I was the only one living with him (his nearest kids lived about an hour away), I did a lot to help him out for a while - at least until things got really bad, at which point I moved out, and one of his daughters moved in to help on the last few months of his life.  All of that was fine, and made sense.  

&amp;#x200B;

So here's the AITA.  I had conflicts with his kids a lot during the months I was still there -- things like them wanting me to lie about his prognosis, and me not wanting to do it, things like that (he appreciated the honesty).  The big thing was along a similar vein though -  Like I said, E was an ex-alcoholic.  His family had staged an intervention 5-10 years before, and he'd gone along with it but was never happy.  So one day, he basically says ""Listen, I'm going to die soon and I'd really like some single-malt scotch.  Here's some money, go down to the Liquor store and buy me some &lt;brand x&gt;"".  

&amp;#x200B;

I was happy to do it.  To me, this was a case of ""he's dying anyways, he's not going to risk his work, maybe this will help him suffering and he can die with the things he likes"".  So, I went down, bought the required booze, brought it back, and returned his change.  When his kids found out, they were livid, and in at least one case, they've still never forgiven me - it was the end of the relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

To them, alcohol had been the ruination of their dad, and between that and the diagnosis thing, I'd betrayed him and them.  To me, I was just helping a dying man die as painlessly and happily as he could, they weren't there, and it's not like it was going to impact his career or anything.

&amp;#x200B;

So lay it to me straight:  AITA?",AmItheAsshole,1054

TakpakMagoo,2019-07-13 18:38:39+00:00,What players are closest to becoming their franchise's all-time leading scorer?,"Pending no other big off-season moves, no team will have its franchise's all-time leading scorer at the start of next season ([https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cchb1n/with\_russell\_westbrook\_being\_traded\_6\_teams\_have/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cchb1n/with_russell_westbrook_being_traded_6_teams_have/)). So, which players are closest to reaching that mark? And how close are they? 

The players in bold are each franchise's all-time leading scorer. The first two players for each team are that team's current leading scorers. Teams are sorted by how many points their all-time leading scorer has scored, from least to most. 

Next to each player is a potential scenario for them to become the new all-time leading scorer. In most cases, I tried to keep the 'PPG' number close to their PPG last season. The exceptions to that rule should be evident...I hope.

IMPORTANT. I think the majority of these hypotheticals are dumb, and that’s mainly because of how difficult it is to trade a star PG. Before you go, “NEPHEW, NEPHEW, horrible trade idea!” I would likely agree with you. Personally, I don’t think Westbrook will be traded and I don’t think they should. Anyways here is some nonsense:

**ATLANTA RECEIVES**

Russell Westbrook

**OKC RECEIVES:**

2020 1st Round Cavs Pick (1-10 Protected)

2021 1st Round Hawks Pick (Swap Worst with ATL)

John Collins

Chandler Parsons

*Why?*

Imagine Westbrook playing with shooters everywhere. The Hawks backcourt would be Westbrook running the point and Trae Young playing as an off ball combo guard. Huerter would be placed at the 3, and Reddish and Hunter would be playing the forwards. This small ball lineup would defensively be horrendous, but produce one of the difficult to stop defensively.

The Hawks would be able to afford a max contract slot in 2020 to pair with the Young Hawks and Westbrook, but if I were them I’d sign Millsap and Marc Gasol on one year deals. 

OKC will get a guy averaging 20/10 in John Collins, who replaces the loss of Jerami Grant, and getting the expiring contract of Chandler Parsons. The assets they receive will likely be two second round draft picks (if the Cavs escape the top 10 picks it would be a miracle) and a mid future 1st rounder, but gaining Collins and cap space is worth it.

**BOSTON RECEIVES**

Russell Westbrook

**OKC RECEIVES:**

Marcus Smart

Gordon Hayward

Guerchon Yabusele 

2020 Memphis 1st Round (1-6 Protected)

2020 Milwaukee 1st Round (1-7 Protected) 

*Why?*

Some people think that Westbrook and Walker don’t pair well together because they are both “ball dominant guards who in order to be successful they need to be the primary ball handler.” Uhhhhhh, have you not watched the NBA All Star game? Team LeBron stood no chance.

Boston would have on paper one of the most talented teams in the NBA. Having a big three around Westbrook, Walker and Tatum, while still have Jaylen Brown and Enes Kanter would be tremendous. Boston also dumps the disgusting contract of Gordon Hayward, and is essentially shipping away a late lottery pick and the 30th pick of the draft.

OKC receives former Oklahoma State superstar Marcus Smart who will at least be loved by the fans. The backcourt of Shai and Smart would create a very nice defensive backcourt, and having Hayward and Schroder manning the bench lineup is solid. Yabsule is Zion in Sandals and a winter coat with a dress shirt underneath, but is a PF the Celtics need on roster. OKC also getting the Memphis pick can get themselves a potential unprotected Memphis Lotto pick in 2021 if the Memphis pick falls past 1-6.

**BROOKLYN RECEIVES:**

Russell Westbrook

**OKC Receives**

DeAndre Jordan

Caris LaVert

Joe Harris

Spencer Dinwiddie

2021 Brooklyn 1st Round (Unprotected)

2023 Brooklyn 1st Round (Top 3 Protected)


*Why?*

Imagine OKC with instead of Young Harden/Westbrook/Durant big 3, you had Kyrie instead. On paper the team would be filthy, Westbrook has two iso scorers to pass to, and the drive and kicks will be hard for any team to keep up with. Maintaing Kurucus and Allen gives them a solid enough starting lineup as Durant nurses his injury. Prince will be thrown in the starting lineup as well as play sixth man during the absence. Claxton/Jaylen Hands have All NBA Rookie 3rd Team Potential.

The NBPA will be pretty mad DAJ gets traded after sacrificing to play on a contender, and he will be traded out of OKC. Harris and Dinwiddie, as well as the very talented LaVert. The picks will be in the 20s region likely, but the cap space they will be able to free and the tank can finally start.

**CHARLOTTE RECEIVES:**

Russell Westbrook

Steven Adams

**OKC Receives**

Nicholas Batum

Michael Kidd Gilchrist

Bismack Biyombo

2020 Charlotte 1st Round (Unprotected)

2022 Charlotte 1st Round (Unptotected)

2024  Charlotte 1st Round (Top 3 Protected)

*Why?*

Michael Jordan realizes that he could create the best team of dunkers the NBA has possibly seen. Westbrook/Monk/Bridges would honestly make me nbastr-, I mean league pass some Hornets games. Their fastbreaks would be insane. Charlotte becomes a playoff contender, and honestly could go to the Eastern Semis. Having a stretch 4 like Marvin Williams will expand Westbrook’s ability to help the team. As Monk, Washington and Bacon (future MIP) progress, the Hornets will be a future ECF contender. If Rozier can return to Scary Terry form, it’s bad news.

OKC taking on the horrendous contracts and getting assets will be best for them. Embracing the tank so they can eventually draft the savior, James Wiseman.

**CHICAGO RECEIVES:**

Russell Westbrook

**OKC RECEIVES:**

Otto Porter Jr

Kris Dunn

2022 1st Round (Unprotected)

2024 1st Round (Top 3 Protected)

*Why?*

The Bulls young core will be gunning for playoff experience, and will show flashes of being a top 4 seed at times. Taking the load off of LaVine allows him to shine like he did in earlier parts of the season. Coby White will get a chance to develop in a more comfortable postion, instead of being forced to carry a larger role.

OKC gets more cap free for the 2021 free agency by taking on Otto Porter. Kris Dunn is a talented young Point guard OKC can look to build on if Shai doesn’t succeed. 2 future 1st that have potential of jumping in the lottery is a good investment for them to build on.

**CLEVELAND RECEIVES:**

Russell Westbrook

Steven Adams

**OKC RECEIVES:**

Darius Garland

J.R Smith

Tristan Thompson

2022 Cavs 1st Round (Unprotected)

2024 Cavs 1st Round (Unprotected)

2026 Cavs 1st Round (Top 3 Protected)

*Why?*

Cleveland who can’t move Kevin Love decide to pair him with the UCLA alum in a last ditch effort of making a Cavs playoff run. Westbrook and Sexton will be the most energetic backcourt in basketball, and having shooters like Love, Cedi, Windler will benefit Love tremendously. 

OKC would love to take on the expiring contracts of J.R and Tristan, and couldn’t be accused of tanking when they can’t play Garland because he is already nursing an injury.

**DALLAS RECEIVES:**

Russell Westbrook

**OKC RECEIVES:**

Tim Hardaway Jr

Courtney Lee

2025 Mavericks 1st Round (Unprotected)

2027 Mavericks 1st Round (Unprotected)
 
*Why?*

Dallas is going to gun for that 8 seed that is in contention with Sacramento and San Antonio. Westbrook can take Dallas to the playoffs and beyond. The Big 3 of Westbrook, Doncic and KP will be a nightmare for defenses. Westbrook and Doncic are both elite playmakers, and Porzingis will space the floor and be a monster on the glass.

The future unprotected picks for Dallas could potentially be lottery picks if Westbrook declines hard, or KP is cursed with injuries. Adding Courtney Lee (expiring) and Tim Hardaway Jr will be nice veteran presences to help lead the tank.

**DENVER RECEIVES:**

Russell Westbrook

**OKC RECEIVES:**

Gary Harris

Mason Plumlee

Michael Porter Jr

2022 Denver 1st Round (Unprotected)

2024 Denver 1st Round (Unprotected)

*Why?*

Murray who is not known for being a great playmaker, but know as being an elite scorer, and could be paired with one of the best playmakers in basketball in Russell Westbrook. Russ and Jokic would spread the ball around beautifully, and Murray would get open shots for days. 

OKC gains a piece they can build next to in Gary Harris, and have the high reward potential Michael Porter Jr posses. Plumlee expires, and would fill the starting center role if they decide to move Adams. The future assets will help OKC build a solid team in the future.

**DETROIT RECEIVES:**

Russell Westbrook

Abdel Nader

**OKC RECEIVES:**

Reggie Jackson

Luke Kennard

Tony Snell

Khyri Thomas

2022 1st Round (Unprotected)

2024 1st Round (Unprotected )

*Why?*

Detroit has very sneaky depth, and can afford to lose young assets while still having an elite bench. Detroit’s new big three will be the best trio in the league when healthy. Svi will step up big time this year and looks to be one of the best players at Summer League. Bruce Brown shown tremendous improvement throughout last year, and Detroit will have a gem in Sekou Dombouya. Detroit would be willing to give away future picks in an attempt to gun for a top seed in the East.

OKC taking on the expiring Jackson will give them an above average PG if they don’t want to trade Adams, and acquiring guards Khyri Thomas and Luke Kennard will give them a nice future backcourt to work with, and throw in a lineup with Schroder. Two first round future picks is always nice for a rebuilding team.

**GOLDEN STATE RECEIVES:**

Russell Westbrook

Steven Adams

Clippers 2024 1st Round (Unprotected)

Clippers 2026 1st Round (Unprotected)

**OKLAHOMA CITY RECEIVES:**

Steph Curry

Draymond Green

*Why?*

(Only trade that works financially)

Because the Oakland Warriors are retiring, they need to create a new image in San Fransisco. OKC accepts the burden of Steph Curry. FREEFLACKO.

**HOUSTON RECEIVES:**

Russell Westbrook

Patrick Patterson

**OKC RECEIVES:**

Chris Paul

Issac Hartenstein

2021 Houston 1st Round (Unprotected)

2023 Houston 1st Round (Unprotected)

2025 Houston 1st Round (Unprotected)

2027 Houston 1st Round (Top 3 Protected)


*Why?*

Houston reunites Harden and Westbrook creating the best backcourt in the NBA. Westbrook’s fast style of play fits well in D’Antoni’s system and (knock on wood) he is way more durable than Paul. 

OKC will have to try to deal out Paul, as someone as competitive as CP3 would not want to be tank commander. The roster with Paul would be interesting, as CP3, Adams and Gallinari are all chippy, fiery competitors. Defensively they would be in the upper echelon of the league. The future assets they would receive would be enough to lose Westbrook.

**INDIANA RECEIVES:**

Russell Westbrook

**OKC RECEIVES:**

Myles Turner

T.J Warren

Aaron Holiday

2022 Pacers 1st Round (Top 10 Protected)

*Why?*

Indiana now is equipped with Russ’s former teammates, Oladipo and Lamb. Lamb is a knockdown shooter that pairs well with Russ, and Oladipo is a great secondary ball handler off the wing. If Oladipo recovers well, with less attention on him he could be able to dominate. Brogdon off the bench would allow either Westbrook or Oladipo to rest comfortably. Sabonis will look to be their starting 5, or would be able to play the 4 if McMillian chooses to start Goga.

OKC gains a lot of young talent that makes it so they don’t necessarily need to tank. With Myles Turner, the Thunder can trade away Adams for either another wing they could use and a future draft pick(s)

**CLIPPERS RECEIVE:**

Russell Westbrook

**Thunder Receive**

Landry Shamet

Mo Harkless

Jerome Robinson

Sindarius Thornwell

Luc Mbah Moute

2020 LAC 1st Round (Unprotected)

2021 MIA 1st Round (Unprotected)

(Tobias Harris/Sam Dekker Trade Exceptions)

*Why?*

Creating a god squad that would put its big brother to shame would be great. I can’t picture Westbrook and Paul George playing together, but they both fit well next to Kawhi. This team would have some holes to fill depth wise, but the starting lineup rivals 2017 Golden State.

OKC getting that Miami draft pick could be huge due to the uncertainty of Dragic and Butler’s future with the team, and the weak upcoming free agency class that Dragic is in. Landry Shamet is a great young guard that will stay on contract, and I have a lot of faith in Jerome Robinson’s potential.

**LAKERS RECEIVE:**

Russell Westbrook

**THUNDER RECEIVE:**

LeBron James

*Why?*

(Only trade that works financially)

LeBron is terrfied of earthquakes. FREEFLACKO.

**MEMPHIS RECEIVES:**

Russell Westbrook

Terrence Ferguson

**OKC RECEIVES:**

Josh Jackson

Kyle Anderson

Grayson Allen

Brandon Clarke

Miles Plumlee

2022 Memphis 1st Round (Unprotected)

2024 Memphis 1st Round (Unprotected)

*Why?*

Ja Morant and Westbrook have similar playstyles, and what if Ja could learn from his predecessor. The Grizzlies would be a very good fit for Westbrook because they will have great spacing due to JVal and JJJ being able to hit the tre. This team will be able to play multiple positions, and be great at switching (Crowder/JJJ/Iggy). Having Ja, Brooks, Dwight and Crowder off the bench makes their team significantly deep, and Memphis could gun at even a 6 seed. 

OKC gains Josh Jackson, who I believe can still be a star in the league. Brandon Clarke one of college’s best shot blockers and finishers gives OKC a starting 4, and they can take on Miles Plumlee’s contract. Anderson can fill a solid role. 

**MIAMI RECEIVES:**

Russell Westbrook

**OKC RECEIVES:**

Goran Dragic

Bam Abadeyo

James Johnson

2020 Heat 1st Round Pick (Unprotected)

2025 Heat 1st Round Pick (Swap Worst)


*Why?*

Westbrook already has spacing on this team from Waiters, Herro, and the floor spacing bigs of Kelly Olynyk and Meyers Legend. Westbrook and Butler will both motivate their team to succeed, and could push the Heat to an ECF visit.

OKC has Dragic on a one year deal, and he’s a good PG if they want to retain him. Bam Adebayo is a great athlete who has shown moments of being a dominant rebounder and shot blocker, and could be a great starting 5 if the Team decides to trade Adams. James Johnson fills the teams need at four for the next two years.

**MILWAUKEE RECEIVES:**

Russell Westbrook

Terrance Ferguson

**OKC RECEIVES:**

Khris Middleton

DJ Wilson

Donte DiVencenzo

2024 Milwaukee 1st Round Draft Pick (Unprotected)

*Why?*

(Only trade that works financially besides switching Middleton with Antetekounmpo)

This again is one of the only trades that financially can happen. If Westbrook or Giannis gets a defensive rebound, the fast break that ensures will be unstoppable. The Westbrook To Antetekounmpo lobs will be a thing of beauty, and they will destroy any center under the hoop.

OKC would have their franchise piece in Middleton, and get young assets in DJ Wilson and DiVencenzo

**MINNESOTA RECEIVES:**

Russell Westbrook

Andre Roberson

**OKC RECEIVES:**

Andrew Wiggins

Jeff Teague

Gorgui Dieng

2022 Minnesota 1st Round (Unprotected)

2024 Minnesota 1st Round (Top 3 Protected)

*Why?*

Minnesota finally sheds that monster contract of Wiggins and allows Towns to play with a true elite point guard. Westbrook will have Okogie and Covington as his wings, who will allow him to rest on defense as he can guard now the second best guard on offense. Jordan Bell will be an excellent cutter off the pick and roll. Off the bench Jarret Culver can space the floor for Russ, and create his own shot when Russ can’t get it to fall down. Jake Layman also is a top 20 lob catcher in the NBA.

OKC would take on the expiring Teague, and build around Wiggins. Wiggins in another environment could be the Andrew Wiggins that people envisioned him to be back in 2014. Dieng is a serviceable replacement if the Thunder try to trade Dieng away. 

**NEW ORLEANS RECEIVES:**

Russell Westbrook

**OKC RECEIVES:**

Lonzo Ball

Josh Hart

E’Twaun Moore

Darius Miller

Jason Smith

2021 New Orleans 1st Round Pick (Unprotected)

2023 New Orleans 1st Round Pick (Unprotected)

*Why?*

New Orleans would have a very athletic lineup of Westbrook/Holiday/Ingram/Zion/Hayes. They still hold knockdown shooter JJ Redick and Davis Bertans off the bench, as well as the dynamic prospect Nickel Alexander Walker.

OKC would get a load of expiring contracts and most importantly their franchise PG in Lonzo Ball. Josh Hart is another young guy that will keep the rebuilding process positive as well as being able to develop into a better playmaker.

**NEW YORK**

If you trade every eligible Knicks player to OKC all they can afford is Steven Adams and Patrick Patterson.

**ORLANDO RECEIVES:**

Russell Westbrook

**OKC RECEIVES:**

Evan Fournier

DJ Augustin

Markelle Fultz

2021 Orlando 1st Round Draft Pick (Unprotected)

2023 Orlando 1st Round Draft Pick (Unprotected)

*Why?*

Orlando with an elite PG like Westbrook could create some serious damage. The Magic have failed to place an all star next to Vucevic, and it would be a shame if they wasted his prime. Ross/Issac/Gordon are all freaks of nature that still haven’t hit their peak, and with Westbrook this team has potential to go to the ECF. Off the bench the Magic still have MCW, Iwundu, Frazier, and we still don’t know how good Bamba can be.

Markelle Fultz is the perfect PG to have when you need someone to command your tank. If he can get past his mental obstacles and physical pain, he could bounce back and be the two way star that we envisioned him to be out of college. Fournier is a good guard to have in the future that fits in most offenses, as well as a good future trade piece. Augustin is also a solid PG that is on a one year deal that you can resign for cheap.

**PHILADELPHIA RECEIVES:**

Russell Westbrook

2024 LAC 1st Round Pick (Unprotected)

**OKC RECEIVES:**

Joel Embiid

Zhaire Smith

Jonah Bolden

*Why?*

(Embiid is required to make this trade financially work)

In this scenario Philly would have two ball dominant guards in Simmons/Westbrook, and have Richardson/Harris stretching the floor. Horford is more effective as a 5 than a 4, so overall Philly’s spacing improves. 

OKC is ready to make Embiid their franchise player, making it so they trade Embiid for supporting pieces immediately. Zhaire Smith is an interesting process who could end up like a pre injury Iman Shumpert.

**PHOENIX RECEIVES:**

Russell Westbrook

**OKC RECEIVES:**

Mikael Bridges

Tyler Johnson

Aron Baynes

Ty Jerome

2020 Phoenix 1st Round (Unprotected)

2022 Phoenix 1st Round (Unprotected)

2024 Phoenix 1st Round (Unprotected)

*Why?*

The Suns in real life would think that trading Westbrook for Booker, Ayton and Saric would be a win for them, but in this dream fantasy where the Suns are competent this isn’t terrible for them. Rubio is a good all around guard and Westbrook plays somewhat similar to Donovan Mitchell so they would work fine. Booker would be playing at the win, Saric would be at the 4 and Ayton can play down low. If they retain Oubre they still have a decent bench, with Okobo, Korver (another shooter for Russ), Jevon Carter and Kaminsky. Booker wants to be on a team that can win, and this roster would definitely put them in a spot to reach the 8 seed. 

OKC would be given a high amount of future draft picks from one of the least successful franchises in Major sports. They would have Baynes who would be good to have if you want to tank and trade away Adams. They also get Mikael Bridges who is sneakily one of the best defenders in the NBA, along with the Exipiring contract of Tyler Johnson.

**PORTLAND RECEIVES:**

Russell Westbrook

**OKLAHOMA CITY RECEIVES:**

CJ McCollum

Zach Collins

2020 Portland 1st Round Pick (Lottery Protected)

*Why?*

(There’s really no reason to make this trade)

In this scenario Neil Olshey goes clubbing with Lamar Odom and thinks he sees the light. Westbrook and Lillard are the two hardest competitors in the league, and maybe in this alternate reality Westbrook plays hard but is in a situation where he feels he can take less shots. 

OKC gets a really good shooting guard for two year and a young PF/C in Zach Collins they can build by Adams.

**SACRAMENTO RECEIVES:**

Russell Westbrook

2020 OKC 1st Round Pick (Unprotected)

2020 OKC 2nd Round Pick (Unprotected)

2024 LAC 1st Round Pick (Unprotected)

**OKC RECEIVES:**

De’Aaron Fox

Marvin Bagley III

Bogdan Bogdonavic

Caleb Swannigan

Nemanja Biejencia

*Why?*

(This trade also has no business taking place)

Westbrook, Buddy Hield and Harrison Barnes fit well with each other, and could land a max slot in the 2021 Free Agency. The Kings would definitely lose some of their identity, but them getting a ton of draft picks would numb the pain.

OKC would love to take the Young core of the Kings and most teams would sell even more to have what they have going. Billy Donovan would love to try to play Bagley at the 2 and Swannigan at the three.

**SAN ANTONIO RECEIVES:**

Russell Westbrook

**OKC RECEIVES:**

DeMar DeRozan

Patty Mills

Lonnie Walker IV

*Why?*

The Spurs have a great roster to surround Westbrook with. They have sharpshooters like Forbes and Bellenelli, as well as quality wings in Rudy Gay and DeMarre Carroll. The Spurs are already loaded at PG now that Dejounte Murray returns, as well as Derrick White. Of course Aldridge can benefit from another guy who can get hot and score, and Aldridge will got lot of freebies from Westbrook’s aggressive drives. I would love to see what Pop could bring out of Russ. Tony Parker too played reckless, but Pop got him to harness it and make him a hall of famer. Westbrook is about 2x the athlete and could do even more damage.

OKC gets a great asset in DeMar DeRozan who can be a key role on a successful team if they build around Adams, or a future trade asset. Lonnie Walker is a great prospect who can do it all and is a really intelligent guy that would bring positive energy during a rebuild. Patty Mills is an expiring contract who will likely rarely see the floor, or will get traded.

**TORONTO RECEIVES:**

Russell Westbrook

**OKC RECEIVES:**

Kyle Lowry

Norman Powell

2022 Toronto 1st Round (Top 5 Protected)

2024 Toronto 1st Round (Top 5 Protected)

*Why?*

(Lol why would both parties agree to this)

Toronto fearful of Lowry’s departure makes a move that shocks the world, trading him for another star PG. Westbrook is better than Lowry, but losing him changes Toronto’s whole scheme. Regardless, Westbrook has bigs who can stretch the floor in Siakam and Gasol, and off the bench he has his old teammate Serge. His wings have room to grow in Ferguson and OG, but still solid. Van Vleet remains the face of the bench mob and can keep them in the game when Westbrook sits.

OKC with Lowry and Powell still have a sneaky team. They have depth at the guard position, and they could sneak in for that 8 seed. It would be another first round exit but OKC fans are already accustomed to that. If Lowry leaves, the Thunder would have a max slot available for them to use in 2020.

**UTAH RECEIVES:**

Russell Westbrook

**OKC RECEIVES:**

Mike Conley

George Niang

2021 Jazz 1st Round (Lottery Protected )

*Why?*

Utah taking the gamble on the Superstar fitting well with Mitchell isn’t the worst idea. The Jazz are put a spot where this is there best shot at winning a title, and Conley is a great PG, don’t get me wrong, but he isn’t a superstar like Russ. Westbrook has shooters such as Bojan and Jingles, and I think him and Mitchell would be able to push each other.

OKC taking Conley would make it so they have a better version of the 2019 Clippers in my opinion, and they would be geared to face the #1 seed Clippers. I think if OKC wants to pull the trigger on this deal they would be a playoff team still.

**WASHINGTON RECEIVES:**

Russell Westbrook

**OKC RECEIVES:**

John Wall

Rui Hachimura

Troy Brown Jr

Ian Mahinmi

*Why?*

(Only a team without a GM would make this move)

Westbrook got a star guard in Beal that compliments him very well, along with knockdown shooter C.J Miles and Bertans. The Wizards can make a playoff push with this team, and we could see Thomas Bryant win MIP. Schofield and Wagner looks promising enough, and IT hopefully can return to at least 60% of his Boston self. Brooks may elevate his coaching when around his former star PG.

OKC getting John Wall could allow them to tank the first season and get pieces around him. Hachimura I believe will have a Giannis like rise in the league and he fills in the 4 position well. Troy Brown also has through the roof potential that was not shown because of Brooks stubbornness to play him. Mahimni is expir",nba,2518

dynorex,2019-07-07 17:33:28+00:00,"The league has -NEVER- had better NBA JAM potential, so I present to you my rosters for the future GOAT basketball video game, NBA JAM 2020","NBA JAM is something I hope we’re all familiar with: teams are represented by their best frontcourt/backcourt (loosely) duo, and are graded on four criteria: speed, shooting, dunking, and defense. With the rise of super-duos in the NBA, I believe that now is the time to capitalize on what will prove to be the GOAT NBA video game: NBA JAM 2020. Here’s the teams.

*TORONTO: KYLE LOWRY AND PASCAL SIAKAM*

A lob-heavy, fast duo that does well on defense. Both players can threaten from 3pt land. Weak point: dominant big men.

Other Players: Van Vleet; Gasol, Ibaka

—

*BOSTON: KEMBA WALKER AND JAYSON TATUM*

Shooting galore! Tatum can get consistent rebounds, Kemba will outpace everyone, and the 3s will rain down from heaven above. Weak point: if the shots aren’t falling, you aren’t exactly a dominant finish-at-the-rim duo.

Other Players: Brown; Hayward

— 

*BROOKLYN: KYRIE IRVING AND KEVIN DURANT*

Arguably the most threatening shooting duo in the game. Their reputation precedes itself. Opponents will never stifle your shooting game — even if you never pass the ball. Weak point: defense — no one in your duo is a reliable steal threat, and only KD is a blocking threat.

Other Players: Dinwiddie, Levert; Jordan, Allen

—

*NEW YORK: RJ BARRETT AND MITCHELL ROBINSON*

If I were a Knicks Fan right now, I wouldn’t care about a damn thing I could possibly be writing here — I would just be happy for my young boyes whose skillsets are still developing themselves 🥰 

That being said, good luck finishing around the rim against Robinson, the some-day all time blocks leader.

Other Players: Back - Mudiay, (sorry frankie smokes, you didn’t make the cut); Randle, Knox.

— 

*PHILADELPHIA: BEN SIMMONS AND JOEL EMBIID*

Who needs to shoot anyway? Dunks are more reliable anyway, and the graphics are always way more fun. Yes, all I want to see in my WHOLE ASS LIFE is Ben Simmons lobbing a ball to the moon, while Joel does a 1980° flaming, spinning jump, catches the ball, and shatters the backboard on the way down. Weak point: Just don’t shoot 3s.

Other Players: Richardson; Front - Harris, Horford

— 

*MILWAUKEE: GIANNIS ANTETEKOUNMPO AND KHRIS MIDDLETON*

Y’all were a Kawhi away from being the runaway favorites in the east, and so far, you probably have the most well-rounded skillset in the game. Big rebounding dominance, lights-out shooting; with no glaring flaws, you’re currently the team to beat.

Other players: Bledsoe; Lopez

— 

*INDIANA: VICTOR OLADIPO AND MYLES TURNER*

A good offense-defense duo; Turner excels defensively, and Oladipo can reliably score from deep and mid range. A force to be reckoned with! Weak point: Turner isn’t a top level scorer or passer, and Oladipo isn’t going to do you many favors on defense.

Other players: Brogdon; Sabonis

—

*DETROIT: DERRICK ROSE AND BLAKE GRIFFIN*

This is a high-tier duo. They will excel at passing, dunking, driving, defending — pretty much everything except shooting, which they’ll be average at. Weak point: there’s a weird glitch where as soon as one of Griffin or Rose is Heating Up, they get injured and replaced with Ish Smith.

Other Players: Drummond

— 

*CLEVELAND: COLLIN SEXTON AND KEVIN LOVE*

With all the Kevin Love buzz right now, this might end up being Sexton and Tristan Thompson, or maybe someone else. That being said, Sexton and Love may not be top tier, but they’re actually a ton of fun — Love will contend with the best as a rebounder, and Sexton will create well as a shot maker. Weak point: If you like dunking, this isn’t the team for you.

Other Players: Osman; Nance

— 

 *CHICAGO: ZACH LAVINE AND LAURI MARKANNEN*

Admittedly, I only watched the Bulls when they played the Sixers this year, but their roster has had so much upheaval, including Robin to Milwaukee, that these are the only Bulls I could think of to rightly represent your team. I don’t imagine there will be a lot of passing, but Lavine will be a good shotmaker and Markannen will rebound well. Also, there’s a feature in the game where when things are going poorly, your duo forms a Players Council, where you get a short chemistry bonus. Weak point: defense is not your strong suit.

Other Players: Coby White?

— 

*ORLANDO: DJ AUGUSTIN AND NIKOLA VUCEVIC*

Yall have like 3 guards to choose from but Augustin hit that shot against the Raptors in Round 1, so he gets the starting spot. That’s just the rules.

Shooting is your strength! Utilize it, and hope that you can score enough points where your defense won’t matter. When you play as Orlando, you are Mike D’Antoni. Weak point: defense.

Other Players: Ross; Gordon.

— 

*CHARLOTTE: TERRY ROZIER AND BISMACK BIYOMBO*

Charlotte, you deserve better. This is a decent duo on paper, but come on, you ain’t winnin a damn thing with these boys. Weak Point: Rozier can’t defend, can sometimes shoot, and can never dunk. Biyombo can defend, but he’s slow and can’t shoot. I’m sorry.

Other Players: Batum; Kidd-Gilchrist

— 

*MIAMI: JIMMY BUTLER AND BAM ADEBAYO*

Jimmy is a great do-it-all guy, and will pretty much always meet your expectations, but when paired with Adebayo, he’s really never going to pass. That won’t change unless Miami receives another big fella. Adebayo will reliably dunk and defend, but he’ll slow down Butler. There’s a glitch in the game where Jimmy’s partner will show up as a blank face and a ??? name — that is your third stringer. Jimmy is actually unbeatable in this rare scenario. Weak point: easily outpaced; just-below-average 3pt shooting.

Other Players: Winslow; J. Johnson.

— 

*WASHINGTON: BRADLEY BEAL AND THOMAS BRYANT*

Thomas Bryant is just about as underwhelming of a partner for Beal as there could be, but that’s what happens when there isn’t a GM. Beal is good enough on his own to win some tight games though, as an all around talent. Weak point: you’ll be playing a lot of 1v2 on offense, save for a few lobs and easy dunks.

Other Players: The Ghost of John Wall; Mahinmi

— 

*ATLANTA: TRAE YOUNG AND JOHN COLLINS*

Oh hell yeah.

This might be a Stockton-Malone, Starks-Ewing level duo on paper if you covered up the part of the stat sheet that shows defense. Young is gonna do it all on offense: lobbing, shooting, passing, just no dunks — Collins will take over from there. What a duo — I’m hype in real life for this. Weak point: Trae Young turns into a traffic cone when he steps into the defensive side of the court. It’s a feature, not a glitch.

Other Players: Huerter; Len.

— 

*DENVER: JAMAL MURRAY AND NIKOLA JOKIC*

[They did the work for me.](https://sinbadtee.com/teephotos/2018/12/NBA_Jam_Nuggets_Murray_And_Jokic_Shirt.jpg)
Weak point: no obvious weak point beside my minority opinion that Jokic isn’t actually **that** good of a defender. Also, Murray is very reliant on whether or not he’s Heating Up.

Other Players: Beasley, Millsap.

— 

*PORTLAND: DAMIAN LILLARD AND JUSUF NURKIC*

Arguably the most well-rounded, top-tier duo in the game. Not a ton of lobs, and Nurkic isn’ the speediest guy, but he’ll get a lot of putback dunks and anchor the defense. Lillard will be Lillard. Weak point: potential to be good-not-great

Other Players: McCollum; Whiteside? lmao

— 

*UTAH: DONOVAN MITCHELL AND RUDY GOBERT*

This is what I’m talking about — Gobert isn’t the scorer that Malone is, and most of the points will be because of Mitchell, but aside from that, they’re very reminiscent of the
Stockton-Malone duo that dominated NBA JAM back in its heyday. Weak point: when Mitchell isn’t Hot or Heating Up, he’s actually pretty cold. A great highs-and-lows guy. 

Other Players: Conley, Ingles.

— 

*OKLAHOMA CITY: RUSSELL WESTBROOK AND STEVEN ADAMS*

I hope you don’t like 3s, and I hope you don’t mind playing back and forth all game. Westbrook and Adams isn’t nearly as fun as Westbrook and George would have been, but whatcha gonna do. Weak point: shooting, shooting, shooting.

Other Players: Schroeder; Gallinari?

—

*MINNESOTA: ANDREW WIGGINS AND KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS*

There will be a lot of 13 year olds who think “I know both of these guys’ names, they must be good!!” They will be sad. In Big Head mode, you can actually see the will-to-live leaving Wiggins’ face as the game goes by. Shame. Weak point: one of the players is Andrew Wiggins.

Other Players: Teague; Dieng.

—

*GOLDEN STATE: STEPH CURRY AND DRAYMOND GREEN*

Do I even need to explain myself? This is a top-tier duo that spammed itself to 73 wins a few years ago. Weak point: your expectations will be too high, and you’ll get mad whenever your 40 footers don’t immediately go in.

Other Players: Thompson, Russell; Looney

—

*LA LAKERS: LEBRON JAMES AND ANTHONY DAVIS*

I heard you liked Jordan-Pippen. James Davis is damn near unstoppable, and is arguably one of the two or three highest tier duos in the game. Weak point: not a great shooting duo, but you get into the lane at will, so who’s really complaining?

Other players: Kuzma, A Ham Sandwich

—

*LA CLIPPERS: KAWHI LEONARD AND PAUL GEORGE*

Far and away the best defensive duo in the game, Leonard and George can steal the ball whenever you want to tap the button. Shooting-wise, they are beyond consistent; their dunks aren’t the flashiest, but they’re always going to be viable. Let’s boil these guys down: you have two of the best 7 or 8 guys in the league here. Y’all spook me. Weak point: Not exactly the fastest duo; be careful against teams like the Kings that can run all around you.

Other Players: Williams; Harrell.

—

*SACRAMENTO: DEAARON FOX AND MARVIN BAGLEY*

This duo is probably 3 or 4 years away from being as good as I want it to be, but in my head, these guys are just way faster than anyone can handle, pass and lob the crap out of the ball, and play juuust good enough defense to stay competitive. Weak point: they’re just not **great** at any one thing.

Other Players: Hield, Giles.

— 

*PHOENIX: DEVIN BOOKER AND DEANDRE AYTON*

Step aside, good player on a bad team” takes!! Booker and Ayton are actually a ton of fun in NBA JAM!! Booker can and will shoot from **legitimately anywhere** and Ayton is the prototypical would-be-great-as-a-video-game-character basketball player (is there even like 2 other guys that would be more fun on paper?) Shooting, dunking, and speed will come naturally to you, but may God above avert his holy eyes from your defense.

Other Players: Oubre; Holmes.

— 

*HOUSTON: JAMES HARDEN AND CLINT CAPELA*

With NBA JAM, you have a chance to play Harden the way Harden wishes Harden could play — every shot comes from 3, the defense is not only optional, but also largely inconsequential, and any team shortcomings can EASILY be blamed on Capela. This is a dream scenario for Harden fans, and I’m happy you get to be a part of it. Capela will do his very best. Weak point: the defensive end will legitimately be a one man show from Capela.

Other Players: CP3; Tucker.

—

*SAN ANTONIO: DEMAR DEROZAN AND LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE*

I actually really like this team as a basketball nerd, but the truth is that aint nobody playin as DeRozan and Aldridge when all these other options exist. You’re a perfectly fine team that just will never shoot 3s, but there’s genuinely not a less-flashy duo in this game. Weak point: 3pt shooting.

Other Players: Gay; Poeltl

—

*DALLAS: LUKA DONCIC AND KRISTAPS PORZINGIS*

It’s a dream come true for the European fans here on r/nba . Doncic and Porzingis give you everything you want, from shooting, to dunks, to defending, albeit not at an elite level. Far and away the best duo of white guys this league has seen in a while, much less NBA JAM. Weak point: you won’t be outpacing too many other teams, but it might not matter. 

Other Players: Hardaway Jr.; Marjanovic (he’s not your next best bigman, but who could ever stand to let this man be left out?)

— 

*MEMPHIS: JA MORANT AND JAREN JACKSON JR.*

Young boys comin’ in hot!!! This is such a fun rebuild. Your boys haven’t shown me enough to know what to expect in this game, but I like them anyway and they clearly have no weak points whatsoever. I love rebuilds so much.

Other Players: Bradley, Valanciunas. If you use these guys instead of the young guys, you get softlocked out of the game. Sorry, I don’t make the rules.

— 

*NEW ORLEANS: LONZO BALL AND ZION WILLIAMSON*

A pass-happy point guard paired up with the NBA JAM 94’s version of Charles Barkley? This is dangerous stuff. You’re an above average defensive team, and only a few teams can keep up with your speed. As it stands, you won’t be shooting too well, but it’s all good — you’re a fan favorite, and that’s all that matters.

Other Players: Redick; Ingram.

The Lakers needed to expand the deal to create optimum salary cap space, and Pelinka executed the deal to completion with Washington's interim GM Tommy Sheppard and New Orleans EVP of Basketball Operations David Griffin over the past few days.

The Lakers are expected to pursue several scenarios in free agency, including Brooklyn Nets guard D'Angelo Russell, who is a restricted free agent now -- and Toronto star Kawhi Leonard, league sources said. If the Lakers decide to break up the money, they're interested in several combinations of players including Toronto Raptors Danny Green, Orlando Magic Terrence Ross, Portland Trail Blazer Seth Curry and several other free agents with a strong shooting ability.

Do you guys agree with Frye that the Portland Trailblazers should trade for Kevin Love when he is making an average of $25M for the next 4 years? 

What would that trade even look like? 

The expirings of Meyers Leonard, Maurice Harkless, and Evan Turner for Kevin Love would likely be the deal, but how many draft picks would the Blazers have to give up here? Also would they need to get someone else in return like a J.R. Smith and add a Skal Labissiere or Anfree Simons to the deal so their bench isn't completely scrapped?",nba,1136

Allegorithmic,2019-06-20 07:25:44+00:00,I asked OpenAI's new language model what it thought about the currently ranked top 10 players and their teams,"After seeing [this post on the NFL subreddit the other day](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/c1f4wd/i_let_an_ai_language_model_rank_the_top/), I thought I'd give OpenAI's GPT-2 language model a whirl and see what it could come up with if I fed it names of the top 10 NBA players going into the 20-21 season. If you're unfamiliar, this is the same language model used on /r/subredditsimulator, and works by predicting the next word it thinks will occur in a chain of text. This particular model is based on 40GBs worth of text all over the internet, and thus can be sporadic and nonsensical at times.

I haven't modified any of the text and simply fed it each player's first and last names as a key to complete a few paragraphs. Most have been trimmed as the generator only spits out 1,000 word blocks and would usually end in the middle of a sentence. These were the ones I found the funniest / most interesting. 

**10. LeBron James**

For a while, he just looked ahead more, like he was trying to make sure that all-time winning numbers stick with him the rest of his life. After all, no matter how many title rings he had, it felt like they were always going to feel like he missed them. Then James came to Cleveland in 1995, where his legacy had changed, and he won a total of 14 championships -- which included nine titles during his tenure while in charge in Miami and a pair of championships in Cleveland while playing there. LeBron James has won 15 championship rings during his career and 14 of his 15 titles are his first. That's a total of 26.

**9. Joel Embiid**

Embiid is still the league's most underrated player. He has been compared to LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo, but he is actually ahead of both when it comes to average per minute production – which is a measure of how well his team does its job while the other players are on the court. He's sixth in offensive PER for starters, behind only James, James Harden, LeBron, Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant. There isn't much better in the league besides that stat, and the Warriors aren't sure if he even plays much as a player.

**8. Paul George**

Paul george's next season will be very different as well. If they can get the roster together, and manage to find the right mix of players with the same philosophy for the season that they should, then they can win in an exciting, entertaining way. This team is going to be a major challenge for the Bruins.

**7. Nikola Jokic**

Nikola jokic joker-joke-joker; I will use the word ""Jokic"" in the final sentence. Nikola jokic is playing without a doubt the better side in that role.

But his shooting numbers still haven't picked up, and his passing hasn't been very consistent. In fact, he has only shot more than 50% from the field the past three seasons but has only been able to average around 11 points per game when going the route of isolation plays. Nikolajagic is also averaging under five points per game when taking over the fourth line with a center on the wing.

To make matters worse, Nikolajagic is the team's third best shot creator, getting nearly 60% of his shots.

The Nuggets have been the team in transition this season, averaging 12.7 points in that category. Nikolajagic, although he has managed a respectable 0.97 PER of his own, has missed 25.7% of his free throws. It is likely that this drop in quality of competition is related to the lack of production for Nikolajagic in the fourth line.

**6. Damian Lillard**

Damian lillard is no exception to the rule of not giving you much hope for the Portland Trail Blazers this season. Lillard has the potential to be even worse than last year in terms of shot blocking and defending the basket. Lillard is averaging a double-double (17.9 PPG, 8 RPG) per game, but only average 17.8 FTA per game, leading to a league-worst 1.9 FGA per possession. Portland's defense might be the worst in the league, allowing an average of just 19.1 FTA per game, a number which includes four turnovers. With Portland taking away the Blazers' top player, Damian Lillard, on both ends this season the Blazers will take advantage of their lack of defensive options to start losing games by an alarming margin. The Portland Trail Blazers are not a bad team. They absolutely are not a great team. However, as bad as they are they do have a fairly nice roster which includes a potential All Star in guard Damian Lillard, and a future first rounder. I would think the Blazers should be able to win the Southwest Division, and potentially contend a bunch of other division races including the East, Southwest, West and Central. The key for Portland this season will be to keep trying to score, guard and not give away big points while still keeping everyone on a consistent enough level of performance to allow the Blazers access

**5. Kevin Durant**

""Kevin durant achilles! What a night! There was a lot of fun at the game. It was fun to watch everyone fight (the fans). That's something I definitely look forward to in the future."" -- Raptors GM Masai Ujiri 

""It was an amazing experience. All three of those guys were phenomenal tonight,"" said Ujiri about James. ""It was a heck of a game all around for us. We were lucky enough to have a good lineup, we were able to have guys like Kyrie, (Iman) McGee, DeMar (DeRozan), Monta (Lillard) and (Curry) coming out on the floor. They came in here and did some stuff that didn't make sense. We're pretty much in complete control of this team. And I felt like that game, it was a good win for us.""

What the Raptors and their fans can look forward to in 2020: A championship. They're trying to win a second title this season.

**4. Stephen Curry**

Stephen curry is a delicious and affordable curry with a simple flavor profile. Like many other curry dishes you'll notice that it's easy to make, easy to process and it tastes pretty damn good. If you're a fan of Indian food then this is a perfect recipe for the holiday of December and January.

How to make kiracha curry

Kiracha can be cooked almost anywhere except in the hottest of homes in the South, this is because of its intense heat but also because its a relatively easy spice to harvest.

**3. James Harden**

James harden's beard - in the nick of time

""I was really excited about the prospect of learning how to grow facial hair, that's what I wanted - as I did with my beard. I was also really excited by what a beard could mean to my life. I had never used my own facial hair before, but this week as I did a beard makeover, it became apparent we didn't have to be cut,"" he says. ""With my new beard, I was so pleased I could walk outside and say hello to the people I used to meet and talk to. The effect has been to make me a little bit less insecure about whether I'm going to be accepted into the local community. People are talking about it and asking if it's okay that I wear my hair down"". ""We were so surprised to see people's reactions, it was a shock.

""It was a very humbling process for me, I know people find it embarrassing sometimes - that's just the nature of human nature - and one thing I know I've never had was somebody look at me funny. With hair down my face, people really do not notice you,"" he continues.

**2. Giannis**

Giannis Antetokounmpo (or simply Antetokounmpo for short) is an elite point guard in the NBA, and I think a lot of the discussion has always been about being able to defend Giannis or defend other elite point guard's. While that's true, there are also a number of other aspects to this to consider that should be addressed. This is a little tricky when trying to find a definitive answer, but given how Giannis is getting older and more comfortable on defense, it's probably worth diving into.

I know, this is a pretty big assumption right now, and like I said earlier, I'm not a big fan of this line of thinking. I personally believe that most of the people who like Giannis tend to do so because of his skill set and ability, but there are some questions about the defense as a whole.

Now, as I am always open to discussion and suggestions, or for me personally doing some research, there's really only one way I can see a possible answer for the above questions to work.

**1. Kawhi Leonard**

Kawhi leonard, who is widely regarded as the greatest athlete to ever play the game, is now taking his career to the next level to help build awareness for autism.

Leonard, a former NFL running back, has taken his own life in his sleep, and he and his wife are sharing a video of their journey with fans to raise awareness for autism in sports.

""You gotta believe that we are not alone,"" said Leonard in a video that has been viewed more than 11 million times. ""This world is so big, people have gotten used to the lack of awareness of autism. We have to believe that we are not alone.""",nba,4925

&amp;#x200B;

In the spring of 1993, Katheryne ""Katie"" Eggleston graduated from Oregon State University with a BA in English. On the cusp of a seemingly bright future, she vanished on her first day at a new job on August 2, 1993.

&amp;#x200B;

After graduating from OSU, Katie moved in with her older sister Janet in a suburb immediately east of Portland. She had taken a sales representative job with Allnet, a telecommunications company based in Lake Oswego. On the morning of August 2, she had completed a business meeting and made several stops at a bank, a Burger King, and a gas station. In the afternoon, she was seen speaking on the phone (presumably about sales) in the now-former Port of Portland office building just two blocks from the Lloyd Center (a shopping mall). Several witnesses reported that she looked ""worried"" or ""preoccupied."" Around 2:15pm one of her clients witnessed her coming off the building's elevator accompanied by an unidentified man wearing a blue blazer. He was described as having dark hair and a dark complexion. This was the last known sighting of Katie.

&amp;#x200B;

At 5pm, she was due for a meeting with her supervisor in Lake Oswego, but never showed up. Her car was apparently seen still parked in the Port of Portland building's lot shortly before 5pm. However, in the early hours of the following day, a security guard found her vehicle parked in an industrial lot nine miles away in the 12000 block of NE Airport Way. It was unlocked with its windows rolled down and the keys were in the ignition. Katie's purse and belongings, including cash and credit cards, were located inside, though her Allnet binder and passport were missing. There were no signs of a struggle.

&amp;#x200B;

On August 3 Katie's family reported her missing after she failed to return home. Searches turned up no evidence. Police suspicion immediately fell on Katie's boyfriend, but he provided an alibi that was verified by law enforcement. Subsequently, police chased a theory that Katie had left of her own accord in order to avoid testifying in a tax evasion case against her sister Janet. The Egglestons, however, believed their daughter had been met with foul play, possibly by someone she knew. They hired a retired Oregon State Police detective who produced several leads, but none proved useful. In October of 1993, law enforcement continued to maintain Katie had willingly disappeared, citing her missing passport and the tax evasion case (even though Janet had pled guilty to the charges, meaning Katie wouldn't have had to testify).

&amp;#x200B;

Law enforcement maintained their runaway theory until 2004, when 19 year old Brooke Wilberger vanished from Corvallis, Oregon on May 24, 2004. Brooke was last seen cleaning lamp posts on the edge of the OSU campus. Her disappearance was linked to a rapist and suspected serial killer named Joel Patrick Courtney, a native of Beaverton. Courtney, who was known to travel between Mexico, Alaska, New Mexico, Florida, Arizona, and Oregon, has a long history of substance abuse, mental illness, and criminal offenses. In 2009 Courtney pleaded guilty to aggravated murder. He led investigators to Wilberger's remains in exchange for life imprisonment (instead of the death penalty). The FBI named him as a suspect in three other unnamed cases. So far, he has been cleared in two of those three, and it is speculated that the third unnamed case belongs to Katie given the proximity to Wilberger's murder and similar appearance and age. As of now, however, there is no evidence linking him to Katie's disappearance.

&amp;#x200B;

Katie's parents (both now deceased) believed throughout the investigation that she was abducted and murdered. Katie had no history of mental illness or runaway behavior and was reportedly very close to her family and extended family.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I do think she was unfortunately abducted and murdered. By who, and exactly how, I have no idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps Joel Patrick Courtney could have abducted her in the parking lot and returned sometime between 5pm and midnight to move her car to the industrial lot near the airport. He may have taken and disposed of her passport to throw police off. But then you'd have to assume he used his own vehicle (similar to how he abducted Brooke) and I would hope some witness would've seen it. It would also mean he would've had to walk the nine miles between the industrial lot and the Port building (either before or after dropping off Katie's car), unless he had an accomplice who could drive the other vehicle. He'd also have to know his way around the area, especially if he walked the distance. Not to mention the possibility of being spotted by passers-by. 

&amp;#x200B;

That makes me think it's unlikely Courtney was involved. Possible, but unlikely, especially since the FBI have already cleared him in two of the three cases they're looking at.

&amp;#x200B;

Then there's the man on the elevator, who was seen by the one witness. Was he just a bystander taking the elevator with Katie? Did he work at the building? Did the witness watch him leave with her? Is this sighting just a red herring?

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think happened to Katheryne Eggleston?

I also had two speeding tickets and one for a broken tail light on my driving record at time of hire. All went well for a couple of months. I did my job and kept to my self.

He wouldn't hear it, my last day was friday. I didn't show it but I was pissed.

The very next thing he told me to do was to pull an airplane into the hangar and wash it. Now, this is very illegal as the chemicals used to clean the planes would drain in to Columbia River Slew and you're supposed to pay a service elsewhere at the airport to do it in an environmentally safe fashion. It's like $1000.

The drains in the hangars were supposed to be welded shut to prevent this and they were, but someone had made it to where the whole cap, weld and all, would just come off, exposing the drain. I told Pete I wasn't comfortable doing. He said tough shit do it. I complied.

But seriously? How dumb are you? Tell me I'm losing my livelihood unfairly, then tell me to break federal law, FAA regulations, and god knows what else!? 

These mortals would fucking pay! 

My first action after arriving home was to place a call to the EPA. I didn't expect to talk to anyone as it was after hours, but somehow I got connected to an inspector. He was very interested to say the least. I made sure to tell him about everything. I was even more helpful and told him that if he showed up at exactly 3pm the next day that he would catch me in the act of washing a plane.

Upon arriving at work at 2pm the next day I went to talk to ""Michelle"" the parts lady, who was also the main company gossip. I expressed to her my extreme frustration over losing my job in such an unfair way and also my dismay about how the company was forcingvme do things that were illegal and that it sure would be terrible if someone ever caught them. Super subtle right?

Lo and behold! At exactly 3pm who comes strolling into the hangar but a portly middle-aged guy with a poloroid camera around his neck and a id badge that just screams federal inspector! He walks right up to Pete introdces himself as much.

Meanwhile, I had ceased any pretense of working and was just watching my chaos unfold! Pete was at a total loss, totally flat-footed with no idea what to do or say. Finally he noticed me. He tried to tell me to do something, but i don't recall what. When he did I just took a second to consider. Finally I said ""Nah, I think I quit instead. Fuck-off Pete."" And then walked out.

The look on Pete's face when he realized he was on his own and no one was gonna be there to help him or to blame was classic. I remember it to this day 20 years later!

Pete ended up losing his job of course. So did the site HR person and the even the site CEO! Apparently what they were doing was pretty egregious and the EPA called in the FAA who went through everything with a fine toothed comb. I heard from a friend who still worked there that as well as the firing of the managers, the company was fined around $200k when all was said and done plus legal fees, chemical clean-up fees, and the loss of revenue from that hub for about a month while they were suspended during investigations.

All in all I felt like it was a pretty even trade at the end of the day 😈",ProRevenge,3855

Sometimes you should trap. Sometimes you should do all of those things in rapid succession. A lot of those strategies are in direct conflict.,"http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26783313/how-golden-state-reclaimed-juggernaut-style

&gt; The inherent challenge of Golden State (with or without Durant) is that there is no one catch-all answer to defending them, or even to defending any one of their players over any single possession. Sometimes, you should switch. Sometimes, you should roam. Sometimes, you should trap. Sometimes, you should do all of those things in rapid succession.

&gt; A lot of those strategies are in direct conflict. Say you are a shot-blocker defending Green on one wing while Curry dribbles on the other. You should get ready to help at the rim on Curry's drive, right? But wait! Green is setting an off-ball screen for Thompson. Your job is to switch such actions. How can you switch outside onto Thompson and help inside on Curry?

&gt; You can't. If you're switching you can't help, and if you're helping you can't switch, and trying to figure out which to do depending on a dozen variables -- who has the ball, how much time is left on the shot clock, what other Warriors are on the floor, whether Joe Lacob is taunting you -- can plunge the smartest defenders into a haze.

&gt; ""It's like you're in a boat with three holes in the bottom,"" Jeff Bzdelik, Houston's former defensive coordinator, told me last season, ""and you only have two pegs to plug them. You just have to keep moving the pegs around.""

&gt; In convincing opponents they need to help so dramatically off every non-shooter -- that a threat could appear anywhere, that you need to be all places at once -- the Warriors mind-trick them into helping on ghosts.

&gt; ""They cause a lot of confusion,"" Meyers Leonard says days after the Warriors swept Portland. ""It's incredibly difficult to be a help defender and then be up at the screen. It feels awkward. Help defense against the Warriors is totally different when they are playing that old Warriors style. It's not normal. You never know what's coming.""",nba,2409

brynntense,2019-05-15 03:55:36+00:00,I only let my son bring his math homework onto this four hour flight and it’s YOUR fault he’s uninterested in it,"Part-time lurker, am on mobile, etc.

TL;DR since I can’t keep anything short: woman brings her son on a two hour flight and he’s allowed to do his homework and *only* his homework. He gets bored enough to ask what *I’m* doing, and then I am obviously the reason he’s unable to focus and my writing my thesis is something that can obviously be put aside for a kid’s fucking algebra.

Before I really get into this, you’ll need some background. Here are all the phrases that are relevant most likely to make you gag and hit that back button but bear with me:

-I’m getting my MFA 
-I’m writing my novel for my thesis
-This happened on the way to a writer’s convention in Portland, so this was a little over a month ago

Now if that pretentious-sounding shit didn’t turn you off of reading anything I have to write, I’ll continue. I swear it’s relevant. 

(If you read that picturing a woman with a beret smoking outside a local café riddled with ennui, I will instead offer you the image of a woman drinking boxed moscato from a hotel coffee mug while stranded somewhere in Kansas with nothing better to do, because I have to go through Kansas every time I go see my parents and sometimes I *like* feeling like I don’t exist).

ANYWAY.

This, of course, happened on a plane, because planes are nightmarish, bacterial suffer-tubes and they have too much power over me. It’s also where entitled people in general seem to cluster.

I won’t bother with abbreviations. I’d call her Karen but I know a good amount of Karens who are great, and she looked more like a Brenda. Her son was actually a cool little dude. I’ll call him Kiddo because I’m secretly a hip youth pastor.

Now Brenda did *not* have that “can I speak to your manager” haircut because I haven’t seen one of those in the wild since 2008, but her ombré was poorly done, and she *did* look like a General Manager at a Chico’s who would condescendingly kick me out for looking too poor, so maybe that’s the new thing. So, even without the “trademark” hair, I could tell she was going to be a pleasure once she started loudly (not yelling, but not trying to be discreet) complaining to someone on her phone (this was well before takeoff, she did put it away when she was supposed to) about this “disrespectful slut” across from her. Admittedly, I looked to see what the big deal was. The “slut” in question? Was breastfeeding a baby with a huge blanket covering everything. Babies need to eat, Brenda.

Now, this was my first flight with assigned seating because I usually don’t use this airline, and don’t plan to do so again, I just wanted the direct flight instead of two hour layover. So I had reserved an aisle seat, Brenda was at the window, and Kiddo was next to me. I noticed him pull out what I guessed was a textbook (he looked like 11 and I haven’t been in middle school for well over ten years I don’t know) and a notebook. Not the most exciting thing to do on a flight, but I planned on finishing my work — aforementioned thesis novel — in those four hours as well. First interaction with Brenda was kind of rude, but innocuous enough. The flight attendants told us all to make sure our tray tables were up and all that, and the kid had his down for his books and didn’t seem to hear. His mom was still on the phone so I nudged him a little.

“Bud, you gotta our the table back up for a minute,” I said. Imagine that but much more awkwardly because I have to deal double-edged sword of being autistic and Bad With Kids. Also, Final Destination taught me that if this kid leaves his tray table down during takeoff we will all die, so I was dealing with that as well.

Brenda dramatically slams her phone into her lap and whips around to tell me to *not* tell her son what to do, she was about to do that. I thought, fine. I was probably out of line. Kiddo did as he was told anyway.

The incident didn’t happen until we were in the air. I had my laptop out for awhile, staring at my novel in Word and willing it to magically become, I don’t know, *better,* or perhaps *done.* I didn’t know Kiddo had been looking over until he actually spoke.

“That’s super long,” he said. I could barely hear him over the plane noise. 

“Yeah,” I said awkwardly, “yeah, it’s a book I’m writing.”

I’m not going to jeopardize the integrity and believability of this story by trying to convince you that *anyone* was interested in my novel for more than five seconds. His eyes lit up, but not for me.

“I’m writing a story too,” he told me, and then he started flipping to the back of that huge notebook (in which he seemed to have been doing math so I imagine he must’ve been bored out of his mind). Brenda has headphones in during this conversation, by the way.

Kiddo regaled me with his fantasy story of about “I just read all the Eragon Books (is there a Gen Z equivalent?) and I’m super psyched about DRAGONS” caliber and honestly i was kinda flattered he wanted to talk about this thing he was obviously passionate about with a stranger (a captive audience, admittedly) because at his age I never showed my work to anyone but my friends. Rock on little dude.

If I could remember what the hell happened in his 20+ pages of drawings and writings relating to his epic, I would tell you. But I don’t. I do remember getting to what must’ve been the sixth major battle between like four kingdoms before Brenda remembered she had a kid. She reminded both of us if this by *yanking kiddo’s notebook out of his hands,* aggressively closing it and then giving it back once she’d opened it back to the math parts, I guess.

She said something like “what did I tell you to do?” and dude just went back to his math. Sucks, but not my kid. She tells me to mind my own business. 

So you may be wondering: this just sounds like a shitty parent, not an entitled one. My friends, we’re not just getting there—we’re here.

After a few minutes of silence and me actually typing words, Brenda reaches over and taps me on the shoulder. I already hate when strangers scold me, but touching me in any aggressive fashion triggers my switch of “am i socially required to be polite to you” to “no.”

I sigh and look over, “can I help you?”

“Put that away.”

Uh.

I look at my laptop, then at her, back to my laptop, back to her. I voice my “uh.”

“You’re *distracting* him. Put it away. He needs to work.”

That does not sound even remotely like my problem.

“I need to work too. That’s what I’m doing. I’m not gonna put it away.” 

As a woman in her mid-20s, I was very opposed to being told what to do. Also, as mentioned above, this novel is also my thesis for my master’s degree. I can’t just stop working on it. They won’t let me have the degree if I don’t give this to them. I do not tell Brenda this because I honestly just don’t care enough.

“He needs to do his *math.* He can’t do that if you’re writing a story right next to him.”

“That’s not my problem!” I finally got to say it.

“Oh, just—“ and this woman, this monitor lizard dressed like a middle school principal, reaches over her son and *shuts my laptop screen on my fingers.* My laptop is not big and she didn’t put in enough force for it to hurt but let me reiterate, to my fellow writers, artists, gamers, etc. *this bitch touched my laptop.*

“What the fuck?” This is one thing I know I said verbatim, I say it very often. “Leave me alone.”

I of course open my laptop back up. Brenda presses the button to summon a flight attendant. Why this. 

“Is there a problem?” The flight attendant was about my age, likely older, just significantly younger than Brenda.

“This girl is being inappropriate, I’ve asked her to stop and she won’t. My son is ten and he’s trying to do his homework.”

Now, again, this was over plane noise, but if what she said *wasn’t* what I just typed, it was vague enough for the flight attendant to have no fucking idea what she was talking about.

“Being...inappropriate? How?”

“I’m writing, and her kid’s bored,” I said before anyone could speak over me. I solved exactly nothing by saying it. This is why I write instead of talking to people. I don’t talk good. I opened my laptop wider so she could just see an open word document. Flight attendant has no idea how to proceed. Brenda persists.

“She’s being *disruptive,* I’d just like her to stow her computer.”

“You’re the one who called her over here!” Oh boy, I was big into talking now. My clams steamed, jimmies rustled.

“My son is doing his *work,* and you need to just write your story *later.*”

“I don’t care! I’m working, it’s not my fault if he’s watching me! If he’s that fucking bored you should’ve brought him something else to do!”

I was making Kiddo feel awkward, I know I was, and I did and still do feel bad about that. But I was yelling at an old woman on a plane, my mind was elsewhere.

“Don’t tell me how to raise my kid!”

The flight attendant did attempt something like “ladies, please,” but she didn’t have anything to say after the “please” so I wasn’t listening.

Now, this could have a classic ending. Brenda is detained and arrested for tax fraud upon landing. Her kid’s long lost father arrives, her evil twin takes over her life, I somehow know everything about her new criminal record in satisfying detail despite me having nothing to do with anything. Carrie Fisher is there, dusting glitter on my face as I triumphantly de-plane. White horses in the airport. Everything is good and right. I am a bestseller and can afford a 30 square foot apartment in New York. OP wins!

But that isn’t what happened. What really ensued was flight attendant trying to figure out what the fuck to do before an older man in the aisle seat in the row across from me speaks.

“They’ve been fightin’ over that thing for twenty goddamn minutes. I’ll just switch with her.”

And we both got up, switched seats, I said thanks and his wife was perfectly accommodating. This flight was coming out of Minnesota if that helps sell this resolution to you. Did not see Brenda or kiddo after the flight or on the way home three days later—but who I did see was a mid-30s woman reading a Warriors book while slamming Jack&amp;Cokes at 2 in the afternoon. Fuck it *up,* Susan.

So yeah, no explosions and a shocking lack of dog-stealing in this tale, but I thought maybe y’all would take it anyway. I don’t have any morals to send you off with, really—just...create with reckless abandon and don’t touch other people’s shit. Later days.",entitledparents,1764

morningstar829,2019-05-09 09:58:34+00:00,Taking everything back," This is a very long story mostly because of the backstory but will include a TLDR at the bottom.  


Backstory: To begin with I will point out how incredibly fucked up my world views on “normalcy” were as a young child because of the abuse I suffered. Raised by a single mom. My mother has two masters degrees (criminology and sociology) and is incredibly manipulative and intelligent (read as sociopath). When I was born we lived with my grandparents still (my mom was 23 at the time). My mother wanted to continue her college education at the time and so got government assistance for childcare etc. During this time my mother found out that if you have a special needs child your benefits allowances were more then doubled. At about the age of 4 she began to severely mentally traumatize me causing me to lash out in unusual ways that were not recognized by teachers and counselors at the time as being signs and symptoms of abuse. At the age of 4 I was in first grade and at the time diagnosed with a condition which is no longer recognized as a mental health condition called O.D.D. (ha ha yes I'm odd). This put me into the special needs program and this began my moms manipulation of the system via me.   


I don't really remember much of the mental abuse to this day which I take as a small blessing. But of the physical abuse I can give a few highlights of. At the age of 6 my mother poisoned me twice in the same day, first with cough syrup that had been expired by 10 years followed by 15 year expired syrup of ipecac. She (being 5'10'' 280 lbs) sat on me and broke several ribs when I was 7 years old. At 9 years old I was kidnapped and raped by my mothers cousins husband. I was found by the cops but was forced by my mother to say nothing happened. My mother hit me the first time with a car when I was 10 running me over while I was on roller blades. At 12 she threw a clothing iron hitting me in the testicles/penis. At 13 she hit me with a van running my leg over entirely on a family vacation (my godmother paid for) to Yellowstone national park breaking my leg which didn't get treated for two weeks until we got back home.   


When I got older while I knew these sorts of things weren't right but I didn't question it because at school no one believed me because I was “special needs” and a “pathological liar” as cultivated by my mom which did stoke a lot of real rage in me which did lead to violent outbursts by me which were very not good because I was one of those kids who got huge fast being taller then every teacher I ever had even in the first grade hitting 6' tall by the age of 11. My mother always cultivated a US vs THEM mindset in me with her manipulations especially in regards to my grandparents. I had always grown up poor and my grandparents were multi millionaires who in my childish brain could of stopped a lot of pain and suffering if they only did what my mom asked and helped her the way they helped their other kids.  


The beginnings of my rebellion came after I finished my second year of college when suddenly my mom could no longer work (read as didn't want to work anymore). She claimed she was to obese and had to many medical conditions to work and filed for social security disability. I was still living with her at this time so she expected me to drop out of school to get a job until she could get her disability. I refused which led to an argument where she called the police and lied to them claiming domestic violence. I was arrested but never charged. I of course cowed at that point knowing that if I didn't do what she wanted I was just going to go back to jail. This is where I thank whatever god there may be in finding the perfect position where I was an “apartment manager and maintenance man.” I got to work that job while I finished college in all my free time.   


After I finished college I left to try and work in LA with my degree and after a 2 week failure I was offered a position doing the same apt management in Portland OR. Of course the moment I got that job my mom wanted to pick up and move back in with me because she was squatting at a friends house. Of course I knew if I didn't do what mom said I was going to get the shaft again. So of course I relented and she moved in with me taking up the same roles we had while I was in school. For a time things were good. I thought I could live a happy comfortable life doing what I was doing making a decent living and having loads of free time as my mother would handle all the management side of the job with accounting etc and I would do all the maintenance. Of course things weren't meant to be as I found out she was defrauding the owners by fudging the numbers on the accounting. And that means if someone who's not good with accounting could figure it out that means someone back at the property management was going to find out soon enough. Sure enough we were lucky and only “let go” instead of charged criminally for what she had done and I could of easily been charged as an accessory. At the time I basically had become dependent on my mother. She wanted to move to some place with a warmer climate.   


We moved to a college town in eastern WA where I had been offered a job working at the school in the past. Only this time it was a job where my mom wasn't helping me and so I didn't feel like she deserved any of my money. At this point in the story her social security still hadn't been approved. But because my mom wasn't getting what she wanted  Fell back on her standard of claiming domestic violence and had me arrested and she left the city. Later I found she moved to the city I now live in at a domestic violence shelter. I got into a terrible relationship toxic which is another story.   


Anyways, at the end of that relationship I made the dumb decision to fall back on my mom who gladly took me back in because my grandparents had moved to live near her (about 45 min drive). And she needed me to manipulate my grandparents into her next plan. Where we live housing is very scarce and so my mother begged and pleaded and manipulated my very sick grandfather into buying a house for her and myself. My grandmother convincing my grandfather of it because she knew the shit my mother had put me through and knew we weren't going to find anything. At the time my grandmother felt guilty because she knew she should of petitioned for custody of me when I was a kid because she knew of all the abuse and manipulations I went through and she did nothing to stop it. She only admitted this to me this year and claims she didn't do anything because she always believed my mom would eventually do the right thing. Within a month of purchasing a small mobile home with suitable living spaces for me and my mom to live separate lives my grandfather passed away. Having not been added to the will the house passed into a trust that was controlled by my grandmother. This is when my mom began to ruin the home that my grandfather bought for us by trying to rent out the parking lot space to people with RV's to live in and renting out the two extra rooms as well as starting up an unlicensed and un-insured doggy daycare. While living there my mother finally was approved for her social security disability after having to sue for it. And I had managed to get myself into another toxic relationship with another mentally unstable woman even going so far as to have her move in with me.  


The wrongdoing (1 year ago): My now ex went psycho jealous at the end of our relationship to which she got me fired from my job. My mother decided she didn't need me in “her house” anymore since I had lived my purpose of getting her home and got my ex to file a restraining order against me essentially getting me kicked out of my own home at 11 pm. I was even placed on a 72 hour suicide watch after being forced out of my house.  


The plot: My grandmother finding out about what happened to me is furious beyond measure and takes me in and begins the process to try and take the property back from my mom. During this time a lot of the illegal and other stuff my mother had put me through I tell my grandmother most of it some of which she has me report to social security causing her to lose her disability benefits. It has been cathartic but obviously no substitute for the therapy I ultimately need. Additionally, I start dating the only woman apart from my grandmother that actually cares about me and being able to be honest with her about everything has been helpful and part of why I'm writing this. My best friend being the other part of the reason I'm posting this to Reddit and the only reason I've found such a wonderful woman to date (Morpheus if it weren't for you I'd be crazier or dead by now). My grandmother ends up with a final trial date set for today with much of the legal stuff and a week before today I realize I never told my grandmother that the car my mom has been driving around for the last year is my car and is titled and registered in my name. So my grandmother at this point goes into overdrive speaking with her lawyer on the legalities of everything. She goes with me down to the courthouse and pays for a duplicate title and registration. We take those down to a dealership where they cut a key that matches the VIN number.   


The revenge: Grandmother has her day in court and everything goes her way and Grandmother is going to get her house back so that I can move back in the house my grandfather bought for me. But we know  that my mom is showing up in my car. So before the judge dismisses the parties I let myself out of the courtroom and walk outside and sure enough there is my car with the windows down and doors unlocked. I open the door sit down put the key in and... tragedy.. the key wont turn in the ignition. So when my grandmother and girlfriend walk out of the courthouse I quickly wave them over and say the key wasn't cut properly so I send them back to the dealership while I sit in the car. This of course couldn't end without some kind of conflict. My mother comes out of the courthouse seeing me sitting in the car and comes to curse me out and tell me to get the fuck out of her car. She calls over a sheriff who happens to be nearby and proceeds to get him to try and arrest me. I calmly show the officer the registration to the vehicle showing its mine the officer tries to explain that there is nothing he can do as the car is registered, titled, and insured in my name but she continues to whine to which the officer has none of it and walks away. My mother gets the brilliant idea to call my ex and have my ex come down because I have to stay X number of feet away from her. So I call the local non emergency line for dispatch and explain the situation of what my mothers plan is to try and force me out of my car. Local PD shows up 4 units (because hey we live in a small boring town) and I have to re-explain how I'm trying to take my car I sent my grandmother to  get the key re-cut and I'm being harassed and my ex is coming to try and harass me by getting me arrested on violation of the restraining order. Ex pulls up while I'm talking to the police and they arrest her on the spot for harassment and violation of the order of protection (apparently its felony harassment to use your order of protection to harass the person the order is against). I tell my mom she can have anything out of the car she wants because nothing in the car is mine. She uses a large black trash bag that was in the back to take as much as she can. Finally grandmother gets back with girlfriend and the new re-cut key works perfectly. I drive off with my car and park it in grandmothers garage in case my mother decides to come back and try and take it back for herself until I can sell the car. My mother sitting in front of the courthouse holding onto a black trash bag of everything she owns crying her eyes out, homeless, without a car and without income.  


TLDR: Lifelong abusive manipulative destructive mother takes away everything I have a year ago. Today I took it all back and left her crying with nothing in this world but a black trash back full of junk.",ProRevenge,2966

cheemaNBA,2019-05-04 22:00:03+00:00,The L2M report for the Trail Blazers - Nuggets game includes a whopping 99 calls and no-calls. Only 4 of these were ruled incorrect.,"That's a shockingly low figure. For reference, the infamous first game of the current Rockets-Warriors series had three incorrect calls/no-calls and that was just the last two minutes of the fourth quarter.

This included all four overtime periods.

The incorrect calls/no-calls, in case anybody is wondering:

1. [Gary Harris loose ball foul on Damian Lillard went uncalled with 1:02 left in the first overtime period.](https://official.nba.com/last-two-minute-report/?gameNo=0041800233&amp;eventNum=2437) Lillard would have went to the line with a chance to take a two-point lead. 

2. [Paul Millsap offensive foul on Maurice Harkless went uncalled at the end of the first overtime period.](https://official.nba.com/last-two-minute-report/?gameNo=0041800233&amp;eventNum=2452) Harkless would have went to the line to most likely win the game, as the Nuggets had no timeouts.

3. [CJ McCollum loose ball foul on Jamal Murray went uncalled at the end of the second overtime period.](https://official.nba.com/last-two-minute-report/?gameNo=0041800233&amp;eventNum=2470) Murray would have went to the line to most likely take the lead with about 8 seconds to go. Portland had 2 timeouts remaining. Could have possibly been the game-winning free throws, though.

4. [Maurice Harkless personal foul on Jamal Murray was incorrectly called with 1:25 to go in the third overtime period.](https://official.nba.com/last-two-minute-report/?gameNo=0041800233&amp;eventNum=2475) No chance to even remotely know what would have happened if Harkless' steal wasn't called off, but Murray did get two free throws out of this incorrect call which gave the Nuggets a two-point lead. 

A couple of these were ticky-tack stuff that probably shouldn't have been called anyway even if they're technically illegal. All in all, very well officiated game imo.

SaraPortland1,2019-05-04 21:09:25+00:00,Someone Is Claiming They Live At Our Address,"Was not sure where to post this situation - so I am sorry if it is in the wrong spot.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the situation - My husband and I built our house a few years ago on the outskirts of Portland, OR. We are the only ones that have EVER lived here ( since we built the house and the address was given to us)  with no neighbors nearby. Address is not a typical address ( tons of numbers and unique name) 

About 2 months ago we started to receive mail addressed to someone ( Daniel). The first thing to arrive was from the USPS saying welcome home ( it was that welcome packet when you change your address to a new address and the packet is sent to your address with tons of coupons). Clearly Daniel changed his address to our address. From that point on we receive about 4 - 5 pieces of mail a week ( no bills just junk mail).   


With a little research I found Daniel ( he has a very unique last name) - he seems to be in his 60s in Phoenix, AZ. A mild interesting point is that about 8 years ago my husband and I lived in Phoenix, AZ for a short time ( 6 months) but not in the same part of town. 

  
What we have done - 

We have written - return to sender that person does not live at residence. Mail keeps arriving. 

We have talked to USPS - we told them the situation. They keep saying ""OH it must be someone that previously lived there"" --- unless he was living in a tent in a middle of a field no one lived at our address before us. They never seemed to understand our point. 

SO we are trying to figure out why would someone change their address to our address. Is there any sinister reasons? Should be just ignore the mail? Should I try and reach out to Daniel?",legaladvice,2612
janyetocean,2019-05-04 13:30:25+00:00,Doris Burke is an amazing commentator,"Ok so don’t really know how to go about making this as I usually just lurk and don’t do much posting or commenting. 

But anyway, I just wanted to acknowledge the fact that Dorris Burke is an amazing commentator. 

I was watching the Portland v Denver game last night and she was doing a great job. She was providing great insight and facts about the game and about the players. She wasn’t just blabbing about random facts. She is also clearly very articulate and overall easy on the ears I guess you can say. 

Yeah that’s about it. Just wanted to give my girl Doris a shoutout for all the great work she’s doing.",nba,3284

Christinacorn7,2019-04-29 13:32:43+00:00,I told my boss to fuck off and quit my job all before 8am.,"I’ve been checking my hours religiously. I noticed some missing hours last pay cycle and had them fix it, but was still a little sketched and worried that they might mess up again. My fiancé and I are leaving for Portland in two days and I can’t afford for them to make another mistake. 

I checked my hours on Thursday before the pay cycle ended and everything looked okay. It really felt like I worked many more hours than I saw on there, but I’ve been so tired and working so much that my internal clock is all out of wack, so I brushed it off.

So, this morning I arrived and clocked in like normal. One of my supervisors clocks in. She decides to just randomly checks her hours only to realize she is missing several hours from a couple shifts.

So I decided to check my hours too.

***I am missing nearly 3 hours for almost everyday for the past two weeks.***

So I’m pissed at this point and march my butt up to my boss’s (we’ll call him M) office and ask him if he can please look at my hours with me. And I do this politely, by the way, because even though I’m angry, I’m not blaming him (yet).
So I tell M that my other boss (we’ll call him V) had to have messed up my hours and they needed to be fixed. 

He looks at the hours and says there’s no way V messed up because “[i was] the one clocking in and out,” which is not correct because I have *three* supervisors that can back me up on the fact that I haven’t taken a lunch break since I came back from leave three weeks ago.

I tell him this, then M gets pissed and decides to throw my MH medical leave (*triggered in part by this job*) in my face saying, “You’ve had issues before.” As if me needing to take a break to get my mental health back on track was somehow related?

I just say, “Excuse me?” And the conversation devolves from there. 

I am livid as we leave his office and just

S N A P.

“You know what, M? NO. I’m not doing this. Fuck this. Fuck y’all. I’m not doing this anymore. NO!” 

I was fury walking so fast I almost tripped down the stairs, but I got back to the kitchen, told my supervisors that I was done and I wasn’t coming back and left, crying the entire walk home. 

V texts me and asks me to come back and he will fix my hours without question. 

I agree and text one of my supervisors who tells me *don’t* come back because M is *pissed* about what I said.

So, I relay this to V and he tells me to wait until he comes in at 1pm and he will call me.

So honestly, I have no clue what is happening.

I’ve worked for this godforsaken company for almost a YEAR. I fought tooth and nail for a raise, worked my fingers to the bone for them, and they have the *audacity* to not pay me for all my hours?

I’ve been working 12-14 hour days for them with little more than an hour break in between.

WE ALL HAVE! The whole damn staff is underpaid and overworked and they are STEALING OUR HOURS! 

I’m not even the only one!!! I am just one of several people who are missing 10+ hours on their paycheck!

This company is stealing money from it’s employees and I’m so done with this. I could scream!

End rant.

Baybebel,2019-04-25 21:14:33+00:00,The supermax rule is punishing teams for having drafted a superstar - it needs to be seriously reworked,"It was meant as a way for small market teams to be able to keep their homegrown star players and while that thought is great and it is working as intended in this regard, it seriously cripples a teams ability to stay competitive. Having up to 50m on a single player count against your salary cap is a serious handicap to build a team around your star player that can actually compete. I mean congrats, you've kept your superstar. But now what? How are you supposed to stay competitive in a league that nowadays requires at least 2 star players with a great supporting cast to win?

Take Damian Lillard for example. He is up for a super max this summer. He's a borderline top 10 player, a superstar, extremely loyal to his team and city and in every sense of the matter deserving of a supermax. And yet it seems like a bad idea for Portland to give him the supermax as they'd be paying 55m for a then 34 year old. When that is the case, you know that something about this needs to change. Why should Portland be punished in terms of building a competitive roster because they have drafted a superstar?

And the solution is simple too. Allow teams to pay their players the supermax as an incentive for them to resign, but only have it count as a regular max against the cap.",nba,1866

FarWestEros,2019-04-23 23:56:48+00:00,"[PSA] Reminder: A Gentleman's Sweep requires winning in 5, but winning in 5 is not necessarily a Gentleman's Sweep","Many people make the mistake of calling a series win in 5 a Gentleman's Sweep, when there is actually more extenuating criteria.

Namely, Game 4 must be the outlier.

If the series-losing team wins any earlier game, hope remains after that win of remaining competitive to the point of possibly winning the series if things break right.

For example, when OKC beat Portland in game 3 (or LAC beat GS in game 2) there were days when the team's fanbase could realistically talk themselves into the belief that they stand a chance to compete. If OKC wins game 4, then it suddenly becomes a best-of-3 series. 

Only when the lesser team has gazed into the depths of an 0-3 hole from which bounds no team has ever emerged - like the event horizon around a black hole - can they be permitted a win (typically on their homecourt so their fans have a last glimpse of the promise their season held before going fishing) and qualify for a true Gentleman's Sweep",nba,2998

casualtrout,2019-04-20 15:01:29+00:00,CMV: Gateway drugs do not exist,"I heard a presentation at my university recently on E-Cigs being a gateway drug, and the argument seemed like Big Tobacco propaganda.

When talking about illicit drugs, such as marijuana, I always hear people fall to the logical fallacy of appealing to imperfect authority. It seems that most groups, like anti-smoking groups that try to equate E-cigs to regular smoking, regularly cite that the FDA has stated that the vapor in E-cigs ""MAY"" contain harmful toxins. People also like to cite how the FDA has not officially recognized E-cigs as a positive aid for getting people to stop smoking tobacco, and the rhetoric behind this seems to be ""SEE?? IT'S NOT APPROVED BY THE GOVERNMENT"" (made up of a bunch of bureaucrats whose salaries are paid to the tune of at least 40% by lobbying by drug companies who profit off of not having alternatives to their addictive and at times dangerous substances).

My problem with the gateway drug model is that it falls flat under scrutiny. After we started to realize that the criminalization of marijuana was a result of the inaccurate scare stories pushed by bureaucrats in the Bureau of Narcotics to keep their salary high, a new narrative had to be formed for why it must still be illegal, that narrative being the gateway drug narrative. The idea behind labeling marijuana as a gateway drug is that if someone uses marijuana, it will lead to deadly drugs. The Drug Free America association published this ad to emphasize that if people so much as use an addictive substance, it's not 'if' they get hooked it's when:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kS72J5Nlm8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kS72J5Nlm8)

Researchers like Bruce Alexander and organizations like Liz Evans' Portland Hotel Society have debunked this idea by showing that there are other factors that contribute to a person's reasons for using drugs, primarily pain. This idea of the gateway drug in my opinion is exposed when looking back when our soldiers were coming back from Vietnam, and how 20% of all returning soldiers were addicted to heroin. Within a year, 95% had stopped using heroin completely, most without treatment. If you believe the model of the gateway drug, this makes no sense, because the simple use of a drug leads to the use of the next drug, and the next, until a lifetime of addiction. Actually though, we don't see this at all, the use of marijuana does not seem to escalate 100% to cocaine, and the use of e-cigs does not escalate into heroin or tobacco either.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion: 

Quick disclaimer: this is not me arguing for E-cigs, and I know that Juul is a shady company. However, I believe that by listening to the gateway drug model we are putting too much focus on the substance, and not enough focus on the reasons people use the substance! And I believe that the gateway drug model is another way of getting us to be scared of safer alternatives to drugs and acting like if we stop the supply and use of safer drugs, then people will not go on to use harder drugs, when the OPPOSITE is true. We can use safer drugs to help people who are addicted to harder ones, and integrate therepeutic practices, as opposed to criminal punishment, to help people.

Advertisements like the Real Cost, are sponsored by the FDA. Just something worth thinking about, that perhaps the reason we believe the gateway drug model, is because there are people out there making money off of the fact that there are no safer alternatives to their substances, looking at you Big Tobacco.",changemyview,1103

Undaunted_Dante,2019-04-16 17:34:32+00:00,"Vancouver is the most beautiful city I've ever visited, it didn't even feel real.","So last weekend, I flew from Oregon to visit my Mom in Seattle. We decided to drive up last Friday to visit Vancouver, since neither of us had been to Canada before. We got really lucky, because the weather was perfect that day.

When we finally crossed the border and drove for about 40 minutes, it was interesting to be in British Columbia. I thought Canada would be like the U.S. just more polite, but to my pleasant surprise Canada actually felt like visiting a truly foreign country (where everyone happens to speak english). Your roads are nicer, your streets are cleaner, you buildings were cozier and well maintained, and everyone we met was super friendly. 

Anyway, my jaw dropped when we crossed the bridge over the river. You could see the skyline; tons of sleek, glass skyscrapers, cranes over the harbor, seagulls flying against the wind, all with a backdrop of towering mountains. I almost crashed steering into the oncoming lane because I was distracted by the view.

We went to eat some place, went to try Tim Hortons, and just a few hours before the sun was suppose to set we decided to drive downtown and see Stanley Park. As we did so it felt like anywhere you turned you'd see one of 3 things; beautiful houses/skyscrapers, mountains, or waterfront. 

We got lucky and were able to snag a parking meter downtown, walked to the marina and stanley park, and watched the sunset from what I think was either second or third beach but I'm not sure. It was so calming to just see all the cargo boats resting in the harbor and the orange sun behind them. Then when it was dark we walked back downtown and got some Pho before driving home.

I'm so fucking jealous of Canada. Like, I thought Portland and Seattle were nice, but Vancouver actually felt like a dream. It's not fair you guys have such a beautiful city. 

Anyway, just wanted to send some love your way. &lt;3 It was the first time I've ever been to Canada before, and it was a wonderful time.",vancouver,1954

Looking for pointers.,"So, I told my boyfriend of 6 years to meet me in the city tomorrow night, haven’t told him where yet just that I’ll let him know when the time comes. There’s a hotel bar and I got a room for the night upstairs.

He isn’t expecting this but I have a wig and some cute clothes I don’t normally wear/ came up with a backstory (I’m in advertising for a woman’s magazine in Portland and just in the city until the next day). I also got a cheap little rinestone ring (cause I’m engaged in the fantasy). 

I was thinking of walking in after he’s already there, and completely ignoring him at the bar and ordering a drink. If he tries to catch my attention I’ll just be like “sorry but have we met?”

Hopefully he gets the hint and we can go from there. But I am nervous! Just looking for any pointers or from anyone who has done this before. He’s definitely into role play but this is the first time I’ve gotten the balls to do this.",sex,2066

I don't really come to this sub once, being in my late 20s I find my outlook on drugs is a lot different than most people here. I'm as staunchly pro drug as before after seeing how much misery everything but soft drugs have brought me, my family, my friends, everyone I've ever been locked up with. I'm sure someone will ask about my sobriety, I'm 7 weeks off fent/dope down to 16 grams of kratom a day from 40g. I'm facing prison time for a violation coming but my PO is recommending just to keep me on GPS tether.**   


You can take a criminal out of his neighborhood, but you can’t take his neighborhood out of him. People bring their bad habits with them to prison whether it be drug use or drug dealing the same way gangs from the streets make their way into the corrections system and vice versa. When I went to prison at age 22 I had no desire or thought of reforming my drug habit. I arrived in real prison in early January and got high for my first time while their was still winter.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember my nerves blaring as I sat on a picnic bench with Stump, watching him huddled up into his coat hood with his arms pulled back through the sleeve holes trying to manipulate the homemade lighter inside his jacket, and thought it looked comical but couldn’t laugh. This was the first time I had ever had the nerve to smoke anything in prison, I smelled tobacco and marijuana almost every day and could not believe it. Every time I smelled the sweet sickly aroma I would giggle with delight because I’m still a highschool boy at heart that loves smoking weed where you’re not supposed to. Such a flagrant breach of the rules inside a corrections institute blew my mind… but within 6 months I would be smoking joints behind the softball fence with Gay Mike like it wasn’t against the rules. Things becomes easier like that in addiction.

&amp;#x200B;

Drug use in prison eventually got as normal to me as drug use in the streets. Drugs are a major factor in prison, they produce an unbelievable amount of profit but with drama and violence to match. Drugs are usually ten times the price they would be worth on the street and they still sell out quicker than they can be smuggled in.

People don’t really get raped in prison anymore but drug debts often lead to a sort of gray area rape. One of the biggest and most powerful subcultures in prison are the Black Muslims. These guys range from Louis Farrakhan like political beliefs to just normal gang bangers that don’t even know the first thing about Islam. In many joints they control the heroin trade through sheer numbers. In MDOC over half the inmates are black and it seems like damn near all the black guys over 35 were in some sort of Muslim group. Every one of the muslim groups does not condone homosexualty but Black Muslim men are notorious for gay sex in the joint. It’s just a known thing that they are “on the down low” more than any other group or subculture. It’s a common prison move, since they often control the heroin, to lure young white guys into heavy drug debts in an attempt to turn them out (“press them for sex”). Basically the alternative offered is either violence or being forced to leave The Yard (Locking Up) and potentially face problems at the next prison.

&amp;#x200B;

For the most part though I didn’t have a bad time in the drug trade. I got into typical shouting matches with friends, argued with black men over my line of credit, was threatened over said line of credit, used dirty needles, and all the same antics I did on the street but never had a violent incident. I did have one close call though, a call so close I almost earned myself a few more years in prison.

&amp;#x200B;

I was fiending hard after watching a re-run of “Drugs Inc” on NattyG in the middle of the afternoon. It was only 2pm and I was already fiending for drugs, it wasn’t looking like today was gonna be one of those “good days”. Someone more experienced with recovery might have noticed the trend of watching “Drugs Inc” then getting high and cut out that specific show out of the schedule, but it was one of my favorites. It doesn’t take much to set off my addiction. Getting a brand new, fresh syringe would set me off like no other… as if a only having a dirty one would stop me!

&amp;#x200B;

I remember it was the Portland episode of Drugs Inc. I remember thinking Portland seemed like junky heaven. I wanted to live in Portland for this. I dreamed of a culture that accepted me for what I was. A burden on society, sure, a stain on the napkin of an otherwise beautiful cityscape, me nodded out on a bench. Not a menace, not a villain, just a guy with problems but no nefarious intent. All my life I dreamed of a place where they would just let a junky be a junky. I can take being dopesick, I can take spending all my money, I can take being alone, I just can’t take getting locked up. Portland and those pacific northwest cities seem like they don’t put you down just for being a fiend. I came down with 2 years for failing a drug test in Michigan. But I wasn’t in Portland, I was in Jackson, MI, but I could get heroin on credit.

&amp;#x200B;

Jackson, MI is known for the MDOC with multiple prisons in the city along with quarantine. It’s also a city with a hood that doesn’t get the publicity of Saginaw or Flint but still bangs hard as fuck. Some of the craziest white guys I’ve met in my life were meth cooks from Jackson County. Some of the hardest GD’s (Gangster Disciples) I ever met were from Jackson City. Jackson also produced a strange amount of white GD’s which is something I can’t much comment on. In the parole violator camp the Jackson boys always clique up heavy. It wasn’t much of a surprise that the Jackson clique in prison were major players in the drug game due to their geographic proximity.

&amp;#x200B;

Tank was a black kid in his mid 20’s. It’s easy to describe him as a kid because of his smaller build compared to all the other black guys in prison but he commanded as much respect as anyone. I thought that even without the drug connection he might have held just as much power in some way or another. I had many dealers in prison I got friendly with who would give me long grace periods before I had to pay my debts and never gave me terse words over big debts. Tank wasn’t like that. With him you paid your debt when it was expected and he never warmed up to me even after multiple successful deals. He had the least problems with debt collection of any dealer I ever saw because of this stone demeanor though.

&amp;#x200B;

The fact that Tank and his crew were operating this criminal organization from the fuckin’ *honor* dorm tells you all you need to know about how “on the ball” MDOC is. I swear that more dope came out of the “Change for Life” (aka “Cons for life”) honor dorm. Not to mention the guy that got caught with 34 knives there. I spent many hours of my life sitting on the picnic tables outside the honor unit waiting for Pooky to get the drugs from Ray Ray and have Junebug run them out to me. You would think since we are fenced inside a small area a prison drug deal would be at least fast but leave it to black ingenuity to find a way to make the white man suffer even more in his chemical and physical bondage.

&amp;#x200B;

My sewn-up dirty New Balances pitter pattered across the basketball courts as I made my way towards C-Unit. “Makin’ my way downtown…” my body bounced and swayed ipsy-pipsy as my enthusiasm for life bloomed and my outlook rose more and more positive. In the back of my mind the rotten idea bloomed, “What if I can’t get the drugs?”, I blocked the negative vibes out and focused on the positive, the syringe is always half *full*. The drugs were on The Yard the day before yesterday, and the day before that, and the day before that. But they weren’t here *so long* that the stash would have been ran through. The dealers never fucking let you know when the stash is getting low though.

&amp;#x200B;

I side stepped a few pick up basketball games and walked by Faggot Beach (the volleyball court) and C unit came into my view. I made a quick scan of the crowd in front of the unit trying to spot someone I knew or Tank himself. I needed someone from C unit to go in and get Tank for me. I saw Bike Chain Mike Augastinus but that would be my last resort, I didn’t need Bike Chain knowing I had money or dope. I slowed down my step and considered asking a stranger to go inside and get Tank.

&amp;#x200B;

Just when the chips were down Kyle Brewer emerged from the door with his thick black jazz musician MDOC sunglasses scanning the compound. Luck! Nothing better than a friend to shoot a move with. Kyle walked towards me muscles pushing out of his mint fresh white tank top. His arms and neck were covered in crude tattoos with “FUCK” running down one bicep and “OFF” down the other. He was often referred to as a “Solid Honkey” because of his adherence to his word and speed of paying debts. Kyle wasn’t my closest friend but I liked him more than just about anybody on The Yard. I asked Kyle to run back into his unit and give Tank a doorcall (This is sending someone into a housing unit you do not lock in to get someone). As soon as he heard my question his face turned to frustration, right away I could see he’d been getting sent in and out for people.

&amp;#x200B;

“Good luck, mothafucka we’ve been door callin’ this nigga for half an hour,” a voice called from a picnic table.

&amp;#x200B;

It was Trenton Palmer and Pooh-Bear, the rest of the Jackson drug ring. They had three homemade prison calzones made with dough stolen from the chow hall. One was in front of each of them with the other in front of the empty seat, obviously waiting for Tank.My heart sank with the realization there was obviously a difficulty in locating Tank.

&amp;#x200B;

“Is he in the unit? Is he in a class or something? Or someone else on The Yard?”

&amp;#x200B;

“He’s gotta be in there. He don’t have class today and we checked everywhere else,” answered Pooh Bear. I didn’t know Pooh as well and it was clear he was taking some pleasure in my obvious fiending.

&amp;#x200B;

“I called fucking everywhere, his cube, both bathrooms, the day room. He’s not in there,” said Kyle.

&amp;#x200B;

Just then Tank emerged through the double doors in button down MDOC blues. Why anyone wears state blues (*“I’m here now! In state blues. Tub of chow hall butter and some sewn-up shoes!”*) when you can just wear a white t-shirt or tank top is beyond me. I suppose Tank was probably institutionalized having been in prison half a decade but appearing to be only in his mid 20s. He was doing a 7 year sentenced for Armed Robbery after hitting a 7-11 for 70 dollars. It was an odd contrast that a guy running such a lucrative drug ring in prison was committing such desperate and petty crimes in the streets. I tried to flag down Tank first but Trent and Pooh Bear were louder and more boisterous than me and gained his attention first. Before they could finish asking where he had been Tank roared over both of them.

&amp;#x200B;

“I was beatin’ my fuckin’ meat, nigga!”

&amp;#x200B;

Tank had been jacking off in the bathroom to porn, which he was returning to Trent (who had a serious collection), and had ignored Kyle’s calls for him (understandable).  Trent glanced at me and locked eyes for a minute with a look that told me he was still holding. I instantly felt relieved but glanced at the calzone laid out on cardboard and knew he would most likely want to eat before getting the dope out of hiding. “*The first thing that you learn is that you always gotta wait*”. The Dopeman always has a way of hassling you around, even the good ones turn like this. Even in a place where we are literally confirmed they found ways to make me anxiously wait. Prison, home of the 2 hour drug deal.

&amp;#x200B;

Calzones were eaten, steps were paced, watches were glanced at, prices were talked and we settled on 8 packs for $400 to be paid no later than a week. Tank went in for the dope, came back out, and things felt really right for the first time since the last time I knew I was about to get dope. Tank motioned for me to follow him away from C unit, showing respect for the unit’s “Honor Dorm” status. Kyle followed with me to make sure everything went OK. He was a solid guy like that and was one of the few people that wouldn’t just stick around in hopes of getting free dope. His tolerance was nothing and I considered giving him a shot. The day had darkened and the sun looked like shaded colored pencil. It was beautiful and a great time of day to get high but I wished it was earlier in the day so I could fully experience my high outside. I would most likely stay up all night reading, writing, and compulsively doing push ups. People knew there was dope on the compound when I was frantically running sprint/pushup circuits.

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason that to this day baffles me Tank led us all to the Big Weight Pit. This was nearly in the center of the yard and not obfuscated from view in any way. To make things worse it was 8:30pm, which meant The Pit was closing, which meant there was a CO present to lock up the weights. Before I could voice my concerns Tank shoved an egg sized ball into my hand.

&amp;#x200B;

I interlude to tell you that $400 worth of heroin prison is NOT an egg-sized chunk. $400 worth of heroin in the world isn’t even close to being that big. Tank in true black-drug-dealer fashion had managed to inconvience everyone involved in the transport of said narcotics by packaging a small amount of drugs in a large amount of paper. This egg sized bundle contained about half a marble worth of heroin all together. There were 8 separate $50 folds of magazine paper with dope all packaged inside an entire sandwich baggie. “What a fucking waste of time and space,” this is what was on my mind when I heard CO Fuqua shout at me.

&amp;#x200B;

“You two! Shakedown, right now,” CO Fuqua was tall, black, muscular, and striding towards us at an authoritarian pace. The dope was in my fist, he was maybe 15-20 feet away and approaching quick. I’ve never been a good criminal, I freeze up way too easy but prison had conditioned me to act without thinking. I brought my fist to my face and put the package into my mouth. I’ll let him tackle me and take whatever ticket that is, plus the Substance Abuse ticket I get when they inevitably drug test me later. I will not just allow myself to catch a possession from *inside* the joint.

&amp;#x200B;

The package passed my lips and felt large in my mouth. I braced for impact but nothing happened. Maybe it was God, maybe CO Fuqua had just glanced away, but as he closed in at about 5 feet he didn’t let on that he saw anything. Now I had to do something with this egg in my mouth. I prepared to choke and swallowed hard. The packaging compacted a lot, thankfully it was a thin sandwich baggie. I felt the packaging slide down my throat and felt sad knowing it wasn’t sealed so there’d be no point in trying to puke it up. Before it reached the bottom of my throat movement stopped. I checked if I could breathe and only a tiny wisp of air came through.

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly I panicked and became very away of my surroundings. Fuqua hadn’t saw me shoot the move, but every other person around The Pit did. The white noise of voices quieted down slightly as conversations cut off to watch and others became hushed. I could see everyone’s eyes were on me and you could even see the groups movement slowed a little bit and body language tensed up. Fuck! Why are they making it hot like this!

&amp;#x200B;

“IDs, now,” Fuqua’s voice demanded respect and he was more aggressive than most black COs. I only now realized that Tank was nowhere to be seen and Fuqua was not also demanding Tank’s prison ID but rather Kyle’s. I was struck with hope that maybe he hadn’t witnessed the actual drug deal after all. I reached into my pocket and handed him my ID. Time slowed down and I tried to keep my breathing normal as I struggled to get air through the miniscule opening. A paranoid daydream played in my head of me holding my breath for as long as I can before breathing in deeply through the small opening, causing a sharp whistling that pierces the silent nightmare and alerts Fuqua to my contraband. Maria, Full of Grace, Johnboy, Full of Dope.

&amp;#x200B;

“What’s your name?” Fuck!

&amp;#x200B;

“Kyle Brewer,” Kyle answered first giving me a minute to think. Why the fuck does he need me to speak? My name is on the fuckin’ card! Fuqua handed Kyle back his ID and his gaze shifted to me. I waited for him to speak hoping for another miracle.

&amp;#x200B;

“What about you, son?” He spoke in such an alpha confident way my hopes of getting one over on this man diminished. I did the only thing I could do and tried to speak my name.

&amp;#x200B;

“uhOhn, uHoonEe…,” someone the lack of confidence in my answer was somehow clear in what came out as gibberish. It sounded like I either had marbles in my mouth… or something in my throat.

&amp;#x200B;

“What? What the fuck did you say?” Fuqua was terse before but now he was bonafide upset.

&amp;#x200B;

“uhOhn...uHoonEe!” I tried to form words but it came out the same as before just louder.

&amp;#x200B;

“Open your fuckin’ mouth. Right now,” these words were actually said quieter than any previous exchange but they bit way harder. Now I was really fucked, and after making it this far. I opened wide and didn’t try any tongue tricks lest he examine even closer. Once again, I braced for impact.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing came. I guess the package was actually lodged too far down my throat for him to see. One more bullet dodged, the only problem was Fuqua wasn’t letting up about my suspicious dialect.

&amp;#x200B;

“Why the fuck do you sound like that?” He demanded. I tried to think of answer and realized I wouldn’t be able to vocalize it anyways. I didn’t get a miracle, I didn’t have a guardian angel or God either. You don’t need those when you have a Sold Honkey watching your back.

&amp;#x200B;

“Hey, man! Leave him alone! He’s got a fuckin’ speech impediment!” Kyle shouted back, matching Fuquas previous intensity. He said it with righteousness, he said it with confidence that assured everyone -he- was in the right. A hail mary play by the Master of Improv! Fuqua’s body language relaxed and he shrank back, it was working!

&amp;#x200B;

“Oh, yeah, sorry…” Fuqua muttered. A few black faces watching from the crowd snickered but for the most part played it cool. He had actually fucking apologized on top of everything. He didn’t stay meek for long and proceeded to search the both of us with another CO coming to assist him. I hadn’t had a decent breath in over a minute and the tiny wisps I was getting weren’t enough. I could feel the shortness of breath gaining quicker and quicker.

I moved my feet apart widening my stance as the large black man’s hand reached up my inner thigh. I had already resigned that a GI Joe motherfucker like this was most definitely a ball-grabber and for a third time I braced for impact. Thankfully black homophobia prevailed and his hand stopped only slightly above the back of my knee. He reached into my front pocket and pulled out the bottle cap I used to mix my dope in. I prayed that he wasn’t that street smart and that there wasn’t a dried up cotton filter stuck to the inside of it. Less breath than ever now as I tried to keep my breathing slow with a post-speedball heartrate.

“The fuck is this?”

&amp;#x200B;

I looked at him with eyes that pleaded not to be embarrassed again by speaking in my retard accent and it worked. He handed me back my ID and walked away. I didn’t feel a rush of relief yet. The entire situation had given me a rush of adrenaline from the fight or flight response. My vision was starting to cave in at the edges as the lack of oxygen really got to me. I turned the opposite way as Fuqua and made sure no CO was approaching before I tried to get the dope back up. “Whiteboy got away!” I hear someone call out.

&amp;#x200B;

I push as hard as I can with my throat trying to push the dope out. I knew it was beyond swallowing. I notice Kyle isn’t by my side and I’m alone. I tense my stomach and push harder and the package, moving slowly from my mouth having run dry, comes up my throat and into my mouth.

&amp;#x200B;

Relief and euphoria break through the adrenaline and I realize I’m already facing my unit and I’m thankful for this as I move at a brisk clip across field and concrete. This was what normal people can’t understand, the rush associated with the lifestyle. Some people preferred to have dope delivered or send someone, but I always liked driving to the set to pick up myself. There was no better feeling than cruising back down I-75 knowing you were out of the risky party and almost home free.

&amp;#x200B;

None of the people standing in front of the unit or on the basketball court registered to me as I walked on autopilot through double doors. I turned sharply in the lobby and made my way down the front hallway. The unit was basically a pool barn divided up into 8 man cubicles with walls that went about 8 feet high. People on top bunks were exposed to people walking through the hallway and people laying down for the night to watch TV washed past my peripherals.

&amp;#x200B;

I needed to find Paul Vella (RIP) aka Pauly D. He was also jokingly called “The Dirty Hamster” for his habit of sleeping with snack food wrappers strewn about him (and it *was* a habit, despite his claims of it happening only a few times). He loved prison food more than anyone I ever met and had the Diabetes to prove it, which leads me to another nickname. He was also known, by all the IV drug users on the compound, as “The Needle Man”. The insulin “required” by his lazy pancreas gave him access to syringes, and his giant balls gave him access to steal them. From what he said there was a certain nurse was less on-the-ball about watching their Diabetics administer their insulin and the rest and when she worked he had about a 50% success rate of stealing a syringe. The rest of the nurses would make sure they saw you dispose of the syringe into the sharps container, but she didn’t watch it particularly close and would sometimes turn her back allowing for an opportunity. He would drop the cap of a pen down into the box to create a convincible sound.

&amp;#x200B;

I knew where Paul would be because the last place I saw him was laying in my bunk watching my TV. Paul didn’t really have money and he was one of my best friends even before he started stealing syringes so I genuinely liked to share my food and television with him and he was always the most appreciative out of anyone I did time with. My family ended up driving Paul home from prison so he wouldn’t have to take the bus and gave him a Costco sized tub of peanut butter, which was his prison favorite.

&amp;#x200B;

I turned into my cube and saw from the face of one of my Cubies they weren’t happy about an outsider being in the cube. I didn’t care and walked past him to my bunk and tapped Paul’s shoulder to get his attention from the TV. He pulled out his, well, my headphones and turned to me without speaking. He did that a lot, probably because he had a slight speech impediment… and Hep C, and fucked up watery calves plus swollen feet on top of the ‘beetus. The prison actually issued guys with feet like him special shoes that are infinitely more comfortable than the regular state issues. I deemed them the “Air Force (Type) Ones”.

&amp;#x200B;

“I need to use the loaner,” I said in shame. Paul, also being a Solid Honkey, had given me dibs on the first syringe he ever stole, plus he would let me trade out my used ones for new ones he’d steal. My old syringes became the loaners. I used rigs until the wheels fell off, until you had to use your ear wax to lubricate the plunger. I traded rigs to Pauly D at about a 2/10 and within a week they would be a -7. It would amaze you that the needle could even puncture skin.

&amp;#x200B;

In a bout of self improvement fueled by intravenous drugs I had destroyed my last clean rig one night in the bathroom the last time I used two days prior. Paul had told me I would regret this and I knew then he was right but half ass resolved to prove him wrong. I made it one whole day before I was coming back to him, state orange hat in hand.

&amp;#x200B;

Paul smiled, acknowledging he had been right along but didn’t rub it in thankfully. Paul hopped down from my bunk and led me out of the cube. I walked two cubes down and turned into his cube as I saw him tilt his locker backwards and grab a package wrapped in napkin from between the wall. He walked back towards the doorway of the cube and made sure no police were making rounds. He unwrapped the napkin and I saw two syringes with the numbering completely rubbed off and with numbering that still looked fairly crisp and clean.

&amp;#x200B;

“Now these two are $2 to use and they’re the same, they’re fine. But this one, this one is $5 to use, but when you shoot it you will feel where they money goes” *Pulp Fiction*. He hadn’t quoted the right, or even very close, and it sounded silly with his lispy speech impediment but I appreciated the references none the less.

&amp;#x200B;

“So this one’s clean?” I asked.

&amp;#x200B;

“No, but it’s better than the others”,  He let on that he had been joking and wouldn’t charge me just to use it and just wanted to quote the film.

&amp;#x200B;

I grabbed the half decent looking syringe and hoped maybe the cosmetic damages I was now noticing were from being hidden and not from multiple HIV infected prisoners sweaty palms. I found Fat Josh by the washing machines doing his State Job of laundry porter. I asked him for a cup of bleach and he smiled realizing what I was doing. Fat Josh was the first person to introduce me to drugs in prison and I could tell by his pinned eyes he has been using the loaner too.

&amp;#x200B;

I assembled my shower bag with plastic spoon, cotton swabs, and bottle of hot water all inside and stuck the syringe in my waistband as I floated like a serene zombie with my cup of bleach towards the bathrooms. In security level 1 bathrooms have stalls with doors but they only go up to lower chest level. It’s enough coverage that someone would really have to be leaning over and specifically looking to see below your chest. You could hear the CO’s coming from the jingle of their keys plus they didn’t ever check the stalls anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

I sat down in the stall closet the wall and finally spit the plastic bag out of my mouth. The bindles were all still safe inside. I broke apart each $50 fold of paper each with more disappointment than the last with regards to their size. The 8th fold I sat aside untouched for Kyle and smiled at his quick thinking. A speech Impediment! Ha! CO Fuqua (pronounced: Foo-kwaa) more like “Fuckwad”! I thought as I rinsed the syringe with shitty watered-down prison bleach 5 times. I tried to hold each rinse for a ten count but my pace increased. Finally I mixed $350 dollars worth of heroin with 90 units of hot water. The dope dissolved fine and I noticed for the first time the little rice grains in the bag and some of the dope folds. Tank must have had the dope hidden inside a bag of rice.

&amp;#x200B;

I balled up a Q-tip cotton and dropped it in the mixture. The needle jabbed into the cotton as I pulled back on the plunger and tried to gauge how sharp the needle still was without luck. The dope drew back quickly and easily since the prison used larger 27 gauge size needles for insulin. I rung out the cotton with my finger as if the minuscule amount of dope I was getting out of it would do anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I sat everything down and pressed the needle against my inner arm which gave resistance for a moment before succumbing to the needle which wasn’t terribly dull. I didn’t have to dig long to find the large vein of my inner arm and a thick plume of blood came up in the way blood comes up a large gauge syringe. I pressed all the way down and then some as I release the cord of the shower bag from around my arm. My fist opened and closed as I attempted to pump the blood and after a few seconds the rest of the night was good.

**Epilogue: Well that's the longest short story I ever wrote I think. Kyle  is off parole and doing fine and Tank got out, killed someone, and went right back.**",Drugs,2141
NitroXYZ,2019-04-11 05:24:03+00:00,[OC] Every NBA Team Ranked By How Well They Have Performed To Preseason Expectations This Regular Season In 2018-19.,"

 ------  
  
With the regular season now done and dusted I decided it would be cool to take a look back at every NBA team this season and place them into tiers on the level that they have performed at this season.  
  
- Completely Exceeded Expectations  
- Exceeded Expectations    
- Slightly Exceeded Expectations   
- Met Expectations  
- Slightly Didn't Meet Expectations  
- Didn't Meet Expectations  
- Completely Didn't Meet Expectations  
  
  
I made a very similar post to this one last year and it was very positively received so I decided to try writing another post. Here is a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8bnnqc/oc_every_nba_team_ranked_by_how_well_they_have/) for anyone interested. Of course every situation is different and so I have factored in the teams overall win-loss record but also how they have responded to difficult situations this season such as injuries or the context of how they have performed.   
  
One thing that I am changing this season compared to this year is how I view situations with ‘disgruntled players.’ Last year this was an issue when trying to rank the Spurs season due to Kawhi’s absence. As a result I have decided that if a players lack of success is due to a disgruntled player and NOT one who is injured this will negatively effect them. (Sorry Pelican fans)  

**This is just my opinion and I am keen to shuffle the list around if people disagree with my results so feel free to leave your input and I will be very willing to take it into consideration. Please don’t be too harsh and I will try to make sure my rankings are as accurate as possible**  
   
------  
  
Just a couple other things to consider:  
  
-  When I state my predicted expectations It as an average of preseason rankings from ESPN, Bleacher Report, Sports Illustrated, CBS Sports, Action Network and 538. Sources: [ESPN](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24813839/projecting-best-worst-cases-toughest-stretches-all-30-teams), [BR](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2789744-2018-19-nba-schedule-win-loss-predictions-for-every-team#slide2), [CBS Sports](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/sportsline-2018-19-nba-projections-warriors-heavy-favorites-to-three-peat-celtics-raptors-very-close-in-east/), [Action Network]  (https://www.actionnetwork.com/nba/nba-win-totals-betting-odds-2018-2019-warriors-celtics), [538 CARMELO](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2019-nba-predictions/)  
  
- This is the [link] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9ogb2k/201819_season_predictions_from_the_rnba_power/) to the NBA preseason power ranking predictions that I make reference to in my post.  
  
-----    
  
###Completely Exceeded Expectations   
  
- **Milwaukee Bucks** WL Record: 60-22  
  
The Milwaukee Bucks were predicted to win 46 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as few as 43 games. They were viewed as a team that would be on the rise with lots of excitement about the prospect of new coach Mike Budenholzer. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 19/30 voters expected the Bucks to finish as a top 4 seed. However only 1/30 predicted them to finish with a top 2 seed. To finish the regular season with the NBA’s best win loss record is an incredible achievement that very few saw coming. The success of Milwaukee this season can be attributed to many people but the clear stand out is star forward Giannis Antetoukounmpo. In just his sixth season the Greek Freak had one of the greatest seasons in recent history and is expected to poll very highly in MVP voting. It’s going to come down to the wire between him and James Harden but I could see voters giving him the advantage due to his consistency throughout the year, elite defence and greater team success. The performance of the rest of the team also deserves tremendous credit with Middleton making his first all star appearance and Malcom Brogdon joining esteemed company in the 50-40-90 club. The Bucks will be a team to look out for in the playoffs and Giannis will be looking to make a huge statement to the rest of the sporting world.   
  
.  
  
    
- **Sacramento Kings** WL Record: 39-43        
  
The Sacramento Kings were predicted to win 25 games in the preseason with 538 expecting them to win as few as 23 games. They were viewed as a team that just didn’t have the right mix of players. In the preseason their power forward and centre rotation seemed too tall to be competitive with questions about the backcourt depth of the team.      
In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 0/30 voters expected the Kings to feature in the playoffs and while the Kings didn’t qualify for the top 8 in the western conference they were just outside finishing 9th. The Kings had their most successful season in over a decade this season and with the improvement of DeAaron Fox and Buddy Hield they look like a young team with a lot of upside. Sacramento have over $70 million in cap space this offseason so If they can make a splash in free agency they will be a team to look out for.

- **Brooklyn Nets** WL Record: 42-40          
    

The Brooklyn Nets were predicted to win 32 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as few as 29 games. They were viewed as a team that could start to turn their future around after many years asa  bottom 5 team in the league, however thats essentially all it was. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 0/30 voters expected the Nets to make the playoffs. Not a single voter. The Nets however would finish the season making their first playoff appearance since 2015 overcoming an 8-18 start to the year to qualify. D’Angelo Russell had a career season which culminated in his first all star appearance and emerging as one of the front runners for the most improved player award. The Nets have a lot of money available in free cap space going in to this offseason and with their developing young team they are going to be one to look out for.

- **Orlando Magic** WL Record: 42-40          
     
The Orlando Magic were predicted to win 30 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as few as 27 games. They were viewed as a team that was going absolutely nowhere in a hurry. Their roster wasn’t rated very highly by many in the league and they seemed to be destined for a bottom seeded finish. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 0/30 voters expected the Magic to make the playoffs. Not a single voter. The Magic however would finish the season making their first playoff appearance since 2012 overcoming a 20-31 start to the year to qualify. Nikola Vucevic had a career season which culminated in his first all star appearance, Fournier and Gordon played strong roles and Terrence Ross emerged as a genuine contender for the sixth man of the year award. The Magic shocked everyone this season with their improvement and I’m excited to see how the team builds on this year going forward.

- **Los Angeles Clippers** WL Record: 47-34*        
     
The Los Angeles Clippers were predicted to win 34 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as few as 29 games. They were viewed as a deep team but ultimately not a team that would be good enough to go anywhere quickly. The departure of stars Blake Griffin and Chris Paul in recent years lead to many thinking that the Clippers would be more amongst the worst in the league and in competition for a high draft pick. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 0/30 voters expected the Clippers to make the playoffs but they defied the odds to not just make the playoffs but also almost win 50 games. The key stand out for the Clippers this season with all things considered would have to be Lou Williams who averaged 20 points per game and hit many clutch shots through out the season. The Clippers have their sights set on Kawhi Leonard this offseason and with an already deep roster could be a team to look out for.

###Exceeded Expectations    
  
- **Denver Nuggets** WL Record: 54-28         
    
 
The Denver Nuggets were predicted to win 48 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as few as 47 games. They were viewed as a young and exciting team that was unlucky to miss the playoffs last season with 46 wins. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 25/30 voters expected the Nuggets to make the playoffs but just 2 of those voters expected them to hold home court advantage in the playoffs. The Nuggets encountered a lot of early season injuries but were able to maintain an elite record in large parts due to their outstanding depth. Nikola Jokic had a career season making his first all star appearance and could poll well in MVP voting. Despite all this many people still regard Denver as a bit of a ‘pretender’ that will fail in the playoffs. Time will tell but during the regular season the Denver Nuggets exceeded expectations.

- **Indiana Pacers** WL Record: 48-34        
   

The Indiana Pacers were predicted to win 47 games in the preseason with 538 expecting them to win as few as 43 games. They were viewed as a team that with a deep roster that was just outside the elite group of the Eastern Conference. After completely shattering expectations last season there was a lot of excitement about the potential of the group. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30/30 voters expected the Pacers to make the playoffs 24/30 voters expecting them to finish 4th or 5th, so you might say that they met expectations completely. However the Pacers started 32-15 this season (a 56 win pace) prior to a season ending injury to star guard Victor Oladipo. Despite the injury the team was able to maintain a strong win loss record. It is unlikely that they advance far in the playoffs but for an awesome start to the season when healthy and maintaining a great level of play despite a serious injury I have decided to say that Indiana exceeded expectations.  
  
.  
  
      
- **Portland Trailblazers** WL Record: 53-29      
   

The Portland Trailblazers were predicted to win 41 games in the preseason with 538 expecting them to win as few as 39 games. They were viewed as a team that would be vulnerable in the race for playoff spots in a competitive Western Conference. After barely improving their roster in the offseason and after being swept in the first round they were expected to fall back. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 18/30 voters expected the Blazers to make the playoffs with only one voter expecting them to maintain home court advantage. However as the Trailblazers regularly do they defy peoples expectations and continue to prove themselves as a great team. A late season injury to Jusuf Nurkic in addition to a knee issue from CJ McCollum has people questioning how far they can go in the playoffs but this regular season, Portland has exceeded expectations.

- **Atlanta Hawks** WL Record: 29-53          
     
   
The Atlanta Hawks were predicted to win 24 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as few as 20 games. They were viewed as a young team that would be amongst the worst in the league and ultimately end up tanking for a high draft pick. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30 voters expected the Hawks to miss the playoffs and they did. The goal for this year was never to make playoffs for Atlanta so that isn’t a concern. The Hawks played better than many had anticipated this season with Trae Young having a sensational rookie season and John Collins playing at an all star calibre level. The team is still young and inexperienced so it would not be realistic to expect them to make a jump to the playoffs very soon. However the Hawks appear to be building something and going in the right direction in their rebuild.

- **Toronto Raptors** WL Record: 58-24           
    
    
   
The Toronto Raptors were predicted to win 56 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as few as 53 games. They were viewed as a clear cut top 5 team that would be even better with the addition of Kawhi Leonard to replace DeMar Derozan. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30/30 voters expected the Raptors to make the playoffs as a top 4 seed. A majority of these voters (24/30) also predicted Toronto to finish as a top 2 seed. The Raptors season was filled with little drama as they ultimately did what they were expected to. However the regular season to an extent didn’t really matter much for the Raptors as their main focus is on making a deep playoff push and as a result Kawhi Leonard was rested for over 20 games this season. As it currently stands the Raptors have met expectations but it all comes down to what happens in the following weeks. An underrated reason for the Raptors success this year has also been Pascal Siakams breakout season. By posting career highs in every stat including doubling his points total from last season he is the strong favourite for the most improved player award.

- **San Antonio Spurs** WL Record: 48-34           
    
      
The San Antonio Spurs were predicted to win 42 games in the preseason with 538 expecting them to win as many as few as 37 games. They were viewed as a team that would be vulnerable in the race for playoff spots in a competitive Western Conference. Many experts thought that the Spurs run of over 20 consecutive playoff appearances was set to end. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 21/30 voters expected the Spurs to make the playoffs. The Spurs did look vulnerable at times and only had a one game gap for the 8th seed as late as March but they were able to win 9 consecutive matches and clinch their spot. The Spurs will be an interesting team to watch for in the playoffs due to their inconsistencies away from home this season but they could also create a big upset. Ultimately for making the playoffs when many expected a decline I’d say that the Spurs slightly exceeded expectations.

- **Detroit Pistons** WL Record: 41-41           
    
   
The Detroit Pistons were predicted to win 39 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win 38 games. They were viewed as a playoff team but almost by default with many expecting them to round out the playoff picture despite a losing record. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 18/30 voters expected the Pistons to make the playoffs. The Pistons were an inconsistent team throughout the regular season going long stretches with few wins but also having remarkable runs of form. Things got close towards the end of the season but Detroit was able to limp towards the playoffs. Blake Griffin had one of his best seasons before knee injuries limited his production in the back end of the season. Its still to be seen just how much of an impact Detroit can make in the playoffs but simply for making it into the top 8 they have met expectations.  
    
.   
  
        
- **Utah Jazz** WL Record: 50-31*             
    
 
The Utah Jazz were predicted to win 51 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win 51 games. They were viewed as a well rounded team that was be able to emerge as a Western Conference threat. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30/30 voters expected the Jazz to make the playoffs and despite starting the season just 14-17 the Jazz would eventually find their groove. Donovan Mitchell had a phenomenal second half of the season following a poor start and Rudy Gobert maintained his elite defence that could see him pick up his second consecutive DPOY award. A lot of Utah’s ranking could come down to how they do in the playoffs in the end but through out the regular season, despite a poor start, as a collective Utah were able to meet expectations and achieve a 50 win season.

- **Philadelphia 76ers** WL Record: 51-31               
    
   
    
The Philadelphia 76ers were predicted to win 53 games in the preseason with 538 expecting them to win 53 games. They were viewed as one of the top 5 teams in the league that with a dynamic young duo would be able to really challenge for a high playoff position. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30/30 voters expected the 76ers to make the playoffs with 16 of those voters predicting a 3rd placed finish for Philadelphia. The 76ers had the 3rd seed secure for a majority of the season and really didn’t encounter a lot of drama as they progressed throughout the year. Trades for Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris through out the season have put more pressure on the team to make a deep playoff push and reach all the way for the finals. However as things currently stand, for the regular season, Philadelphia were able to meet expectations with minimal fuss.  
  
.    
    
        
- **Memphis Grizzlies** WL Record: 33-49               
    
   
The Memphis Grizzlies were predicted to win 33 games in the preseason with 538 expecting them to win 33 games. They were viewed as a team that wasn’t quite bad enough to be tanking but not quite good enough to make a run for the playoffs. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions just 1/30 voters expected the Grizzlies to make the playoffs and that was an 8th seed. The Grizzlies had their moments through out the year and even started a promising 12-5 but quickly dropped off from there. The Grizzlies roster changed a lot through out the season a league record 28 players suited up in a Memphis jersey this season. Marc Gasol was traded mid season and the Grizzlies stuck with Mike Conley. It will be interesting to see how they approach the offseason with their current awkwardly constructed roster.

- **Golden State Warriors** WL Record: 57-25                
    
   
The Golden State Warriors were predicted to win 61 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win 60 games. They were viewed as the clear cut best team in the NBA who would be heavy favourites to win their 3rd consecutive championship. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 27/30 voters expected the Warriors to qualify as the Western Conference number one seed and the other 3 voters picked them as 2nd. The Warriors may not have won as many games as expected this season but for finishing 1st in the West ultimately I am ranking them as having met expectations. The reason is that we all know the Warriors are likely to win the championship and therefore their regular season win total isn’t really a concern. I would be interested to see how other people have seen the Warriors season this year and whether or not this was the right category to place them in.
  
.  
    
        
- **Houston Rockets** WL Record: 53-29               
     
 
The Houston Rockets were predicted to win 55 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win 55 games. They were viewed as one of the key contenders to compete with Golden State and challenge for the championship. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 24/30 voters expected the Rockets to qualify as the Western Conference number two seed and all voters predicted them to have home court advantage. The Rockets season was definitely a more difficult one to judge. They began the season 11-14 losing many games that they should not have lost, they then were dealt heavy injury blows to Chris Paul and Clint Capela. However from there became arguably the story of the season. James Harden. The superstar guard would go on an incredible scoring streak scoring at least 30 points in 32 consecutive games and absolutely carrying the team offensively and producing one of the greatest offensive seasons in NBA history. Harden could very well soon be the back to back MVP this season but time will tell how things transpire. Overall for the Rockets they did decrease their win total from 65 games last season but for ultimately finishing with home court in the West despite their injuries they met their expectations. 
  
.  
    
        
- **Charlotte Hornets** WL Record: 40-42                 
    
    
  
The Charlotte Hornets were predicted to win 36 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win 36 games. They were viewed as a fringe playoff team that didn’t really have a clear number 2 option after Kemba Walker. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions just 7/30 voters expected the Hornets to make the playoffs. It’s a little strange in a way because while the Hornets did essentially meet expectations they will have finished this season as a disappointment. Despite winning a lot more towards the final month of the season the Hornets really left their run till too late. Kemba Walker will enter free agency this off season and with the current state of the Hornets he has a big choice on his mind. Whether he stays or goes Charlotte have a lot to work on this offseason.

The OKC Thunder were predicted to win 50 games in the preseason with 538 expecting them to win as many as many as 53 games. They were viewed as a team that would with much improved bench depth would be able to solidify themselves as one of the clear cut top teams in the Western Conference. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30/30 voters expected the Thunder to make the playoffs with 20 of those voters predicting home court advantage for OKC. The Thunder began the season in extremely impressive fashion with Paul George looking like an MVP candidate and were 37-19 and within touching distance of the second seed before struggling post all star break. The Thunder failed to secure home court advantage but ultimately did have a great first half of the season so I feel inclined to say that they only slightly failed to meet expectations.

The Dallas Mavericks were predicted to win 35 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as few as 38 games. They were viewed as a young team that would be in the 10-12 range in the standings but finish the season tanking. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions just 1/30 voters expected the Mavericks to make the playoffs and that was an 8th seed. The Mavericks had their moments through out the year and even started a promising 15-11 but injuries and a drastic midseason roster change lead them in a different direction. Four starers in Jordan, Smith, Barnes and Matthews were all traded to different teams with the Mavericks set to rebuild their future around one key player. Luka Doncic. The biggest highlight of the year was rookie sensation Luka Doncic who averaged 21 points per game and show cased some terrific playmaking skills. Although he struggled a little towards the end of the season Doncic looks like a perennial all star for years to come and should be the favourite for the rookie of the year award.

- **Miami Heat** WL Record: 40-42                
     
    
  
The Miami Heat were predicted to win 43 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as many as 45 games. They were viewed as a veteran team that had achieved a lot of success in seasons past and as a result would be a playoff team due to their defined locker room and team culture. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 28/30 voters expected the Heat to make the playoffs but they fell short and were unable to give Dwyane Wade a final full farewell tour. With the retirement of Wade now allowing for a deeper look into the Heat without emotion it appears the future really doesn’t seem too promising for Miami. They are bound by some poor contracts and do not really have a younger star ready to take the reigns. The Heat had an underwhelming season and its hard to see them bouncing back too quickly.

The Chicago Bulls were predicted to win 28 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as many as 31 games. They were viewed as a young team that was still in the middle of a long term rebuild. They were expected to be a mostly competitive team but ultimately one that didn’t really have a chance to make playoffs. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions just 1/30 voters expected the Bulls to make the playoffs and that was an 8th seed. There was some promising development for the Bulls with Zach Lavine having a career season and Lauri Markannen building on a strong rookie season but the glimpses were few and far between. In the end though, the Bulls didn’t have a good season going backwards in wins from the year prior.

The Washington Wizards were predicted to win 44 games in the preseason with 538 expecting them to win as many as 48 games. They were viewed as a veteran team that with the addition of Dwight Howard would be a solidified playoff team. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions almost everyone, 29/30 voters expected the Wizards to feature in the playoffs. An early season injury limited John Wall to just 32 games and Dwight Howard only played 9 games as well which could be to blame for the Wizards lack of success but in reality they had been playing poorly prior to the injury either way. A few mid season trades saw them move Otto Porter and Kelly Oubre for Jabari Parker and Bobby Portis but they were barely anymore successful with them. With John Wall still sidelined all of next season there isn’t a lot of optimism regarding the Wizards and there is a lot of uncertainty about their direction.

- **Minnesota Timberwolves** WL Record: 36-45*                   
       
The Minnesota Timberwolves were predicted to win 44 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as many as 49 games. They were viewed as a fringe playoff team that would likely be one of the unlucky teams to only just miss out on the playoffs. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions only, 3/30 voters expected the Wolves to feature in the playoffs with all three voters putting them as an 8th seed. Early season drama with Jimmy Butler did little to help the team as they would eventually trade him following a 4-9 start. The Wolves had little runs of form but ultimately never really looked like a threat to make a playoff push. A point of optimism for Minnesota through out the year was the resurgence of Derrick Rose who had arguably his best season since his injury troubles. However going forward the Wolves seem to be rather directionless especially with the Andrew Wiggins contract.

- **Phoenix Suns** WL Record: 19-63                      
    
The Phoenix Suns were predicted to win 28 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as many as 30 games. They were viewed as a team, that with the addition of number one draft pick DeAndre Ayton, would finally start to show some improvement and Devin Booker was expected to lead the team back to some semblance of relevance. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 0/30 voters expected the Suns to feature in the playoffs. Expectations were already low for the Suns but they were expected to be competitive, they were anything but that as they started the season just 4-24 and failed to win even 20 games for the whole year. The Suns will be in the lottery this offseason for the tenth time in eleven years and with some recent draft failures Suns fans will be praying for some success their. Despite being a poor team Phoenix at least seem to have some sort of direction which should eventually bode well for them.

- **Boston Celtics** WL Record: 49-33      
      
The Boston Celtics were predicted to win 57 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as many as 59 games. After an incredible playoff run the season prior they were viewed as an exciting young super team that would not only be a solid playoff team but many expected the Celtics to be the second best team in the league. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 23/30 voters expected the Celtics to finish first in the Eastern conference with the other 7 voters expecting them to finish second. However what ultimately happened was the team would struggle to win 50 games in a season filled with drama. Tatum and Rozier didn’t play as expected, team chemistry issues arose, Hayward failed to recover and Brad Stevens’ coaching was sub par. The Celtics however are still an incredibly talented team and it would not be surprising to see them make the NBA finals. Although it wouldn’t be entirely surprising to see them lose in the first round either. With Kyrie Irvings impending free agency this will be a critical post season push by Boston.

The New York Knicks were predicted to win 27 games in the preseason with Action Network expecting them to win as many as 30 games. They were viewed as a young and inexperienced team that would struggle to win many games especially with a season ending injury to Kristaps Porzingis. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 0/30 voters expected to see New York in the playoffs so its amazing in a way that the  Knicks still underperformed. The Knicks had multiple losing streaks of over 10 games and where the worst team in the NBA for large parts of the season. The Knicks made a huge gamble at the trade deadline effectively trading Porzingis to the Mavericks to free up cap space. It is yet to be seen whether the gamble will pay dividends as the attempt to pursue big name free agents but for having one of the worst records in the NBA this season its fair to say the Knicks failed to meet expectations despite how low they really were. 
  

  
- **New Orleans Pelicans** WL Record: 33-49      
    
The New Orleans Pelicans were predicted to win 45 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as many as 48 games. They were viewed as a team that could really build on a strong playoff run and Anthony Davis was expected to take a step up and become a legitimate MVP candidate. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 23/30 voters expected the Pelicans to feature in the playoffs and instead the Pelicans essentially imploded. Davis requested a trade midseason after an underwhelming season and the Pelicans just fell from there. Davis was placed on a team imposed minutes restriction and the teams lack of depth was severely exposed. Its hard to see what the future holds for New Orleans and it is very much reliant on what unfolds with the Anthony Davis situation and whether they can build around Jrue Holiday going forward.

- **Cleveland Cavaliers** WL Record: 19-63        
    
The Cleveland Cavaliers were predicted to win 31 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as many as 32 games. They were viewed as a veteran team that would struggle following the departure of Lebron James in free agency but would be able to compete for playoffs in a weak Eastern conference. Kevin Love was expected to lead the team and return to his Minnesota form. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions only 7/30 voters expected the Cavaliers to feature in the playoffs but they somehow still underperformed on those expectations. Kevin Love was injured for a majority of the season, Kyle Korver and George Hill were traded, JR Smith disappeared somewhere and the team quickly changed its focus. A positive for Cavalier fans was the development of Colin Sexton in the back half of the season but ultimately to follow 4 straight finals appearances with a bottom 3 record makes the season a major disappointment for the Cavaliers.

- **Los Angeles Lakers** WL Record: 37-45    
  
The Los Angeles Lakers were predicted to win 47 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as many as 49 games. They were viewed as a team that would be on the rise with lots of excitement with the addition of Lebron James to complete and teams exciting young core of emerging talents. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 28/30 voters expected the Lakers to feature in the playoffs, 6/30 voters even predicted them to have home court. However what eventuated was a forgettable season for the Lakers as the underachieved tremendously. Lebron James missed 16 games through injury before infamously being ‘managed’ through the remainder of the year. The Lakers playoff chances weren’t completely ruled as late as February but a horrific stretch of losses against bottom seeded teams late in the season saw them miss the playoffs by quite a margin. Its going to be a long offseason for the Lakers.

ZandrickEllison,2019-04-03 13:19:31+00:00,The results are in for: LEAST Valuable Player,"While the media may focus on the MVP award, reddit has the distinct honor of awarding the LVP. **The LEAST Valuable Player**. It's a tradition that dates back to 2016-17, when Indiana starting SG Monta Ellis won the trophy. Last season, Minnesota SG Jamal Crawford won [LVP honors](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8ai7pl/the_results_are_in_for_least_valuable_player/?st=jsdf3cqi&amp;sh=70ff7ca4) thanks to some incredibly bad defensive numbers (514th out of 514 players.)

Before we announce this year’s winner, let’s review the criteria and caveats:

--- Obviously, the worst players in the league are the ones who sit at the end of the bench and don't get any playing time. However, this award focuses on players who log a decent amount of minutes and consequently affected their team's play the most. Simply put: the more you play, the more damage you can do.

--- And that actual ""damage"" is important. If you're on a tanking team, no one cares about your poor play; it may even be a positive. I'm also ignoring young players (under 21) who are still developing and can't be expected to be solid players yet.

--- Similarly, we don't want to judge players within the context of their salary any more than the actual MVP does. Someone like Chandler Parsons may be hurting his team with his fat contract, but he's not the type of player we're eyeing; we want players who are sinking their team on the court.
 
######**not quite enough minutes**
 
**F Carmelo Anthony, HOU**: In theory, Carmelo Anthony should have fit well as a complementary scorer in Houston (or in OKC the year before.) But after 10 games -- and 29.4 minutes per contest -- it became clear that theory did not match reality anymore. Thankfully, Daryl Morey and the team called a mulligan before it was too late.
 
**G Markelle Fultz, PHI/ORL**: It's too soon to determine if Markelle Fultz will be a total bust or not, but it's fair to say that he never should start alongside a ball-dominant non-shooter like Ben Simmons again. Forcing Fultz into this particular starting lineup was a terrible idea from the start, but also got mercy-killed (19 games) before he could rack up LVP consideration.
 
**G Jerryd Bayless, PHI/MIN**: Veteran Jerryd Bayless has played horribly since he started logging minutes again (charting as the 100th of 101 point guards according to ESPN real plus/minutes). He escapes the noose here based on the fact that he's only played 32 games, most of which came during the doldrums of the season.
 
######**not quite what we expected**
 
**G Avery Bradley, LAC/MEM**: A strong run in Boston helped inflate Avery Bradley's reputation and salary, but he struggled to maintain that type of impact with the Clippers. He didn't contribute much on offense and his lack of size limited his ability to guard wings (-1.34 on ESPN RPM). To his credit, he's played better in Memphis, although perhaps it's no coincidence that the Clippers have played well without him in turn.
 
**G Austin Rivers, WAS/HOU**: Again, Austin Rivers escapes our LVP honors based on the fact that he's had a few nice moments with his new team in Houston. That said, his shooting has been poor this season, with the 52.7% from the free throw line being most alarming of all.
 
**F Markieff Morris, WAS/OKC**: Another member of the disappointing Wizards, Markieff Morris has been dealing with injuries this season so we can excuse him to some degree. That said, you do wonder about a player who has a reputation as a ""stretch"" four but limited results (32.8% from three this season, 33.7% for his career.)
 
**G/F Tyreke Evans, IND**: On paper, Tyreke Evans should have parlayed a strong season in Memphis into a 6th Man of the Year candidacy in Indiana. That has not been the case. He's struggled to find a rhythm all season, logging just a 48.1 true shooting percentage.
 
######**our official top 5 LVP ballot**
 
**(5) G/F Andrew Wiggins, MIN: 34.9 minutes per game, -1.4 RPM**
 
After a season or two into his NBA career, it became clear that the Andrew Wiggins we got was not the Andrew Wiggins we had been promised as a high school superstar. But that said, he still started to find some rhythm. He couldn't shoot like a modern star, but he could slash and slither his way to the free throw line (6.8 attempts per game in year 2-3). If he did *that*, perhaps he could be a throwback scorer in the DeMar DeRozan mold.
 
And then: the T-Wolves traded for Jimmy Butler, and something changed. Taking the ball out of Wiggins' hands reduced his already-shaky value and tarnished his already-fragile confidence in a way that he's never fully recovered from yet. His FTA are down to under 4.0 over the last two seasons, putting his poor shooting on full display. He's hitting 40.5% from the field, 33% from three, and 70% from the line for a grand total and god-awful 48.6% true shooting.
 
The fact that Wiggins is an empty calorie scorer (17.9 points per game) and poor defender (-1.40 on ESPN real plus/minus) who is logging such heavy minutes puts him as a frontrunner for this award. In his defense, that ESPN RPM grades his offense as a net even +0.00, which is a feather in his cap in a lineup like this. In fact, it prevents him from snagging our LVP.
 
**(4) G/F Evan Turner, POR: 22.0 minutes per game, -3.86 RPM**
 
""The Villain"" has been a staple of the LVP award circuit, earning dishonorable mentions in each of the prior two seasons. Still, whenever we'd point out his awful shooting numbers and poor advanced stats, Portland fans would defend him. Still a solid playmaker, he simply needed a different role and the ball in his hands more often.
 
The Blazers agreed with that logic, making a big point of emphasis that they were going to stagger Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum less so that Turner could thrive like he did back in Boston. They wanted to salvage Turner and their oversized investment in him; they did not want to admit their mistake. In my mind, that would be taking the pile of poop the dog left on the rug and claiming it should be the centerpiece at the dinner table.

Turner has some talent and some virtues (he has averaged 3.8 assists per game, and notched a triple double this week), but they cannot overcome his fundamental problem: he is SUCH a bad and reluctant spacer (hitting 16.7% of his threes on 0.7 attempts per game) that he is still a net negative overall. He charts poorly on offense (-2.66 on ESPN RPM) and below average on defense (-1.2). In his defense, Turner has dealt with injuries and personal issues this year, but this is a trend that has continued for several years now. The fact that Damian Lillard can continue to carry this team to a top seed out West despite the limited shooting around him is a real testament to his case as a top 10 player.
 
**(3) F Stanley Johnson, DET/MEM: 18.2 minutes, -2.62 RPM**

and

**(2) F Jonathon Simmons, ORL/PHI: 18.7 minutes, -5.05 RPM**
 
We're linking these two together because they suffer from the same issues. They’re strong and fierce forwards, both doomed by the same problem: very poor shooting. The numbers are cold and harsh. Both shoot under 39% from the field, under 29% from three, and both have a true shooting under 50%. Largely as a result of that, their advanced numbers are some of the worst in the league. Simmons charts as the 88th best small forward out of 89, ahead of only rookie Kevin Knox.
 
As is the case with most ""LVP"" candidates, the main problem isn't so much that they are bad players as much as they're over-played. Their original teams felt compelled to force them out there for various reasons: Stanley Johnson had been a recent lottery pick, while Simmons had been a recent free agent add. But at the end of the day, their organizations realized to call a mulligan and shed the dead weight, which helped both franchises improve toward the second half of the season.
 
**(1) F Solomon Hill, NO: 19.4 minutes per game, -3.09 RPM**
 
If you catch Solomon Hill on the right night, you may think he's a solid rotational player. He looks the part of a spacer and decent defender. Presumably, New Orleans GM Dell Demps must have seen one or two of those good playoff games in Indy before handing Hill a 4 year, $48M contract.
 
The trouble is: his shooting is not quite good enough or consistent enough to merit that 3+D role. He's netting 32.1% from three for the season, not far off from his 32.9% career average. And if Solo Hill isn't shooting well, he simply isn't doing enough to help you win. He's an OK defender (measured -0.6 on ESPN RPM) but not a true positive there.
 
What makes Hill most worthy of this dubious honor is the domino effect that his below-average play may have caused. Sure, he only played limited minutes across 40 games (15 starts), but the majority of those came earlier in the season when New Orleans still had dreams of the playoffs sparkling in their eyes. While their record may have been bad from the start, the team was actually better than that (and had a positive point differential prior to the white flag going up.) If they had settled on the right rotation earlier, they may have turned that ship around. But because the organization overpaid Hill a few summers ago, they stubbornly force-fed him minutes at the expense of better 3+D players (like Darius Miller.) Partly as a result, the team underachieved and soon lost the faith of their franchise player Anthony Davis. The ramifications of *that * may be far reaching (and even beyond the firing of GM Dell Demps.)
 
To be clear and reiterate, we are not saying that Solomon Hill is the worst player in the NBA. Far from it. On some teams, he could be a playable 8th man. But the LVP is not about the ""worst player in the league;"" it's about the player whose poor season hurt their team the most. And unfortunately for the Pelicans, starting Hill may have done more damage than any other player in the league this season.

&gt;“He’s a very good defensive pick-and-roll player,” Clippers forward Danilo Gallinari said. “He can protect the rim very well. He knows how to use his body. He knows how to be vertical. He’s been doing great for us.”

&gt;Before the Feb. 7 trade deadline, the Clippers had a defensive rating of 110.2, the 19th-best mark in the league. But over the past 13 games, with Zubac starting at center, the team has posted a 108.8 defensive rating, 11th-best in the league. Before their 125-104 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday, the Clippers were a top-seven defense with Zubac.

&gt;“We have a rim-protector. Bottom line,” coach Doc Rivers said. “Trezz [Montrezl Harris] does it at times. But Zu is a true rim-protector, and Zu has been great at it. So that’s why (we’ve improved).”

&gt;“He’s not one of those guys who cares about getting dunked on or anything,” Beverley added. “Pressure from me and Shai, send them to Zu, Zu cleaning up.”

&gt;Finally, in the short term, Zubac is battling injuries to both hands. In his right (and dominant) hand, he has hyperextended tendons. In his left hand, he has a fractured bone in his middle finger. He is gutting it out and playing through the injuries, but they have clearly affected his play.

BergIsToasted,2019-03-12 19:40:07+00:00,Help My Dad's Endgame,"TL/DR:  My dad has ALS and is very close to the end.  He was given a month to live a few weeks ago - he’s not going to make it to Endgame.  As the MCU has been so important in our relationship (we've been going to MCU movies since Iron Man), I’d love the last movie we watch together to be Endgame! Can you guys help me make it happen?

The Long Story:

Last August, my dad was diagnosed with slow-progressing Bulbar ALS.  The doctors told him he’d likely have 3-5 years.  They said nothing was guaranteed - ALS is a beast that’s really tricky to predict.  I’ve witnessed it.  His hand would feel a little weak one week then he wouldn’t be able to lift a cup the next week. 

My dad and I haven’t had the smoothest relationship, but watching superhero movies has been a pretty consistent thing for us.  We started Father’s Day ‘08 when we went to Iron Man and haven’t looked back.  We’ve had stretches where we weren’t really talking, but our bimonthly 15 minute chats were mainly talking about the MCU.  

After his diagnosis, I moved home to help my mom take care of him.  While ALS sucks, it gave us an opportunity to become closer and put some demons to rest.  I feel very fortunate for that.  Thankfully, the ALS was slow progressing, so he was still able to bike and drive, use his computer, and live a semi-normal life for awhile.  

I ended up going back to University this past September, and though his ALS was progressing, we were expecting to have him around for awhile.  Then, in December, I got a call the “come home to say goodbye” call.  I guess his body wasn’t reacting to antibiotics for pneumonia.  So I fly home (the Endgame trailer ironically came out during my layover) and thankfully he began reacting to new treatment.  We got more time, but his prognosis became months not years, and his quality of life was far lower than pre-pneumonia. 

Today, my dad is unable to walk alone, eat (without a tube), use his hands, lift his neck, breathe without assistance, or speak.  His type of ALS includes Frontotemporal Dementia, and that’s kicked into overdrive this last month.  He’s tired most of the time. We spend 3-4 hours a day on rigorous breathing treatments and oral care to prevent another infection.  He’s been in and out of the hospital four times since December.  It’s been rough.  He’s currently in the hospital again with another infection, and his lungs aren’t strong enough to handle another.

So, what’ve we done together over the last year?  Watched a *stupid* amount of Marvel movies.  I can’t complain, it’s been really fun.  Plus, seeing Black Panther, Ant Man and The Wasp, and Infinity War opening night were events for us to look forward to.  He didn’t really have much else to look forward to.  Back when he could still use the computer, he’d spam me with articles about the movies the next week.  Here’s an example of one:

Subject:  Missed that red skull was alive

Did you catch that detail?  

\*attached article about Red Skull being alive\*

All my love, dad.

This one cracked me up.  How’d ya miss that dad?? I thought it was kind of cute.  On our latest watch-through, we started ranking the MCU movies.  It’s been fun!  The only main discrepancy is that I have Age of Ultron right below Civil War, while he has it near the bottom of his list.  Agree to disagree, I guess.  

So, like many other people with loved ones who have terminal illnesses, I set a goal.  I wanted him to make it to Endgame.  It was stupid, but I thought if we couldn’t watch Marvel movies in the future, we should at least close out this chapter together.  And it was reasonable!  It was 22 months after his diagnosis, where he was given 3-5 years. 

Unfortunately, it’s no longer realistic.  He doesn’t have a month left in him.  It’s sad, but he’s pretty ready to be done with this.  Again, his quality of life is *really* low.  

But we were so close!  I saw how the internet really rallied around Alex a few months ago, so I figured I’d try my hand with my dad!  I figured if we could spread the message around, maybe we could get someone at Marvel to put on a screening for my dad or bring the movie to the house.  We live in Portland, Oregon.  We’d really appreciate the help! He doesn’t have many good days left, but seeing Endgame would definitely put a smile on his face :). 

I’ve read that twitter is a good medium for this stuff, so I made a twitter for him.  It’s @Pauls\_Engame.  I figured a good hashtag might be #PaulsEndgame?  Do I just start tweeting celebrities to gain attention?  Please let me know what you guys think!  Any help is really really appreciated!

I can provide a doctor's note or something as proof if needed.  Attached is a photo of my dad with Hulk Hands in the hospital!

And who has the biggest Daddy issues in the NBA?,"Do you ever wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat, running from that feeling of abandonment that has haunted you for your entire life?  Its moments like those that have inspired this post, those somber moments where you look in the mirror and ask yourself, “Who’s your daddy?”

For this post, I am examining cumulative team success against a given opponent for the last decade.  Below you will see the Top 10 Daddy Issues in the NBA, which are the 10 most lopsided match-ups of the past decade. 

After that, I break down each team by listing the top 5 teams in terms of win % against that franchise over the past 10 years, aka their Daddy.  So, let’s get started.

Perhaps this is LaMarcus's parting gift to Portland, and he is seeing it through?

The next closest team is the OKC Thunder who are 27-30 against the Spurs since 2009.

Mister_DB_Cooper,2019-03-05 14:09:46+00:00,"Forty-eight years ago, I had to become ""D. B. Cooper."" These are the details I've never shared.","Yesterday, I shared the experiences that led me to the craziest decision of my life. That story can be found here:

https://old.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ax6548/fortyeight_years_ago_i_pulled_off_the_only/

For those who were wondering: yes, I really am D. B. Cooper. No, that’s not my real name. For obvious reasons, I need to keep my anonymity. I’m sorry that I can’t share more.

I wanted to respond to questions that people left in the comments, but for some reason, my messages can’t be read. I also found out that I have to wait 24 hours between each post.

My apologies for any confusion. I’m 88 years old, and there are still many things that I don’t understand about the internet.

------------------------

“I can always turn back” was the mantra that got me past my own inertia.

Was I really going to hijack a place? No, I told myself – I was just *setting up* for it, not actually doing something wrong. I could always turn back before I became a criminal. 

Which made sense. I had been a law-abiding citizen for my entire life. I’d nearly died for my country. 

Then I remembered the note attached to my wife’s medical file. The people controlling her fate wanted me to become a widower. 

That’s what I had gotten for following the rules all my life.

And suddenly, I didn’t feel so bad about destroying the system that was trying to kill my wife.

I thought about how shockingly easy it had been to break into files that were supposedly top secret. 

The reality is that I had been conditioned to believe in un-crossable boundaries. We all have.

Those limits are real simply *because* we believe in them.

But the thought of losing my wife in my early 40s – of spending the next half-century alone – peeled back the visage of a world that had been created through belief and obedience. 

In its stead was a plan.

The pieces fell into place almost of their own accord, and the idea presented itself to me fully formed. I looked for a reason to believe that it wouldn’t work. But each possibility generated the same result:

If I don’t, she will die.

So I kissed my wife goodbye three days before Thanksgiving. She cried then – not in an angry or combative way, but with tears that were too exhausted to fight. “Please,” she whispered.

“Trust me,” I responded.

We looked at each other for several minutes, but didn’t say another word.

That was our entire conversation.

It was all that needed to be said, and neither of us could bear any more talking.

I extracted $200 in cash, leaving my credit card and driver license at home. I gave a fake name to the motels along the way, changing it each time I had to use one. 

“Dan Cooper,” I responded to the man selling tickets at Portland International Airport. 

It was the first and last time I ever said the name. 

For reasons I don’t fully understand, people came to use the alias “D. B. Cooper” when talking about me. The name stuck.

I tried to smile as I handed over cash for the ticket, but my entire face was numb. I paid $20 (flights were much cheaper then, and required no photo ID), he handed me 87 cents in change, and I walked away like someone else was controlling my body.

Waiting to board was the worst. I almost turned back when I saw a little girl of about six wearing a blue dress and combing a Barbie doll’s hair. I considered what I was about to do to her family, and I nearly vomited.

*Road flares,* a voice in my mind interrupted. *You’re only using road flares that look like a bomb. No one’s getting hurt.* 

I almost laughed at the internal voice. *I* was going to lose everything if they called my bluff. My wife would die alone while I withered in a forgotten federal prison cell, waiting decades to be released back into a life that I no longer wanted.

No, someone was definitely going to get hurt. 

Sometimes, that’s a good thing. 

My heart nearly jackhammered out of my chest as a stewardess stared curiously at my briefcase while I boarded. I tried to smile.

I failed.

But I walked confidently past her and headed for the rear of the plane. Like I said, flying was different in the 1970s. No one checked any of my bags.

The first signs of a combat flashback were stirring as I sat in the back row where I could watch everyone. As soon as I did, the stewardess made a beeline for me.

For the moment, I forced the flashback away. I had to.

This was it.

“Excuse me, miss,” I called, waving slightly. 

She flashed that fake airline smile and asked me how she could be of assistance. 

“Bourbon, please,” I responded. I felt exhausted already.

“Of course,” she answered with saccharine sweetness. “Coca-cola?”

I nodded, and she turned away. 

I didn’t think I could do it.

She returned with my beverages and a grin. After handing them over, she sat right near me in one of those folding seats used only by airline crew.

I wanted to cry. This was too much. I had to give up.

Every tool I needed was in my briefcase, but I just wasn’t strong enough to use them. Part of me always knew that I would be too weak. As the plane took off, I closed my eyes and did everything I could to hold in the tears.

“Going home?” came a voice from behind me.

I wiped my eyes and turned around in surprise. “Pardon?”

It was the same stewardess who had brought me the bourbon. “Are you heading home for Thanksgiving? It’s always crazy for us the day before.” Her smile seemed real this time. “I’ve been in the air for nineteen hours straight. All *I* want to do is get back to my family and then take a nice, long rest.”

The first tear finally escaped, but I wiped it away before she could see it. 

Finally, I smiled too. It was genuine.

I pulled the pre-written note from inside my briefcase and handed it too her. “Me, too.”

She took the note politely. My adrenaline spiked.

Then she dropped it, unread, into her purse. 

I frowned. 

“Um. Excuse me, Miss?”

She seemed irritated now, but the saccharine smile was back in place as she turned to look at me. I waved her closer and leaned forward.

“I really think you should read that message.” I pulled up my briefcase, but kept it closed for the moment. “I have a bomb.”

And just like that, there was no turning back.

SmartAleq,2019-03-02 23:47:32+00:00,Some more info on the Great Juanita's Mystery!,"So, I was in Freddie's the other day and the Juanita's merchandiser was there stocking the shelves so I decided to ask him a few questions about the totally inferior chips we all know keep showing up but that Juanita's denies exist.

Guy admits that when he goes to pick up his cartons he can tell which facility the bags come from based on the sticker on the carton and that the defective crappy ones are actually turned out in a factory in California. Which explains much, but not necessarily WHY we keep getting the gross ones here in Portland.

He says the CA factory is primarily online to produce Juanita's chips FOR distribution in CA (which would explain it if they don't comprehend why we're so sprung on the real ones) but that sometimes if the Hood River factory gets overwhelmed with orders or if, like last week, the town gets stranded by weather and the trucks can't get through they'll take over production and the crap ones get shipped up here to ruin our day.

That's why they sometimes suck, but it is good to know that we aren't totally fucking crazy, this really is happening and the  merchandisers know it perfectly well and at least one of them is looking out for us by picking only Hood River chips to stock our stores with.

Kudos to you, Juanita's guy at the SE Sunnyside/172nd Freddie's--you're a goddamned hero!",Portland,1130

#**1. NBA Basketball 101**

**Scoring ‘Baskets’.** Putting the ball through the hoop either awards you 1, 2, or 3 points depending on the circumstance. 2-point shots are the most common, and the default for any shot, lay-up, or dunk. The shot is worth 3-points if it enters the basket from beyond the aptly-named 3-point line, also called ‘the arc’ (e.g. ‘from beyond the arc’ or ‘from downtown’). Common types of standard shots include the ‘jump shot’, when a player’s feet leave the ground as the ball leaves his hands, and the ‘step back’, when a player quickly steps backwards, away from the defender just before shooting. The only 1-point baskets are free throws – open, uncontested shots awarded to players who have been fouled, or whose team has amassed a certain number of fouls in a quarter.

**Fouls &amp; Violations.** The penalties of the NBA come in a wide variety of obscure forms, but the ones you’re going to see the most are:

•	Personal Fouls – When an opposing player hits, pushes, shoves, holds, or illegally obstructs another player. If the fouled player was shooting the ball, and the ball went in, they’re awarded one free throw (i.e. they get 2 points for the basket, or 3 if it was a 3-pointer, and have an opportunity to make it a 3-point or 4-point play, respectively, by scoring a free-throw). If the fouled player was shooting the ball while fouled and missed, they are awarded either 2 free throws for a missed 2-pointer, or 3 free throws for a missed 3-pointer.

•	Charging – You can’t plow into a defending player.

•	Blocking – You can’t plow into an offensive player.

•	Traveling – You can’t move while holding the ball and not dribbling it.

•	Carrying – You can’t hold the ball from underneath between dribbles.

•	Goaltending – Imagine a shot ball as traveling in an arc through the air. Once it reaches the apex of that arc and begins to fall downward toward the basket, it can no longer be blocked, or touched, by any player.

•	3-Second Violation – In general, you cannot stand in the ‘key’ or ‘lane’ – the painted rectangle just under the basket – for more than 3 seconds. There are a variety of exceptions, but in general this prevents a player from standing under the basket for a substantial period of time.

There are others that are less common and less important. Understand that many of these fouls and violations are, to some degree, subjective, and that the referees who determine whether they’ve taken place are imperfect. Mistakes are made. Calls are made that shouldn’t have been, and calls aren’t made that should’ve been. It’s part of the game. Get used to it.

**Assists.** Assists are a stat awarded to players who pass the ball to a player who then promptly scores. This stat reflects a player’s passing ability, their unselfishness, and their ‘vision’ – their ability to know where other players are on the court and to get the ball to them at the right time to guarantee a score. [Here’s a montage of some beautiful assists.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=032N4hay1QY) 

**Rebounds.** Also called ‘boards’, rebounds are when a player grabs a missed shot – often as it falls away from the hoop or backboard. Offensive rebounds are those rebounds secured from the opposing team’s basket, i.e. your team missed a shot, but you’ve retained the ball. Defensive rebounds are those secured from your own team’s basket, i.e. the opposing team missed a shot and you have reclaimed possession for your team.

[Here’s a game from Psychotic Ambassador to North Korea Dennis Rodman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF6qOsgb1cs), whose hands seemed to be magnetically attracted to any ball that fell from the rim any time he was in a game.

**Blocks.** Any time a player attempts a shot, layup, or dunk, and another player interrupts the ball from going into the basket, that is a block. Goaltending fouls generally occur as a result of mistimed blocks. [Here are some of last season’s best blocks.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGVtoBqv4-Q) Blocking is one of two purely defensive stats, along with…

**Steals.** This one’s pretty simple. If you manage to take possession of the ball away from a player on the opposing team, you have recorded a steal. But hey, [let’s montage it anyway.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW9X5h-cFC0)

**Screens.** When one player takes a firm stance on the court and stops players from the opposing team from getting around them, they have ‘set a screen’ or ‘set a pick’. This is often done by offensive players assisting the ballhandler by slowing down and rerouting defenders, allowing their teammates the time and space to score. The ‘pick and roll’ is a common type of 2-player offensive play designed to allow an offensive player to escape defenders via the use of a screen. A ‘switch’ is when defenders must reassign which defensive players are guarding which offensive players often as a result of screens and similar offensive adjustments. Forcing ‘mismatches’ and ‘bad switches’ can be a crucial offensive tactic in generating poor defense and better scoring opportunities. [Here’s a compilation of some ‘brick wall’ screens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcAW6g6BNao), i.e. clips of people setting such firm screens that other players smack off of them like they’re a wall.

**Cutting/Driving/Finishing.** This is the term for when an offensive player runs toward the basket to attempt a dunk or lay-up. It is often preceded by a screen or by fancy dribbling (like ‘a crossover’) intended to disrupt the defender’s ability to run alongside them. Here, [watch Kyrie put on a driving showcase.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOiyFW1Vcs0)

**Posting Up.** Playing in ‘the post’ is when an offensive player is between the 3-point line and the basket, often nearer the basket or in ‘the paint’, with their back or shoulder facing the basket and a defender pressed against them. This was a very common circumstance in the NBA for a long time, but as the value of shots taken from this middle area has decreased in the current strategic ‘meta’, ‘posting up’ is considered less valuable than either driving to the basket directly for a lay-up or dunk, or passing to the arc for a more valuable 3-point attempt. [The best highlight reel for post play I could find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcULJMJFuNs) is from 2014. See what I mean?

#**2. Positions &amp; Player Types**

There are five standard positions in most basketball: the Point Guard and Shooting Guard, the Small Forward and the Power Forward, and the Center. The two Guards are generally the smallest players on the floor and the best at shooting from range. The two Forwards are generally larger and better at playing nearer to the basket. The Center is generally the largest player on the team and assigned to work very close to the basket. In the modern NBA, these positions are becoming increasingly obsolete as more players fill liminal, hybrid roles.

**Point Guards – The De-Facto On-Court Leader**

The ‘floor general’, on most teams, the Point Guard starts each offensive possession with the ball, making the first pass or the first shot. They are often referred to as ‘primary ballhandlers’ for their job in controlling the ball at the start of a play. For a Point Guard, their intelligence, ability to read a defense, and their leadership are as important as their tangible, physical skills, and many of the best PGs are renowned as much for their ‘basketball IQ’ as they are for their jump shots or driving ability.
Stephen Curry and Kyrie Irving fill fairly traditional PG roles for the Warriors and Celtics, respectively. Notice how nearly every possession for each team begins with Steph or Kyrie scoping out the defense, directing their teammates, and initiating a play.
Shooting Guard – The Flashy Shooter and Driver

A role that increasingly steps on the toes of the Point Guard and the Small Forward, the Shooting Guard is traditionally a sharpshooter and an independent playmaker – a player who roams the 3-point line waiting for a chance at a 3-point shot, or hoping to be defended in isolation (‘iso ball’ is the name for 1-on-1 play) where they often excel at drop-stepping or cross-overs to push away the defender for an open shot, or to beat them to a drive to the basket.
Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant were both archetypal SGs, tremendous long-range shooters who also had the skill to blow by defenders and drive to the rim. In today’s game, James Harden exemplifies the Shooting Guard role.

**Small Forward – The All-Around Problem-Solver**

The ‘middle’ role on the court, between the two Guards and the Power Forward and Center, the Small Forward is a role often assigned to players of general, all-around skill and athleticism, jacks of all trades who are not big and powerful enough to take on around-the-rim roles, but who aren’t small and agile enough to be Guards. Small Forwards should ideally be capable of performing essentially every role on the court as-needed, and depending on the team, the coach, and the play, can fulfill a wide range of functions.
Unsurprisingly, the two players widely-regarded as the best in the NBA today – LeBron James and Kevin Durant – are both Small Forwards, as they are each capable of doing just about anything – shooting 3’s, driving to the basket, setting screens, defending, and everything in-between.

**Power Forward &amp; Center – The Rim-Protector and Two-Hand Dunker**

These two positions have gravitated together to such a degree that distinguishing between them is, in my opinion, not valuable. Often when sports journalists discuss the best Power Forwards or best Centers in the NBA, they stumble over the comparisons, being unsure exactly who should be counted as which position. Power Forwards and Centers are the biggest players on the court (the two positions, combined, are referred to as ‘Bigs’), and as such, are generally the most talented rebounders and shot blockers by sheer virtue of their strength and height. Traditionally, PFs played slightly farther away from the basket than true Centers, playing in the post and taking mid-range shots. As this type of play vanishes in the NBA, their role has become all-but identical to that of the Center.

Great historical Centers include Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell (once upon a time, the Center was more like today’s Point Guard in serving as the de-facto team leader) as well as Shaquille O’Neal, who is perhaps to this day the most archetypal Center of all time. Great Point Guards include Tim Duncan and Dirk Nowitzki – both of whom were capable of playing at greater range than most Centers are. In today’s game, great Bigs include Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid.

#**3. A Brief History of the NBA**

**1946-1959: The Early League**

The Basketball Association of America was founded in 1946 by a bunch of dudes who owned hockey arenas when they realized that basketball teams could make them some cash when their arenas were sitting around empty. The BAA absorbed two other leagues – the ABL and the NBL – by 1950, when it became the NBA. The game was substantially different back then – there was no 3-point line or shot-clock (explained later in the next paragraph) – and things like player training, nutrition, travel, and salary were basically non-existent. Stories abound about players who drank and smoked excessively, who had to hitchhike to games in rural places like Fort Wayne and Rochester where teams were located, and retiring because they got jobs that paid them too much to justify playing (can you imagine that happening today?).

The first non-white player, Wataru Misaka, played in 1947, and the first black players joined the league in 1950. The shot-clock was introduced in 1954 (the shot-clock can be seen ticking down in the corner of the screen during any NBA game – it allows the offensive team only 24 seconds to attempt a shot, which resets if the ball touches the rim – preventing one team from simply holding onto the ball the entire game, which is exactly what some teams were doing in the early 50’s, famously once resulting in a final score of 19-18).

The Minneapolis Lakers (now Los Angeles) won five titles in ’49, ’50, ’52, ’53, and ’54 under legendary coach John Kundla and headlined by the first basketball star in history, George Mikan, nicknamed “Mr. Basketball”.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGYKyRmX4q4

**1960-1969: Russell’s Celtics Dynasty**

Bill Russell, the winningest American sportsman in history, joined the Boston Celtics and their star guard Bob Cousy and soon-to-be-legendary coach Red Auerbach in 1957. Between 1957 and 1969, the Celtics would win the NBA Championship a staggering 11 of 13 times, including 8 straight from ’59 through ’66. The NBA has never seen anything like it again, and likely never will. Bill Russell was a defensive monster (in an era before most defensive stats were tracked) and selflessly devoted to winning above all else. Russell was not just the star of the team, but also the coach for the ’68 and ’69 championships as well. Player-coaches are not something we’re going to see again, but Russell got two titles doing both jobs.

During the Celtics’ reign, they would beat Elgin Baylor and Jerry West’s Lakers in ’62, and ’63, Wilt Chamberlain’s Warriors in ’64, then Baylor and West’s Lakers again in ’65, ’66, and ’68. Wilt teamed up with Baylor and West for the ’69 finals, during which West averaged over 37-points per game against the Celtics, now led by a 35-year old player-coach Bill Russell.

And the Celtics still won. Bill Russel’s Celtics were incredible. In any other era, Baylor and West would’ve won several titles (Wilt is less certain: he seemed to care a lot more about his stats, which were admittedly absolutely preposterous, including a 100-point game, than winning).

**1970-1979: The ABA and Over-Expansion**

Understanding the NBA in the 1970’s can be a little difficult. There was a lot going on. During the early-to-mid ‘70s, the ABA gave the NBA a run for its money by offering a more exciting, fast-paced, player-centric game with a multi-colored ball, a 3-point line, a dunk contest, and flashy players with cool nicknames like Julius “Dr. J” Erving. Meanwhile, the NBA went from 9 teams in 1966 to 18 teams in 1974 and was thoroughly diluted with talent. The 70’s are largely remembered as an era when basketball was not especially popular, strangled by racism both internally and by the potential audience, with TV networks offering very little to the league that was increasingly known for losing out to sitcom reruns and hit by multiple drug scandals (NBA players were just famous enough to have as much cocaine as they wanted, but not quite famous enough to get away with it).

The great players of the 1970’s besides Dr. J (who would eventually join the NBA when the ABA merged into it by the end of the decade) include Kareem Abdul-Jabaar (statistically one of the three greatest players of all time), Rick Barry (who shot his free-throws grandma-style, underhanded), Elvin Hayes, Knicks hero Walt ‘Clyde’ Frazier, 3x MVP Moses Malone, George ‘The Iceman’ Gervin, and ‘Pistol’ Pete Maravich (who was born a few minutes away from where I was born, and my name is also Pete – please clap).
The 70’s are the only decade in NBA history where we really can’t talk about anything resembling a dynasty. The talent was so dispersed by the rapid expansion that no team even managed to win back-to-back titles the entire decade, and only the Knicks (’70 and ’73) and Celtics (’74 and ’76) won 2.

Then, in 1979, the 3-point line was added to the NBA the same year that two rookies joined the league – a scrawny white farm boy named Larry Bird joined the Boston Celtics, and a charismatic, wide-smiling showman joined the Lakers. His name was Earvin Johnson – but everyone called him Magic.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tMmaXRSeL4

**1980-1990: The Bird-Magic Rivalry**

If it weren’t for Larry Bird, Magic’s Lakers would’ve dominated the 80’s like the Minneapolis Lakers dominated the 50’s. If it weren’t for Magic Johnson, Bird’s Celtics would’ve done to this decade what Russell’s had done to the 60’s. Luckily for all of us, instead of domination, the 80’s were fierce competition – and that competition sparked a huge upturn in broadcast numbers and ticket sales. These two players, who had played against each other in the ’79 NCAA College Championship Game, would, through their rivalry (first a genuine spite, and later a genuine friendship), reinvigorate a shoddy league and set the stage for the modern NBA. From here on, from Magic and Bird on, the NBA is the league as we know it today – superteams, corporate sponsorships, 3-pointers, flashy dunks – the NBA we know and love was born between Magic and Bird.

The Lakers, with young superstar Magic and veteran leader Kareem, won the ’80, ’82, ’85, ’87, and ’88 championships under legendary coach Pat Riley. The Celtics won the ’81, 84, and ’86 titles, with Bird leading a remarkable team of the likes of Kevin McHale and Robert Parish. During the battle between these two juggernauts (three of those NBA finals were Celtics-Lakers), Moses Malone got to three championship series – one loss with the 76ers, one win with the 76ers, and one more loss with the Rockets – and Hakeem Olajuwon’s Rockets, a team that would’ve been amazing in any other era, got to, and lost, one finals series against Boston. With these exceptions, the ’80 to ’87 era was dominated by Boston and Los Angeles.

In ’88, Magic’s Lakers won their last title against Isiah Thomas’ Bad Boy Pistons – who would go on to beat them in ’89 and then beat the Portland Trail Blazers and Clyde Drexler in ’90. The Pistons three straight finals and two straight titles are something of a forgotten bridge between the famous Bird-Magic ‘80s and the even more famous era that was to follow…

**1991-1998: Michael Jordan**

Drafted into the league from the University of North Carolina in 1984, Michael Jordan grew up while Bird and Magic were still sharing the crown, on a Bulls team that just wasn’t quite up to snuff. But as Magic and Bird aged and the Lakers and Celtics faded, and Isiah Thomas’ Pistons took the crown, the Bulls and their now-prime Michael Jordan were ready. Under the leadership of coach Phil Jackson, the Bulls ousted the Pistons to face Magic in his last finals appearance in 1991, and won in 5 games. The next year, Michael’s Bulls beat Portland. The year after that, they beat the Suns. Michael Jordan was the greatest player the league had seen in decades, maybe ever… and at the height of all that, after three straight titles… his father was murdered, and he was faced with a personal crisis that culminated in his retirement from the NBA to play for a minor-league baseball team (If it sounds like there has to be a larger story there – there is, but we don’t have time to get into that here).

While Michael was gone, Hakeem Olajuwon’s Rockets (remember them from the 80’s?) came back to win back-to-back titles in ’94 and ’95. Hakeem caught a break… or so he thought.

“I’m back.”

With those two words, Jordan came out of retirement, and immediately led the Bulls to a regular-seasons record of 72-10, the best in history to that point, followed by another threepeat, winning the ’96 title over Seattle, and the ’97 and ’98 titles over Karl ‘The Mailman’ Malone and John Stockton’s Utah Jazz. Two threepeats, 6 titles, an undefeated record in the finals, and now, at last… Jordan would retire again, this time for good.

…wait, he came back AGAIN? And played for a terrible team that missed the playoffs? Okay, we’re going to pretend that didn’t happen. Jordan retired for good as far as anyone is concerned. And so in 1999, after years of the leadership of epic players like Bird, Magic, Thomas, Olajuwon, and Jordan, the league was opened up for new blood.

**1999-2010: NBA in the New Millennium**

From ’99 through ’10, coach Gregg Popovich’s San Antonio Spurs won 4 titles, and coach Phil Jackson’s (remember him?) Lakers won 5 titles. That probably makes it sound like this was another of the NBA’s great rivalries, but it really wasn’t – at least, not in the same way as the Lakers-Celtics, for example. The Spurs and Lakers are both in the Western Conference, meaning that the two teams could never play against one another in the finals. Popovich’s Spurs were championed by legendary Power Forward Tim Duncan, while Jackson’s Lakers road the wave of devastating Shooting Guard Kobe Bryant. Besides the hiccup of the ’04 Pistons, the ’06 Heat (coached by Pat Riley – remember him, too?), and the ’08 Celtics, the Spurs and the Lakers dominated this decade.

I imagine many of the people looking to get into the NBA grew up with the ’99-’10 NBA happening in the background. It might stand out as odd to you that the Shaq-Kobe Lakers duo was such a cultural phenomenon even outside of the basketball world, while Tim Duncans Spurs seemed to slip under the radar. The Spurs played a very clean, unselfish, systematic style of basketball, and Tim Duncan had the exact opposite of a superstar personality, creating a very professional and undramatic dynasty compared to those led by spotlight-lit stars like Kobe or Shaq – or even Allen Iverson, who I distinctly remember as a non-basketball-fan growing up, even though his team never managed to win a finals (they made it, but lost, in ’01).

**2011-2016: LeBron James**

Best to just come out with it from the very start. LeBron James has been in every NBA Finals game since 2011. His Miami Heat made the Finals every year from ’11 – ’14, and when he returned to his hometown of Cleveland, his Cavaliers made the finals every year from ’15 – ’18. Were the Heat in the Finals the year before LeBron arrived? Nope. Were the Cavaliers in the Finals the year before LeBron arrived? They weren’t even in the playoffs. LeBron James is a phenomenon.

LeBron, a son of Akron, Ohio, not far from Cleveland, was drafted by his hometown Cavaliers straight out of high school in 2003. Though he managed to drag them to one Finals in ’07, Popovich and Duncan’s Spurs swept them 4-0, and by 2010, it became clear that LeBron’s talents were being wasted in Cleveland. Most NBA fans wanted him to stay there, to be loyal to his home team, and to hold out through some bad years and help them see a championship. But in what was dubbed ‘The Decision’, he chose to leave and join superstars Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh on the Miami Heat. The very next season, he made it to the Finals.

The year, 2011, they lost to Dirk Nowitzki (a Power Forward who can shoot 3-pointers, a unique and remarkable player) and the Dallas Mavericks, before winning the ’12 and ’13 titles against the Oklahoma City Thunder (spearheaded by an incredible trio of Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook) and Popovich’s eternal Spurs, who proceeded to best them in ’14.

Remember Jordan’s “I’m Back”? In 2014, LeBron announced he was returning to Cleveland. The team had developed while he was away. They acquired Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, and Kevin Love, and were ready for the King’s guidance. His first year back, they made the finals, and like his first year in Miami, they lost – this time to the Golden State Warriors, led by Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, perhaps the two single greatest shooters in the history of the NBA, as well as superstar Andre Iguodala and defensive machine Draymond Green.

The next year, 2016, the Cavaliers met the Warriors in the Finals again – this Warriors team having beaten Jordan’s Bull’s record of regular season wins, going 73-9 – and the Cavaliers came back from being down 3-1 in the series to win the title, LeBron hoisting his third Championship trophy, and his first with Cleveland, breaking the city’s half-century-long title drought. That win is one of the most legendary in the history of the NBA, and really, in the history of American sports.
And then something happened.

**2016-Present: Golden State Dominance**

The Golden State Warriors had made it to the 2016 titles by beating the Oklahoma City Thunder, who were led by Kevin Durant, widely regarded as the second-best player in the league after LeBron.

And the Warriors signed Durant. This team, already featuring the deadliest pair of shooters in NBA history, the league’s Defensive Player of the Year, having gone to back-to-back titles, having just gone 73-9 in the regular season… signed the league’s second-best player. It shook the entire league. Kevin Durant is the greatest villain in the NBA to this day – nobody else comes close. Many regard this as having destroyed all parity in the league.

In 2017 and 2018, the Warriors and Cavaliers faced off in the Finals two more times – marking the first time the same two teams have played in four straight finals – but this time, the Warriors won 4-1 and 4-0. LeBron, despite seemingly never aging and playing as well as he ever has even into his mid-30’s, despite carrying an increasingly-mediocre Cavaliers team to the Finals year after year… simply couldn’t do anything against a Warriors team with not just Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, with not just Draymond Green, but with Kevin Durant as well. Even the Houston Rockets, who in the 2017-2018 season built and designed themselves specifically to defeat the Warriors, whose whole philosophy and strategy was designed around killing the Warriors, who ended this season with a better record and home court advantage over the Warriors, fell in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals against them.

The Warriors sit on top of the whole league right now in a way that no team has in a very long time. It’s hard to imagine who could beat them.
This offseason, LeBron finally left Cleveland for the second time to join the Los Angeles Lakers. They’re a very young and untested team mixed in with some veteran talent. The Rockets got a little bit worse. The team that would’ve won in the East last year, if not for LeBron, the Celtics, got a little bit better. And what did the Warriors do? The Warriors signed a played named DeMarcus ‘Boogie’ Cousins, one of the most dominant Bigs in the NBA today. He’s coming off a devastating injury and it’s unclear when he’ll be able to play, and whether he’ll be his old self, but there is no indication whatsoever that the Warriors have gotten anything but even better than before. Can anyone possibly threaten them?

Everyone outside of the Bay Area is hoping so. But none of us are feeling very confident about it.

So that’s where we are now.

#**4. Team-by-Team Breakdowns**

I’m going to provide brief summaries of each team in the NBA. These are intended to provide you with the bare basics necessary to have some idea of who they are – what kind of history they’ve had, what their last few seasons have been like, what the expectations are for this season, what we’ll all be watching for, and what particularly notable players have been, or currently are, on their rosters. Stuff will be left out. Important things will be forgotten. People in the comments will be telling me how I left out incredibly vital things that are essential to understanding their favorite team. I know. These are meant to be a primer for new fans, just to get your footing in understanding where a team is coming from and where they're going. I recommend the team's wikipedia pages to learn more.

***

**Atlanta Hawks**

**Hallmarks:** Bob Petit in the ‘50s and ‘60s, Dominique Wilkins in the ’80s and ‘90s; ’58 Champions

**This Year:** Bottom 10

One of the oldest teams in the league, dating back to the Buffalo Bisons in 1946, they won their only NBA Championship in 1958 and haven’t made it back to the finals since ’61, which was before they moved to Atlanta. They have sparsely even managed to make it to the playoffs since then – every time they get the ball rolling and make a playoff break, something seems to fall apart. Dominique Wilkins was one of the great, fun-to-watch dunkers of the ‘80s and his statue sits outside of their arena today. The Hawks had some good fortunes in the late 90’s, and again between ’08 and ’10, but never quite enough to propel them to another Finals. In 2015, finally, it looked like their luck was turning around, having a 17-0 month in January, and even advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals… where LeBron was waiting for them. In 2016, they lost in the first round of the playoffs, and in 2017, they slipped back substantially, as seems to be their curse. They drafted Luka Doncic with the third overall pick in this year’s draft, who they traded for a 2019 first-round pick to the Mavericks for Trae Young. The way that whole thing played out was… controversial.

This year, keep an eye out for Trae Young, who should at the very least be exciting to watch. 41-year old Vince Carter might well be in his final season on their bench. It’s very unlikely that the Hawks will find a lot of success this year, but even if Young and their youthful roster show signs of promise, it will be all the success the Hawks could really hope for. At least the expectations are low. 

***

**Boston Celtics**

**Hallmarks:** 17 NBA Championships, from ’57 through ’08; Bill Russell and Larry Bird.

**This Year:** ECF Contenders

The Boston Celtics are the most successful team in NBA history. They have won 23.9% of all NBA championships in history, and their leaders have won 10 MVPs. Since 1986, they have only managed to win one Championship, the 2008 title. The Celtics have made it to the last four straight playoffs – losing in the first round on ’15 and ’16, and losing in the Eastern Conference Finals to LeBron’s Cavaliers back-to-back in ’17 and ’18. Many commentators speculate that if their last season hadn’t been weakened by injuries to stars Gordon Hayward and superstar Point Guard Kyrie Irving, the Celtics could’ve beaten LeBron and gone to the Finals last year. This year, LeBron has moved to the West, and under the guidance of their incredibly talented coach Brad Stevens and assuming healthy years for their stars and continued growth for their young stars Tatum and Brown, the Celtics have the clearest path to the Finals of any team in the East.

This year, watch the Celtics as closely as any other team. If they stay healthy, the combined power of their all-star lineup, their incredibly deep bench, their all-NBA coach, and the weakened Eastern Conference should make them the clear favorites to face off against Golden State in the Finals. Whether they could beat them is an entirely different question.

***

**Brooklyn Nets**

**Hallmarks:** ABA Champions ’74, ’76, Eastern Conference Title ’02, ’03. Jason Kidd &amp; Dr. J.

**This Year:** Bottom 10

Formerly of New Jersey, the Nets were an ABA team that merged in 1976, bringing Julius Erving into the NBA as the reigning ABA Champs. Though the Nets had a strong streak in the early 00’s under the guidance of Jason Kidd, they never managed to secure an NBA title. Currently in a rebuilding process, they’ve let go of briefly-superstar Jeremy Lin and picked up the likes of Shabazz Napier and Ed Davis from the Blazers on short contracts. It’s been rough going for the Nets, who foolishly gave away their own first-rounders for three straight years, and at last, now, the light might be beginning to peak over the horizon. They have a lot of money in their pockets (and will have even more after this season), and their Brooklyn home attracts superstars far more than a team of their stature normally could. Finally under strong, smart leadership, though the Nets are very unlikely to see any success this year, everything is set up for them to come into next season looking dramatically better.

This year, just enjoy watching some of their young players and one-year contracts, hope for some fun games, and desperately try to make yourselves look like the kind of team that a superstar will want to come to next season.

***

**Charlotte Hornets**

**Hallmarks:** Alonzo Mourning in the early 90’s

**This Year:** Middle-of-the-Pack

The Charlotte Hornets joined as an expansion team in 1988, then moved to New Orleans and became the New Orleans Hornets. Then in 2004, another expansion team started in Charlotte – the Bobcats – until the New Orleans Hornets renamed themselves the Pelicans in 2013, after which the Charlotte Bobcats became the Charlotte Hornets again.
Did you catch all that?

TL;DR the Charlotte Hornets organization as we know it today has only existed since 2004, but they own the rights to the history of the Hornets team from 1988 until 2002 when it moved to New Orleans. So, while the early-90’s Mourning/Johnsons/Curry-era Hornets were a pretty good team… they really have nothing to do with the current Hornets organization. Today’s Hornets, owned by Michael Jordan since 2010, have made three playoffs – each time losing in the first round – and have finished the last two seasons with identical 36-46 records. They are the definition of mediocrity – good enough, maybe, to crack one of the lowest playoff seeds in a year when the conference is weak, but never good enough to do anything with it, and never bad enough to secure a #1 draft pick.

This year, expect much of the same thing. Kemba Walker is talented and entertaining, and this could be his last year in Charlotte. Spurs vet Tony Parker is here to provide guidance and support if things get too dark. You might get to see the first round of the playoffs. Or next year might be the start of a true tanking. It’s all up in the air for the Hornets.

***

**Chicago Bulls**

**Hallmarks:** Michael Jordan and the two 90’s threepeats; the brief spark of light that was Derrick Rose.

**This Year:** Middle-of-the-Pack

The Bulls were a mediocre team until they were the greatest team. Jordan won them their only 6 conference titles and their only 6 championships. Since then, mediocrity has returned to Chicago. Derrick Rose’s ’10-’11 bizzaro-world MVP made it seem like the Bulls might have had another Jordan on their hands, but alas, things are not always as they seem. The Bulls in recent years have been back down toward the bottom of the league, but with rebuilding thoroughly underway and a young and promising roster, it’s not all frowns for the Windy City. LaVine and Markkanen both look very promising (Lauri’s injury was announced as I was typing this – my bad, Chicago), and their draft pick Wendell Carter Jr. is poised to be one of the most exciting rookies to watch this year. It’s not impossible that this is the year the Bulls’ fall comes to a halt and they start turning the plane around and squeeze into the 8th Seed. But it’s also not impossible that the pieces just aren’t in place yet.

This year, watch their young players putting on a fast, exciting show – particularly Wendell Carter Jr., who’s poised to be a Rookie of the Year candidate if anyone is.

***

**Cleveland Cavaliers**

**Hallmarks:** LeBron James, and then again, LeBron James; Incredible 2016 Championship

**This Year:** Middle-of-the-Pack

The Cavaliers joined the league in 1970 and lost the first 15 games they ever played. They made the ECF in 1976, and it was all downhill from there. The Cavaliers were a mediocre-to-bad team until they drafted a kid from Akron named LeBron James, and even in his first few years, they struggled. He got them to one Finals in 2007, but it otherwise took him until his 13th season to manage a Championship in Cleveland. It’s hard to win there. It’s always been hard to win there. And now that the King is gone… there’s no reason to think it’s gotten anything but much harder again. Were the Cavaliers really a bad team that just had the greatest player in the world on their roster last year, or do they, now led by Kevin Love, actually have a real team on their hands?

This year, the Cavaliers will be one of the biggest questions, and one of the most-watched and curious teams in the league. For all we know, Love is going to carry the Cavaliers to some amount of success and even crack the playoffs. If the Cavaliers made the 6th Seed, even, I don’t think we’d be shocked. And if they were one of the 5 worst teams in the NBA, we wouldn’t be shocked either. It’s going to be interesting, that’s for sure.

***

**Dallas Mavericks**

**Hallmarks:** Jason Kidd and Steve Nash (neither in their prime), Dirk Nowitzki; 2011 NBA Championship

**This Year:** Bottom 10

The Mavericks joined the NBA in 1980 and had bad luck, drafting quality players like Detlef Schrempf (no, I didn’t just make that name up) and Mark Aguirre only to see them reach their potential once they were no longer on their roster. They drafted Jason Kidd, who had two separate tenures on the team, but who saw his best years – again – while not playing for the Mavs. Their franchise’s true hero is German-born three-point-shooting-Center Dirk Nowitzki, a strange player with a strange life who took the NBA by absolute storm for a few years and won them their sole NBA Title. That 2011 Championship, as the years go on and every title since has been won by either LeBron or Golden State, is looking increasingly prestigious and remarkable. This offseason, they traded for #3-but-projected-by-many-#1 draft pick Luka Doncic, who has just come off from winning virtually everything you can win in professional European basketball at the ripe age of 19. In what is likely Dirk’s last year, the team’s hopes rest on his shoulders – but you couldn’t ask for better shoulders to rest your hopes on.

This year, watch Luka. The Mavs are unlikely to see a lot of success – the team just doesn’t have enough talent in enough places – but it’s not an uncommon opinion to project that Luka Doncic is going to do things that very few NBA rookies have ever done before. He has played and succeeded at very high levels of professional basketball, playing with and against adults and veterans. He’s no high schooler or even an NCAA senior. He’s a whole different monster.

ad7410,2018-09-21 22:39:20+00:00,Junior dev feeling demotivated after senior dev lashes out at me,"Throwaway account created for this one. 
Working at a very small company in Portland with 3 developers total, including myself. I'm a junior and just started working here. The system we're working with is incredibly complex, spanning nearly 15 years worth of code base, and there is 0 documentation. Naturally, I need to ask the only developer who's been here long enough  (the senior) how things work sometimes. Unfortunately, he always makes me feel like I'm under qualified for this position or that my questions are a huge burden for him to answer. 

As a result, I end up spending hours on my own trying to find the solution to something that could be trivially answered by him. (Like out of the 350 cryptically named db tables we have, these 2 might help you with your task). Instead I have to trial and error look at the massive amount of data in all 350 tables and try and guess which one will remotely be relevant to my task.  Now I understand that I should put an effort first on my own to grok the system, and I do. Sometimes the code is self documenting so I use that as a means to explore further and solve my own problems.. But when I finally think I've spent too much time on something and wish to ask a question, he gets frustrated and gives sarcastic or condescending responses back. When I ask him to review my code, he just looks at it, says ""wow this is bad design. This is real bad"", and then barely provides any advice on how to improve it. We're working for the same company..and ultimately are on the same team aren't we? If my code isn't perfect, I want some basic direction on what I can improve, not a ""what made you think this would ever be a good idea...-walks away-"". 

Finally today, when I asked a question about our cacheing layer, he blew up at me and said I'm annoying and bothersome with my questions and to stop talking to him. I literally ask 1 question a day, maybe 2 max...because I'm terrified he's gonna roast me again if I ""exceed my limit"". 

Our company has no hr, nobody for me to really go to, and I'm feeling really small and like I need to quit. I do a huge amount of research before I ask a question, but at the end of the day, I need to get answers so I can do my job. I don't know what to do but I'm getting really down going to work each day and feeling scared to speak to the senior. Should I quit? ",learnprogramming,1369

In this alternate reality, the NBA removes the franchise that comes in last each season. This means the league continuously shrinks until there is just one team left.

In order to find that one team, we’ll say that this system started 29 seasons ago (as there are 30 teams). We’ll use their real-world records to determine who the eliminated franchise is.

Now, ideally, I’d only look at the games that non-eliminated teams played against each other. However, it’s incredibly difficult to sift through, say, 20 teams’ schedules to look for their records against *each other* by removing their results against the 10 teams that no longer exist. I have no idea how to do that efficiently. Instead, I will use their full, real-world, 82-game records for the first 20 seasons. Then, when there are just 10 teams left, I will only use their records *against each other* as if they were the only teams in the league.

Nobody knows it at the time, but the league has been saved. **The Warriors are permanently removed from the NBA.** The NBA championship is not changed by any team’s elimination. **The Lakers win the championship by defeating the Pacers in the Finals.**

**2000-01 (Year Twelve):** The Washington Wizards come in last place in the NBA at 19-63. They unknowingly save Michael Jordan’s legacy by preventing his comeback. **The Wizards are permanently removed from the NBA.** The NBA championship is not changed by any team’s elimination. **The Lakers win the championship by defeating the 76ers in the Finals.**

**2001-02 (Year Thirteen):** The Houston Rockets come in last place in the NBA at 28-54. The world is much better because of it. **The Rockets are permanently removed from the NBA.** The NBA champion is not changed by any team’s elimination, but the Eastern Conference champion is. In the real world, the Nets won the East. However, since they don’t exist, that title goes to the non-eliminated Eastern team that went farthest in the playoffs that year: the Charlotte Hornets. **The Lakers win the championship by defeating the *Hornets* in the Finals.** Ashamed by their loss, the Hornets immediately move to New Orleans.

**2002-03 (Year Fourteen):** The Cleveland Cavaliers come in last place in the NBA at 17-65. In response, an eighteen year-old LeBron James announces he will be taking his talents to the Guangdong Southern Tigers of the Chinese Basketball Association. He promises to win one for the ‘Dong. **The Cavaliers are permanently removed from the NBA.** Again, since the Nets don’t exist, the new East champion is the team that went the farthest in the real world. **The Spurs win the championship by defeating the *76ers* in the Finals.**

**2003-2004 (Year Fifteen):** The Orlando Magic come in last place in the NBA at 21-61. **The Magic are permanently removed from the NBA.** For the first time, a real-world NBA champion has already been eliminated from existence. That means the championship goes to the runner-up, and the longest-surviving East team wins their conference championship. **The *Lakers* win the championship by defeating the *Pacers* in the Finals.** No one makes fun of Karl Malone for being ringless anymore.

**2004-05 (Year Sixteen):** The Atlanta Hawks come in last place in the NBA at 13-69. **The Hawks are permanently removed from the NBA.** The East champion is changed. **The Spurs win the championship by defeating the *Heat* in the Finals.**

**2005-06 (Year Seventeen):** The Portland Trail Blazers come in last place in the NBA at 21-61. **The Trail Blazers are permanently removed from the NBA.** The West champion is changed. **The Heat win the championship by defeating the *Suns* in the hottest Finals on record.**

**2006-07 (Year Eighteen):** The Milwaukee Bucks come in last place in the NBA at 28-54. People everywhere wonder how they lasted this long. **The Bucks are permanently removed from the NBA.** The East champion is changed. **The Spurs win the championship by defeating the *Heat* in the Finals for the second time in three years.** (Interestingly, the Heat were swept in the first round in the real world. Every other East playoff team had already been eliminated.)

**2007-08 (Year Nineteen):** One year after making it to the NBA Finals, the Miami Heat come in last place in the NBA at 15-67. **The Heat are permanently removed from the NBA.** The NBA champion is changed to the real-world runner-up. **The *Lakers* win the championship by defeating the *76ers* in the Finals.** (The 76ers went 40-42, but were the only non-eliminated Eastern playoff team.)

**2008-09 (Year Twenty):** The Sacramento Kings come in last place in the NBA at 17-65. **The Kings are permanently removed from the NBA.** The East champion is changed. **The Lakers win the championship by defeating the *76ers* in the Finals for the second consecutive year.** (The 76ers were 41-41, but they again were the only East playoff team that hadn’t been eliminated.)

**2009-10 (Year Twenty-One):** For the first time, /u/InMyBrokenChair is willing to take the time to count up the existing teams’ records **solely against each other.** The Philadelphia 76ers, one year removed from being back-to-back Eastern champions, come in last in the NBA at 6-18 against the other existing teams. **The 76ers are permanently removed from the NBA.** Again, the East champion is changed. **The Lakers win the championship by defeating the *Bobcats* in the Finals.** Yes, the Bobcats. No, that’s not a mistake. It was either them, the Knicks, or the Pacers in the East, and the Bobcats made the playoffs while the others didn’t.

**2010-11 (Year Twenty-Two):** The Charlotte Bobcats, one year removed from an Eastern Conference championship, come in last place in the nine-team NBA at 4-15. **The Bobcats are permanently removed from the NBA. The Charlotte Hornets never return.** Both conference champions must be changed to the longest-lasting non-eliminated team. The team that made it farthest in the real world is declared the champion. **The *Thunder* win the championship by defeating the *Pacers* in the Finals.** The Pacers win the East because, in the real world, they won one playoff game while the Knicks got swept.

**2011-12 (Year Twenty-Three):** The New Orleans Hornets come in last place in the eight-team NBA at 4-16. **The Hornets are permanently removed from the NBA. The Pelicans never come into existence.** The East champion is changed, and the Finals runner-up becomes the champion. **The *Thunder* win the championship by defeating the *Pacers* in the Finals for the second consecutive year.**

**2012-13 (Year Twenty-Four):** The Phoenix Suns come in last place in the seven-team NBA at 4-15. **The Suns are permanently removed from the NBA.** The East champion is changed and the Finals runner-up becomes the champion. **The *Spurs* win the championship by defeating the *Pacers* in the Finals.**

**2013-14 (Year Twenty-Five):** The Utah Jazz come in last place in the six-team NBA at 3-13. **The Jazz are permanently removed from the NBA.** The East champion is changed. **The Spurs win the championship by defeating the *Pacers* in the Finals once again.** The Pacers are now the Buffalo Bills of the NBA, losing four consecutive Finals.

**2014-15 (Year Twenty-Six):** The Los Angeles Lakers come in last place in the five-team NBA at 3-10. Things are good. **The Lakers are permanently removed from the NBA.** Both conference champions must be changed to the longest-lasting (or best) non-eliminated team. The team that made it farthest in the real world is declared the champion. **The *Spurs* win the championship by defeating the *Pacers* for the third consecutive year.** The Pacers have lost five consecutive Finals. They didn’t even make the playoffs in the real world, but won the East because the Knicks went 17-65.

**2015-16 (Year Twenty-Seven):** The New York Knicks come in last place in the four-team NBA at 1-6. They spent six seasons in a two-team Eastern Conference, but didn’t manage to win it once. They didn’t gain any championships or extra conference titles out of this entire experiment. It’s somewhat of an accomplishment to make it this far, but it doesn’t really get more hollow than this, Knicks fans. **The Knicks are permanently removed from the NBA.** **The *Thunder* win the championship by defeating the *Pacers* in the Finals.** That’s six straight, Indiana.

**2016-17 (Year Twenty-Eight):** The Oklahoma City Thunder, one year after winning their third championship in six years, come in last place in the three-team NBA at 1-5. **The Thunder are permanently removed from the NBA, and the league is down to two teams.** **Those teams face each other in the Finals, where the *Spurs* yet again defeat the Pacers.** Seven straight.

**2017-18 (Year Twenty-Nine):** Two teams left. The San Antonio and the Indiana Pacers. The Spurs have won eight championships over the last twenty-eight years, four of which were against the Pacers. They play just two games against each other to decide the last team standing. [The first game is a thriller in Indianapolis. The Spurs are up by two in the final minute, but Victor Oladipo drains a three with ten seconds left to put the Pacers ahead. The Pacers hang on to win by three.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/pbp/201710290IND.html) The second game is a bit less exciting. [After a strong third quarter in San Antonio, the Pacers are able to hold off the Spurs to sweep the season series.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/pbp/201801210SAS.html) That means two things: **The San Antonio Spurs are permanently removed from the NBA**, and… **THE INDIANA PACERS ARE THE SURVIVOR! THEY ARE THE LAST REMAINING NBA TEAM!**

---

So what changed in this world?

The Spurs and Thunder won an extra three championships and the Lakers won an extra two. The Pacers won the last one by default. Nobody else gained a championship. The old Charlotte Hornets won an Eastern Conference title then immediately left town never to return. The 76ers gained a fuckton of extra Eastern Conference championships. The Pacers lost seven consecutive Finals. Despite having a single-digit number of teams, this league doesn’t really have much less parity than the real NBA in the last few years. Somehow.

---

What can we learn from this experiment?

The Bucks know how to be bad for a long time while not being the absolute worst?

The Knicks can’t win the East even if there’s only one other team to compete with?

The Pacers have to be **literally the only team left in existence** in order to win an NBA championship?

/u/InMyBrokenChair has to get back to his schoolwork?

These are all valid points.

sharkgorilla,2018-09-14 15:35:51+00:00,Hi! I'm a 23-year-old woman who accidentally drove of a 200+ ft cliff &amp; survived alone at the bottom for 7 days. AMA!,"Hey! 

My name is Angela Hernandez.
On July 6th, 2018, I was driving south on the Pacific Coast Highway. I was driving from Portland, OR to Southern California. 
When I was in Big Sur, CA, a small animal stepped onto the road causing me to swerve, which sent my car down a 200+ cliff and into the water. 

I was at the bottom of the cliff for a total of 7 days. 

I recounted my misadventure in a detailed facebook post that you can read here: 
https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=863966753796017&amp;id=100005481015477

Long story short, the crash caused me to experience a brain hemorrhage for the first few days, break &amp; fracture both collar bones, fracture 4 ribs, and experience intense sunburns on my hands, feet, &amp; face. 

I went without water for the first few days until finding a patch of moss that dripped fresh water from the top of the cliff. I used the radiator hose, which had fallen off of my vehicle, to collect water. 

On the 7th day, right before sunset, I spotted an adventurous couple walking across the beach. They contacted nearby officials and I was lifted up the cliff using ropes and then airlifted to a nearby hospital where I was reunited with my family. 


It was the craziest week of my entire life! Anyway, yeah! Ask me anything!",AMA,1515

The Lakers had been on a 7-game losing streak prior to this, including two back-to-back blowout losses of 36 points and 27 points. They had fallen to almost .500, and were in real danger of missing the playoffs in the West.

This is when Kobe went full nuclear mode, scoring 4 straight 50-point games and 5 straight 40-point games. The Lakers won all 5 games, and they needed all of Kobe's points, as won every game by single digits. 

Bonus: Kobe and Carmelo Anthony had been battling for the scoring title this season. The final game of the Lakers' 7-game losing streak was against Carmelo and the Nuggets, and Melo outscored Kobe in a 27 point blowout. This really lit a fire in Kobe, and over the rest of the season he took a definitive lead in what HAD been a neck-and-neck scoring title race. Kobe finished the season with 31.6 PPG, Melo with 28.9 PPG.

Atillion,2018-08-11 16:23:25+00:00,That time I was an accidental metal bouncer..,"Darkest Hour played a show a couple years ago at the Analog Cafe in Portland, and being a long time fan of the band, a few friends and I took a road trip out to see them.

I like to get to these shows SUPER early so I don't have to fight traffic/parking, but most of all, because I usually get to meet and hang out with the bands before they start warning up.  We were the first to arrive by a long shot.

The Analog Cafe has a bar and seating area downstairs, and the stage for the shows is upstairs, cordoned off.  I can hear the band setting up upstairs, so we take a seat downstairs and just chill.  My friends took the couch, I sat in the stool by the door.

As it got closer to show time, we noticed a line growing outside the door.  I didn't really think about it at the time, but the bottom section of the venue is open to everyone all the time.  No ticket or ID required.  One of the employees of the venue noticed the line outside and opened the door and said, ""You guys can come on in.""

I'm just randomly chatting with my friends, who are still on the couch, and a guy holds his driver's license out in front of my face.  I don't know what the hell is going on, so I look closely at it to see if there's something funny or if I'm missing something, then I look up at the guy and shrug at him because I don't get it.  He walks on by.

Then the next girl in line hands me her license and looks at me for approval.  It suddenly clicks what's happening.  My friends started chuckling as they also made the realization.  Having an amused audience and without missing a beat, I held the license up in line with the girl's face, had a scrutinizing look, paused for drama, then handed it back to her with an approving nod.  The next person stepped up.

I checked IDs unnecessarily for a good half hour, making small talk, causing people to squirm with double takes, etc, much to the delight of my buddies.  Once the real employee came and removed the rope going upstairs, I handed the current ID back, abandoned my post (and the line) without a word, and we walked up the stairs to show our IDs and tickets to the real bouncer.  

One of my favorite concerts ever.

lucasmcml,2018-08-08 13:51:04+00:00,How would the literal version of each team play basketball? [OC],"August. The basketball world have to rely on sutff like TBT and BIG3 to survive the dreadful **off-season**. Or we can just wait until the NBA starts again.

So, hello! In this post, we shall analyze how the literal version of each NBA team would perform in a basketball court. The Atlanta Hawks, for example, would be represented by five hawks, and not Trae Young and John Collins.

If a team is a non-sentient thing, like the Nets, we will be assuming they developed temporarily conscience and are trying to win the game.

In this ~~waste of time~~ exercise, each team would be facing a regular basketball team... Let's say... hum... the LA Clippers from 2017-2018, who posted a [point differential of 0.1](https://www.nbastuffer.com/2017-2018-nba-team-stats/)

**Atlanta Hawks**

According to 10000birds.com, a [hawk couldn't lift even 3 pounds worth of weight](http://www.10000birds.com/can-a-hawk-carry-off-your-12-pound-pet.htm). A basketball weights only 1.3 pound, so maaaybe they could carry it. But their claws are just too small to lift the ball, so even though they can fly, they wouldn't be able to actually pick the ball up. 

FINAL GRADE: D (they could always just rip the eyes of the adversaries off)


**Boston Celtics**

Per the Cambridge Dictionary, a celtic is a person ""of an ancient European people who are related to the Irish, Scots, Welsh, and Bretons, or of their language or culture."" We're talking actual human being here, so they could play basketball just fine, but would probably lose to the 17-18 Clippers because reasons.

FINAL GRADE: C (eltics)

**Brooklyn Nets**

They could trap the entire Clippers team and make it so there's no actual game. Or one of them could just stay on top of their basket, so there's no chance the Clippers ever score. 

FINAL GRADE: D+ (not sure if a net could score a basketball)


**Charlotte Hornets**

They could sting the opposing team (is that a foul?), but unless they came in a swarm, it would be kinda hard for them to pick the ball up.

FINAL GRADE: F (you can't win if you can't score)

**Chicago Bulls**

Oh boy. Bulls are super-physical and are the first team that could actually kill the Clippers (if they were wearing red unis, that's... 5 casualities). But can a bull pick a basketball up? They could use their horns, I think, but would that work?


FINAL GRADE: B (they are intimidating)


**Cleveland Cavaliers**

A cavalier is ""a supporter of the king in the English Civil War in the 1640s"" (per Cambridge, again). The game of basketball was created by James Naismith in 1891, so the cavaliers probably wouldn't know the rules.

FINAL GRADE: D+ (they could learn on the fly)


**Dallas Mavericks**


""A person who thinks and acts in an independent way, often behaving differently from the expected or usual way"". So, Rajon Rondo was actually a pretty solid Maverick! But five persons acting independent can't work on a basketball court, so boom they would lose.

FINAL GRADE: F (team work is needed for basketball)


**Denver Nuggets**

Five small pieces of gold would do no harm for the other team.

FINAL GRADE: F (would five chicken nuggets perform any better?)


**Detroit Pistons**

Five engine parts that go up and down? Great for a car, not so great for basketball

FINAL GRADE: F (if [that guy](http://content.sportslogos.net/logos/6/223/full/qgf4hh019filgwe4k9gh0x8va.gif) could play, maybe they win the game)

**Golden Snakes Warriors**

That's not a typo, KD burner. Oh, sorry, that's not what this post is about. Anyway, a warrior is someone with experience in battles and war, and probably is in peak physical form. So that can be the first actual close game we have!

FINAL GRADE: A (even here the Warriors are great?)

**Houston Rockets**

When they turn their five engines on, they would probably melt the court floor (and the Clippers. And the fans.), so it is W.O win!

FINAL GRADE: B (there was no actual basketball)

**Indiana Pacers**
Their name comes from [running fast as hell](https://www.nba.com/pacers/history/pacers_name_history.html). In this small-ball era where everybody on the court needs to be mobile, they could out-run every team in the open court.

FINAL GRADE: B- (if they were facing Usain Bolt, that would be an A+)

**LA Clippers**

The Flying Cloud, a clipper ship, has a size of 69m x 67.4m. A basketball court has 28.7 by 15.2 m. They can just keep the human-Clippers from even entering the court.

FINAL GRADE: B+ (that's better than the human-Clippers)


**LA Lakers**

Five lakers are a shitton of water. I don't know if drowning the other team is illegal or something, but they have a lot of upside here.

FINAL GRADE: A- (it would be like watching Katara play ball)


**Memphis Grizzlies**

Five bears would be fantastic playing basketball. They are super tough.

FINAL GRADE: A (I like bears)

**Miami Heat**

As you can see by my flair, this is my team, but I'm an imparcial judge. But if [the AC going off caused cramps](http://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2014/story/_/id/11039853/2014-nba-finals-lebron-james-exits-game-1-loss-thigh-cramp-c-fails), imagine what a super heat could cause. Maybe even death by dehydration.

FINAL GRADE: B- (if it gets hot enough, maybe everybody hallucinates that ""heat"" can actually score a basketball?)


**Milwaukee Bucks**

They would be like the Bulls, but more agile (I think. I'm no animal expert). So a solid team, but I'm not sure about their scoring habilites.

FINAL GRADE: B- (B is for Bambi).


**Minnesota Timberwolves**

Ooh boy. Wolves have pack tatics, so they would be a super cohesive machine. That being said, can a wolf mouth fit a basketball? 

FINAL GRADE: B (solid team work, no hands)

**NOLA Pelicans**

Pelicans are creepy as fuck, ok? Even their mascot [is a fucking demon](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQpRkpHYIYMjVam71JEYLngGoRgB6iaKDRVo1TD4T4GUlhRaXlKTA). (Yeah I know they did a total make-over on him, but still.) But their mouths fit a lot of water, right? And they helped Nemo's father and all that, so let's say they could actually win the game because they fly, and humans don't.

FINAL GRADE: A (flying is super OP)

**New York Knicks**
A knick is ""a new yorker"", and 1 in each 4 new yorker have some [obesity](https://stateofobesity.org/states/ny). They would lose a lot for the Clippers. ~~Even the actual Knicks would~~.

FINAL GRADE: D+ (they at least know the rules)


**OKC Thunder**

Thunder is just a... really loud noise? They could make the Clippers go deaf, but would lose. A lot.

FINAL GRADE: F (y'all got PG13 to resign, so who the hell cares about this post?)


**Orlando Magic**

Magic is super powerful, but can it manifest without something controling it? If yes, boom, Orlando wins. If not, it would just be like watching the actual Orlando Magic.

FINAL GRADE: either A or F (magic is confusing)

**Philadelphia 76ers**

Is a 76er supposed to be someone from 1776? If so, same as the Cavaliers: basketball wasn't a thing back then.

FINAL GRADE: Trust the Process (if it started back in 1776, the Sixers could have like a gazillion draft picks)

**Phoenix Suns**

One Sun would, like, destroy the entire planet and probably throw the entire solar system in a chaos. Five Suns on the same spot? I not good at physics but that sound both bad and awesome to witness.

FINAL GRADE: Everybody is dead.

**Portland Trail Blazers**

For finding new places and going into the wild (great movie BTW)? Sure! For playing basketball? Not so sure.

FINAL GRADE: D (I love this name, tho)

**Sacramento Kings**

They could just use their titles to, like, arrest the other team, right? Is that how monarchies work?

FINAL GRADE: B+ (but viva la democracia)

**San Antonio Spurs**

They could probably kill the other players (a spur in the head seems like a bad thing), but wouldn't be able to actually play the game.

FINAL GRADE: F (we don't approve murder here)

**Toronto Raptors**

Can this please be in Jurassic World III: I Hope There's No Talking Dino Is This One? Like, a game where Chris Pratt, the red-hair woman and The Rock (the 2020 POTUS will be in every movie franchise ever, someday) play a 3x3 against 3 raptors?

FINAL GRADE: B- (their arms are super tiny, can they make a shot?)

**Utah Jazz**

They would be like the Thunder, but with some smooooth sax.

FINAL GRADE: F (music is great, but not as a basketball player)

**Washington Wizards**

They win. Like, by a lot. In the ""I can shape reality"" lot.

FINAL GRADE: A+ (one of them should be coaching the Magic)


**CONCLUSIONS**

* Teams with human names would have advantage, but not by much

* The Suns are really unbeatable, unless you create the Las Vegas Black Holes (actually, that's a terrible name)

* Don't take anything on this post seriously. You might regret it.

Clarimonde,2018-08-05 10:35:08+00:00,No One Ever Explained Why Twenty-Two People Died At My High School in 1996. I Want Everyone To Know The Full Story [Part Two],"[\[Part One\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/943z47/no_one_ever_explained_why_twentytwo_people_died/)

It was about a month after Casey was found when my uncle questioned Eden Colburn. There was something about the case that both fascinated and mystified him. According to Glen, my uncle was working alone at this time to find out more about what happened. I remember being in the house one night sometime after nine. We’d had a party for my sister’s seventh birthday and my uncle had arrived after the other kids had gone home. I was cutting a piece of leftover cake when he came in and sat down at the kitchen table. My father was putting out the trash while my mother was upstairs reading my sister a story. It was clear that my uncle was a few beers deep when he told me where he’d been that day.

Eden lived in a foster home and was the eldest of the three kids that lived there. This was the fourth foster home she’d lived at in seven years. He was deliberately vague about her biological parents. He said that they had lived off the grid for several years and that both were deemed mentally unfit to look after Eden. My uncle told me that he had spoken to Eden for an hour at her home. He also went to Adam Breaker’s house but was headed off at the front door by his father, who told him to come back with a warrant. He told me that a warrant was unlikely as he had no evidence that either one had been involved in Casey’s disappearance and later re-appearance. I remember him emphasizing that I should steer clear of Eden. I would have taken my uncle’s word for this. He had an uncanny ability to read people, which had been honed and perfected after years as a detective. There was something about Eden that made him uncomfortable, maybe even a little scared. “That girl” he said, “was not right” and I was not to provoke her in any way. I said I understood, although I was disappointed that my uncle thought I would do such a thing. Looking back, I suppose he just wanted to convey how dangerous she was but left out the more worrisome aspects.

Word had gotten out about what had happened to Casey and the students began to look on Eden in a new light. People now made a specific point of avoiding her rather than just ignoring her. Adam was treated differently too. The situation was not spoken about openly, but rumors circulated that Adam was in some way responsible for Casey’s ""breakdown"", and people gave him a wide berth from that point on. 

I reckon Adam Breaker had never felt like an outsider before. He was part of a local logging dynasty and his father owned a large lumber facility on the outskirts of town. He was also a member of the debate society and on the varsity wrestling team. I didn’t know him well, but he had an undeniable charm that usually won over any girls that came his way. But everyone has their secrets. A girl I knew from yearbook club, Jessica Steinman, told me that Adam came to school one day with a vicious black eye and swollen jaw. He shrugged if off, saying that he landed badly in practice after an ankle pick went wrong. But Jessica’s boyfriend, who was also on the team, told her Adam had never turned up for practice that day. It wasn’t the only occasion that Adam skipped practice or came to school with inexplicable bruises.

The altercation with Eden happened in mid-February. It was before first period and I needed to get a book before math. A large group of people had congregated by a row of lockers near mine, shoving and jostling each other to get a better look at what I was sure was a fight. As I approached, I heard a dull metallic clang as a body was shoved against a locker. I craned my head to see Adam hunched over Eden, one hand firmly grasping her wrist while the other yanked back her hair, tilting her head upward. She had no reaction when Adam shouted in her face, accusing her of defacing his car. Her eyes remained fixed on some unknown spot on the ceiling. As his anger subsided, Adam became aware of the growing number of onlookers. He slowly released his grip on Eden and threatened to “bury” her if she went near him or his property again. Eden’s listless gaze followed Adam until he rounded the corner. I never found out what had happened to his car, but I never saw him drive it again.

The news broke on February twenty-third that Adam Breaker had disappeared. He had left practice on the afternoon of the twenty-first to walk the half mile that lay between his home and school. He never made it home that day. It was now Adam’s parents that were making appeals on local media, although coverage was more widespread given the family’s influence. His parents were also more composed than Casey’s. Any interviews they gave were both eloquent and restrained. According to them, there was no obvious reason why Adam would leave home. Yes, he did experience normal teenage pressures, but he was well-liked, his grades had been pretty good, and he was planning to go to college in Portland. However, this reserve appeared to crumble at a candlelight vigil on the twenty-fourth, where several people saw Adam’s mother allegedly strike his father before bursting into convulsive sobs and subsequently collapsing under the weight of her own grief.

At about 8:30 a.m. on February twenty-seventh, Kenneth Barnes, a journey level millwright, entered the storage room in the outer west building of Breaker Lumber. The room was large and boarded on all sides by pallets that were piled high on double-row racks. Part of Kenneth’s task that morning was to get extra pallets for a shipment of machine parts due that day. He downed the last of his coffee and fumbled with the keys to the forklift. He had been called into work early after a late-night poker session and wasn’t feeling overly spry that morning. As he walked toward the machine, he heard a faint murmuring. It was a male voice repeating something again and again. Kenneth followed the voice to a nearby aisle. He was shocked to find someone stretched out on a stack of pallets. Adam Breaker had been lying in a gap no more than twenty-five inches high for several days. He had apparently never moved during that time. He had not eaten and was extremely gaunt, as if intentionally starved. Beside his head was a plastic tray filled with water. Adam lay face up, saying the same phrase over and over to no one. His started to scream when Kenneth attempted to pull him from the rack, suddenly jolting him from his waking coma.

Like Casey Schneider, Adam had no clear recollection past walking home on the twenty-first. When the police interviewed him at the hospital, Adam stated that he had heard a female voice asking, not commanding, asking him to lie down and not to move a muscle, unless he had to turn and drink. Whenever he tried to move, he felt the weight of an unseen force press down on him and could barely raise his arms. His thoughts were replaced by a thick mental fog where the only moments of lucidity were graphic and terrifying dreams. He recalled one such dream, where he was being chased through a labyrinthine tunnel by some dark and foreboding shape that he could neither see nor outrun. Unlike Casey, who bore no signs of physical injury, a series of shallow flowing lines had been carved on Adam’s forearms and upper torso, although he had no memory of experiencing pain or ever being touched. 

The police searched for signs of forced entry and found at least two points where the building could have been accessed without keys. Security footage also showed no sign of Adam or anyone else entering the premises, although the guard on duty later admitted that recording suddenly stopped at 8:32 p.m. on February twenty-first and inexplicably resumed at 9:13 p.m.

I've only learned these details from talking to Glen, as the specifics where never made public. Adam didn’t return to school and had a long way to go before making a full psychological recovery, although Glen believes that he never fully recovered, and I tend to agree. When I asked whether Adam was repeating the same phrase as Casey, Glen shook his head. According to Kenneth Barnes, Adam had been repeating the same two words over and over as he approached him that morning:

“Doesn’t hurt”

“Doesn’t hurt”.

“Doesn’t hurt”.",nosleep,2530

zxc123zxc123,2018-08-03 23:51:26+00:00,FACT: Steve Kerr has won more championships than all the NBA franchises except the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics. That's over 10% of all NBA rings.,"I hear the talk in the media, NBA players, and even some on /r/nba complaining that the warriors are too dominant and destroying NBA parity when they've only won 3 titles in 4 years. The truth is that parity in the NBA has always been an illusion. Lakers and Celtics together have over 43% of the rings. The top 5 teams have 70% of the rings. But the real 

* Steve Kerr himself has 8 NBA championship rings. 

* That's more than all teams but LAL and BOS. ([3 with Bulls, 2 with Spurs,](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-8CM8tEIVu-Q/U3U3pm6YNhI/AAAAAAAAv8U/Yk1Wn4WsMCo/w800-h800/Steve+Kerr+Rings+Shot+Science.gif) and 3 with Warriors)

* Kerr's Championship Rate (aka CHAMPR) is 8 rings / (17 player season + 4 coaching seasons) = **38.09%**

* The next best CHAMPRs are BOS 23.61%, LAL 22.86%, CHI 11.54%, SAS 9.80%, and finally the ""sp00ky"" GSW with a whopping 8.33%. (I did the math on them all so if you want your team's % just ask and I'll reply, but it's not pretty.)

* Even the mythical Michael ""perfect ""NBA ""Skip's ""G.O.A.T."" pornhub"" Jesus"" 6of6"" Jordan was 6 titles in 15 seasons for a **40%** CHAMPR. But if you count his years as owner? Then it's 6 of 24 for **25%** It's looking like Kerr is the one winning those 2nd run chips for MJ and not the other way around. MJ thanked him with a punch to the face too *SMH*.

* Reminder that GSW had Jerry West, Stephen, Klay, and Draymond for years and hadn't won the chip with those guys until Steve came along. The secret sauce ain't Curry, it's Kerr.

* How many Jordan win without Kerr? 3. Kerr won 5 without Mike.

* How many Duncan win without Kerr? 3. Kerr won 6 without Duncan.

* How many rings Curry win without Kerr? 0. Kerr won 5 without Stephen.

**TL;DR Warriors aren't destroying NBA parity. Steve Kerr is destroying NBA parity. The sexy little slut keeps winning titles and secretly ruining the NBA for those of you guys who love parity (Personally, I rather like [Kerr](https://www.popovichkerr2020.com/)). But for imaginary parity's sake the NBA needs to stop him. I personally suggest Adam Silver secretly funding a cloning program splicing the DNA of Bill Russell, Flyod Mayweather, Father Time, and Dwayne Douglas Johnson together.**

cariboustewwwwwwwww,2018-07-31 21:57:54+00:00,[OC] What if the NBA had 100 teams?,"Talk about expansion is all over American professional sports, and basketball  is no exception. The NBA’s a bit different from most leagues, though, in that (besides Seattle) it’s not entirely sure *where* it wants to expand to. The other leagues are more certain -- hockey has Quebec City and Hamilton, soccer has at least 6 cities on standby, the NFL’s got at least a couple more teams to fit in the LA metro area, and Baltimore could really use a professional baseball team. The NBA, though? There's no consensus. Maybe Kansas City, maybe Louisville, maybe Omaha, that dude who was talking about Little Rock a while ago, Mexico City, Hampton Roads, Montreal, Vegas, St. Louis, Vancouver, who knows how many others. 

So why limit it to only adding one or two? If we’re gonna be expanding the league, I feel like we should be really, truly expanding the league. Maybe balloon is the better word, actually. Or detonate. I don’t know. Regardless, your initial reaction might be, “aren’t there innumerable downsides to suddenly rivalling D-1 college football in size?” And yes, but I believe there are also upsides:

1. There are dozens of cities that want an NBA team, and it’d be rude to turn them down. Would you go up to some little kid playing basketball in Edmonton and tell him he doesn’t deserve a pro team? I wouldn’t, mostly because they could probably beat me up, but that’s besides the point

2. The NBA is, like every other business in this hellworld, built on the back of the eldritch horror that is capitalism, a beast whose thirst for profit is unquenchable. Seventy more teams means 3.3 times the profit for its gaping maw

3. I’m from San Diego and this is the only realistic way I could get a local team

4. With this level of team saturation, team moves wouldn’t really happen anymore, mostly because there would be no open cities for the teams to move to. As a Kings fan, this would really take a load off my mind

5. Basketball and hockey both have a blessing football and baseball sadly don’t: their stadiums don’t take many people to fill up. The biggest NBA stadium doesn’t break 21,000 people, and the biggest basketball stadium *in the world* barely meets the *minimum* requirement for an NFL stadium, and it’s in the Philippines anyway. This means the NBA can expand to cities the NFL and MLB never could.

6. If this doesn’t happen, and expansion continues at the incredibly slow pace it’s going right now, we’ll still get to a number of teams that seems ungodly today at some point. The UN’s more moderate projections predict a US population of 450 million by 2100, and a North American population of 650 million, so it’s not like there won’t be enough fans in the future. Why not make the teams now, so not only will everyone get the teams they’d eventually get anyway, but also so those 2100 fans will have successful histories to look back on longingly when their team finishes 78th overall?

I believe these benefits outweigh the myriad problems the NBA would face with 100 teams. 

#The teams

So we’ve decided that there should be enough NBA teams to match the entire minor league baseball pyramid in a single league. Sweet! But where should we put all the new teams?

1. Firstly, we should put teams back in the cities who lost theirs to a move. That means, yes, bringing back the Sonics, but also adding teams in 11 other cities, not including the [Quad Cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quad_cities) and Fort Wayne because I’m trying to maintain at least a facsimile of realism. So there’s 41 teams.

2. Secondly, we wanna add teams to metro areas that can support them, which given point 5 shouldn’t be too hard. However, we’re gonna want to start with the non-American markets, since we don’t want America hogging all the teams. Since it’s the least complicated one, let’s do Canada first: every metro area with a population over 800,000 people -- half of that of the smallest NBA metro area, Salt Lake City -- gets a team (plus Winnipeg, since it barely misses the mark). There’s 47. 

3. Next we’ll add Mexican teams, which is more complex, since Mexico’s already got a pro basketball league, the LNBP. Should we even try to break through it? Not in *all* of Mexico, but in the north, yes; the cities (and the 4 existing northern LNBP teams) are pretty far from the south, and culturally pretty distinct as well. Besides those 4, we’ll also add another 5 metro areas without preexisting teams, since they’re big enough to support teams as well. There’s 56.

4. Why not add some Caribbean teams? Oh, what’s that you’re bemusedly listing? Reasons to not add Caribbean teams? That'd be great if I cared. Now there are really only 6 metro areas with enough people in the Caribbean for a team, but we’ll leave one of them, Port-au-Prince, out -- Haiti’s still reeling from the 2010 earthquake. There’s 62.

5. Also, just since they’ve got the people to support it and I like intercity rivalries, let’s add one team to metro areas that can handle more than one team, like Chicago and Dallas. That brings us up to 69. As a mature and respectable adult, I had an entirely mature and respectable response to that number when it came up. 

6. So now we’re finally able to add teams to new cities in the U.S. itself. We’ve got 31 left to work with, which is more than enough to sprinkle across the the country. I tried to spread them out evenly, which is why there’s a Boise team but not a Richmond team, and also wasn’t incredibly strenuous in my city choices, by which I mean I avoided cities I don’t like. In other words, if you’re annoyed your city didn’t get a team, you’re taking this more seriously than I am.

Also, I decided to stick with the 5-team division model in the current NBA, but put 5 in each conference, and bump the number of conferences up to 4, named after cardinal directions because I’m creative but not quite creative enough. Here they are:

As you can tell, the team names are the only (mostly) serious thing in this post. I tried to make up for it with the division names

#The Expansion Draft

So we’ve got 100 teams now, but we don’t have players for them. The CBA guarantees a league average of 14 players per team, which would mean we’ll need 1400 players for the league. That’s, uh. That’s a lot. How are we gonna get such a ridiculous number of players?

One word: G League. Two words. One and a half words. Who cares. See, there were 491 players at the beginning of the 2017-18 season, which, combined with the rosters of the teams we stole from Mexico, could probably be raised to about 550. The G League, though, has at least a thousand players -- I didn’t bother figuring the exact number, suffice to say there’s a lot -- more than making up for the deficit. 

So here’s what I’m proposing as an expansion draft: each already-existing team from the NBA or LNBP can keep 2 of their players, and the rest are thrown into a lottery consisting of them and every 2017-18 G League player. The players are then chosen at random and assigned to each team in a ridiculously long ceremony probably spread out over the space of 2 or 3 weeks. Truly a waste of time for everyone involved, just like this post was a waste of my time, but a necessary waste of time to ensure there’s basketball for the fans to watch. Maybe not good basketball, but basketball.

#The Season 

Instead of an 82-game season, I’m thinking we expand it to 110: 15 4-game series with 15 in-conference teams, then 25 2-game series with 25 out-of-conference teams. 
 
So after this season of only interacting with less than half the league, we come to the playoffs. What we should do here is obvious: the same thing the NBA does, but instead of 16 teams we go up to 64, 16 from each conference. Teams are reseeded once we get down to 16, then 4. This might be kind of an unnecessarily long playoff season, reminiscent of early MLS when 8 of 10 teams went to the playoffs, and I’m sure there’s more scientific ways to do it with fewer than 50 teams, but I’m not a science man, so whatever. 

Who wins? Who knows. Probably Golden State, since they’d keep KD and Steph and also because God is real and he hates us. Maybe we’d get an upset from Hawai’i or Albuquerque or something. Whatever, it’s 2:00 AM and I have to wake up at 7:00, I barely care anymore. Thanks for coming to my TED talk",nba,9568

Y'all talk big game about Kevin Love's mental health awareness then turn right around and pile onto IT for being a midget or not being the same player he was.

Now, dumplings are one of those things that’re really more of a *category* than a dish itself: walk into a dumpling shop in China, and there’ll be an absolute myriad of fillings that you could choose from. And at many restaurants, you can opt for any of those dumplings to be boiled, steamed, or pan-fried. 

So this post is a touch on the ambitious side. What I’d like to do is generalize the idea of how to go about making dumplings so that you have a framework to play around with it. Of course, the question of ‘how to make dumplings’ is kind of akin to ‘how to make sandwiches’… where do you even begin? Something all-encompassing would be better suited in a textbook than a reddit post. But against my better judgement, I’ll charge forward here, undoubtedly overgeneralizing along the way. So apologies in advance. 

[Video is here if you’d like a visual to follow along](). In the video, we go over how to make the wrappers, three fillings (Pork with Leek, Beef with Common Fennel, and Egg with Jiucai), and how to wrap and boil those. We’ll cover all that here too, but with a bit more background on some of the underlying techniques. 

######How to Make Dumpling Wrappers

So if you got access to a Chinese supermarket, you can usually swoop in and buy a big ‘ol pack of dumpling wrappers. If they’re so easy to buy, why the hell would you make them yourself?

The thing is that dumpling wrappers aren’t, say, like puff pastry where the store bought stuff works just as well. Think of it more like, I don’t know, pre-minced garlic? They work in the sense that everything *works*, but there’s an obvious and marked quality difference between store bought and homemade.

First problem with store bought is that they’re usually rather dry. In an ideal world, there shouldn’t be munch of a lag between the time you roll out the skins and when you wrap the dumpling.  Second problem is that the store bought ones are usually machine rolled – not too much of an issue for something like wontons, but for dumplings it’s quite important for the inner portion of the dumpling wrapper to be a bit thicker than the outside. This not only makes the dumpling easier to wrap, but also allows you to hold a greater quantity of filling without the dumpling potentially breaking on you.

I get that they’re helpful if you’re feeling lazy, no judgement there.  But try to make the wrappers if you can.

**Ingredients, Dumpling Wrappers:**

1.	*Dumpling-flour -or- a lower protein bread flour -or- a mix of all purpose flour and higher protein bread flour, 500g.* So if you’ve got access to dumpling flour, great, use that. If not, take a look at your flour’s protein content. Our dumpling flour clocks in at 12.8%. If you use the King Arthur brand, their bread flour is 12.7%, so that’d work just as well.  Some bread flours can get up to 14% protein, so if you’re working with something heftier like that it’d probably be best to mix in a bit of AP. E.g. if you have 14% bread flour and 10% all purpose flour, mix 70% bread flour with 30% AP to arrive at something like dumpling flour.

2.	*Salt, ½ tsp.* Helps develop the gluten in the dough.

3.	*Egg, 1 medium.* Helps make the dough a bit softer and easier to roll.

4.	*Hot, Boiled Water, 200g.* Right, so dumpling wrappers are a hot water dough. The hot water slightly cooks the gluten in the dough, making the whole thing stretchier for when you’re filling the dumplings.

**Process, Dumpling Wrappers:**

1.	*Mix together the flour, the salt, and the egg.* I used a stand mixer in the video, but you can absolutely do all this by hand.

2.	*Slowly drizzle in the hot water, making sure that all the flour gets some.* If you’re using a stand mixer like me, this step’s dirt easy. Speed one with the hook attachment, drizzle in the water bit by bit, making sure you get all the sides. If you’re kneading by hand, drizzle in the hot water and mix it in with some chopsticks (there’s a good visual for that at [0:46 in our scallion video](https://youtu.be/Iblk2-1QNGM?t=46s if you’re going that route).

3.	*Knead -or- use a stand mixer on speed one for ~8 minutes until a smooth dough forms.* It’ll be smooth when it’s no longer sticking to the sides of the mixing bowl.

4.	*Place in a plastic bag and let rest for at least a half hour, and up to overnight.* To relax the gluten in the dough. We’ve found that a plastic bag keeps the dough much moister than the cover-with-a-wet-towel method.

5.	*Punch a hole in the dough, and get it into a sort of ‘monster-sized Montreal bagel’ shape. Then tear, and roll it a touch thinner.* So the whole idea of getting the dough into a big ring is to basically just get it into a really even round log. If you’re weighing each dumpling skin it’s less imperative, but it still gets you a good starting point for the dumpling skin.

6.	*Cut the dough into 20g pieces, twisting the dough 90 degrees after each cut to help maintain a circular shape.* If you don’t twist, by the end your pieces will be more ‘ovular’ than circular due to the force of the knife. Also, **please note that 20g makes for a rather large dumpling**. We were aiming for the style you can get in Beijing where the dumplings are like these massive ping-pong balls. Most dumpling shops I’ve eaten at are about 10-15g per skin. If you’d like a smaller dumpling, please feel free  to go that route. The advantage of the bigger dumplings is a larger ratio of filling to skin, the disadvantage is that they’re only ‘bite-sized’ for the determined (though if you’re American, you probably got enough practice with large burgers/sandwiches to do the job).

7.	*Press down on the pieces with your palm to slightly flatten them.* Gives you a starting place to roll them into a round shape. If you’re having trouble getting the skins round, you can also slightly roll them from the center out once in each direction.

8.	*Starting with the rolling pin on the board, roll inward, then add a little force for when you’re rolling things back out. Twist around the dumpling skin.* Rolling stuff’s always a bit difficult to describe in writing, so take a look at [3:45 in the video for a visual](https://youtu.be/JBfKsS0ASMo?t=3m45s) of this whole process. The whole idea here is that we’ll want the center of the dumpling skin to be slightly thicker than the outside – the filling will rest on the center (so it’ll need to be a bit sturdier), and you’ll want a thinner edge in order to pleat/seal everything up.

From here, it’s best if you *immediately* wrap up your dumplings. If you’re not interested in learning the fillings, jump down to ‘how to wrap dumplings’.

#######How to Make Meat Fillings

So what I hope you can take away from this post is a basic formula for how to approach your fillings. We’ll toss out two tested recipes, both of which are pretty classic at dumpling joints – pork with leek, and beef with common fennel.

But don’t let that dissuade you from trying different things out. There’s a ton of different combinations that’re popular – [take a look at this menu from a dumpling joint in Beijing](http://qcloud.dpfile.com/pc/ryc1rVgel6ZYJDOUET-Ratniysu14Fie9VLgPyZFNtlCuOLBp4VcPfUu7tXbiRZdTYGVDmosZWTLal1WbWRW3A.jpg). There’s everything from lamb with leek to pork with pickled cabbage. Wanna see if beef with tarragon works? Why not! One you have the basic approach down, there’s a million different directions you can go with this.
As always, quick reminder that there’s more than one way to skin this cat. If you already know how to make dumplings and this contradicts a tried-and-true approach you already know, stick with what you know. For something as widespread as dumplings, there can be a bunch of variation from region to region, household to household, and dish to dish. This is simple our best shot at a generalization based off what we know: 

**Basic Ratios:**

1.	By weight, 9/10 of your filling will be meat and fats, and 1/10 of the filling with be whatever accoutrement you’re added in. This ratio is extremely flexible, I often add more stuff in.

2.	By weight, 2/3 of the meat will be lean and 1/3 will be the ‘fats’.

3.	By weight, 2/3 of the ‘fats’ will be animal fat and 1/3 will be a seasoned oil mixture.

4.	The seasoned oil mixture can contain pretty much whatever you like. We fried leek, star anise, and fennel in peanut oil. The animal fat will be finely diced and added in later.

5.	The lean will be chopped by hand into a paste-like consistency. Pre-minced meat can work but it can be a bit more finicky.

6.	You’ll season the lean and stir it. Seasoning is really up to you – the only mandatory bit is salt. We used salt, sugar, chicken boullion, white pepper, liaojiu (i.e. Shaoxing wine), and soy sauce. Note in place of that seasoned oil, many people opt to simply add spices straight to the meat (usually five spice powder, thirteen spice powder, or specially-sold dumpling seasoning mixes) – you can go that route too, but we feel the spices are a bit more mellow and less in-your-face with the seasoned oil.  

7.	Stir it in one direction only to develop the myocin in the meat, making it a more uniform whole. A big issue in some homemade dumplings from inexperienced cooks is that the meat is far too loose – the goal is something cohesive, not ‘hamburger helper in a dumpling’.

8.	Add in a seasoned water mixture while stirring, a tablespoon at a time. The seasoned water will be roughly the same quantity as your seasoned oil.  For the seasoned water, we opted for some pounded ginger and a touch of Sichuan peppercorn mixed with hot, boiled water.  Some restaurants use stock in place of water. Some households use plain ‘ol water, and just add minced ginger to the filling.

9.	Once the filling is sticky enough where you can see streaks on the side of the bowl, fold in the accoutrement, the diced fat, and the seasoned oil.

So that’s the general idea.  From that framework you can start to play around and experiment with whatever you want to cook. We’ll start off with the pork and leek filling here, apologies in advance when I inevitably repeat myself a bit. The way I’ll organize this is go over the ingredients for the pork first, then the beef, and finally the process (which’s basically the same for both).

**Ingredients, Pork with Leek:**

1.	*Pork ham (后腿肉) -or- belly (五花肉), 315g lean; 135g fat.* So we use the cut of pork called the ‘ham’, which’s from the butt of the pig. It’s a nice cut to use for this because it’s really easy to separate the lean from the fat. Pork belly works great too, it’s just a bit more of a pain to cut.

2.	*Leek (大葱), 1.* A few slices saved for the seasoned oil, the remainder minced.

3.	*Seasoned oil: Peanut oil (花生油), 6 tbsp; Leek (大葱), ~6 slices or so from before; Star Anise (八角), 4; fennel seed (茴香籽), 1 tbsp.* These’ll be fried in the peanut oil and then strained.

4.	*Seasoned water: Hot, Boiled Water, 6 tbsp; Ginger (姜), ~1.5 inches; Sichuan peppercorn (花椒), ~1/2 tsp.* So the burning question – why put the ginger and Sichuan peppercorn in the water instead of the oil? While Sichuan peppercorn’s famous for its numbing quality, it’s also got a nice floral taste to it too. The flavonoids that cause the numbing sensation aren’t water soluble, so if you want the flavor of the peppercorns instead of the numbingness, using this sort of Sichuan peppercorn water’s the way to go. For the ginger, we’re using ginger-water primarily as a replacement for adding minced ginger into the mix – ginger-water has that same sort of raw ginger ‘spiciness’ but with the benefit of not having chunks of ginger in your filling.

5.	*Seasoning: salt, 1 tsp; sugar, 1 tsp; chicken boullion powder (鸡粉), ½ tsp; white pepper powder (白胡椒粉), ¼ tsp; liaojiu a.k.a. Shaoxing wine (料酒), ½ tbsp; light soy sauce (生抽), 1 tbsp.* If you don’t want to use chicken boullion powder, you could swap it for a sprinkle of MSG or skip it.

**Ingredients, Beef with Common Fennel:**

Ok, now with beef we’re breaking some of the rules we set out earlier regarding hand mincing and separating out the lean from the fat. Why? The fat’s much too interspersed within the meat, and beef’s a good bit tougher than pork is. 

So after a few tries, I broke down and had my butcher grind it up for me. I suppose that’s alright in the end though, because now I get to talk about how you’d go about working with pre-ground meat.

For your ground meat… with the approach that we’re going with here (separating out the lean and fat), the leaner the better. As anyone that’s ever cooked a burger over charcoal knows, the fat in ground beef melts really easily – the fattier your ground beef, the greasier the dumpling’ll feel in the end. For us, we were using some ground beef that was around ~20 percent fat in the video. That made a final product that was tasty but a little oily in my personal opinion. So opt for something leaner if it’s an option. Hell, I’d even recommend those 96/4 blends you guys got abroad if I wasn’t so skeptical of the how they processed them.

So your ground meat to diced fat ratio will change depending on how fatty your beef is:

* 90/10: 350g ground beef, 100g beef fat
* 85/15: 370g ground beef, 80g beef fat
* 80/20: 400g ground beef, 50g beef fat
  
1.	*Ground beef brisket (胸口肉) -or- top sirloin (肥牛) -or- chuck (上脑), quantities as above.* So the two cuts that are used most often for dumpling fillings are called ‘xiongkourou’ and ‘feiniu’ –I’ll be totally straight with you, Chinese cuts are a bit different and I’ve had a devil of a time translating those two. In the video we used ‘xiongkourou’, which I erroneously translated as ‘chuck’ in my narration. Whoops. From what I can tell, ‘feiniu’ can refer to a few cuts… but is generally a fatty cut that’s from right below the tenderloin, so I’m 90% sure that’s top sirloin. Regardless, you could use almost any cut you’d like – a buddy of mine even uses shank.  

2.	*Beef fat (牛油) -or- pork fat (猪板油), quantities as above.* So outside of Muslim areas of China, they’ll often use pork fat in these sorts of dumplings. Either works great, we used beef fat to keep everything kosher.

3.	*Common fennel (茴香) -or- dill, ~50g.* So the fennel that’s used is these is ‘common fennel’, not the bulb fennel that’s often used in the West. Not sure how easy it is to source this. Dill’s a touch stronger of a taste but hits many of the same notes – if you were interested in replicating this but didn’t have a way to source common fennel (ironic name, no?), I’d personally try dill. Quick note that that 50g is the amount *after* picking the fennel – a huge chunk of the weight comes from the stems, so you’d likely need to buy ~150g to get to that amount.

4.	*Seasoned oil: Peanut oil (花生油), 6 tbsp; Leek (大葱), ~6 slices or so from before; Star Anise (八角), 4; fennel seed (茴香籽), 1 tbsp.* Same as above.

5.	*Seasoned water: Hot, Boiled Water, 6 tbsp; Ginger (姜), ~1.5 inches; Sichuan peppercorn (花椒), ~1/2 tsp.* Same as above.

6.	*Seasoning: salt, 1 tsp; sugar, 1 tsp; chicken boullion powder (鸡粉), ½ tsp; white pepper powder (白胡椒粉), ¼ tsp; liaojiu a.k.a. Shaoxing wine (料酒), ½ tbsp; light soy sauce (生抽), 1 tbsp.* Same as above.

**Process, Either meat filling:**

1.	*Make the seasoned oil.* Over medium low heat, fry the leek and the star anise for about two minutes. Then add in the fennel seed, and fry for another two minutes – I toss in the fennel later mostly because I’m paranoid that it’ll burn. Strain out the spices, and set it aside to cool completely.

2.	*Make the seasoned water.* Smash your ginger in a mortar or a bowl (or, alternatively, you could mince it), then add in the Sichuan peppercorn. Add in the six tablespoons of hot water, then let it infuse for at least 10 minutes. Strain, and set aside to cool completely.

3.	*Prep the accountrement.* For the pork dumpling, finely mince the leek. For the beef dumpling, pick the leaves off the fennel.

4.	*Dice the animal fat.* Get the pork or beef fat into a fine dice, and set it aside.

5.	*If using meat (i.e. NOT ground meat), get it into chunks and continuously chop it… periodically folding the meat over itself.* Be patient with this step. We’re looking for the meat to become a sort of ‘pasty’ whole. Going at this with two cleavers can make quick work of this. If you’re new to mincing by hand, take a look [at 2:33 in the video](https://youtu.be/JBfKsS0ASMo?t=2m33s) for a visual.

6.	*If using ground meat, use the back of a heavy knife to pound it until pasty.* This is a primary reason why we usually don’t use ground meat for fillings – it generally doesn’t actually save any time. You’ll still need to pound and fold it, just using the back of the knife in place of the front as it’s already choppped. 

7.	*Season the meat, and begin to stir.* I.e. add in the salt, sugar, chicken bouillon powder, white pepper powder, liaojiu wine, and light soy sauce. Stir in one direction only – you can use your hands, but using chopsticks to stir makes things a bit more obvious to see what’s going on.

8.	*Add in the seasoned water one tablespoon at a time, stirring until the meat until it leaves streaks on the side of the bowl.* Another thing that you just gotta take your time with. For the pork, this’ll take about five minutes to get where you wanna be.  For the beef, because we have some fat already mixed in, it’ll take a bit longer – oil gets in the way of your myocin developing, which’s a big reason why we separated out the fat. Ten minutes of stirring should get you there.

9.	*Fold in the accoutrement (i.e. the leek or fennel), the fat dice, and the oil.* Then those are ready to wrap.

#######How to Make Not-meat fillings

So there’s this whole category of dumpling fillings called ‘Su fillings’ (i.e. ‘素饺子馅’) which I haven’t really found a nice translation for yet. While ‘Su’ can often refer to ‘vegetarian’ in Chinese, it can also refer to something that’s ‘light’ or ‘not a meat dish’. And the latter’s what this kind of filling’s referring to.

While a solid chunk of these sorts of dumpling fillings are vegetarian, many of them use stuff like dried shellfish or oyster sauce.  Almost universally in play for the pescatarian crowd out there, however.

Here’s the thing though, they’re bloody difficult to generalize. They can include a combination of anything from smoked bean curd, to fresh shrimp, to mushrooms, to vermicelli rice noodles. And, of course, each of those ingredients has its own variables to consider when prepping.  The best I can give is that (1) the ingredients are usually used reconstituted (if a dried ingredient) or fresh, i.e. not pre-fried (though egg’s an outlier there) (2) there’s *roughly* an equal quantity of each main ingredient in the filling (though I’m using extremely liberal definitions of ‘roughly’ and ‘main ingredient’) and (3) the fresh ingredients are coated with oil, then mixed and seasoned at the last possible second.

So apologies there. The best I can do is give a recipe for one classic kind – Egg with Jiucai (Chinese Chives) – and hope that that gives enough perspective.  For some more options, [check out this translated link of 20 Not-Meat Dumpling recipes](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=destination_language&amp;u=https://www.haocai777.com/Article/ruchu/12698.html) or [here for the original link if you can read Chinese or would rather translate directly within Chrome](https://www.haocai777.com/Article/ruchu/12698.html).

**Ingredients, Egg with Jiucai Filling**

1.	*Jiucai a.k.a. Chinese Chives (韭菜), 250g.* So Jiucai – a.k.a. Chinese Chives (apologies, I irrationally dislike that translation) are a pungent green that’re probably about halfway between a vegetable and an herb. They go great with egg. We’ll need 250g minced, but when prepping you’ll need to chop off the hard ends… so buy 350g just to be safe.

2.	*4 medium eggs.* We’ll be scrambling these.

3.	*Optional: 1 tsp liaojiu wine (料酒).* To mix in with the eggs and season it before scrambling. I always add a bit in, you don’t have to.

4.	*Oil to Coat: 1 tbsp peanut oil (花生油), 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil (麻油).* We’ll be using half sesame oil to add a bit more flavor in here.

5.	*Optional: ½ tsp baking soda (苏打粉).* To mix in with the Jiucai. Helps keep it a nice vibrant green color through cooking.

6.	*Seasoning: 1 tsp salt, ½ tsp chicken bouillon powder (鸡粉).* We’ll be adding these in at the last possible second.

**Process, Eggs with Jiucai:**

1.	*Chop the hard end off the Jiucai, as well as the brown bits on the other side. Wash, then sit out to dry completely.* Jiucai’s often quite dirty/sandy as sold. To wash, soak in water for about 10 minutes, drain the dirty water, then continuously slam the jiucai into a big bowl of water to get any dirt off. Rinse until the water runs clear. Set it aside to dry completely – it’ll take a bit of time (like, hours), so if you’re in a rush opt for a salad spinner.

2.	*Crack the eggs, mix in the optional liaojiu wine, then beat.* Really beat the snot out of those guys until there’s no strands of egg white remaining.

3.	*Scramble the eggs.* You can scramble the eggs using any method you want, just add a bit more oil than you usually would. If using a wok, first *longyau*: i.e. get that wok piping hot, shut off the heat, add in the oil (we used about four tablespoons) and give it a swirl to get a nice non-stick surface. Flame on medium, get the oil up until bubbles begin to form around a pair of chopsticks (about 160C), then pour in your egg. It’ll puff and set, so stir and flip it around… let it set again… stir and flip it around again… continuing the motion until the egg’s ~90% done. Then shut off the heat, give it a good scrambled, and take it out.

4.	*Thinly slice the Jiucai, then coat with the oil and baking soda.* Slice the Jiucai as thin as you can feasibly get it, then mix with the oil and the baking soda. The reason we’re mixing these in with the veg at first is to form a bit of a ‘protective barrier’ so that the Jiucai won’t release moisture as easily while we’re wrapping them.

5.	*As the last possible second before wrapping, mix in the egg, salt, and bouillon powder in with the Jiucai.* Salt makes Jiucai weep like crazy, so as soon as you mix that in, the shot clock’s running.  Do this after you’ve finished rolling some skins and are about ready to wrap.

######How to Wrap Dumplings

Ok, so there’s a bunch of different ways to wrap dumplings. We only did one sort of wrapping in the video – the original, basic sort. It’s the wrapping style that’s usually used at dumpling joints… and to be honest, if you’re boiling dumplings (like we did in the video), it’s probably the best method. It makes for the sturdiest dumpling that’s least likely to break apart when boiling.

If you’d like to fry or (especially) steam your dumplings, the alternative styles give the dumplings much better visual flair. We didn’t include this in our video, so I’ve got two clips for you – first one’s [here](https://youtu.be/W2cAkkrRDT4?t=5m16s), which’s in Chinese but has some old Northeastern women showing how it’s done; second one’s [here](https://youtu.be/84-QPpmIleA), which’s a Portland restaurant owner from Taiwan explaining them in English.  

Also, note that even for this basic style, there’s a few slight variations to the theme. We learned this exact method from a dumpling shop owner downstairs from our apartment, which is a touch different than those Northeastern women in the video, which’s a touch different from the Portland restaurant owner.

1.	*Add 1-1.5 tbsp of filling in the center of the dumpling.* Again, our dumplings were the really big sort, so we used about 1.5 tbsp of filling. If you’re doing the 10-15 gram dumpling skins, then you’re probably aim for about 1 tbsp or a touch less. The goal is to get as much filling as possible in the dumpling without it bursting out, and not a touch more.

2.	*Pull two of the side up to get a sort of ‘taco’ shape, pressing and sealing at the top.* Again, always difficult to describe this sort of process, so check out [4:24 in the video](https://youtu.be/JBfKsS0ASMo?t=4m24s) if you’d prefer a visual.

3.	*Fold one end of the dumpling inward, then seal up the top. Do the same on the other side.* You might need to press a bit of the filling in, that’s normal.

4.	*Optionally add two pleats to the top of the dumpling.* This helps everything seal and makes things ever so slightly good looking.

5.	*Hold the dumpling in between your two thumbs. Press down and slightly inward.* This accomplishes two things: first, it’ll seal the sucker up; second, it’ll add a slight crease in the middle of the dumpling.

Best way to go about this is to roll the skins and wrap the dumplings basically concurrently so that things don’t dry out. So get your friends or family to join in and make a little assembly line.

######How to Cook Dumplings

Four ways to cook dumplings: pan-fry and steam (i.e. ‘pot stickers’), boil then pan-fry (i.e. ‘fried dumplings’), steam, or boil. It seems like I might’ve just listed those in descending order of popularity for Americans, which’s really a shame because I quite like my dumplings boiled.

But they’re all good really. Boiled dumplings have a bit smoother of a texture as compared to steamed dumplings, which have more of a bite to them (though again steamed dumplings are great for the more intense wrapping techniques). Fried dumplings are a bit ‘crispier’ than potstickers, which have that one really crunchy side.

**How to Boil Dumplings:**

1.	*Get a pot of water to a boil, and add in ~1/2 tsp salt.* In an ideal world, the pot wouldn’t be stainless steel – stick pots can easily risk the dumplings, well, sticking to them. If you’re using a stainless steel pot, just periodically make sure that the dumplings aren’t sticking to the bottom.

2.	*Carefully add in the dumplings, then bring the water back to a boil.* Make sure the dumplings aren’t sticking to the bottom when you’re adding them in. Tossing them in one or two at a time is a good idea.

3.	*Add a bit of cool water to get the water back down to a really light simmer, then cover.* I’ve heard different things as to why you should add water – maybe it’s because a heavy boil can potentially break apart the dumplings, maybe it’s because it’ll cook the filling a bit more evenly. Either way, add enough water so it’s no longer boiling, then cover.

4.	*Once it’s boiling again… open the lid, add some water again, then cover.* Continue doing this at least three times in total.  

5.	*Once the dumplings are floating, give them ~30 seconds in the hot water, then take them out.*

**How to Steam Dumplings:**

1.	*Place the dumplings on a lightly oiled plate, then place in a steamer.* The dumplings will not be steamed on a bamboo steamer directly in order to prevent sticking.

2.	*Sprinkle a touch of water over the dumplings.* Not too much, this’s just to help keep the skins from drying out.

3.	*Steam for 15 minutes.* If opting for smaller dumplings, check on them earlier, at ~12 minutes. The dumplings will be done once slightly translucent.

**How to Make Fried Dumplings:**

1.	*Boil the dumplings.* As above. Note that this’s great for leftovers.

2.	*Add about 1cm of oil to a pan and put the flame to medium. Fry the dumpings for ~2min on each of the three sides.* Basically, you’re just looking for the side of the dumpling to get golden brown, then you’ll flip to another side.

IIRC there’s also a way to pan-fry fresh ones, but unfortunately that’s a bit of a blind spot for us.

**How to make pot stickers:**

1.	*Add a thin layer of oil to a pot and put the flame to medium-low. Add in the dumplings.* The side facing down is going to be the crispy side.

2.	*After about two minutes, add enough water to get ~1/3 of the way up the dumpling. Cover.* Water and oil obviously have the potential to sizzle like crazy, which’s why (1) your oil quantity shouldn’t be very high (2) the heat should be rather low and (3) you should be ready with the lid in your hand.

3.	*Cook for ~6 minutes.* If you touch the top of the dumpling, and it’s soft, it should be done.

######Dumpling Dipping Sauce(s)

So in China, the question of what you dip your dumplings in is sort of the cultural equivalent of what you put on a hotdog. There’s two camps: dark vinegar and soy sauce.

In my personal view… the soy sauce camp, like those that put ketchup on hotdogs, are misguided heathens and dark vinegar is ultimately the only correct choice ;) But it’s all personal preference. Steph likes soy sauce.

There’s some really complex dumpling dipping sauces out there, so let’s just zero in on what would be at the table at a standard little dumpling shop:

1.	*Dark Chinese Vinegar (陈醋).* So this’s as good a time as any to make a note that there’s two sorts of dark Chinese vinegar – ‘mature vinegar’ and ‘Chinkiang vinegar’. They’re both aged, and in most recipes we post here they can be used interchangeably. I prefer the ‘mature vinegar’ as a dumpling dipping sauce.

2.	*Youlazi Chili Oil (油辣子).* This’s the Chinese chili oil that’s most commonly found in English language sources. [Mike Chen’s recipe](https://youtu.be/ZlIiADdh-QY) is super popular on YT, and you can also find one within our [Sichuan Liangmian video at 2:26](https://youtu.be/95ENQDE7nvg?t=2m26s).

3.	*Light soy sauce (生抽).* Ideally a nicer one if possible. 

4.	*Garlic.* Either minced or pounded, and mixed with water. ",Cooking,1147

But rather than dwell on the obvious names, this series intends to do the opposite: focus on the lower-profile free agents who may have some value to teams.

After looking at [point guards](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8tj9in/99_cent_store_free_agents_point_guards/?st=jivw48l1&amp;sh=9d788e63), [shooting guards](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8trmra/99_cent_store_free_agents_shooting_guards/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage), [small forwards](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8u0qgk/99_cent_store_free_agents_small_forwards/?st=jivw3oye&amp;sh=cab0e753), and [power forwards](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8ubn1g/99_cent_store_free_agents_power_forwards/?st=jiyq6lq0&amp;sh=e0201673) already, we're turning our attention to CENTERS.

######**featured item**

**Nerlens Noel, Dallas Mavericks, UFA, 24 years old**

Sometimes, I get stubborn about my predictions. I'm sticking with Josh Jackson as the # 1 prospect in his class, I'm sticking with Brandon Ingram over Ben Simmons... heck, I'm still waiting for Greg Oden to come around (not really.)

But I am (really) still waiting for Nerlens Noel to come around. There’s a reason this kid was the # 1 high school prospect in his class, and would have most likely been the # 1 draft prospect in his class if not for injury. Noel is one of the most agile and nimble 6'11"" big men that you'll ever see, with extremely quick hands to boot. His defensive potential has always been massive.

Take, for example, how Nerlens Noel compares to this stacked draft class of big men based on college averages:

DeAndre Ayton: 0.6 steals, 1.9 blocks

Marvin Bagley III: 0.8 steals, 0.9 blocks

Jaren Jackson Jr: 0.6 steals, 3.0 blocks (only 22 mins)

Mo Bamba: 0.8 steals, 3.7 blocks

Wendell Carter Jr: 0.8 steals, 2.1 blocks

Nerlens Noel: 2.1 steals, 4.4 blocks

Noel has translated some of that success to the NBA. In his young career, Noel has averaged 1.6 steals and 1.4 blocks per game. That's a rare combination. Not even Anthony Davis or Draymond Green can make that claim. In fact, very few players in NBA history can make that claim. Since the league made it an official stat, 82 players have averaged 1.4+ blocks. 65 players have averaged 1.6+ steals. But only four -- FOUR -- have met *both* of those thresholds. Julius Erving, Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, and Nerlens Noel.

Even more impressively, Nerlens Noel is doing that in limited time. He's averaged 26.0 minutes per game in the regular season, well below those legends. If you extrapolate to a ""per 36 minute"" mark, Noel would balloon up to 2.2 steals and 2.0 blocks. No player, not Erving, not Olajuwon, not David Robinson, ever averaged 2 steals and 2 blocks per 36 minutes for their career. (Hakeem came the closest, narrowly missing the steals mark with 1.8 per 36.)

Now obviously, those raw counting stats don't tell the whole story about your defensive ability. You never want to hunt for blocks or chase steals to the detriment of the team. Noel can be a little too much of a freelancer in that way at times. That said, he’s still proven to be an impact defender on the court according to +/- metrics. Even this year as he struggled to find a footing in Dallas, he graded as a +2.4 based on ESPN plus/minus on that end.

Of course, there's a reason that a 24 year old with legit Defensive Player of the Year potential can be found on display at our 99 cent store. By all accounts, Noel is a ""bad egg"" who wouldn't survive Willy Wonka's factory or avoid Rick Carlisle's doghouse. He hasn't proven to be a professional, which has kept his minutes low and kept him from fulfilling his potential.

At the same time, that may keep his price down. If Noel had a breakout season with Dallas, he may be fielding $80M long-term contracts. Right now? He may need to settle for a ""prove it"" contract again to show that he can be a genuine starter in this league.

For the first time, Noel will have the opportunity to pick his own coach and his own situation, and we should only hope that he does so wisely. With his career on the rocks, he can't chase the cash right now. He needs to find a true ""home"" that will help him develop better habits (on and off the court), if only to prevent me from looking dumb for touting him for so long.

*possible fits*

LAL. According to reports/rumors, Nerlens Noel had previously turned down a $70M offer from Dallas last summer in order to reach this unrestricted free agency. His new agent is going to have to work *hard* to come anywhere close to that again. But you know who his new agent is? Rich Paul. And Mr. Paul happens to have some other high-profile clients in his portfolio. If the Lakers sign LeBron and still have money to spare, Rich Paul can make a push for his boy Noel to join them. And to be fair, he does fit a run-and-gun young lineup in need of a defensive big man down low.

HOU. I presume the Houston Rockets will pay up to retain RFA Clint Capela, but if they *don't*, signing someone like Nerlens Noel becomes crucial to maintaining their momentum. Noel can provide a lot of the same skills as Capela for a steep discount. Houston would also provide Noel a stable and ""winning"" situation to help rehabilitate his stock (as would Boston or Golden State on a short-term deal.)

DAL. It's always difficult to speculate what's going on behind the scenes (or behind the ears of a player like Noel). At this point, a reunion seems unlikely. But that said, Dallas didn't draft a big man like Mo Bamba, and may strike out on their plans to chase big name FAs. If that's the case, these two may turn back to each other, for better or worse.

######**99 cent store**

**Ed Davis, Portland Trail Blazers, UFA, 29 years old**

As a talented young big man, Ed Davis always on felt on the verge of a breakout. We've been waiting. And waiting. And waiting. I was surprised to see that he's already 29 years old already; I would have pegged him for 25. Perhaps that breakout will *never* come.

But then again, perhaps Ed Davis simply hasn't gotten the real opportunity shine. He's always been a productive player in his limited minutes, averaging 11.6 points and 11.4 rebounds per 36 minutes over the course of his career. His smooth movement skills have allowed him to thrive on defense, where he registered a +2.4 impact according to real plus/minus. Originally, he may have been seen as a ""tweener"" as a slightly undersized center, but the modern and smaller NBA is playing into his hands.

In fact, there's a legitimate argument that the Blazers should allow the bulkier (and more expensive) Jusuf Nurkic to leave in free agency, and have Ed Davis serve as the placeholder starter until Zach Collins gets up to speed.

**Brandan Wright, UFA, 30 years old**

Effectively, Brandan Wright was ""Ed Davis"" before Ed Davis. The fleet-footed and slightly undersized center out of UNC, Wright has always shown well in his limited minutes. He's especially effective at rolling to the rim, and contributes 2.2 blocks per 36 minutes.

Wright has never found a permanent home in the league, playing for 7 separate teams as he's struggled with injuries. Right now, Wright is off a roster as a result. Teams will need some medical info on him to see whether he can still contribute off the bench, or whether it's the end of the road for him.

######**clearance rack**

**Stephen Zimmerman, UFA, 22 years old**

Previously, we mentioned Portland center Zach Collins, who has become a favorite son of Blazers fans. However, there's one unsigned and fringe roster player who may be grumbling about his success.

You see, back in high school, Stephen Zimmerman was the star of his Las Vegas high school team, with Zach Collins as his backup. Between them, Zimmerman had a much bigger national reputation. *He* was the McDonald's All-American and top 10 recruit. *He* was supposed to be the ""stretch"" big that would become an NBA star.

That hasn't happened. After one decent year at UNLV, Zimmerman fell to R2 and has been cut by both Orlando and the L.A. Lakers. In theory, he’s a modern stretch big, but he hasn't proven to be a reality yet. In college, he only made 29.4% of his threes and 62.4% from the line. He's barely played in the NBA so it's difficult to chart his progress there, but presumably he didn't light up practices if he's been getting cut.

If you bring in Zimmerman, you're banking on his ""pedigree"" as a recruit more than anything else. He's still young enough to have a future if he can figure it out. It's not a *great* bet, but that's why you can find him in the clearance rack / trash bin.

anemia_,2018-06-27 06:41:00+00:00,Don't perform an exorcism on someone that doesn't need it,"Six years ago my friends and I found something on the internet and did something really stupid.  It was supposed to be a joke, and it isn’t anymore.  

My name is Emily and I have epilepsy.  It’s not too bad, I take my meds and every once in a while my friends have a laugh or my mom freaks out.  It’s not a life ruiner these days.  But it used to be.

My mom is super religious (catholic, if you want to know) so I grew up hearing a lot of biblical stories and historical stuff.  For the record, I’m an athiest, but when I was 17 so mom still made me go to church every damn weekend.  Anyway, in church there’s lots of stories of people being stoned to death for ‘possession’, which was really just seizures or other health ailments that they were unaware of back then.  Jump a bit ahead historically to exorcisms being conducted for what I thought to be, similar reasons.  Possessions aren’t real; it’s like the Salem Witch Trials, I thought.  People jumping to conclusions and doing really fucked up things.  I didn’t realize that it a gate was present and closed, you could still open it.

Anyway, my friends Jack and Diane (okay I changed their names haha, but still it’s a male and female), loved spooky stuff.  We lived in Salem so it kind of came with the territory.  We all went to Jack’s house one summer weekend to watch some scary movies, which was our usual Saturday afternoon routine.  When Diane and I got there he had found some funny stuff online and showed it to us.  He’d found an odd looking copy of the Roman Ritual and the rubrics of the rite.  We each read through it and had a laugh.  We all knew how my mom is batshit for catholicism and any crazy religious anything reminded us of her.  But then Jack said “hey…. Your mom has all this stuff…. Would you wanna?!”

Diane snorted and I was just like “Wanna what, perform an exorcism?  On what?”

Diane laughed, “Maybe we should do it to your mom, get that nonsense out of her!”  The three of us laughed at the thought of waiting until my mom fell asleep and going into her room to do this bullshit ritual.  

“No, dumbass!  You have seizures just like the dudes they did this to!  We should try it on you!” Jack was smiling and laughing when he said it, but was also serious.  “Come on, are you scared?” He taunted me, “What’s the worst that could happen?  We mess with some of your mom’s stuff, say hi to some demons, try to put it all back in the right spot and then we can hit up pizza hut before we watch our movies.  It’ll be a great day.” I knew Jack and I were just friends, but his smile really made me melt.  If he ever knew how I felt, or the things I had sometimes thought, it never showed.  But he was giving me that smile, and ruffled his hand through that hair, and I nodded in agreement without thought.

So we made the trek to my place on foot, it wasn’t a long walk.  When we got inside we all laughed because you could just instantly see my mom’s faith oozing out of every corner- crosses, nativity scenes (yes, she leaves it up all year long), paintings and statues everywhere.  It’s enough to make you throw up, but we didn’t.  We laughed it off, and went to my bedroom to set the stage for our homemade ‘exorcism’.  

Jack had printed out the rituals and rubric of rites.  We had our materials aligned on my night stand and everything was all set to go.  Diane joked that maybe we should induce a seizure before we start, to get my body in the ‘correct state’ for the exorcism.  We laughed at the thought but then wondered if there was any validity to it.  They both looked at me as if to say ‘you down for that?’ and I quickly said “Why the hell not”....so we got out an old halloween strobe light too.  Mom didn’t know I had it, it’s been in my closet for a few years.  Fun until, well you know.

They set up the light, I laid in my bed, and we giggled as we got ready.  We’re really doing this, we all thought silently in our heads.  We had our holy water, crosses, and because Diane is a bit weaker on the horror than Jack and I, some white sage.  She insisted.

I know inducing a seizure was stupid, by the way.  I know.  We’re total morons.  I was laying down, we’d drawn the curtains on my windows, and we had our materials present.  Jack turned on the strobe and we laughed for a minute or two, then I don’t know what happened.

The next bits are a little hazy.  I was coming out of my convulsions, saw Jack and Diane next to me, and couldn’t remember at first what we were all doing in my room.  Jack started reciting off his paper and Diane stood at my side sprinkling water droplets over me and my bed.  It felt cool, then burned.  It burned so much that I howled from the pain.  Jack kept talking but looked a bit more worried.  He’s not one to give up, so he let himself flinch for just a moment and then continued.  Diane looked much more concerned.  She stopped with the water and ran from the room.  The moment she left I saw Jack lean down to me.  He kissed me hard on the mouth and it was beautiful.  I closed my eyes and saw us together, everything I’ve wanted, being in his arms and feeling so lovely.  When I cracked my eyes open I saw a disgusting dark, morphed face.  The room looked much more dark.  The ugly cloaked figure stood close to my face and smelled horrid.  It leaned in for another kiss and I fought it away, opening my eyes to see Jack again.  He was still reading the rites, watching my body twitch exhaustingly, and Diane was wiping me with a wet towel, encouraging me to drink some water through a straw.  

I must have fallen asleep for a few minutes because the next memory I have is of the three of us in my room, curtains open and religious symbols put away.  It smelled of sage; Diane must have smoked the room.  My two friends were sitting on the floor eating some apples and playing cards while watching me, waiting for me to get up.  When I did, they asked how I felt.

“What happened?” I said groggily.  “Did anything work?  Was it cool?” I was beat, but so hopeful.  I made nervous eye contact with Jack.  He seemed to be totally normal, playing it cool.  Diane stood to hug me.  “I was really scared for you,” she said. “You seemed like you were in a lot of pain.  Otherwise it felt pretty stupid to me.” She glared at Jack as she said that last part.

“I hope you’re okay,” Jack said quietly, “I really didn’t want to hurt you.  Diane is right, it was a stupid idea.  It’ll be a fun story to talk about, but you didn’t speak in tongues or slide head first up the wall or anything.  It was mostly just me standing there, being an idiot.  I’m really sorry.”

After ample checking to make sure I was okay, I told them I really wanted that pizza.  We laughed, Diane went to get her car, we got our pizza and went back to Jack’s basement for a fun horror flick.  

The next day at church I got a monster headache.  That’s not unusual for me, especially after having a seizure.  I didn’t tell mom about it, there’s nothing anyone could really do and it’s not something people really need to know.  But my head was pounding and my vision was off.  I was seeing blurry.  It was like everyone I saw had a double standing just slightly off beside them.  The double was like a burnt version of themselves; like how someone would look if they’d been horribly burnt in a fire.  But it was super blurry and I figured I was just having an off day after what happened. It sounds weird, but headaches and blurred vision isn’t that out of the norm for me.  

When I got home I had a text from Diane asking if we wanted to come over for a swim.  I put my bikini on and tossed a big tee over it.  I gave myself a look in the mirror.  I felt pretty.  I had a thin body, long dark hair, clear skin, and big green eyes.  Could Jack ever see me this way?  Did he think I was pretty?  As I turned from the mirror to head out, I saw the burnt black shadow of myself, following me.  It was only just for a moment, and I again tossed it up to nothing.

I slipped on my shoes and headed out.  It was a great thing that we all lived so close, as I obviously can’t drive.  I decided to stop at Jack’s on the way.  I was passing by anyway, and I wanted to spend some time alone with him, I’ll admit it.  Every time I closed my eyes, I could see that kiss.  I could feel his body against mine, and his arms wrap around me until they turned into a snake.  When I started to see that, I’d open my eyes again.

When I got to Jack’s his brother answered the door.  “He’s in the basement” he motioned as he let me in.  When I got down there he was chilling out watching some basketball game.  He smiled and greeted me as I walked down the steps.  

“Did you get Diane’s text?  You wanna go swimming?” I asked eagerly.  He took a look at his phone- it had fallen through the cracks in the couch.  He saw the texts, shot up, went into the bathroom and back out within minutes ready to go.  Swimming at Diane’s was always really fun.  Sometimes when her parents weren’t home, her older sister would make us smoothies with vodka in them and Jack reminded me that they were away for work that weekend.  Even more excited, we headed out.  

As we were walking, Jack told me all about the game he’d been watching.  He mimed out one of the shots to show me.  When he was done, I asked him about yesterday.  

“What happened….” I trailed off.  He’s super cool all the time, but me?  I’m a nervous ball of shyness.  But I finally looked him straight in the eyes. “When Diane ran out, I mean.”

We stopped walking abruptly.  “Diane didn’t leave,” He said.  “What are you talking about?  What did you see?”  I now felt really stupid, and really, really embarrassed.  The kiss had been in my head after all.  But it was so nice!  I’ve had lots of kisses.  Plenty of boys at school liked me, but I had never been able to fully get past my thoughts about Jack.  I wondered what he’d do if he knew.  That fake kiss was better than any real kisses I’ve ever had.  

I saw the burnt shadow of Jack behind him.  It winked at me.  I giggled and the real Jack looked puzzled.  I pondered telling him what I had seen.  “I saw Diane run away, and then you kept talking, and then you……” I trailed off again out of nerves, and when I looked back up Jack was much closer to my face.  I closed my eyes and our lips touched.  It felt magical.  His hand found my back and mine floated up to his shoulder.  When my eyes flickered open, he was gone.

I was left standing on the side of the road, very confused and alone.  I couldn’t tell what was real and what wasn’t anymore, and it was freaking me out big time.  Had I even gone to Jack’s house?  Had he just run off?  I started to panic and my breathing got heavy.  I was closest to Diane’s so I decided to run over there for help.  She knew a bit about my crush on Jack and could sympathize and help me out.  Maybe he’s already there, maybe they’re already swimming and waiting for me.  That’s what I was hopeful for, at least.

Diane is a closet lesbian, in case that’s important. Our friendship dynamic between the three of us has always been very platonic.  We talked about crushes, hook ups, anything and everything all the time.  Except my crush on Jack.  that was just a Diane and I thing.  

When I got to Diane’s house she opened the door and saw me in hysterics, I guess.  I blurted out that I didn’t know where Jack was and I kissed him but maybe I didn’t and I didn’t know what was going on.  She caught me, and we went to sit in her living room.  Her sister popped in to ask if we wanted a ‘smoothie’ yet, and Diane flashed her a look that was a hard no.  I told my story of what happened between yesterday and this moment, not leaving out a single detail.  Diane just listened.  Then she said maybe we should go upstairs so her sister didn’t overhear.  After we got up the stairs, I explained to her more slowly what I was experiencing.  

“No, Jack isn’t here.  No, I didn’t leave during the exorcism.  Jack didn’t kiss you- I’m sorry!  I just want to tell you the truth” she filled in the holes in my memories.  “Let’s call Jack’s house and see what’s going on there.”

The phone rang and no one picked up.  After 20 minutes of calling we drove over.  I was a fit of tears, there was no hiding it and to be honest I didn’t really care at that point.  My best friend was possibly missing or hurt.  Jack’s brother answered the door just as he had before, except he said Jack wasn’t home.  When I asked if he’d seen me earlier, he looked at me like I was a complete idiot.  “Uhh, why would you say that?  You haven’t been over since yesterday.  Unless you slept over and snuck out this morning… did you guys do that again?!”  He wasn’t referring to anything sexual; just friends being friends, and my mom being my mom.  We shook our heads and went back to the car.  

I was really upset and just wanted to go home, so Diane dropped me off and I spent the rest of the night crying and confused in bed.  I texted Jack to call me as soon as he could, but didn’t hear back from him.  I fell asleep as the sun started to come up.  

A couple days went by, and more and more people started to discuss Jack’s sudden disappearance.  His picture was in the paper listed as a missing person.  In the picture behind him stood a burnt outline of his cloned face, winking at me through the inky paper.  I still have that photo framed on my current bedside table.  I really loved him.  

I went to art school in Portland.  I still live here and I’m doing alright.  I do a lot of freelance art and work graveyard at a diner.  It’s actually a really fun job.  I live with 4 friends in an apartment, and Diane actually found herself out here too, though she doesn’t live with me.  She went to school in Ohio then got a nice job offer out here.  Portland is great for LGBT so she quickly accepted the job and has been out here since.  We still hang out a lot on the weekends.  Oh, I still see the burnt men (that’s what I’ve decided to call them) behind people from time to time too.  Usually it’s before something terrible happens to the person.  I wish I could warn them, but sometimes I don’t know them; and if I did I don’t know what to warn them about.  I like working nights because I’ve noticed that I see them less at this time of day.  I also like sleeping in the daylight.  I avoid seeing the burnt men, and I often have dreams of my dear friend.

It’s 11pm and Diane just sent me a text. “Hey, are you at work?  I need you to call me immediately.  I think I just saw Jack.”   

I just called her back and she's on her way over.  I wanted to document this story in case something happens and we disappear too.  Jack, if you're out there, I hope we find you.",nosleep,2736

Denver Nuggets | draft a Rookie of the Year | The Sonics drafted the ROY in 2007. The Nuggets have never done this. | 50% The Nuggets drafted Donovan Mitchell before trading him to the Jazz for Trey Lyles and Tyler Lydon. Mitchell and Ben Simmons have the best chance at winning it this year.
Detroit Pistons | were founded | The Sonics were founded in 1967. The Pistons havent been founded since 1957! | 1% they probably wont get founded again. 
Golden State Warriors | have a player win the JWKC award | Sonics’ player and cousin of then coach and GM Bill Russell, Slick Watts won it in 1975. No Warrior player has ever won this. | 10% I could see the league giving to KD for his community work.
Houston Rockets | move cities | The Sonics moved from their city in 2008. The Rockets havent moved since 1971 when they moved from San Diego! | 0% Rockets owner has pledged to keep team in Houston.

Los Angeles Lakers | had a player win Defensive Player of the Year | Gary Payton won this award on the Sonics in 1996. The last Laker player to win was Michael Cooper in 1986. | 2% if the Ball family is able to sign LiAngelo and he leads the league in steals, it could happen, but other than that I dont see it happening.
Memphis Grizzlies | finish the season as a top 3 seed | The Sonics finished 3rd in 2005. The Grizzlies have never been able to do it. | Originally a 0 but Marc Gasol seems like a nice guy so I had to bump it up to a 3%.

Milwaukee Bucks | had a player on the All NBA first team| Gary Payton was All NBA first team in 2000 for the Sonics. The last Bucks player to do that was Sidney Moncrief in 1983! | 100% Giannis is gonna do it.
Minnesota Timberwolves| trade away Ray Allen | The Sonics traded Allen in 2007. The Timberwolves traded Ray Allen away in 1996 for Stephon Marbury. Allen went on to be a 10 time all star and is 1st in all time 3 pointers made. Marbury has done great things in China. | 0% Allen retired in 2016 
New Orleans Pelicans | relocate to OKC | The Sonics relocated in 2008. The Pelicans, then the Hornets, relocated to OKC in 2005 after Katrina hit. | 0% would require two teams moving and thats not going to happen.
New York Knicks | had Knicks legend Patrick Ewing on the team | The Sonics had Pat on the team as recently as 2001. Ewing hasn’t been on the Knicks since 2000 when they traded him to the Sonics. | 1% Ewing is retired but if Dolan is desperate enough I wont rule it out completely.
Oklahoma City Thunder | be liked by Sonics fans | The Supersonics have been liked by Sonics fans since the team was founded till today. The Thunder have never been liked by Sonics fans | 1% maybe Seattle gets its team back and the fans kinda chill.
Orlando Magic | draft 23rd | The Sonics drafted Bobby Jackson 23rd in 1997. The Magic last drafted 23rd in 1991 when they took Stanley Roberts. | 10% Although usually you have to be good to draft 23rd, the Magic have many young players they drafted high in the lottery who they might trade for an expiring contract and a late 1st rounder.
Philadelphia 76ers | win their division |  the Sonics won their division in 2005. The 76ers havent won since 2001. | 50% as long as Joel Embiid can stay healthy, Ben Simmons can get a shot, and Markelle Fultz can get his shit together I would say they have a pretty good shot. It goes up to 60% if Saric ever comes over.
Phoenix Suns | be sold | the sonics were last sold in 2008. The Suns were last sold in 2004 | 1% With the leagues’ value at an all time high and newish owner Robert Sarver only being 57 years old I think Suns fans have a long future with the man who beat James Dolan in a ranking of the worst owners in the NBA.
Portland Trailblazers | draft Kevin Durant | The Sonics last drafted Kevin Durant in 2007. The Trailblazers have never drafted Durant. | 5% This may seem high but Im trusting my gut. There are a lot of Kevins out there. A couple of them might have the last name Durant. 
Sacramento Kings | win a playoff series | The Sonics beat the Kings in the playoffs in 2005. The Kings last series win was in 2004. | 50% I am a big believer in Doncic and if the prophecy is true than the Kings should be pretty set.
San Antonio Spurs | had a player win Most Improved | Dale Ellis won it for the Sonics in 1986/87. Alvin Robertson won it for the Spurs in 1985/86. | 10% The Spurs have always been good at developing players and I could see them snagging one.
Toronto Raptors | retire a number | The Sonics retired Gus Williams’ number “1” in 2004. The Raptors have never retired a number. | 100% I just think they’ll do it soon for either Carter Bosh or LeBron.
Utah Jazz | lose 60 games |  The Sonics last lost 60 games in 2008. The Jazz have remarkably never lost 60 games. | 1% with young stars Mitchell and Gobert I see this team having a better chance to win 60.
Washington Wizards | play in a conference finals | The Sonics last played in the conference finals in 1996. The Wizards havent made it out of the second round since 1979 where they won and went on to meet the Sonics in the Finals for the second straight year. | 10% I am a big John Wall fan but if Lebron stays in the East its going to be difficult for this team to get back.

Because the Timberwolves finally made the playoffs this year, they now have made the playoffs more recently than the Seattle Supersonics. I decided to compile a list of things that the Sonics have done more recently than each team in the league.

The Wizards havent made it out of the second round since 1979 where they won and went on to meet the Sonics in the Finals for the second straight year. | 10% I am a big John Wall fan but if Lebron stays in the East its going to be difficult for this team to get back.

jordonkry,2018-06-12 04:39:37+00:00,[OC] Ranking all 30 Teams by Attractiveness,"It is the offseason, my dudes, and you know what that means; low-effort shitposts! But this is not one of those. Actually, this took way too much time, but I was already too committed by the time I wanted to give up.

But anyway, as the title implies, I'm going to be ranking each NBA team by how attractive on average their players are. [If you want to just see the rankings of all the individual players, here's a google doc.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n27aE8NbcZt0YyIfkL-a6pLsG46OMsqoe_EMImwnfXM/edit?usp=sharing).

Before I start, there's a few things I should get out of the way. First off, only players who were on the team at the end of the season counts. Any two-way player who played in at least 15 games for their team counted.

Also, before you come at me saying ""you fucking idiot there is no way x is more/less attractive than y"", keep these two things in mind. First, this is all the opinion of a 16-year-old girl (so no, you can't call me gay). Also, pretty much all of these numbers are completely arbitrary and just the first number I thought of. The only number that really means anything is 5, which was that I had literally no opinion. So odds are if there's some egregious ranking that puts someone over someone else, I probably agree with you, but I'm too lazy to keep consistent. There's also a chance I fucked up my math because I'm a dumbass. So without further ado, onto the rankings.


**30. Sacramento Kings- 4.80 avg**
Turns out, the Sacramento Kings are the ugliest group of players in the league. Frank Mason III (6.55) and Iman Shumpert (6.35) lead this team in looks, but it all goes downhill from there, with players like JaKarr Sampson (4.25), Nigel Hayes (4.15), De'Aaron Fox (4.00), Justin Jackson (3.95), and Kosta Koufos (2.90) really bring this team down.


**29. Milwaukee Bucks- 4.93 avg**
Before I even thought about these rankings, I just assumed the Bucks would be the ugliest team in the league. And I was almost right. When Delly (6.15) is your second most attractive player, it can only get worse from there. The Bucks have some of the ugliest players in the league in Thon Maker and Tony Snell (3.75) and the ugliest in Tyler Zeller (1.25).


**28. Brooklyn Nets- 4.97 avg**
With Nik Stauskas being the most attractive player (6.45), it's pretty bad in Brooklyn. Timofey Mozgov (4.00), Allen Crabbe (4.20), and pretty much the entire team are some ugly motherfuckers, and Joe Harris (6.35) and D'Angelo Russell (6.10) couldn't salvage them.


**27. Atlanta Hawks- 5.04 avg**
Miles Plumlee (6.25) is the only player above a 6, and with 6 players all being sub-5 (with Taurean Prince at a 3.95), the Hawks are ugly as shit. Maybe that's why no one goes to their games.


**26. Los Angeles Clippers- 5.05 avg**
I barely even knew anyone on the Clippers before doing this. Lou Williams (6.60) and DeAndre Jordan (6.35) are decent looking, but this team also has Boban (3.25). This team also has probably the most difficult to rank player on here. Milos Teodosic (5.50) has some pictures where he looks like a homeless man, but others where he looks like a really attractive homeless man.


**25. Miami Heat- 5.07 avg**
I swear to God, looking at these Heat players I wasn't totally convinced they were real NBA players and not created 2k ones. Hassan Whiteside (6.70) is decent looking, and this team definitetly were saved from being really fucking ugly from that. The number of players over and under 5.00 are equal, but there's also a 3.05 Kelly Olynyk in there.


**24, 23, 22, and 21. Toronto Raptors, New Orleans Pelicans, Portland Trail Blazers, and New York Knicks- 5.10 avg**
Yup, we have a 4-way tie. Starting off with the Raptors, no one on this team is really ugly, with C.J. Miles (4.75) and Pascal Siakam (4.45) being the ugliest players. The thing is, no one is really attractive, either, with Demar DeRozan (5.75) being the most attractive. The Pelicans have DeMarcus Cousins (7.95), and Anthony Davis (6.00), but things get messy after that.  The Trail Blazers suffer from the same fate as the Raptors, with no one hideous, but no one really attractive (Wade Baldwin is the most attractive at a 5.95). Lastly, the Knicks got a couple of European cuties in Porzingis (7.05) and Enes Kanter (6.85), but Jarrett Jack (4.30), Joakim Noah (4.15), Michael Beasley (4.10), Troy Williams (4.05), and Ron Baker (4.00) completely kill them.


**20. Orlando Magic- 5.20 avg**
Fuck I really don't know anyone on this team. Like, I haven't even heard of over half of these people. Vucevic (6.25) and Aaron Gordon (6.10) are both solid, but this team really suffers from a lack of really
 attractive players and also from just some below average guys like Shelvin Mack (4.80), Rodney Purvis (4.80), and Mo Speights (4.50).


**19, 18, and 17. Houston Rockets, Denver Nuggets, and Phoenix Suns- 5.23 avg**
Another tie here. I didn't even realize the Rockets were one of the less attractive teams, but after Chris Paul (8.00) there's a pretty big drop off to Gerald Green (6.15) and Nene (5.55). Chris Paul really saved them, because a team with James Harden (4.70) and Zhou Qi (3.95) is just destined to fail. The Nuggets are yet another team without anyone really hideous, with Will Barton (4.70) being the ugliest, but at the same time Jamal Murray (6.40) wasn't enough to carry the team. Finishing off the 5.23s, besides Booker (7.05) and Tyson Chandler (6.25) they have a lot of guys hovering around average, with Dragan Bender (4.70) at the bottom. (Side note: I find Bender kinda cute, but in an ugly way, kinda like pugs).


**16. Chicago Bulls- 5.24 avg**
Finishing off the below-NBA-average teams, my Chicago Bulls feature the love of my life Lauri Markkanen (7.60) and the technically more attractive Zach LaVine (7.65). Looking at the top, you wouldn't think that the Bulls would be that ugly, with guys like Kris Dunn (6.40) and Robin Lopez (6.15). There's some ugly pieces of shit on our team though, like Shrek (4.15) Cam Payne (4.00), Jerian Grant (3.85), and Omer Asik (3.80).


**15. Detroit Pistons- 5.26 avg**
I assumed the Pistons would be really ugly. Turns out, I only assumed that because they're another one of those phantom teams where I only know what like 3 of the players look like. The team in general is pretty average, but Blake Griffin (7.35), Jon Leuer (6.10) and Andre Drummond (6.00) help bring up the average. Not only that, out of the  7 sub-5 players, only 2 are below 4.85, those being Henry Ellenson (4.75) and Anthony Tolliver (4.60).


**14. Dallas Mavericks- 5.27 avg**
I kinda have a crush on Dirk (6.15) and I definitely ranked him too high, but fuck it. Maxi Kleber (6.35), DSJ (6.05), and J.J. Barea (5.60) don't have crazy high scores, but all the guys on this team are generally not-ugly enough so that even Salah Mejri (4.15) didn't completely kill this team.


**13. Charlotte Hornets- 5.28 avg**
I'm actually pretty surprised by this. I actually probably messed up my math, but I'm too lazy to check it. I mean, can Kemba Walker (7.50) and Dwight Howard (7.10) really make up for the sins of Treveon Graham (4.65) and Frank Kaminsky (3.80)? I guess.


**12. Minnesota Timberwolves- 5.32 avg**
No one is really ugly on this team. Cole Aldrich (4.95), Jamal Crawford (4.90), Marcus Georges-Hunt (4.90), and Tyus Jones (4.85) are the ugliest of them all. Throw in a D Rose (7.75) and you've got yourself a borderline top-10 team.


**11. Indiana Pacers- 5.33 avg**
Much like the Timberwolves, the bottom players on this team aren't even that low, with Cory Joseph (4.95), Ike Anigbogu (4.95), Thaddeus Young (4.80), and T.J. Leaf (4.75) being the only below 5 players. On top of that, there's some pretty good looking guys on here as well, like Oladipo (6.55), Domantas Sabonis (6.35), and Lance Stephenson (5.85).


**10. Memphis Grizzlies- 5.35 avg**
Kicking off the top 10 we have... the Memphis Grizzlies? I mean, sure. Whatever. Chandler Parsons (7.45) may suck at basketball now, but he's still got a pretty face. Mike Conley (7.15) is a lot more attractive than I realized, and Marc Gasol (6.05) and Kobi Simmons (6.00) aren't too bad looking themselves.


**9. Washington Wizards- 5.36 avg**
John Wall (7.45) is a very attractive man. Kelly Oubre (6.40) is also attractive. Hey, would you look at that, Bradley Beal (6.25) and Markieff Morris (6.00) are also good looking. I don't really give a shit about the Wizards. 


**8. Oklahoma City Thunder- 5.38 avg**
Can I just get out the way that I fucking despise the Oklahoma City Thunder as a basketball team? Okay? Okay. But they are a very attractive team. ""Playoff P"" (still waiting to meet him) and Carmelo ""Literal Trash Can"" Anthony (7.95) make up for Raymond Felton (4.45) and Kyle Singler (4.40). Not Carmelo, Abrines (6.00) also helps contribute to this team's average. 


**7. Los Angeles Lakers- 5.41 avg**
Another team I didn't expect, the Lakers have some ugly ass players on their team. I just realized I forgot Alex Caruso, which definetely helped them out, because that hairline is an automatic 4.00. Anyway, there's some pretty unattractive guys on the team, like Ivica Zubac (4.40) and ROY Finalist Andre Ingram (4.65). But they also have the likes of Isaiah Thomas (7.55), Lonzo Ball (6.95), Slenderman (6.85) and Kuzma (5.95), who I just realized I ranked too high. This whole one I kinda fucked up. Y'all got lucky.


**6. San Antonio Spurs- 5.42 avg**
I overrated Manu (6.55) because I'm madly in love with him, similar to how I overrated Dirk. Manu was fine when he was younger, but he's currently old enough to be my dad which is kinda weird I guess. Anyway, Kawhi (8.00) is what really takes this team over the top, but it's really a team effort, much like the real Spurs. Danny Green (5.75) and LaMarcus Aldridge (5.55) also add to this team average, and only 4 players are below 5, with Derrick White (4.75) being the lowest.


**5. Philadelphia 76ers- 5.51 avg**
Kicking off the top 5, we have the Philadelphia 76ers. J.J. Redick (8.95) is hot as hell, Ben Simmons (7.00) doesn't look that much like the Mona Lisa, Joel Embiid (6.85) is good looking, and T.J. McConnell (6.70) is a cutie. If it weren't for RoCo (4.35) and Dario (3.45), this team would be even higher.


**4. Boston Celtics- 5.71 avg**
I honestly considered including coaches just because Brad Stevens is such a DILF. But still, the Celtics are borderline top 3. I mean, how can a team with Gordon Hayward (8.75) be ugly? Have you seen that man? That glow up gives all ugly people (like me) hope. Throw in a Kyrie (8.00) with that smile, a Jayson Tatum (7.15), a Marcus Smart (6.80, don't @ me), Jaylen Brown (6.50), and, hell, even Al Horford (6.15) and you've got yourself a superteam. They got a few ugly sons of bitches holding them back, like Aron Baynes (4.30), Guerschon Yabusele (4.00), and Daniel Theis (4.00), but it's still not enough to keep them from being at the top of the attractiveness scale.


**3. Utah Jazz- 5.75 avg**
Ricky Rubio (9.00) is one of the few men that can only be described with ""beautiful"". Raul Neto (7.45) is a Brazilian babe. Donovan Mitchell (7.15), Thabo Sefolosha (6.35), Rudy Gobert (6.15), and Jonas Jerebko (6.00) only add on to the beauty that is this Utah Jazz team. They do have Alec Burks (4.50) and Ekpe Udoh (4.40) but... Ricky Rubio.


**2. Golden State Warriors- 5.80 avg**
For once, the Warriors aren't the best at something. Just like when it comes to actual basketball, their big 4 of Steph Curry (9.00), Klay Thompson (8.25), Kevin Durant (7.75), and Swaggy P (7.75) really make this team elite, not to mention Andre Iguodala (6.15). However, their weakness is in the center position, with Kevon Looney (4.30), Javale McGee (4.15), and Zaza Pachulia (4.00) killing the average.


**1. Cleveland Cavaliers- 5.86 average**
They couldn't get it done in the Finals, but the Cavs got the best of the Warriors when it comes to most attractive. Let's just get this out of the way; [Kevin Wesley Love is gorgeous.](http://phi-lophobic.tumblr.com/post/124569814674/if-you-think-he-isnt-hot-theres-probably-smth) I mean, [just look at him.](http://heybelinda.tumblr.com/post/128933134805/kevin-love-on-late-night-with-seth-meyers) I gave him a 9.15, which I'm pretty sure is the highest I gave anyone, which may or may not be accurate. There's like 3 ugly people on this team. Ante Zizic and Jose Calderon (4.50) aren't even that ugly, but yeak Perk (4.00) is. Hell, there's barely even anyone *average* on this team. Korver (7.65). LeBron (7.00). JR (6.75). Cedi (6.35). TT (6.25). Y'all may have gotten swept, but at least you looked fine doing it.

ZandrickEllison,2018-06-10 18:01:31+00:00,[OC] Projecting the Future for Each Possible LeBron Team,"If you hadn't heard, LeBron James may become a free agent this summer. He'll have his fair share of suitors -- essentially every team in the league. In order to help LeBron make up his mind, I'm going to run through each possible destination for him, and project their **chances to win in 2018-19.** 

Now to do that, we can't simply add LeBron James into each lineup. We need some semblance of reality here. Instead, we're going to have to chart a semi-plausible path to that team getting LeBron. They either need the $30M+ it'd take to sign him in free agency, or work out a sign and trade package that the Cavaliers would actually accept. 

Keep in mind, this is me running through these ""simulations"" fairly quickly, so feel free to criticize my roster decisions or my projected results. 

######**THE LEBRON SIMULATION SERIES**

**Atlanta Hawks**

*how they get LeBron*

The Hawks have around $25-30M in cap space, which isn't too far away from the max that LeBron James would need. It's certainly possible for them to get to that mark. They can ""stretch"" Miles Plumlee (who somehow makes $12M a year) or attach an asset (they have three R1 picks) in order to get rid of him. 

*the LeBron lineup*

PG: Dennis Schroeder

SG: Kent Bazemore

SF: LeBron James

PF: John Collins

C: Dewayne Dedmon (FA) / # 3 pick Marvin Bagley

*how they do with LeBron*

While the Hawks have *some* talent, it may be diminishing returns for scorers like Dennis Schroeder or John Collins to play off the ball with LeBron running the show; neither are great spacers. The Hawks have a bumpy ride all season, finishing 45-37 and earning the # 7 seed. The team gives # 2 Boston a fight in R1, but lose 4-2. In hindsight, trading the # 3 pick for another veteran may have been a better way to contend in 2018-19. Not off to a great start, GM Zan.

**Boston Celtics**

*how they get LeBron*

With no cap space at their disposal, Danny Ainge and the club will have to work on a sign and trade. Fortunately for them, they have all sorts of assets to dangle Cleveland's way. The ones with the highest price tag would be either Kyrie Irving or Gordon Hayward; either one plus some change may make the salaries work. Given their history, we'll say the Celts shed Irving over Hayward (although ""fit wise"" it may be better in reverse.)

*the LeBron lineup*

PG: Terry Rozier / Marcus Smart

SG: Jayson Tatum / Jaylen Brown

SF: Gordon Hayward

PF: LeBron James

C: Al Horford

*how they do with LeBron*

Watch out, East. Not only would this Celtics' squad be loaded, they'd be coached by Brad Stevens. Better yet, they'd have the depth on the wing to allow LeBron James some much needed rest during the regular season. Let's pencil them in for a 62-20 regular season record before they turn on the gas and crush the East in the playoffs. Would they beat Golden State in the Finals...? This new look team may be a little short on shooting and chemistry, so we'll give them a 4-3 Finals loss. If LeBron could have made amends with Kyrie, it may have been a different story.

**Brooklyn Nets**

*how they get LeBron*

Despite the lack of talent on the roster, Sean Marks and company don't have loads of cap room to offer: only around $15-20M. As a result, they're going to have to work hard to make this math work. Timo Mozgov is a big salary that they can try to work a sign and trade with, but he'd have to come with plenty of assets attached -- maybe D'Angelo Russell, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, *and* Caris LeVert.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG: Jeremy Lin / Spencer Dinwiddie

SG: Allen Crabbe

SF: DeMarre Carroll

PF: LeBron James

C: Jarrett Allen

*how they do with LeBron*

Here on the Nets, LeBron James would have some decent spacing to work with, but the key would be determining how ""ready"" second-year center Jarrett Allen may be. It's unlikely that the talented Allen would take a major leap this soon, which, along with the depth the team lost in the dealmaking would leave them short-handed. The Nets struggle and finish 44-38. They give Philadelphia a tough battle but lose 4-2 in R1.

**Charlotte Hornets**

*how they get LeBron*

Maxed out with nearly $120M on the books, new GM Mitch Kupchak will have to engineer a decent trade. Nicolas Batum ($24M) is the big salary on the board, but his stock has stagnated. Instead, let's package MKG ($13M), Cody Zeller ($14M), and Jeremy Lamb ($7M.) 

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Kemba Walker

SG:	Nicolas Batum / Malik Monk 

SF:	LeBron James

PF:	Marvin Williams

C:	Dwight Howard

*how they do with LeBron*

If they can actually swing a sign and trade, this Charlotte Hornets lineup looks pretty well balanced all the way around. They have enough vets to win 53 games and grab a top 3 seed. Their upside may be determined by how quickly Malik Monk can develop into the dead-eye shooter he showed in college. Presuming he's still another year away, so this team would battle Boston but fall 4-3 in R2.

**Chicago Bulls**

*how they get LeBron*

With $40M+ in cap room, the Chicago Bulls can simply sign LeBron James to a max. But if we presume they do that, let's say they allow erratic scorer and RFA Zach LaVine to chase big money elsewhere.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Kris Dunn

SG:	Justin Holiday / Denzel Valentine 

SF:	LeBron James

PF:	Lauri Markkanen / Bobby Portis

C:	Robin Lopez / # 7 pick Mo Bamba

*how they do with LeBron*

Personally I'm a fan of the young Bulls, so I'm higher on this team than others may be. Kris Dunn has the potential to be an elite on-ball defender and Lauri Markkanen can provide the complementary spacing. He may remind LeBron too much of Kevin Love as a PF/C, but that's still good enough to win 51 games and grab a 3 seed. I'll say the young guns step up to the plate and knock off Philly in R2, before ultimately falling 4-2 to Boston in the Eastern Conference Finals.

**Cleveland Cavaliers**

*how they get LeBron*

Simply strap him down and force him to stay. 

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	George Hill

SG:	J.R. Smith / Jordan Clarkson 
 
SF:	LeBron James / Kyle Korver / # 8 pick Mikal Bridges

PF:	Kevin Love

C:	Tristan Thompson / Larry Nance

*how they do with LeBron*

In terms of projecting the upside of this Cavs team, a lot depends on whether they can actually land the ""veteran"" rookie Mikal Bridges or re-sign Rodney Hood. At their best, both can serve as 3+D wings and complementary scorers. If LeBron actually stays, this team should also benefit from another year of chemistry. I'll say they improve to 53 wins and advance to the Eastern Conference Finals, battling with Boston again. But alas, the coaching and defensive deficit leads to a 4-3 loss.

**Dallas Mavericks**

*how they get LeBron*

The rebuilding Mavs have the cap space to sign LeBron James outright. 

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Dennis Smith Jr.

SG:	Wes Matthews

SF:	LeBron James / Doug McDermott

PF:	Harrison Barnes

C:	Dirk Nowitzki / # 5 pick Jaren Jackson Jr.

*how they do with LeBron*

This new look Mavs team would be a hodgepodge of the young and the old in a way that may not be to their benefit. LeBron may actually murder shot-happy Dennis Smith Jr. by midseason. So while I like the fit with Wes Matthews and Harrison Barnes, I foresee a stumbling 46 win season here, and a R1 loss to New Orleans. Again, the team may have considered trading their young talent for vets, but their GM Zandrick got too lazy to look around for offers.

**Denver Nuggets**

*how they get LeBron*

Maxed out, the Denver Nuggets would need to figure out a trade package. Paul Millsap ($30M) may still be seen as a slight asset, so let's give him the benefit of the doubt here and make that the offer. The Cavs would presumably flip Millsap elsewhere after.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Jamal Murray

SG:	Gary Harris 

SF:	LeBron James

PF:	Wilson Chandler / Kenneth Faried

C:	Nikola Jokic / Mason Plumlee

*how they do with LeBron*

The offense around LeBron James may be deadly here. Jamal Murray in particular is on the verge of breaking out, and could be an ideal spacer for LeBron. I'll pencil the Nuggets in for 54 wins and a # 4 seed in the tough West, where they draw a tough matchup with Golden State in R2. Unfortunately, there may be too many limitations on defense (especially with Nikola Jokic) to get past that barrier. 4-2 Warriors.

**Detroit Pistons**

*how they get LeBron*

Maxed out, the Pistons need to work a trade here. Given Blake Griffin's bloated salary and history of injuries, it'd be hard to convince a team to take his contract on. Fortunately for them, this is a silly exercise so they manage to sweet talk Dan Gilbert into making it happen (with the intention to flip him elsewhere.)

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Reggie Jackson / Ish Smith

SG:	Luke Kennard 

SF:	Reggie Bullock

PF:	LeBron James

C:	Andre Drummond

*how they do with LeBron*

With a big man rebounder down low and decent spacing on the wings, the recipe appears there for a solid LeBron team. Again, I'd pencil them in around 48 wins and the 4 seed in the East. The question when it comes to the playoffs would be Reggie Jackson, and whether he can provide the (efficient) complementary scoring to help push them through the tougher teams in the conference. I doubt it. A bitter R2 loss.

**Golden State Warriors**

*how they get LeBron*

With nearly $130M committed in salary, we have to consider a trade here. The only realistic scenario would be to offer Draymond Green or Klay Thompson (with Andre Iguodala attached.) Both would be difficult losses to overcome, but the Cavs push for Klay Thompson and get him. Harsh. But necessary.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Stephen Curry

SG:	Nick Young / Shaun Livingston 

SF:	Kevin Durant

PF:	LeBron James

C:	Draymond Green / Jordan Bell

*how they do with LeBron*

Losing Klay Thompson would sting badly. For a while. In fact, it may take these new look Warriors some time to find their rhythm, giving them a ""disappointing"" 64 wins on the year. But by the time the playoffs roll around, they find their groove and show just how dominant their superstar trio can be; after all, these may be the top overall 3 players in the entire NBA. The Warriors CRUSH the playoff competition, going 16-2 en route to an easy NBA title.

**Houston Rockets**

*how they get LeBron*

The Rockets have about $20M or so in free space, and would have about $10M more if they stretch Ryan Anderson and Nene. Is that enough to land LeBron? Not really. But hey, maybe LeBron would be so determined to beat Golden State that he'd agree to a discount. Even if Chris Paul and Clint Capela did the same and the team let Trevor Ariza walk, the luxury tax would be obscene. But hey, that's the price of chasing history.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Chris Paul

SG:	James Harden / Eric Gordon 

SF:	LeBron James

PF:	P.J. Tucker

C:	Clint Capela

*how they do with LeBron*

We're *stretching* to find a way to squeeze LeBron James onto this team, but that Dhalsim-level yoga paid off with a three-headed monster that would have lineup balance to boot. The Rockets win 66 games and square off in an epic showdown with the Golden State Warriors. And here, they squeak it out 4-3! From there, Houston crushes Boston 4-1 in the Finals and wins the title.

**Indiana Pacers**

*how they get LeBron*

The Pacers have about $25M in cap room and can make some moves (encouraging Thaddeus Young to leave or trading him, declining Lance Stephenson/Al Jefferson) to sneak LeBron onto the roster.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Darren Collison / Cory Joseph

SG:	Victor Oladipo 

SF:	Bojan Bogdanovic

PF:	LeBron James

C:	Myles Turner / Domatas Sabonis

*how they do with LeBron*

While Victor Oladipo may be the ideal secondary scorer to take pressure off LeBron James, he doesn't exactly have the ideal skill set to play alongside him (unless he shoots as well as he did in 2017-18). As a result, this team finishes with 52 wins and a disappointing # 3 seed. They power up and best the Sixers in R2, but stumble and lose 4-2 to Boston in the Eastern Conference Finals.

**Los Angeles Clippers**

*how they get LeBron*

Maxed out, the Clippers will need to get creative to find a LeBron James trade that makes sense from Cleveland's perspective. They can package Tobias Harris ($15M), Austin Rivers ($12M), and draft picks to make it happen. 

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Patrick Beverly / Milos Teodosic

SG:	Louis Williams 

SF:	LeBron James

PF:	Danilo Gallinari 

C:	DeAndre Jordan

*how they do with LeBron*

Trading for LeBron (and extending DeAndre Jordan) will hurt the Clippers in terms of their depth. So while I love the idea of Patrick Beverly being an attack dog 3+D PG, there may not be enough defense on the wings to help this team get over the hump. The LeBron Clippers win 51 games, but stumble in R2 of the playoffs.

**Los Angeles Lakers**

*how they get LeBron*

Magic Johnson and the Lakers have as much cap space as any team, bolstering $60M+ in the bank. They can certainly sign LeBron James to a max, but the question is: what else? Let's go for the gusto here. They can ALSO sign Paul George and maybe even work a sign and trade for DeMarcus Cousins if they attach some younger assets like Kyle Kuzma and Julius Randle to make the math work.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Lonzo Ball

SG:	Paul George

SF:	Brandon Ingram

PF:	LeBron James 

C:	DeMarcus Cousins

*how they do with LeBron*

While this may be a star-studded team, they would have to rely on a few youngsters in Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram who may not be ready for prime time yet. As a result, the 55-win Lakers roll into the playoffs with massive expectations, only to get the boot by Houston in R2. However, if Ball and Ingram can keep improving, this may have the look of a juggernaut in 2019 and beyond.

**Memphis Grizzlies**

*how they get LeBron*

With $100M in salaries committed, the Grizzlies would struggle to find a way to land LeBron James. They can't simply offer Chandler Parsons' massive contract, because no one wants that. However, if they did attach the # 4 pick along with that? That would be enough for the rebuilding Cavs to accept a bunch of dead weight. 

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Mike Conley

SG:	Ben McLemore 

SF:	LeBron James

PF:	JaMychal Green 

C:	Marc Gasol

*how they do with LeBron*

You can't find a steadier trio than Mike Conley + LeBron James + Marc Gasol, although the supporting cast would be questionable beyond that (re-signing Tyreke Evans may help.) The team has a strong regular season with 53 wins, but doesn't have enough switchable pieces to handle the Golden State Warriors, who knock them off 4-2 in R2. 

**Miami Heat**

*how they get LeBron*

The Miami Heat have one of the highest payrolls in the league with $120M+ committed, and would have a hard time finding appealing matching salaries in a trade. For their sake, let's say the Cavs are generous and accept a package of Goran Dragic, Justise Winslow, and returning hero Dion Waiters.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Tyler Johnson

SG:	Josh Richardson / Dwyane Wade 

SF:	LeBron James

PF:	James Johnson / Kelly Olynyk 

C:	Hassan Whiteside

*how they do with LeBron*

This rugged Miami Heat bunch would have a good amount of size, defense, and swagger. So while I'm only projecting they win 53 games (and land the # 3 seed) in the regular season, they'd be able to crank up that intensity and push hard in the playoffs. They battle back and forth with Boston in the ECF, eventually getting knocked out in a decisive Game 7.

**Milwaukee Bucks**

*how they get LeBron*

Another maxed out team that will need to find a workable sign and trade, the Milwaukee Bucks do have salaries to offer back. A deal for Tony Snell ($10M), Thon Maker, and FA Jabari Parker may be able the heart of a deal that makes sense for both sides,

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Eric Bledsoe / Malcolm Brogdon

SG:	Khris Middleton 

SF:	LeBron James 

PF:	Giannis Antetounkmpo

C:	John Henson

*how they do with LeBron*

So much for Greek Freaks -- this may be Mount Olympus. LeBron James and Giannis together wouldn't have much spacing to speak of, but the length and athleticism would be frightening. The team finishes with 59 wins and only a # 2 seed in the East because it may take some getting used to. That said, they'd have huge upside and enough talent to knock off Boston and advance to the Finals. There, they trade punches with Golden State but ultimately have a few lapses that lead to an epic 4-3 loss. Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither was Zeus' victory over the Kronos and the Titans.

**Minnesota Vikings**

*how they get LeBron*

The Wolves don't have the cap room to sign LeBron James outright, so they need to find a workable sign and trade. And here, they get creative. They get Dan Gilbert drunk and angry enough to agree to Andrew Wiggins, citing him as the fated savior of Cleveland from the start.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Jeff Teague

SG:	Jimmy Butler

SF:	LeBron James 

PF:	Taj Gibson

C:	Karl-Anthony Towns / Gorgui Dieng

*how they do with LeBron*

This team looks loaded on paper -- not only with veterans, but with tough and rugged defenders. The Thibodeau T-Wolves beat up on the competition with 63 wins and a # 2 seed, which allows them to advance to the WCF against Golden State. There, Thibs attempts to bring back ""Bully Bull"" to knock the Warriors off balance. Unfortunately for them, they can't match the consistent shooting of the Warriors, who win 4-2 in a great series.

**New Orleans Pelicans**

*how they get LeBron*

Capped out, the Pelicans have two choices: center a package around Jrue Holiday or a sign and trade DeMarcus Cousins. In terms of ""fit,"" you'd rather trade Boogie. But unfortunately for them, they don't control his rights. As a result, the team decides to send Jrue Holiday+Nikola Mirotic for LeBron, after which Boogie agrees to come back.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Rajon Rondo / Ian Clark

SG:	E'Twaun Moore 

SF:	LeBron James / Solomon Hill

PF:	Anthony Davis

C:	DeMarcus Cousins

*how they do with LeBron*

The size and skill of the new Pelicans frontcourt would be overwhelming, and potentially wreck the smallball NBA. The team racks up a 63 win season and a # 2 seed. Heading into the playoffs, the team feels like they have a great chance against Golden State with their ability to dominate on the glass. Unfortunately, they don't get that chance. Houston stuns them with superior guard play and chemistry, winning a shocker 4-2 in R2

**New York Knicks**

*how they get LeBron*

With no cap room, the Knicks need to work out an appealing trade package. They convince Dan Gilbert in the merits of Tim Hardaway + Enes Kanter, with an assist from the league office, which ""encourages"" the deal to help the New York market.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Frank Ntikilina / Trey Burke

SG:	Courtney Lee 

SF:	LeBron James 

PF:	Kristaps Porzingis / Lance Thomas

C:	# 7 pick Wendell Carter Jr.

*how they do with LeBron*

The fit with Porzingis (a true stretch big) and his buddy coach David Fizdale would be ideal, but the rest of the roster leaves a lot to be desired. It would be a rocky road for LeBron all season long, with a 44-38 record and a # 6 seed. For the first time, the Toronto Raptors get the better of the King, knocking them off 4-3 in R1.

**Oklahoma City Thunder**

*how they get LeBron*

With no cap room, Sam Presti needs to work out a trade. His only real options may be a package of Andre Roberson + Steven Adams, or a superstar in Russell Westbrook. Given the thin roster, Presti decides on dealing Westbrook and offering the angry local fans a free LeBron jersey to make up for it. On the bright side, Paul George happily re-ups with the team. 

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Ray Felton / FA Mario Chalmers

SG:	Andre Roberson 

SF:	Paul George 

PF:	LeBron James / Carmelo Anthony

C:	Steven Adams

*how they do with LeBron*

The huge hole at PG creates some real issues for the team all season long, but they make up for it with excellent defense from 2-5. LeBron works as a de facto PG and wins MVP by leading the team to 58 wins and a # 3 seed. Unfortunately, the more balanced and experienced (in their system) Rockets knock them off 4-3 in R2.

**Orlando Magic**

*how they get LeBron*

With nearly $20M in cap space, the Orlando Magic are fairly close to being in range for LeBron James, but wouldn't be able to offer him the max he seeks. Instead, they package together Nikola Vuevic and S&amp;T FA Aaron Gordon to make the deal happen. 

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	# 6 pick Trae Young / D.J. Augustin

SG:	Evan Fournier 

SF:	LeBron James 

PF:	Jonathan Isaac

C:	Bismack Biyombo

*how they do with LeBron*

Again we see a mix of LeBron + some youngsters, as the Magic struggle to get rookie Trae Young and Jonathan Isaac up to speed for a title run. The team wins a solid 47 games, but gets upset in R1. Magic fans grumble to Zan, wondering what the heck he's doing as GM. Although in Mr. Ellison's defense, Trae Young and Isaac should be a great pair to build around in the future.

**Philadelphia 76ers**

*how they get LeBron*

With cap room this summer, the Sixers should be able to sign LeBron James outright. In fact, they may even have room to bring back J.J. Redick, whom presumably wouldn't mind taking a haircut to chase a title.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Ben Simmons

SG:	J.J. Redick / Markelle Fultz 

SF:	Robert Covington 

PF:	LeBron James / Dario Saric

C:	Joel Embiid / # 10 pick Robert Williams

*how they do with LeBron*

While the spacing would not be ideal, the sheer size and athleticism of this unit would overwhelm the NBA. LeBron + the young pups crush it with 63 wins, grabbing the # 2 seed in the East and setting up an epic showdown against Kyrie Irving and Boston. The trouble here may be whether or not LeBron James is an ideal ""fit"" alongside Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid, a scoring center unlike any he's had before. Trying to figure that out on the fly with two youngsters may lead to inconsistent play, which allows Brad Stevens and Boston to beat them 4-3. On the plus side, an epic rivalry will develop between the two squads.

**Phoenix Suns**

*how they get LeBron*

With around $20M in cap space, the team may be able to squeeze enough room together to sign LeBron James outright. Offering their # 16 pick may allow them to shed Brandon Knight's salary, for example.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Elfrid Payton

SG:	Devin Booker 

SF:	T.J. Warren / Josh Jackson 

PF:	LeBron James / Jared Dudley

C:	# 1 pick DeAndre Ayton / Tyson Chandler

*how they do with LeBron*

The fit between LeBron James and a shooter like Devin Booker would be ideal, although there are some clunkier chemistry issues elsewhere as neither T.J. Warren nor Josh Jackson have that same spacing ability. That, coupled with a teenage center in DeAndre Ayton, leads to some growing pains. A 48 win season culminates in a R1 loss in the tough West.

**Portland Trail Blazers**

*how they get LeBron*

With $110M committed, Neil Olshey will have to work out a trade with Cleveland, ideally without breaking up his superstar backcourt. He could offer assets like Zach Collins, Al-Farouq Aminu, and hope that the Cavs would take back Evan Turner ($17M) to help make the math work. Does it? Sure why not. This is a made up exercise anyway. Maybe the team can involve RFA Jusuf Nurkic in a sign and trade to push it over the top.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Damian Lillard

SG:	C.J. McCollum 

SF:	Moe Harkless 

PF:	LeBron James

C:	Ed Davis / Meyers Leonard

*how they do with LeBron*

If the Blazers can actually acquire LeBron James AND keep their star guards, then they'd be a force to be reckoned with out West. After being a soft # 3 seed last year, LeBron pushes them up to 59 wins and a legit super team. There may be some doubts about their big men, but LeBron + shooting allows the team to beat Houston 4-2 in R2 before taking on Golden State in R3. Again, trying to figure out the chemistry issues in one season may be difficult against a more experienced and more defensive-minded Golden State squad, causing them to lose a heartbreaker, 4-3.

**Sacramento Kings**

*how they get LeBron*

With nearly $40M in cap room, Vlade Divac can essentially sign LeBron James outright. 

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	De’Aaron Fox

SG:	Buddy Hield / Iman Shumpert 

SF:	# 2 pick Luka Doncic / Bogdan Bogdanovic 

PF:	LeBron James

C:	Willie Cauley-Stein / Harry Giles

*how they do with LeBron*

This would be an awkward fit because the Kings are essentially all young talent while the actual ""King"" would want to win now. A trade for veterans may be in the cards here -- with the # 2 pick being a heck of a carrot to offer. Sacramento decides to play it out at first, but regrets their laziness when they stumble with a 44-38 record and get bounced in R1. That said, the roster composition should make sense once the kids develop. This may be a title team down the road.

**San Antonio Spurs**

*how they get LeBron*

The Spurs would need to figure out a trade scenario to the Cavs' liking, which may be difficult without including Kawhi Leonard or LaMarcus Aldridge. Best case, they may be able to cobble together an offer with Patty Mills, Pau Gasol, and a Kyle Anderson sign and trade. It wouldn't be enough to make it worth Cleveland's while, but perhaps the Spurs could push it through by including the # 18 pick and future R1 picks.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Dejounte Murray

SG:	Danny Green 

SF:	Kawhi Leonard 

PF:	LeBron James

C:	LaMarcus Aldridge

*how they do with LeBron*

If the Spurs could actually pull this roster off, it may be close to unbeatable. They have spacing, size, and great defenders on the wing. And of course, a great coach in Gregg Popovich. As a result, the team cruises to 66 wins in the regular season and the # 1 seed. But the big question is... could they top Golden State? The Warriors still may have more talent, but Pop's slight edge in terms of tactics over Steve Kerr may allow them to squeak out a 4-3 win. From there, the Spurs roll on to beat Boston 4-2 in the Finals.

**Toronto Raptors**

*how they get LeBron*

Capped out, Masai Ujiri will need to find a workable trade package. There may be some way to make the math work with Jonas Valanciunas and a hodgepodge of young talent, but the clearest path would be a straight up deal for DeMar DeRozan. DeRozan's youth makes him a more appealing asset than Kyle Lowry, although neither have a huge amount of trade value given their salaries.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Kyle Lowry 

SG:	C.J. Miles / Delon Wright

SF:	LeBron James / O.G. Anunoby

PF:	Serge Ibaka

C:	Jonas Valanciunas / Jakob Poeltl

*how they do with LeBron*

Despite joining a 59 win team, LeBron James may not be able to reverse the sagging momentum of this club. War dogs Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka are on the decline, and big Jonas Valanciunas may be not be a natural fit as a LeBron center either. There's still enough talent and depth here to crank out 60 wins and slug through to the ECF, where they enter as underdogs against Boston. Here, new coach Nick Nurse wisely switches to a faster lineup (with Ibaka or Poeltl at center), allowing them to win a 4-3 battle. But alas, they don't have quite enough to compete with Golden State, losing 4-2 in the Finals.

**Utah Jazz**

*how they get LeBron*

With only $15-20M in space, the Utah Jazz resort to a trade as well. There may be a path forward in that regard, perhaps with Ricky Rubio ($14M), Alec Burks ($11M) as a throw in, and a sign and trade with Dante Exum and Derrick Favors.

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	Donovan Mitchell

SG:	Jae Crowder

SF:	Joe Ingles

PF:	LeBron James

C:	Rudy Gobert

*how they do with LeBron*

The roster looks primed for success here, with a complementary scorer in Donovan Mitchell to take the pressure off, and a defensive force down low in Rudy Gobert, not to mention a glue guy in Joe Ingles and a top notch coach in Quin Snyder. As a result, the Jazz roar to 62 wins and a # 2 seed. The question in a matchup between them and Golden State would be whether Mitchell can shoot consistently well from deep, and whether Gobert can stay on the court. The doubt about both result in a stinging 4-2 loss to the Warriors in the WCF. 

**Washington Wizards**

*how they get LeBron*

While they may be capped out, the Wizards have a fairly easy path to make this math work. They would need to trade one of their ""big three,"" with Otto Porter being the most obvious candidate. The Cavs would likely agree to take the young wing on despite his hefty price tag, even with some cap filler attached. 

*the LeBron lineup*

PG:	John Wall

SG:	Bradley Beal

SF:	LeBron James / Kelly Oubre

PF:	Markieff Morris

C:	Marcin Gortat / Ian Mahinmi

*how they do with LeBron*

The Wizards' strong starting five only gets better with LeBron James taking charge. He'd be a dream fit with Bradley Beal, although it may take some more time to work out the chemistry with a lead dog like John Wall. As a result, we'll peg them for 57 wins in the regular season and a # 2 seed. They storm into the battle with the favored Boston Celtics with an alpha dog mentality and no fear, allowing them to pull off the upset 4-2 win as they go small to match up. But against Golden State, the sleeker and cleaner-fit Warriors win a tough series, 4-2.

**OVERALL**

This may be inexact science (at best), but it does demonstrate how hard it will be to win the title no matter where LeBron James goes next year. Golden State is still absurdly good, and Boston will be a tough ""out"" in the East.

According to this exercise, LeBron James would lose in R1 with 8 teams, lose in R2 with 9 teams, lose in the Conference Finals with 6 teams, lose in the Finals with 4 teams, and win the title with 3 (Golden State, Houston, San Antonio.)

[This](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/563isl/me_27f_in_a_relationship_with_36m_for_8_years/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=u_strawberry-) was my original post. 

Clearly, it's been a wild time since this post for me. I just want to thank everyone for reaching out to me in comments, messages, and even some off-reddit contact I still have with some users! You all are gems and offered me tough advice in a time where I never thought I'd listen. 

I realize now I was completely manipulated by Ray for many years. I thought our relationship was common for two creative professionals. It **WASN'T.** 

After I made that post, Ray was ""needed"" out in California again. It was the perfect opportunity for me to pack up all my shit and leave. Once I collected my thoughts, I reached out to my long-time friend John (actually my age, now 30, who lived in Portland at the time.) He flew out to the east coast city I used to live in with fancy maple syrup, whisky, and my favorite coffee. I'll always remember this little detail. John helped me pack up everything, arranged transportation for me to fly back with him (and my cat) to live in Oregon with him, and brought me to the coast to bury a bunch of memories (photos, film reels, memory cards, etc). It was extremely cathartic. I was sober, feeling every bit of pain in that moment, but realizing it needed to happen. 

Once in Portland, Ray obviously came back to our former apartment and realized I was gone. Per John's idea, the only thing I left on the kitchen counter was my set of keys and a printed out picture of Cat with the engagement ring. I had blocked his number, but Ray continuously tried to contact me, first in fake consideration for my safety, then getting progressively angrier with me. He did not apologize a single time. He just got more threatening and said he was going to hire a private investigator to find me. John ended up hiring a lawyer for me to walk me through my legal options and spoke to the police about a restraining order, which we did file. It appears the order worked, considering Ray has not reached out to me since he was notified. 

I know some of you probably wanted me to tell Cat. I'll be honest, I never did. I'm sure she eventually found out, or maybe she didn't. I have no idea what happened with them, and I have no urge to. You were all correct; I had known some of his friends, but only professionally from working with them. He rarely took me out to social events. I did know his family, though. They were always pleasantly nice to me, but they lived so far away geographically that I only saw them for very special occasions. I don't know if they knew, but I don't want to hurt myself thinking about the disrespect and secrecy of everyone. I was lied to not only by Ray, but by a group of people who I thought respected me. 

I found a therapist who helped me process a great deal of these emotions, but I am certainly not completely healed. I finally feel able to talk about this with you all 1.5 years later. It simultaneously feels like it happened just yesterday and a million years ago. Some of it feels like an extended nightmare. All I know is that I'm awake now. 

Unfortunately, I did end up getting tested and diagnosed with HPV, which has since been treated, but I definitely got it from Ray. I was arrested that night for disorderly conduct as well because I got belligerently drunk in anger. I was sentenced to anger management classes and AA meetings. I was certainly not an full-blown alcoholic, but I realized I was numbing my pain with what I thought was recreational drinking. I have been sober for a year now, just got my year chip last week!!!

Overall, this is a happy ending for me, I promise. 

I started dating John at the beginning of this year. I now understand what being in an actual loving relationship feels like. John is completely honest with me about everything, even the smallest things. He respects me and understands my past. I can't begin to verbalize how thankful I am for him and how much I appreciate him being in my life. He is my rock and was there for me since my healing process began. 

For the record, I'm the one who initiated the romantic contact. We slept in separate rooms, had sex with other people, gave each other romantic advice. But at the beginning of the year, we were both single at the same time. He was making breakfast in the kitchen before he went off to teach. In that moment, I just realized he was always my ""what-if"" guy, since knowing him in college. I wanted him, and I truly loved him. I asked him if I could kiss him, just overcome with emotion and a lost filter. He thought I was joking at first and barely looked away from his eggs. But then he was like, ""Wait, really?"" I said yes and gave him a huge hug, then he kissed me. I felt this warmth I never experienced with Ray, even at our best. It felt like something finally clicked. 

Since then, John and I have been so happy, and now I know what it's like to be with your best friend, especially someone who knows you as well as he knows me. I couldn't be happier, and for the first time, I feel valuable. 

I went back to school part-time to learn some coding and stuck with it. Now, my current job is paying for me to continue my schooling, and I've been doing some web design work for them as well. My boss is the most amazing woman I've ever met and totally supportive. 

Guys, I feel whole. I really do. But even more importantly, I feel ready to deal with anything in my future, good or bad. I've grown up in a big way, and I feel like I'm not afraid of entering my 30's. I still have a way to go dealing with an eating disorder, but I've even gained some weight! I'm proud of myself, and I'm so thankful to everyone who has helped me at all. I'm not alone anymore. 

Thank you for reading.

**TL;DR;** : I am okay now after being severely cheated on.

I teach social work at Portland State University and internal medicine at Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland, Oregon.  There's a lot of talk about autism in children, but not as much about autism among adults.  That's why we just launched this new academic journal. Our goal is to cover the most pressing issues affecting autistic adults, from emerging adulthood to later life. I am particularly excited about including autistic adults in our new journal - as editorial board members, authors, reviewers and readers. As a doctor and a services researcher, my own research is focused on how people on the autism spectrum can get better access to health care services. Many autistic adults don't get the health care they need, resulting in more health problems and shorter life expectancy.  Ask me anything about the new journal or the ways that people on the autism spectrum can get better care. 

We'll be on at 1 p.m. Pacific (4 PM ET, 21 UT), we're looking forward to the session!

samtaylor92,2018-05-17 23:53:46+00:00,Why LeBron would sign with every NBA team,"**Atlanta Hawks**

LeBron is secretly a huge Twister fan. He will join the Hawks so he can film Twister 2 with their owner’s wife on their off days.

**Boston Celtics**

LeBron misses Kyrie. He wants to play basketball with his friend and that means playing for the Celtics.

OR

LeBron wants to troll Kyrie. He will go to Boston management and ask them to trade Kyrie back to Cleveland if they want him to join. Danny Ainge will agree because he has no heart.

**Brooklyn Nets**

LeBron loves NY. He will go to New York to sign with the Knicks to play in historic Madison Square Garden. However, during the drive to the stadium, his driver makes a wrong turn and they end up in Brooklyn. LeBron realizes the mistake, but shrugs his shoulders and signs with the Nets instead, because he will have the same results with either the Knicks or Nets.


**Charlotte Hornets**

LeBron wants to prove he’s better than Michael Jordan. He will sign with the Hornets to taunt MJ directly. He will win the Finals in 2019 with the Hornets and won’t let MJ touch the trophy. After the season, LeBron will buy out MJ’s shares and he will become majority owner. He will then trade himself to a better team because Dwight is too annoying and nobody will agree to LeBron’s trade proposals involving Dwight.

**Chicago Bulls**

LeBron wants to prove he’s better than Michael Jordan. He will sign with the Bulls so he can win 7 championships to pass what MJ did.


**Cleveland Cavaliers**

LeBron loves Cleveland as much as he hates moving. LeBron will re-sign with the Cavs, because it’s more convenient than moving to a different city.

**Dallas Mavericks**

LeBron is still haunted by the 2011 Finals. He will go to Dallas to learn from the true GOAT Dirk Nowitzki. There, LeBron will lead the Mavs all the way to the number 1 seed in the West, only to lose to the Warriors in the first round after KD leaves for India to re-join his snek charmer friend.

**Denver Nuggets**

LeBron loves chicken nuggets. He will sign with Denver, only to be disappointed. He then will retire and start his own chicken nugget company.

**Detroit Pistons**

LeBron will become the new Pistons President of Basketball Operations. His first act in his new role will be to sign himself as the head coach/starting SF. His second transaction will be to trade Blake Griffin to the Cavs for the 8th pick in the draft and salary filler, because LeBron will blackmail Dan Gilbert into doing it.

**Golden State Warriors**

LeBron wants all the ringz. He will sign with the Warriors for the veteran minimum so he can win not 1, not 2, not 3, not 4, not 5, not 6, not 7, not 8, not 9, but 10 championships.

**Houston Rockets**

LeBron loves space. He will sign with the Rockets so he can go to NASA and fly an actual rocket into space to find better competition on other planets. Mike Dan Tony will be confused why LeBron doesn’t show up to their games. Mike, he’s in space, deal with it.

**Indiana Pacers**

LeBron loves pace. He will sign with the Pacers so he can out-pace the other NBA players and win a championship. He will also become best friends with Lance Stephenson and the two will call out plays to each other by blowing in each other’s rear, I mean ear.

**LA Clippers**

LeBron wants to live in Hollywood, but doesn’t want to be under the shadow of Laker greats. If he can just lead the Clippers to the conference finals, they would rename their franchise LeBron’s Clippers.

**LA Lakers**

LeBron wants to live in Hollywood, but doesn’t want to be under the shadow of Clipper goods. He also wants to learn from the great Lavar Ball on how to play basketball as good as him.

**Memphis Grizzlies**

LeBron will not sign with the Memphis Grizzlies.

**Miami Heat**

LeBron will go back to Miami because he left his white headband there and wants it back.

**Milwaukee Bucks**

LeBron loves freaks. He will join the Greek Freak and sign with the Bucks. Then they will sign Rick James to preform every halftime so he can sing LeBron’s favorite song “Super Freak”

**Minnesota Timberwolves**

LeBron wants to learn from former MVP Derrick Rose. He also wants to torture his body and allow Coach Thibs to play him all 48 minutes for all 82 games.

**New Orleans Pelicans**

LeBron loves smoothies. He will join the Brow and sign with the Pelicans, so he can get unlimited smoothies at the Smoothie King Center.

**New York Knicks**

LeBron loves NY. He will go to New York to sign with the Knicks to play in historic Madison Square Garden. During the drive to the stadium, his driver makes the correct turn and they end up in MSG. LeBron realizes this and signs with the Knicks.

**OKC Thunder**

LeBron will sign with the Thunder so he can play with Russell Westbrook for one season, then leave after that and become an even better player.

**Orlando Magic**

LeBron will take his talents to Central Florida. He will sign with the Magic and lead them to another Finals lost.

**Philadelphia 76ers**

LeBron will sign with the 76ers because he trusts the process. LeBron will single handedly play bad for 3 seasons and tank so that the 76ers will get more draft picks to add to their squad. Then by age 37, LeBron will have what he needs to win another Eastern Conference Finals.

**Phoenix Suns**

LeBron loves hot-related teams. He will sign with the Suns and win 2 championships to prove to Pat Riley that he isn’t so special with his so called “Heat” for the “Suns” are the hottest thing in the universe.

**Portland Trail Blazers**

LeBron loves Nike. He will sign with the Blazers so that he can spend his off days at Nike headquarters creating new shoes.

**Sacramento Kings**

LeBron is the King. He will sign with the Kings, because that’s where he belongs.

**San Antonio Spurs**

LeBron loves Coach Pop. He will sign with the Spurs to learn from him, only to find out Coach Pop actually has no idea what he’s doing and is just really lucky. LeBron will use that luck to convince Kawhy? To stay and they will win a championship every other year in 2019, 2021, and 2023.

**Toronto Raptors**

LeBron will sign with the Raptors just to check up on them and make sure they are ok.

**Utah Jazz**

LeBron loves jazz. He will sign with Utah only to find out they don’t actually have jazz. He will then force a trade to New Orleans to be close to real jazz and because he remembered that he loves smoothies.

**Washington Wizards**

LeBron loves politics. He will sign with the Wizards so he can play basketball and also become the next president of the United States in 2020.",nba,23218
emoti0n,2018-05-16 15:28:37+00:00,"Billy King traded away picks that ended up being used for Alec Burks, Damian Lillard, Draymond Green, Jaylen Brown, &amp; Jayson Tatum","Feb. 23, 2011: Acquired Deron Williams from Utah for Derrick Favors, Devin Harris, two first-round draft picks and cash. This was considered a decent trade at the time, as Williams was one of the league’s top two point guards, along with Chris Paul. And as we all know, this trade was ultimately a disaster. Williams was an overpaid malcontent who ended up taking a buyout last summer after fleecing the Nets for a max deal. Favors has been increasingly productive as his career with the Jazz has evolved and is now considered one of the best PFs in the league. Harris remains in the league, though he is on the bench behind Williams in Dallas. Utah used the Nets’ No. 1 pick in 2011 to select Alec Burks, who remains a member of its young core.

Feb. 23, 2011: Acquired Dan Gadzuric and Brandan Wright from Golden State for Murphy and a second-round pick, which the Warriors used to select Draymond Green. Wright played in only 16 games for the Nets, who decided to let him leave as a free agent. The journeyman center has remained in the league ever since. Gadzuric also was let go after appearing in just 14 games for the Nets. His final stop the next season was New York, where he appeared in two games for the Knicks.

March 15, 2012: Acquired Gerald Wallace from Portland for Mehmet Okur, Shawne Williams and the Nets’ No. 1 pick, which Portland used to select Damian Lillard. King put top-three protection on the pick, but the Nets finished with the sixth-worst record in the league, and the Trail Blazers got themselves a stud who actually became worthy of the max contract he received. So in the space of 11 months, King gave up the picks that were used on Draymond Green and Damian Lillard.

Acquired Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Jason Terry, D.J. White and a 2017 second-round draft pick from the Boston Celtics for Keith Bogans, Kris Humphries, Kris Joseph, Gerald Wallace, MarShon Brooks, three first-round picks (2014 – James Young, 2016 and 2018) and the right to swap first-round selections in 2017. It will take years to figure out exactly how bad this trade ends up, but we know this much: The Nets are going to stink for the rest of this season and each of the next two seasons, and the Celtics can build a dynasty with Brooklyn’s draft picks if the lottery ping-pong balls bounce the right way. If there is ever a sequel to the Ted Stepien Rule, it will be known as the Billy King Rule.

kittietitties,2018-05-11 19:07:42+00:00,Dwight Howard: Your Teams Ticket to the NBA Finals,"Hello r/nba I know what all of you are thinking. ""What is our team missing that can put us over the top?"". Well the Charlotte Hornets are in a bit of a pickle in that we are trying to rebuild so we want superstar Dwight Howard to be able to be on a team that allows him to carry you yes you to glory! I know some people might think we are crazy for wanting to trade him, but our mistakes can be your opportunity! I know his play does all of the talking for him, but for the heck of it I'll tell ya why your team needs Dwight Howard.

Atlanta Hawks: I mean this is really a no brainer. You guys maybe made the mistake of trading him to us initially, but now you can atone for your sins and welcome in the second homecoming of Dwight Howard! John Collins gets to learn from the best while watching from the bench and seeing Howard DOMINATE the competition and the set the city of Atlanta on fire like it's 1864.

Boston Celtics: Big Al? More like (there's only one big Al and that's Al Jefferson you fucks don't take the small light of my life away from me"" big ol boring goober. Howard gets the boards and the girls and could easily rock that Bostonian accent. 

Brooklyn Nets: Tired of only being in the national spotlight when Boston picks in the draft? No longer will that be the case as Howard cuddles the hearts of every man, woman, and child across the globe with his silly antics such as missing free throws (totally on purpose) and having quick friendly wrestling matches with the opposing teams point guard.

Chicago Bulls: Show Adam Silver that you are totally not tanking anymore by throwing the max at Dwight Howard. Relive the days of Jordan as you watch Howard drain midrange fade aways and use his massive shoulders and arms to ""create space"" for those sweet sweet jumpers.

Cleveland Cavaliers: Kevin Love is pretty hecking lame am I right fellas? What you need is someone who is way bigger and better looking than sweet baby Kevin that will still take all the exact same shots as him while at the same time improving team chemistry! You guessed it Dwight Howard.

Dallas Mavericks: I'm pretty sure you and the Rockets are rivals I guess, but there's no better way to embarrasses your rivals then by taking their all time best player and making him your own! You'll be sipping on Rockets fans tears as you watch Howard them for years to come my friends.

Denver Nuggets: I'll be straight with you fellers...you have too much young talent and absolutely no veteran leadership. How are you going to handle clutch situations against the likes of the great Timberwolves? You need someone who only elevates their game in those moments. Someone who's not scared to keep the ball in their hands for the final shot because they know they are the best player on the team. Dwight. Howard.

Detroit Pistons: The glory days of violence and dirty plays may be behind you, but that doesn't mean you can't get back to those better days. You can think of Howard as the time machine that gets you back there! Howard is a master intimidator! Unnecessary techs that will instill fear in the hearts of your enemies? Check! Fouls at the end of the shot clock to send a message that your team is not be trifled with? Check! Someone who is not afraid to stay in the paint for half the shot clock because rules are for nerds? Check!

Golden State Warrior's: I like your style in building a super team that leaves no chance for any other team to win the championship, but I can't help but notice you forgot to replace your center with an all star. It's alright we all make little mistakes from time to time, but here's your chance to finally fill in that last little scratch in your armor. Tired of everyone hating on your team well you can kiss that goodbye as Howard creates a perfect 360 degree spin to your public perception.

Houston Rockets: There is no denying that there is great chemistry between Paul and Harden, but it's obvious Harden can not be completely happy again without his best friend on the team.  If you care about Hardens happiness you will bring back Howard and let that weak no shoulders cappella walk to another team like us. 

Indiana Pacers: I'm so happy for you guys! Everybody counted you out, but you played hard and showed that you can still be a force in this league. If you want to keep your momentum then you need Dwight ""LeBron Stopper"" Howard. 

LA Clippers: How can Deandre Jordan be elite in this league if he hasn't raised multiple children? The miracle of child birth is a competitive advantage that only Howard knows how to utilize.

LA Lakers: Do you guys remember how great the Kobe Bryant farewell tour was? What if I told you every season can be like that, but with Dwight Howard instead! Dreams do come true.

Memphis Grizzlies: Here's your opportunity to get rid of Marc Gasoline who ruins chemistry and replace him with the lovable Dwight Howard!

Miami Heat: Having Hassan Whiteside is pretty awesome right? Well what about having TWO Hassan Whitesides?!?!?

Milwaukee Bucks: I agree with you guys that making free throws is for losers who are not good enough to make the shot through contact. Dwight Howard thinks that as well and he's big and stuff

Minnesota Timberwolves: You are excused since Howard has not played for the Bulls

New Orleans Pelicans: Hey remember when you guys got the number one pick and drafted Anthony Davis even though our team had the worst record of all time and our fan base was but a babe in the woods? You stole my happiness.

New York Knicks: There's not many people who can fill the hole that Carmelo left while at the same time being able to handle the New York media. Never fear because Dwight Howard can do both! 

Oklahoma City Thunder: In all honesty Dwight Howard is the type of player you guys have been  going after so you don't need me to tell you why to get him.

Orlando Magic: #TheReturn I can only imagine how excited the five of you must be that this is a possibility! What an incredible opportunity for the city of Orlando!

Philadelphia 76ers: It's obvious to everyone after that playoff series that there's no possibility that Ben Simmons and Joel Embid (Embib?) will every work out. Yep just no chance. They are mentally weak while Howard is mentally strong and somebody who can really personify the great spirit of Philadelphia. 

Phoenix Suns: I've only ever been in the airport there, but it was plain to see that you guys know how to best utilize your available resources in a sustainable way. The 7 seconds or less system is a relic of the past the modern NBA is a 24 seconds or shot clock violation system type of league now and Howard can help you get there!

Portland Trail Blazers: Those pesky big mouth birds sure did a number on ya and they didn't even have Cousins! You need an enforcer! Someone who's not scared of going against Davis and Cousins and that man is *drumroll* Dwight Howard

Sacramento Kings: I saw a Kings game and really enjoyed the city btw but the whole time I was there I was thinking to myself that something just didn't feel quite right and then I realized it was my separation anxiety from missing Dwight Howard. Howard is a man who is capable of changing the culture of a city and that's a thing!

San Antonio Spurs: I've never seen a player that could fit better into the Spurs system. You guys must still be depressed about Tim Duncan retiring, but there is a way to fill that void. Dwight Howard can be your new Timmy he can be...Dimmy (I tried)

Toronto Raptors: You guys need a new coach and someone who can stop LeBron well would ya look at that there's Dwight Howard your new player coach! Talk about killing two birds with one stone!

Utah Jazz: Mitchell showed in the playoff loss to the Rockets that he's still childish when it comes to defeat which is why you need a mature gentleman such as Howard to set the right example.

Washington Wizards: Jesus I forgot that there are 30 teams and this ended up taking longer than I thought. You guys thrive off disorder and chaos so Howard is probably not the right fit for your team sadly.

zero400,2018-05-09 14:44:42+00:00,Rockets/Warriors Matchup History,"In light of what looks to be an epic Western Conference Finals between two stacked juggernaut, I wanted to highlight a few key relationships that makes this hotly anticipated. We all knew this was coming. Let's do it.  

The Rockets and Warriors have been the best teams all season. Warriors have been coasting after a 16-1 epic, all time playoff run. The Rockets came out of the regular season with statement wins in the heads up matchup and the best record in the league. The Warriors run a lot of ball movement and off-ball screens. The Rockets play a lot of spread pick and roll with 2 Hall of Fame point guards, one big to roll to the basket and a flurry of talented 3 &amp; D players.  

A brief (and possibly incomplete) view of recent playoff history:  
2008 Hornets with CP and David West lose to Spurs 2nd round in 7.

2011 Hornets lose to Lakers in 6 games round 1  
2011 Thunder lose to Mavs in WFC in 5.  
2012 Thunder lose to Miami in the Finals in 4-1   
2012 Clippers lose to spurs 4-0

2016 : Klay Thompson, Draymond G., KD.  


Steph : Harden  
Doesn't seem heated but I'm sure Harden didn't like coming in 2nd in MVP in 2014-15.  
Key Series:  
2015 Western Conference Finals  Warriors  4 - 1 Rockets  
Dwight and Harden squeek past CP and Blake in the semi finals thanks to Josh Smith and Corey Brewer. What was a done game has one of the strangest meltdowns in a series. The next year they underperform and clearly had chemistry issues which I've heard called the ""Dwight-bola virus"". This was a year of meltdowns for Harden and CP and a year of success for the pre-KD Warriors. The core Rockets that lost in 2015 and 2016 were Capella (age 20 in 2015), Ariza, and Harden.

KD : Harden  
3 seasons together starting Harden's rookie season in 2009-10. KD had been there since 07-08. They lost to eventual champion Mavericks(4-1) in 2011 and lost to Lebron &amp; Wade &amp; Bosh(4-1) in the 2012 NBA finals before Thunder lets Harden get traded to Houston in a bad call that Bill Simmons still references constantly.
Key Series: 2012 NBA finals

KD : Chris Paul  
Key Series: 2014 WC Semifinals:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKKL1z42x1M (notice Steve Kerr calling CP the best PG in the league)  


Chris Paul : Steph Curry  
Key Series  
2014 1st round 7 game series. Chris Paul wins and is assured to himself that he is the best pointguard in the world, has been putting up HOF numbers for years and this is a Clipper window with Blake and DJ and Doc that maybe won't be cursed this year. He spends the next 3 years watching Steph change the game and reach stardom and accolades Chris Paul's longer and more consistent career can't touch. The Warriors show up consistently vs the Clippers for years and only lost their streak after CP3 and Blake's departures. They each know they're the best pointguard in the league. Its personal.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NudiJUlxb10  


Chris Paul : David West  
Former Hornets stars from 2005-06 until 2010-11 seasons. They split up after losing in 6 to a Laker team that then got swept by the eventual champion mavericks. This is the one that is both the longest stint as teammates and distant which intrigues me. Its also the only relationship where they traded 1st and 2nd options for a team night to night. KD and Harden are in a similar situation but Harden was more 3rd option behind Westbrook while sneaking towards the juggernaught of a stepback jumper that he is today. 
Key Series: 2008 vs Spurs
The 2008 team was the best that they were when they lost to Duncan and the Spurs. D. West had 38 in game 5, CP3 had 35 in game 3.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=insxrb-l5lM  


Klay Thompson : Trevor Ariza  
I just think Klay is a good dude. He knows he's good. He holds the all time record for points in a single quarter. He's grown up in NBA basketball. I'm sure he's worked hard but he's 6-7 and doesn't have to dribble or make many decisions. The system impacts who sets him screens and where he runs to shoot. He basically plays good defense because he's long and active and shoots if he ever catches the ball. Ariza has never been as good as Klay is but I will always love him because of his steal against the Nuggets that won the Laker championship. They play similar roles. I can't picture Klay feuding with anyone but there was this (video below).

unfixablesteve,2018-04-19 18:43:57+00:00,The clearest example of why legal weed is a bad investment -- Oregon farmer's grew 3x the amount that whole state smoked,"It's literally a weed and grows like one. 

&gt;A recent Sunday afternoon at the Bridge City Collective cannabis shop in North Portland saw a steady flow of customers.

&gt;Little wonder: A gram of weed was selling for less than the price of a glass of wine.

&gt;The $4 and $5 grams enticed Scotty Saunders, a 24-year-old sporting a gray hoodie, to spend $88 picking out new products to try with a friend. ""We've definitely seen a huge drop in prices,"" he says.

&gt;Across the wood-and-glass counter, Bridge City owner David Alport was less delighted. He says he's never sold marijuana this cheap before.

...

&gt;It turns out Oregonians are good at growing cannabis—too good.

&gt;In February, state officials announced that 1.1 million pounds of cannabis flower were logged in the state's database.

&gt;If a million pounds sounds like a lot of pot, that's because it is: Last year, Oregonians smoked, vaped or otherwise consumed just under 340,000 pounds of legal bud.

&gt;That means Oregon farmers have grown three times what their clientele can smoke in a year.

&gt;Yet state documents show the number of Oregon weed farmers is poised to double this summer—without much regard to whether there's demand to fill.

&gt;The result? Prices are dropping to unprecedented lows in auction houses and on dispensary counters across the state.

NitroXYZ,2018-04-12 04:54:15+00:00,[OC] Every NBA Team Ranked By How Well They Have Performed To Preseason Expectations This Regular Season.,"  
With the regular season now done and dusted I decided it would be cool to take a look back at every NBA team this season and place them into tiers on the level that they have performed at this season. Of course every situation is different and so I have factored in the teams overall win-loss record but also how they have responded to difficult situations this season such as injuries or the context of how they have performed.  
  
**This is just my opinion and I am keen to shuffle the list around if people disagree with my results so feel free to leave your input and I will be very willing to take it into consideration. Please don’t be too harsh and I will try to make sure my rankings are as accurate as possible**  
  
———————————————————————————————————————————  
   
Just a couple other things to consider:  
—When I state my predicted expectations It as an average of preseason rankings from ESPN,

-This is the link to the NBA preseason power ranking predictions that I make reference to in my post. (https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/76r1af/201718_season_predictions_from_the_rnba_power/) 
  
———————————————————————————————————————————  
     
**Completely Exceeded Expectations**  
  
**—Indiana Pacers** W/L Record: 48-34  
The Indiana Pacers were predicted to win 32 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as few as 30 games. They were viewed as a team that would be stuck in a difficult rebuild position after the departure of Paul George but have performed outstandingly. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions just 2/30 voters expected Indiana to make the playoffs and both of those were as the 8th seed. Indiana winning close to 50 games was just ridiculous to even consider and something not even the biggest Pacers fans would’ve thought possible.  

If they were to have any success this season most people thought it would come from the development of young centre Myles Turner who would carry the load for Indiana and have a break through season but it was former Thunder player Victor Oladipo that has come to the rescue. In his first season in Indiana Oladipo has improved his scoring this season from 15.9 points per game to an incredible 23.1while also posting career high numbers in rebounds, assists, steals, blocks and shooting the best splits of his 5 season career. Victors ability to turn the Pacers into a not just a borderline but great playoff team this season should not go unrecognised and he is likely to be awarded the NBA award for Most Improved Player by seasons end. 

**—Philadelphia 76ers** W/L Record: 52-30   
The Philadelphia 76ers were predicted to win 39 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as few as 33 games. The common thought process around the 76ers was that they were an exciting young team whose lack of experience may prevent them from making playoffs but they could make a lot of noise in a year or two. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 12/30 voters expected Philadelphia to make the playoffs with more than half of those tipping and 8th seed. This enough would’ve been considered a great achievement for the 76ers but instead they have improved tremendously and will own home court advantage in the first round of playoffs.  
  
Perhaps the most obvious reason for Philadelphias surge this year has been the emergence of rookie superstar Ben Simmons who has averaged 16/8/8 through the season and has played brilliant defence. His playmaking ability is already elite and despite the lack of an effective jump shot he is still able to score 16 points per game on efficient shooting. The generational talent is playing at a level we have rarely seen in the NBA from anyone but to be doing it at such a young age is frightening for the rest of the league. I might be a Utah fan but in the end I think that what Ben Simmons has achieved in his first year of actual play has been special which is why I think he is the 2017-18 Rookie of the year. 

**—Boston Celtics** W/L Record: 55-27     
The Boston Celtics were predicted to win 54 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as few as 49 games. Some people thought that was a little generous given the enormous roster turnaround that saw just 4 Celtics remain from the team that made the ECF just a year prior, while others considered this squad a direct upgrade over last seasons team. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions Boston were considered almost a consensus top 2 team in the East with 28/30 rankers voting accordingly. The Celtics season began in shocking fashion when they suffered a devastating blow as newly acquired all-star Gordon Hayward went down with a season ending injury. This lead many to questioning what Boston could actually achieve this season. Some wondering whether the squad could even make the playoffs.  
  
It hasn’t been an issue for them and they have marched to the second seed in the East despite other key injuries to forward Marcus Morris and defensive guard Marcus Smart missing close to a 3rd of the year. Kyrie Irving demonstrated to the league that he has what what it takes to lead a great team after leaving Lebron and the Cavs in the offseason and being able to take the 2nd seed in the East. As is the theme with these Celtics Irving has missed 20 games through injury and will be out for their playoff push. None the less what the Celtics have been able to achieve this season is nothing short of incredible and In my opinion Brad Stevens deserves recognition for his role in their success and should win Coach Of The Year.  

———————————————————————————————————————————  
     
**Exceeded Expectations**  

**—Utah Jazz**  W/L Record: 48-34       
The Utah Jazz were predicted to win 42 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as few as 36 games. In a somewhat similar situation to Indiana many expected a decline from the Jazz when Gordon Hayward left in free agency. The common belief existed that Utah were not a playoff caliber team and that their lack of offensive fire power would leave them exposed and their defence would not be able to compensate for that. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions only 3/30 voters expected Utah to finish higher than the 8th seed. In the end improvements from Ingles and Rubio, a bounce back year for Favors and the unexpected emergence Donovan Mitchell has helped lead the Jazz to the 5th seed in a super competitive Western Conference.   
  
However when speaking of impact and the Utah Jazz it is simply impossible not to mention defensive anchor Rudy Gobert. Their is a direct correlation to Utahs success and Rudy Gobert playing this season. None more so then when Gobert went down with a second knee injury in late November which lead to him missing close to 30 games before finally returning. However since his return the Jazz have a record of 30-8 and the best defence in the league. Despite the amount of games he has missed this year I think Gobert is deserving of this seasons Defensive player of the year award for his impact on the Jazz and how great of magnitude a difference he has made when he is on the court.  

**—Houston Rockets** W/L Record: 65-17     
The Houston Rockets were predicted to win 57 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as few as 55 games. Unlike most other situations were teams have exceeded expectations the Rockets still had very high hopes bested upon them after finishing second in the Western conference. There were concerns that the backcourt duo of Harden and Paul would struggle chemistry wise but that hasn’t been a problem at all. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30 voters predicted a top four seed for the Rockets with 18/30 voters expected Houston to finish second, but with no votes for first. A combination of outstanding performance and Golden State injuries has lead to them finishing as the far and away the number one team in the league and dare I say championship favourite?  
  
An underrated aspect of their excellence this season has been the defensive improvement of the Rockets powered by Ariza, Capella, Mbah A Moute and Tucker. Really though we can all pin point where the majority of the Rockets success has come from and that is the MVP level play of James Harden. The Beard is this seasons favourite for the MVP having averaged 31/5/9 but Houston and leading his team to the best record. Houston are every chance right now to go all the way and take home their 3rd championship in franchise history and I am intrigued to see if they can carry there form into the playoffs. 
  
**—Portland Trailblazers** W/L Record: 49-33  
The Portland Trailblazers were predicted to win 41 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as few as 37 games. Heading into the season they were expected to take home a low playoff spot as they hadn’t changed too much in the offseason but were still a reliably good team. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 21/30 voters anticipated a playoff berth but none saw the Blazers as a top 4 seed. Despite a poorer end to the season then they would’ve liked the Blazers were able to out perform their expectations lead by the amazing performance of Damian Lillard while CJ McCollum has still been effective in a bit of a down year. Perhaps what has been most impressive for the Blazers is the transformation for Portland on the defensive side of the court as they have finished top 10 in defence, A distinct characteristic that separates this squad from other Portland teams of the past.   
    
**—Toronto Raptors** W/L Record: 59-23  
The Toronto Raptors were predicted to win 47 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as few as 43 games. After a disappointing exist from the playoffs last season after being swept people still considered the Raptors to be a good team but didn’t quite think they would be competing for a championship. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30 voters expected playoffs but just 1 voter expected a top two seed which the Raptors were ultimately able to achieve rather clinically. A complete culture reset placing a greater emphasis on three point shooting and general ball movement has been a big part of their success and that is without even making reference to their incredible bench. They were expected to make the playoffs but a near 60 win season is something that not even die hard Raptors fans could’ve seen coming. While I am predicting Brad Stevens to win Coach of they year I definitely think Casey should be runner up.  
  
**—New Orleans Pelicans** W/L Record: 48-34  
The New Orleans Pelicans were predicted to win 41 games in the preseason with Sports Illustrated predicting them to win as few as 39 games. To be perfectly honest while New Orleans were recognised for their talent having two players that are arguably top 10 they were considered to in the preseason to be a team that would fail to succeed which is why expectations were so low. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions just 2/30 voters though they would finish sixth or higher. Throw in the fact that DeMarcus Cousins has missed 35 games and I think you have to say the Pelicans season exceed expectations. Huge credit is due to Anthony Davis who is having an insane season offensively and defensively is currently looking to win the first playoff series of his young career. The Pelicans are definitely a team to look out for next season with a healthy Cousins, rejuvenated Holiday and Mirotic continuing to play an effective role in the team.
  
———————————————————————————————————————————  
   
**Slightly Exceeded Expectations**  

**—Brooklyn Nets**  W/L Record: 28-54  
The Brooklyn Nets were predicted to win 28 games in the preseason with CBS Sports predicting them to win as few as 21 games. Even thought the preseason projections were pretty accurate Id say that the Nets were able to exceeded expectations with the way they were able to remain competitive against strong teams and were able to play overcoming an early season injury to Jeremy Lin and D’Angelo Russell missing large parts of the season as well. Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris and Rondae Hollis Jefferson all made big improvements this season for the Nets and capped of a satisfactory season for Brooklyn. Rookie Jarret Allen looks like an exciting prospect and was one of the bright spots on the year. I’m still not too sure what the future holds for the Nets but as a starting point they finally own their own draft pick next season. Additionally I feel that this season has helped Brooklyn at least identify more players part of their long term plans.  
  
**—Chicago Bulls** W/L Record: 27-55  
The Chicago Bulls were predicted to win 25 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as few as 20 games. After a shocking start where the Bulls were just 3-20 they had a mini revival as Mirotic returned from injury but he was moved in a trade to New Orleans later on. Lauri Markannen had an exciting rookie season, Kris Dunn improved tremendously and Zach LaVine played well after returning from his ACL injury. The Bulls fans might have preferred the team win less games to ensure a higher draft pick but I think this year will be considered a good result after departing from Jimmy Butler and starting their first season in the rebuild.  
  
**—LA Clippers** W/L Record: 42-40    
The LA Clippers were predicted to win 45 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report predicting them to win as few as 43 games. Despite losing Chirs Paul in the offseason people still expected the Clippers to be competing for and making the playoffs. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 20/30 voters said that the Clippers would make the playoffs. It makes it interesting to judge because on the one hand the Clippers were very close to their expected win mark but they still didn’t make the playoffs in a super competitive West. Their season began fairly well for the Clippers but as time went on they began to suffer seriously in injuries with Beverly, Gallinari and Teodosic all missing significant time. Blake Griffins trade was a move that has actually set the Clippers up well for the future as well. Sure they didn’t make the playoffs but Its hard for me to deny that what their side has been able to achieve through great adversity is commendable. The star of the show for the Clippers was definitely Lou Williams. The clear 6th man of the year played at an allstar level having a career best season. I think next season the Clippers are set to shake up the West when healthy.  
  
———————————————————————————————————————————  
   
**Met Expectations**  
  
**—Minnesota Timberwolves** W/L Record: 47-35  
The Minnesota Timberwolves were predicted to win 48 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as many as 50 games. The expectations coming into the season was that Minnesota were a young team who with an added allstar in Jimmy Butler would compete for a top 4 seed in the conference. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 25/30 voters expected the Wolves to make the playoffs with 11 of those expecting them to be in the 5th position. The drought is now finally over and Minnesota are back in the playoffs after ending a 15 year streak without postseason action. It was a nervy finish but they got there. They were expected to finish a little higher but to finally just make the 8, I don’t think any Wolves fans will worry. This squad was the 3rd seed in the West when healthy and will be looking to shake things up.  
  
**—New York Knicks** W/L Record: 29-53 
The New York Knicks were predicted to win 30 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as many as 35 games. The year didn’t start off too poorly and looked to be a dark horse competitor for a low playoff seed being lead by the terrific play of younger superstar Kristaps Porzingis. Porzingis had thrived in a role as the number one option following the Carmelo Anthony before an ACL injury derailed his campaign. Trey Burke has had a resurgence much like Michael Beasley, Tim Hardaway has been solid and Kanter has had a career best season. There is good reason for optimism for the Knicks going forward but they still need just one more young piece.  

**—Miami Heat** W/L Record: 44-38   
The Miami Heat were predicted to win 43 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as many as 44 games. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions they were tipped to finish as either the 6th or 7th seed in the East. There isn’t really too much more to add for the Heat as they have performed exactly the way many thought they would. Goran Dragic making his first all star appearance was a highlight of the season for the Heat and Wayne Ellington has been a big improver.   
  
**—LA Lakers** W/L Record: 35-47   
The La Lakers were predicted to win 32 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as many as 35 games. Things didn’t really start off very well follow for Los Angeles but after a poor first half of the season the Lakers played above 0.500 basketball for the 2nd half. It was a stretch that included some wins against good teams and showed their fans a slight glimpse into what the future holds. I think its fair to say Lonzo didn’t quite live up to expectations but Ingram’s improvement was exciting for the Lakers and they found and absolute steal in Kyle Kuzma. The future is promising and who knows, If they can attract a big name free agent this summer they could find themselves well in the mix for playoff next season. 
  
**—Sacramento Kings** W/L Record: 26-56      
The Sacramento Kings were predicted to win 31 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as many as 27 games. Bogdan Bogdanovic had a successful rookie season and Fox has produced some breathtaking highlights specifically in the clutch. In their first full season without DeMarcus Cousins in quite some time, despite not meeting the win expectations, I think the Kings have made up for that on the back of the performance of their young players this season which have provided them with some excitement in the future.  
  

**—Atlanta Hawks** W/L Record: 24-58   
The Atlanta Hawk were predicted to win 27 games in the preseason with USA Today expecting them to win as many as 32 games. While they weren’t really set with high expectations I still feel that Atlanta has been ok in their circumstances. Additionally they aren’t exactly just an easy beat that their record would have you suggest as the performed very well against the Western conference and some of there elite teams. Dennis Shroeder didn’t quite have the break out season Atlanta fans were expecting but Taurean Prince was able to elevate his play and the Hawks have found themselves in a good position to net a high draft pick and set themselves up for the future as they continue to retool while remaining competitive.  
  
———————————————————————————————————————————  
   
**Slightly Didn’t Meet Expectations**  
   
**—San Antonio Spurs** W/L Record: 47-35   
The San Antonio Spurs were predicted to win 54 games in the preseason with USA Today expecting them to win as many as 57 games. After a great playoff run that ended in disappointment following an injury to Kawhi Leonard the Spurs entered the season as one of the favourites for the championship and another great season. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 29/30 voters expected San Antonio to finish as a top 4 seed in the Western conference. Of corse this prediction was made with the assumption that Kawhi Leonard would play out the entire season. Similar to the Warriors Its hard to measure what the Spurs have achieved this year but ultimately I think they have been able to perform sufficiently enough to not be considered a big failure but in the end of the day what they achieved was still not what we planned. Their 20 year streak of 50 wins came to and end as well but their playoff streak lived on. LaMarcus Aldridge deserves tremendous recognition and respect for what he has been able to help San Antonio achieve this year as the number one option.  
   
**—Washington Wizards** W/L Record: 43-39  
The Washington Wizards were predicted to win 48 games in the preseason with USA Today expecting them to win as many as 51 games. I expected the Wizards to be a top 3 seed and based of off their form in the back end of last season I thought they could legitimately challenge for the Easts top seed. It is understandable why they have struggled this season however with star point guard John Wall having missed about half the season. It will be interesting to see how they play this playoffs with a healthy team and whether they can steal a series victory from one of the leagues top seeds.  
  
**—Denver Nuggets** W/L Record: 46-36   
The Denver Nuggets were predicted to win 44 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as many as 47 games. The expectations coming into the season was that Denver were a young team who with an added allstar in Paul Millsap would compete for a huge seed in the Western Conference but just a fall short of a top 4 spot. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 27/30 voters expected Denver to make the playoffs with 20 of those as a either a 5th or 6th seed. A late 6 game win streak wasn’t enough to for the Nuggets whose final night of the season loss saw them miss the playoffs. Jokic, Harris and Murray were seen as a big three that could matchup extremely well with the Warriors but in the end they won’t even qualify. Expect a big bounce back next season if they finally fire Malone and get an adequate coach
  
———————————————————————————————————————————  
   
**Didn’t Meet Expectations**  
  
**—OKC Thunder** W/L Record: 48-34
The OKC Thunder were predicted to win 52 games in the preseason with USA Today expecting them to win as many as 59 games. The external expectation around this squad was that Carmelo Anthony and Paul George where big upgrades to a squad that won 47 games the year prior. Some people were even considering OKC as the second best team in the league following the Paul George trade. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions their lowest rank was at 4th in the West from 30 voters so they were very much expected to do well. However that hasn’t eventuated and the team has been really disappointing as a whole this season. It seems strange that adding a player with 10 consecutive allstar appearances and another with 5 career appearances only helped OKC win one extra game. Thunder fans are quick to point out Roberson’s injury but the reality is that a team with two prime top 15 players should not have been struggling so much to make playoffs. Perhaps they have been cruising though and I guess we will see this postseason. 

**—Detroit Pistons** W/L Record: 39-43  
The Detroit Pistons were predicted to win 39 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as many as 43 games. Pre-season predictions often centred around the seeding of the final spots in the East with the Pistons one of the teams expected to compete. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 11/30 voters saw tipped them for make a playoff appearance but many others considering them a 9th seed at worst. Detroit looked to have shown the league that they were a playoff caliber when they started 9-3 but weren’t able to continue that form and ended up finishing as the 9th seed. A desperate trade for Blake Griffin in the back end of the season saw Harris and Bradley flipped in what appeared to be a panic decision and attempted quick fix but paired with Reggie Jacksons injury and other issues in play style they were unable to make a big playoff push. Andre Drummond took another step forward in his development after a down year last season and I think they could make the top 8 next season. I just don’t see a tremendous upside for this team in the long run. Oh, and after they took on Griffins lengthy contract, they could be stuck around the 7-10 range for a while.  
  
**—Orlando Magic** W/L Record: 25-57 
The Orlando Magic were predicted to win 31 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as many as 34 games. Expectations weren’t very high but there was hope that they would start to take a step forward and make solid progress in their rebuild. The Magic started the season looking like a playoff threat and were the surprise team of the first month after an 8-4 start which included big wins over Cleveland and San Antonio. That stretch however was completely unrepresentative of how their season would pan out and they finished with a bottom 5 record in the league. For most young teams I can see a sense of direction and progress but Orlando is one team that really confuses me. Expect a big fire sale this offseason as they try to clear out and start fresh again.  
  
**—Milwaukee Bucks** W/L Record: 44-38
The Milwaukee were predicted to win 46 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as many as 49 games. There was excitement around the team that they could be a legitimate dark horse and Giannis could push himself into the MVP conversation, which admittedly appeared possible early but the Bucks have just been mediocre since then. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions they were widely considered to be a top 5 seed or 6 seed with 20/30 voters placing them in this range. The early season addition of Bledsoe should’ve also helped them challenge for a high seed but ultimately they fell over the line to make their way into the playoffs. The pieces are there for the Bucks to be a better team and with a good coach next season It will be interesting to see how far they can go as Giannis is only getting better.  
  
**—Phoenix Suns** W/L Record: 21-61  
The Phoenix Suns were predicted to win 27 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as many as 30 games. They weren’t a team seen as a big threat or a squad ready to make a leap but they weren’t meant to be the outright worst in the league. For this reason despite not having a specifically impressive total of wins to meet expectations there was optimism around the Devin Booker lead Suns and fans really haven’t seen any of that. Its another disappointing season for the franchise who haven’t really found their way again since the heartbreak of 2013-14. One thing to look forward to for the Suns is that they do have the leagues best odds for the number number pick and should they draft well could have a legit duo to build around going forward.  
  
**—Golden State Warriors** W/L Record: 58-24  
The Golden State Warriors were predicted to win 66 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as many as 69 games. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30 voters expected the Warriors to finish with the leagues best record. It feels strange saying that a team with the leagues 3rd best record didn’t meet expectations but that ultimately is the reality. All thought Its a little hard to measure how the Warriors have performed this season with their starters missing significant time. Specifically two time MVP in Stephen Curry who missed 30 games in the year and the Warriors aren’t quite at the same level without him. Despite their clear injury problems I have to say that the Warriors have failed to meet expectation for the reason that they have struggled a lot more defensively this season and the fact that they didn’t finish first in the league. Additionally Klay Thompson and Draymond Greens performances in the closing games off the year without Steph were extremely below capitalised by a 40 point blowout loss to the Jazz.
———————————————————————————————————————————  
   
**Completely Didn’t Meet Expectations**  
  
**—Dallas Mavericks** W/L Record: 24-58    
The Dallas Mavericks were predicted to win 34 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as many as 38 games. I remember at one point last season Mark Cuban making a statement that if his team was in the East then they wouldn’t be tanking, and if I recall correctly, competing for a low playoff spot. Well Dallas didn’t even come close to that and finished with one of the leagues worst records. Dennis Smith Jr had some solid moments in his rookie year and Mavericks fans cant be disappointed with how he played, Dirk Nowitzki had a great season at his age and Harrison Barnes continues to play well as the number one offensive option. Dallas isn’t a team I see going back to the playoffs very soon and yes they were tanking but playing 10 games below expectation is clearly not meeting expectations at all.  
  
**—Cleveland Cavaliers** W/L Record: 50-32   
The Cleveland Cavaliers were predicted to win 53 games in the preseason with USA Today expecting them to win as many as 56 games. The majority of people tipped them to retain their crown as the Easts best team overcoming competition from Boston. Their opening night roster was considered one of the deepest in the league with a great group of experience veterans and solid role players. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions they were a consensus top two team in the East make the finals for a fourth consecutive season. You might think its harsh to place Cleveland so low when comparing things with their win expectations but in my mind the fact that the Cavaliers were underperforming so seriously to the extent where they needed a complete roster turnaround at the deadline speaks for itself. One of the biggest disappointments was Isaiah Thomas played very far below expectations when finally healthy and was traded after just 15 games. Clevelands form leading into the playoffs may have lead to people forgetting how bad they were early in the year but in the grand scheme of things they did not have a great regular season. It will be interesting to see how Cleveland perform in the playoffs and whether they can prove once more that their regular season efforts are irrelevant.  
  
**—Memphis Grizzlies** W/L Record: 22-60    
The Memphis Grizzlies were predicted to win 38 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as many as 41 games. While many people were thinking of the Grizzlies as a team to slip out of the playoffs very few expected such a dramatic decline. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 2 voters even predicted the Grizzlies to finish as the 5th seed in the West! The injury to Conley surely didn’t help but it wouldn’t have made this huge an impact in my opinion. While they were expected to compete and make things difficult for teams challenging a playoff position the Grizzlies have not done such at all and even fired their coach early in the season. Some question whether a healthy Conley, Gasol and new draft pick will be enough to give Memphis another playoff run but to be honest I don’t think Its enough and they face a long road back to contention.   
  
**—Charlotte Hornets** W/L Record: 36-46
The Charlotte Hornets were predicted to win 42 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as many as 44 games. Many considered this roster to be a big upgrade on their 2015-16 squad which was tied for the 3rd best record in the East but for whatever reason they have just failed to perform this year. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions they were expected to by 27 of 30 voters to features in playoff action most likely as a 6 or 7th seed. The future is bleak for the Hornets with many question marks regarding the teams direction including what will happen with Kemba and Howard. Monk has ultimately had an underwhelming season and I believe they will be tanking next year and finish in the leagues bottom 5.

A loss from any of OKC (vs. Houston), Pelicans (vs. Golden State), or San Antonio (vs. Portland) would have put Denver in the 8th seed and whatever losing team in the 9th. However, none of these teams ended up losing tonight and all took out the top teams in the conference.

**What needs to happen today to keep the possibility of a 6-way tiebreak alive?**

1. Denver must beat the Clippers

2. San Antonio and New Orleans can both lose, but they cannot both win, because they still have a game left against each other.


**Who goes to the playoffs if this happens?**

Since none of the teams involved is going to win their division, the first tiebreak is head-to-head win percentage of all teams tied.  
Head-to-head tiebreak (Current results only):

Strangely enough, nothing changes no matter which scenario you choose. New Orleans would be the team that misses out, while Minnesota and Denver would finish 4/5 and play each other up to 9 times in a 3 week span. Houston gets OKC, Golden State gets the Spurs, and Portland would play Utah.

ZandrickEllison,2018-04-07 14:01:03+00:00,the results are in for: LEAST Valuable Player,"A few weeks ago, I asked the rest of the sub to [weigh in on potential nominees]( https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/82ov5e/forget_mvp_or_rookie_of_the_year_whos_in_the/) for a rather dubious honor: the *LEAST* Valuable Player in the League. 

Now, it's officially time for the reveal the jewel of our **Anti-Awards** season. The ballots have been counted. The trophies have been molded: not out of gold, but rather toilet paper.

We've got a lovely ceremony here, with a ballroom filled with some notable failures from the past. I see Darko Milicic passing by. Anthony Bennett, front row and center. Later on, we'll have a video tribute to some of Skip Bayless' hottest takes. And naturally, our ceremony hosts will be #players only, baby!

We're starting off with a bang: the main award of the night. Least Valuable Player. This award will be presented by last year's winner, Indiana SG Monta Ellis, who parlayed his award into an early retirement.

But before we announce the award, here are some caveats:

--- Obviously, the worst players in the league are the ones who sit at the end of the bench and don't get any playing time. However, this award is trying to ""honor"" the player who hurt their team the most this season, so we're focusing on players who log heavy minutes (20+) and consequently negatively affected their team's play the most. Simply put: the more you play, the more damage you can do.

--- And that actual ""damage"" is important. If you're on a tanking team, no one cares about the damage you’re doing; it may even be a positive. I'm also ignoring young players (under 21) who are still developing and can't be expected to be solid players yet. 

--- Similarly, we don't want to judge players within the context of their salary any more than the actual MVP does. Bad contracts are the folly of a GM, not the player himself. We're looking for failures on the court, not off it.

######**(dis)honorable mentions**

JAE CROWDER and AVERY BRADLEY: Both have underwhelmed in a major way since leaving Boston. Turns out this Brad Stevens kid may be a decent coach after all.

DION WAITERS: If Waiters didn't get injured, he may have been the frontrunner for this award. After signing a contract extension, his shooting predictably dropped like a rock, down from 39.5% from three last year to 30.6% this season.

Now without further ado, let's get to our top 5.

######**LEAST valuable players of 2017-18**

**(5) SF Evan Turner, Portland: 25.5 minutes per game, 9.9 PER**

Again, we're ignoring contract situations here, because it's not Evan Turner's fault that Portland overpaid him. That said, that bloated salary may motivate the Blazers to play Turner more than he deserves. He finished in the top 5 of LVP honors last season, and is a repeat nominee again this year.

As a wing who doesn't shoot threes, Turner will always be behind the eight ball. He's actually inched his percentages up this year, but he's still only at 33.1% from beyond the arc (with 0.5 makes per game.) On his best days, he makes up for that with his playmaking ability, but he doesn't have much opportunity to do that in Portland, averaging only 2.2 assists per game. His defense is traditionally OK, although ESPN real plus/minus graded him as a negative on that end this season (-0.81) as well.

**(4) C Tristan Thompson, Cleveland: 20.3 minutes per game, 13.6 PER**

In the modern NBA, you dream of a big man who can stretch the floor *and* protect the rim. Most often, you settle for one of the two.

Right now, Tristan Thompson is giving the Cavs *neither*. His range is severely limited, and he's still shooting 55.3% from the line. More damning, he's not protecting the back end on defense either. He's averaging 0.3 blocks per game. That's a grand total of 17 blocks on the season, one less than 6'0"" Fred VanVleet.

To his credit, Tristan Thompson is still an active rebounder. His average of 6.6 per game is even better than it looks given that 2.4 of those come on offense. That said, you can't be a ""one tool"" player in the NBA anymore and be successful. That's reflected in his advanced stats, with ESPN real plus/minus charted his impact as a -3.57 overall.

**(3) PG Michael Carter-Williams, Charlotte: 16.1 minutes per game, 10.9 PER**

We collectively raised our eyebrows when Charlotte signed PG Michael Carter-Williams this offseason. After all, MCW hadn't played that well since his rookie season, with his shooting issues well documented. Surely, this would be a bust.

It didn't go exactly the way we expected: it was even *worse*. Carter-Williams' field goal percentage dipped to an all-time low of 33.2% (note: that's field goal percentage, not three point %). He's a solid defender (+0.98 according to ESPN real plus/minus), but he can't make up for an offensive liability that pronounced. Fortunately for him, MCW has only averaged 16 minutes over 52 games, which has limited his damage and prevented him from winning this trophy. 

**(2) PG Isaiah Thomas, CLE/LAL: 26.9 minutes per game, 12.6 PER**

A year after contending for MVP, little Isaiah Thomas is making a hard charge for LVP honors. 

Coming back from injury in Cleveland, he looked like a shell of himself. And the problem is: he didn't know it. He continued to launch shots like nothing had changed, shooting just 36.1% from the field and 25.3% from three. He almost single handedly derailed the Cavs' chances of contending until the team cut bait entirely.

That efficiency has only slightly improved with the Lakers, ""up"" to 38.3% and 32.7% respectively. And being able to score efficiency is basically the only virtue Isaiah Thomas can bring you: his rebounding (2.1 per game) and defense will always drag you down. If he’s not shooting/scoring well, you have a major problem on your hands.

There are only two reasons that Thomas won't win the LVP this year. Primarily, he hasn't played enough, with 32 games all told. And to his credit, he still managed to get to the free throw line 4.1 times per game, hitting 89.3% of his attempts. 

**(1) SG Jamal Crawford, Minnesota: 20.6 minutes per game, 13.6 PER**

PER (not a good stat in general) doesn't reflect Jamal Crawford's struggles over the last few seasons. Always a score-first guard, the 37 year old has become more one-dimensional than ever in his advanced age. He's a volume scorer (10.5 points in only 20.7 minutes) who doesn't score efficiently, shooting 41.9% from the field and 33.5% from three. And that's basically all he does. He totals 1.2 rebounds per game, and his defensive real +/- is an atrocious -5.58. Among 514 total qualifiers, that's # 514. By far. The next worst is Troy Daniels at -4.47.

Because Jamal Crawford's been healthy all year and played 78 games, he's managed to do more damage than his peers on this list. In fact, his total of 1613 minutes on the court almost matches the combined total of our runners-up MCW and Isaiah Thomas (835 and 862, respectively.) 

What further cements Jamal Crawford our ""LVP"" this season is that his poor play (combined with his extended playing time) may *directly* cause the Timberwolves to miss the playoffs. They're fighting for their playoff lives right now mostly because Jimmy Butler got hurt, but partly because of Jamal Crawford as well. In the offseason, the team reportedly had interest in C.J. Miles (a solid 3-and-D player who would have been a godsend for them) but settled for Crawford instead. Major downgrade. Tom Thibodeau also gave the veteran Crawford playing time at the expense of PG Tyus Jones, an effective backup who should be getting more shine. Without Crawford on the roster, the Wolves may have won an additional game or two that may have made the difference in their year. This last week will determine whether or not Crawford is the fatal flaw that doomed them, but he's done enough damage already to earn this trophy.

So congrats (?) to Jamal Crawford, our 2017-18 LVP.

sloughfoot,2018-04-03 16:46:38+00:00,Are you a Circle team? A study in logos and icons.,"# Are you a Circle Team?

In this post, we will categorize each NBA team’s dominant Reddit logo/icon based on whether it is circular or not. I realize there are multiple logos for each team in use on this subreddit. For the purposes of this exercise, I have chosen *the logos included in the standings sidebar*. For some teams, there would be no change (the Lakers use two different logos, but both are ‘almost-circles’). For others, like the Jazz, this choice had huge implications for where they landed. 

I did not spotlight every team. If a team’s logo was harder to categorize, that also meant there was more to learn from, so considerable attention is paid to teams in the last 2 categories.  

I have tried my best to be objective, but as always, there is room for interpretation.    
***

# Category 1: Circles 
#### This was the easiest group of teams to categorize. These teams are circles, there really is no argument to be had about it.    
  
[Toronto](https://imgur.com/jCeuJGv)  
[Philly](https://imgur.com/V3AAYlT)

[Washington DC](https://imgur.com/qYhCh6m)    
[Timberwolves](https://imgur.com/rZokAtZ)    
***

# Category 2: Not Circles  
#### This was the second easiest group of teams to categorize (with the notable exception of the Heat, which I will get to in a moment). These teams are just not circles, plain and simple.    
  
[Spurs](https://imgur.com/DGKCXQK)      
[Nuggets](https://imgur.com/PwmyPzP)    
[Thunder](https://imgur.com/6OBT4VX)

[Dallas](https://imgur.com/Z7ch8Ia)    
[Nets](https://imgur.com/q8R3vti)    
[Heat](https://imgur.com/LtlUai5)

+ Miami was tough to pin down. I nearly included them in the ‘almost circle logo’ group. Let me explain. Notice, their logo is actually made predominantly of *two circles*. A basketball, and a hoop from an oblique angle. Everything is pointing towards ‘this is an almost-circle logo.’ However, this is a two-dimensional exercise, and to top it off, the non-geometrical flames burn up (wink) the Heat’s chances of making it into the almost-circle logo category.    

***

# Category 3: Almost Circles
#### These teams have logos that are almost circles. They are defined by a strong, but unfinished or interrupted presence of a circle.    

[Kings](https://imgur.com/zsgMjdW)
 
+ Starting from the bottom, the Kings are looking like strong contenders for being included in the circle camp. A clean, if not obvious, basketball motif phases into the team name pretty well. But the modern crown accent dashes any hope of being a circle team. I love my team, but as a logo taxonomist, this one leaves me wanting more.

[Lakers](https://imgur.com/K8JnBPb)

+ This is very circular, but it’s also not a circle. If the font was just a little smaller, the basketball just a little bigger, this would be a circle logo. But with a dashing flourish, this team eschews easy categorization, and lands firmly in the ‘almost-circle’ category. As a Kings fan, I have complicated feelings about the Lakers (insofar as I hate them), but as a logo taxonomist, you have to respect the classic West Coast bravado here. With mass appeal for both circle and non-circle folks alike, this is truly a logo bandwagon that people who have a hard time thinking for themselves will want to hop on to.

[Milwaukee](https://imgur.com/t1AszTF)

+ For circle lovers, this is maybe the second hardest logo to look at in the league. I mean, this thing is begging to be a perfect circle, then bam, the deer horns really fuck things up. I like this logo, but I’m not necessarily a circle guy. I imagine looking at this as a circle person would be like nails on a chalkboard.

[Atlanta](https://imgur.com/YZqrJQe)

+ I like this logo a lot. It’s got a hawk, but it’s also almost a circle. And unlike the Milwaukee logo, it isn’t a circle battling an organic feature. No, this thing is *designed to be an almost-circle*. It exists in a startling and wonderful harmony that I hope the strange and meme-loving fan base of Atlanta appreciates.

[Portland](https://imgur.com/njBy6LR)

+ This category is basically made for the Blazers logo. It’s as if two almost half circles from different but mirrored planes of existence are in the process of coalescing into a perfect circle. Perhaps some millennia from now these two halves will merge like distant galaxies, and Portland can ascend to circledom. Until then, they are relegated to almost-circle-ville.

[Boston](https://imgur.com/o9x8v0S)

+ This logo is more than just the best case for racism existing against white people in the US. It’s also an affront to circle purists everywhere. I mean, there’s a perfect circle there. Clear as day. Some might even say I’m being too strict by including this in the almost circle camp. But just as with the Heat logo, we are not dealing in layers, or three dimensions. The ‘is this logo a circle’ game is a two-dimensional game, and when you slap a little basketball twirling Irish caricature on top of your circle, I’m sorry, but you are no longer a circle team. I’m not a circle guy, but if I was, looking at this would give me nightmares. Like an unresolved harmony, I would spend all day thinking about how to make this almost-circle, a circle.    

***

# Category 4: ????
#### I have no idea what these logo designers were thinking. Are they ahead of their time? Do they know that circles exist?

[Memphis](https://imgur.com/uGwMBTe)

+ Early on in my research, I realized that this is a bear head, but it’s getting dangerously close to circle territory. Mainly though, it’s just a bear head that is very round. I don’t think this logo designer was thinking ‘circle-first’ for his design, or even thinking about circles at all. So, the roundness is a biological coincidence, and therefore we will all be left wondering how to categorize this guy for years to come.

[New Orleans](https://imgur.com/xhajZGc)

+ If I may editorialize for a moment, this is a bland-as-fuck knock-off of the Knicks logo. That much we know for sure. What we can’t be sure about is whether the logo designer had a circle in mind or not. My personal theory is that they were thinking ‘I am going to make this logo, and it will not be a circle,’ but they were so familiar with circles that it started getting too round. Then, realizing their error, they pulled it back at the last minute, stranding it as a sort of ovoid shape, leaving it up to the pundits to argue whether it’s in circle-land or not. 

[Pacers](https://imgur.com/YzbhdRH)

+ This is a P. But the round part of the P is very pronounced. If you blur your vision enough, it starts getting really close to a circle. But like the Grizzlies logo, I don’t think this was meant to be a circle. It’s a P, and the confusion lies in the fact that the structure of P’s are dominated by a half-circle. I’m left scratching my head looking at this, and I’m sure I’ll get a lot of heat for it. But I didn’t do this to make friends, I did this because I have a passion, and we had to put the P somewhere.

[Cavs](https://imgur.com/f0cQj9G)

+ So, this is a ‘C’. A ‘C’ that I think was designed to be cool for 8th graders in the 90’s. In 8th grade I would have been like, damn that’s a dope C. But I am an adult, and therefore non-plussed by this design.    
If it was closer to a pure ‘c’, I would have to put this in the ‘almost-circle’ category. But instead it was designed by Lisa Frank’s masculine alter-ego, and therefore, like a man without a nation, this logo goes into category limbo.

[Jazz](https://imgur.com/6W7SRlh)

+ This is the kind of logo that makes my job tough, and frankly, unrewarding. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do with this. It’s maybe the laziest logo of the bunch. Basketball? Check. “Oh, but also we are a team based on an historically important ~~and now culturally irrelevant~~ genre of music. Let’s make it a musical note.” More like *footnote*. The Jazz logo is boring, uninspired, and most importantly, without category in terms of whether it’s a circle or not.

[Suns](https://imgur.com/p4RAq0Y)

+ As a logo taxonomist, this logo makes me want to throw my computer out of the window and quit my job forever. You are the Suns. Your mascot is the most famous, most widely known circle in history. You play basketball, basketballs are also circular. How the fuck is your logo not a circle? Why are you rejecting your destiny? No one deserves a circle logo more than you, and yet look, there’s some little half-assed spikey corona things and streak marks. Was this what the 7-seconds-or-less Suns were running from? I hate this.

***

EDIT: Thank you for the lively discussion. Obviously people have a lot of strong, positive opinions about the Jazz musical note logo. I shouldn't have called it boring. But just to be clear: my analysis is from the perspective of a logo taxonomist, and that thing is neither a circle, nor not a circle, so perhaps you can understand why I expressed myself the way I did.

**Golden State:** KD is a snake for joining the Warriors.

**Boston:** It's Lebron's face the night of [game 6 of the 2012 ECF](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201206070BOS.html).  He single handidly murdered the Celtics that night, and ended the Big 3 era. 

**Portland:** It's Raymond Felton.  When Felton went to play for Portland he showed up out of shape and fat.  He played like shit then promptly got back in shape when he went to the Knicks the next year.  Portland fans hate him

**Cleveland:** It's Lebron James when he did ""The Decision"" and took his talents to South Beach.

**San Antonio:** It's a broken robot.  Kawhi is often called a robot, and he's broken because he is injured.

**Philadelphia:**  Philly has had a lot of medical problems where their doctors have misdiagnosed their players injures (most notably with Embiid last year)

**Minnesota:** It's KG (who is by far the best Timberwolf ever) winning a championship with Boston.

**Indiana:**  [It's Ron Artest who started a huge brawl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXEFMfd9c1A) which went into the stands.  He got suspended for the entire season, including playoffs, which ruined the Pacers title chances that year.

**Oklahoma City** It's the Thunders big 3.  They traded away Harden very early, and later Durant left to join the Warriors (see the snake flair).  After this year all 3 will have won MVPs, and were on the same team.  

**Washington:** It's Gilbert Arenas with finger guns.  In Washington Gilbert Arenas and a teammate pulled guns on each other in the locker room during a fight.

**Utah:** [ It's Michael Jordan pushing off right before he hit a game winner which won the Bulls the championship.](https://youtu.be/PRCTp57LQro?t=25)

**Miami:** It's Dirk hitting a shot during the 2011 finals, when Dallas beat in Miami in the finals .. sigh

**LA Clippers:** It's a banner of the LA Sparks (the women's team) winning a championship.  I guess it is insulting because every basketball team in LA has won a championship except the Clippers.

**Detroit:**  It's Darko Milicic who the Pistons selected ahead of Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, and Dwyane Wade in the 2003 draft.

**Denver:**  It's Cornrow Carmelo, who forced the Nuggets to trade him because he didn't want to live in a small town like Denver.

**Charlotte:** It's Kobe Bryant after being drafted by Charlotte.  He was traded shortly afterward to the Lakers.

**LA Lakers:**  It's David Stern who [vetoed a trade which would have landed the Lakers CP3 in 2011](http://www.espn.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/7333285/los-angeles-lakers-deal-acquire-chris-paul-off) for ""Basketball Reasons"".

**New York Knicks:**  It's Phil Jackson who was supposed to be the GM/President that would be the savior of the Knicks, but ended up being absolutely incompetent.

**Sacramento:**  It's their owner Vivek who has been amazing at everything except putting together a winning team, or hiring a decent coach.

**Brooklyn:**  It's Danny Ainge, the Celtics GM, who traded them an old Paul Pierce and KG for 4 first round picks (technically 3 picks and swap rights on another).  They ended up being the 18th pick, the 3rd pick, the 1st pick, and this years pick (probably around 8).

**Dallas:**  It's DeAndre Jordan who agreed to go to the Mavericks, but later changed his mind and stayed with the Clippers (after it had been announced).

**Chicago:**  It's the Bulls and White Sox owner holding a World Series trophy.  On numerous occasions he has said baseball means more to him, and that the White Sox are more important to him than the Bulls.

**Memphis:** It's Marc Gasol while giving an interview which criticized his coach (who was later fired).

**Orlando:** It's Fran Vasquez who was drafted 11th by the Magic, but decided not to come to the NBA and played his career in Europe.  

**Phoenix:** It's Robert Horry who in the 2007 WCF [shoved Steve Nash](https://youtu.be/7LT_C7o5ZGM?t=50).  This caused several important teammates (Stoudemire and Diaw) to run to defend Nash and get suspended for the critical game 5 which they lost.

**Atlanta:**  It's the score during the 3rd quarter of the Superbowl in 2017.  The Atlanta Falcons proceeded the blow the 25 point lead and lose in overtime.  It more than doubled the largest lead blown in a Superbowl, and is one of the largest blown leads in an NFL game period.

DriesMertens,2018-03-20 11:41:40+00:00,[OC] I’ve tallied the number of cards shown in the 5 most recent instances of 141 different club rivalries around the world to try to determine the “craziest” rivalries in world football.,"I’ve tallied the number of yellow and red cards shown in the most recent 5 matches between a collection of 141 rival clubs (in all competitions). My main goal here was to use the cards-per-match data to figure out which rivalries are the “craziest”. I know it’s nowhere near the best metric for this purpose, but it was relatively easy to obtain all the data using this metric and I think it’s still accurate for the most part if you look at the results.

---

All data taken from the 5 most recent matches for which soccerpunter.com had card data on record.

I suggest sorting by average yellow/red/total cards in descending order to get a picture of the rivalries ranked from “craziest” to “tamest”.

^^1 This sample was taken over 5 matches from 2010 to 2013. Literally wtf.

^^2 Only includes 3 matches.

^^3 Only includes 4 matches.

^^4 Two of the last 5 matches have ended in 0-3 awarded victories due to fan trouble.

The #1 most-carded rivalry was Universidad de Chile vs. Colo-Colo from 2010 to 2013 — by far. As you can see from the box-and-whisker plots, this select sample was a huge outlier. I was astonished when I saw that streak so I just had to include it.

On the other hand, the “tamest” rivalry (excluding the small-sample West Brom vs. Wolves) in terms of average total cards shown was Brighton &amp; Hove Albion vs. Crystal Palace.

[Link to Excel spreadsheet here](https://sheet.zoho.com/sheet/editor.do?doc=6832ab0661e0a2dabfefe689d67ea169b1662d253a806fa5b571ba7e8ce0afa5124d849707cb3f940a3fa7de77fb4cbb62ee767c4d6a53ccbc2620e8c4fc8bee). I know it throws errors for the average calculations, not sure why. I think if you download the spreadsheet and open it in Excel it should be fine.

---

Sorry for leaving out rivalries like the Casablanca derby and Al Ahly vs. Zamalek, for which I couldn’t find any card data. If you want to include one that isn’t here, give me the card data and I’ll include it. I hope you enjoyed reading this!",soccer,1545

ank1613,2018-03-12 18:27:30+00:00,The Evan Turner Quote Master List [Updated for 3/12/2018],"Hello everyone,

Around 2 years ago I posted the first edition of the [Evan Turner Quote Master List](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/48miap/the_evan_turner_quote_master_list/).

As it would turn out, has continued to say funny things. Every time he does, I get tagged in reddit threads and on twitter by people demanding that I update the list. So I have attempted to do that. If you find one you'd like added, feel free to let me know (just try to use the same formatting if possible).

These have been sourced from his personal twitter, as well as from a number of interviews with basketball writers. I have not included the original links because that would have been kind of a hassle. I used a tweet aggregation site as well as google and the reddit search function.

Lwl3,2018-03-11 00:08:28+00:00,Westbrook has 15 games to get 178 rebounds (11.9rpg) and 141 assists (9.4apg) to become the first NBA player to average a triple-double season twice.,"Nuggets fan here.

Last season I was at the Pepsi Center to watch as Westbrook dismantled our entire team to force us out of the playoffs...a game in which he secured his 42 triple-doubles in a single season. I stood and applauded along with most of the attendees, and I told anyone that listened that night, “Yes, we’re out of the playoffs, but we will never see that happen ever again.”

As the title says, Westbrook is close to having another triple double season, and while the hype of chasing Oscar is gone, I can’t help but think the fact that the guy is this close to averaging a triple double again is going under the radar. I’m not trying to make a case for MVP (I know his assists are sometimes ugly), but good God is he fun to follow as a “stat purist”.

Now for the drunken Saturday afternoon part of this post...the remaining games and how viable is it that he gets the job done. I will be assuming that Westbrook will be getting his normal minutes with OKC in the current shitstorm that is the Western Conference playoff race.

12/3/17 (vs.) 39   9    10    W

Let’s assume that the Thunder want to win both games. The games listed above show were decided by 3 pts and looking at his minutes played, it is quite obvious they need Westbrook to play at his absolute highest to beat the Spurs, regardless of venue. Using his averages from only Spurs games this season, we can assume Brodie is good for 18.5 PPG/9 RPG/9.5 APG. In wins this season, Westbrook’s stats are 25.6 PPG/10.8 RPG/9.8 APG. Personally, and again I’m a Nuggets fan with a lot of bias, Westbrook kills when it matters most. I’m more inclined to believe his hustle play will be out of this world against the team that is currently holding a tiebreaker against them.

No secret the Kings kinda suck. (What’s up, Vlade?) This should be an easy home win for the Thunder, and their premier PG should have no problem piling on stats. In the two wins against the hapless Kings, Westbrook played team ball with 18 PPG/15.5 RPG/10 APG. I see no reason for this to stop, and therefore award him with his averages (picking 15 for rebounds) 
*Total added to his stats: 15 TRB/10 AST*

**ATL (@3/13)** 
No need for a table, dude went off for his game against the Hawks on 12/22. Impressive 12/17 from the floor, 15 assists, but only 7 rebounds. The win was by 3 points, but with the end of the season approaching, I look for Russ and Co. to put them away in dominating fashion. I will use Russell’s average away stats to calculate (10.7 RPG/10.1 APG).

Alright, elephant in the room, 3 rebounds in November. Not likely to happen again, not going to put much weight into it for a couple of reasons: 
1. Roberson grabbed 11 boards; career average is 4 RPG. Also, not playing tonight, take care of that knee buddy. 
2. Griffin is gone. 
3. It’s Russell Freaking Westbrook. 
I’m looking at a tough game, that the Thunder might lose, but not for a lack of stat padding from Westbrook. Easy 10 assists, and I’ll give him a mere 8 rebounds, just because I was scared of Deandre’s play last night.

**TOR (@3/18)** 
This team scares me, but again, small sample size. I can assume that the Thunder want to repeat their performance on December 27 (124 - 107), but this was Melo in his prime. Alright, drinks are catching up with me, but really, Melo played better, and the Thunder were in serious discussions of taking over the Western Conference (whoops). I look for Westbrook to pass less in this game and rely on hero ball against the superior team. 
*Total added to his stats: 8 TRB/ 9 AST* 
*Total needed to reach season triple-double: 113 TRB/ 83 AST*

**BOS (@3/20)** 
These two teams met early in the season, Hayward’s injury still looming as the Celtics rallied off 16 straight wins, including the comeback victory against the Thunder on November 3rd. For reference, Westbrook had 6 rebounds and 11 assists in the losing effort (he was also -9.5 in +/-). Russ knows he has to take charge against the cream of the East, and just like against the Raptors; assists go down, rebounds go up, Thunder lose.

**MIA (vs.3/23, @4/9)** 
Not a lot of interesting (nor bland) insight for this game. Whiteside is a major hindrance in the rebound chase but relying on home/away splits will be the way to go with these games.

Portland has had OKC’s number this year, but in this final home game against them. Look for Brodie to go off, my basic bitch Coors Light can is telling me he’s going to play team ball against a team he’s probably going to face in the playoffs. His stats in the final matchup of last season were terrible (3 rebounds, 9 assists, and a meager 58 points, OKC loss), so look for the opposite to happen here.

Fuck me. This will be the game that will knock the Nuggets out of a first round home series ☹. This man kills the Nuggets, and our fast pace will be the detriment to our loss in this one. OKC will win with Westbrook posting a bajillion points, exactly 9 million assists in fast breaks and countless Jamal Murray bank shot rebounds (love you). His stats haven’t been fantastic this year, you know, apart from a 38 point game and a 21 assist effort. Oh, and don’t worry, Millsap will actually help Russ get stats in this game, he’s too slow for the pace that will be played.

Does someone smarter than me want to explain why Russ was able to get 16 rebounds on a night that AD and Boogie only combined for 24? Stat boners aside, Russ needs to show out against another tough Western opponent and will likely end with another loss for OKC. Russ will get his assists easily enough, but I have trouble counting him for any rebound total higher than 11 in this game. Prove me wrong bucko. (WTF, drinks stop)

Warriors are good, can’t rebound unless Draymond is in, blah blah blah. Russ is only averaging 10 rebounds a game against them, and his assists are way down. As much as I said he would need hero ball against the Raptors, it is doubly true against the Steph, Slim, and Klay. He put up 15 points in the loss on February 24th, and he’ll need to put up at least 30 if OKC wants to stay in this thing.

I’m deeply troubled by this. Rebounds come at a premium in these matchups with Capela and Adams being the only two players with double digit rebounds in this game (both had 10 on Christmas). Westbrook will be forced to play more perimeter defense than he probably prefers, but his hustle will be unmatched in this game that will probably factor into the Thunder’s home playoff hopes. I can’t put faith in the home/away splits because of how low his averages are, but the shining light will be that he will only need one or two assists against the Heat in order to secure his 10 APG. 
*Total added to his stats: 7 TRB/ 9 AST*

2/14/18(@)   37   13   15     W

Here we are. Final game of the season. He needs 35 rebounds to get his second triple double season in a row. Does he do it? Fuck no. But he does continue his complete game dominance against the Griz. Russ gets 12 boards and 12 assists to complement 12 turnovers, 12 angry conversations with refs, and 24 points. 
*Total added to his stats: 12 TRB/12 AST*
*Total needed to reach season triple-double: 23 TRB/ -13 AST*

What did we learn? Well, if you give me 6 beers and the girlfriend tells me to do laundry, I will spend 3 hours compiling stats on a player that I respectfully hate to avoid being an actual adult, only for the entire experience to end with me disappointed in the result, an angry lady, and no clothes to wear to dinner with her parents tonight. 

TLDR: Westbrook is really good and by estimations and shitty analysis will come within 23 rebounds of doing something the NBA world was shitting itself over last season. 

TLDR:TLDR: Russ is good.

TwoChe,2018-03-05 14:40:41+00:00,"The games that really matter this week (March 5-9, 2018)","I bought league pass last week because I expect this to be a great stretch to end the season.  I might do this each week if people appreciate it.  I will do it for myself regardless, but probably a little less formal otherwise. All times are eastern. 

The West is super fucking close, so if any of the 3-10 seeds in the west are playing, that game is important.  I have used information from playoffstatus.com and NBA.com to create this list. Apologize in advance if there are any errors or I determined your game was not important.  Feel free to preview games you are excited in the comments. 

West: 

1. **Clippers and Pelicans** (Tuesday, 10:30, TNT)- The demise of the Clippers and Pelicans has been greatly exaggerated. Clips shed Blake and have improved their record since the trade. Pelicans lost Boogie but keep pushing ahead.  Two teams fighting for playoff berths and positioning in an ultra tight west. 
2. **Magic vs Jazz** (Monday, 9, LP and Local Only)- Jazz are two games out of the 8 seed. They should win here and make a tight race tighter by inching towards Clips and Nuggets. 
3. **Nuggets vs Mavericks** (Tuesday, 8, LP and Local Only)- Nuggets need a win. Mavericks need a loss. Should be an easy win for the Nuggets, but a loss here would be extremely painful.  Watch this like you watch NASCAR, for the wrecks. 
4. **Spurs and Grizzlies** (Monday, 8:30, local broadcast or league pass only) -- Should be an easy win for San Antonio, a team that really needs an easy win.  Don't sleep on the Spurs yet. They are not going to miss the playoffs and Rockets and Warriors have their fingers crossed they don't land in the 7 or 8 seed. Memphis is collapsing, by design possible, but Marc doesn't deserve this.  
5. **Rockets vs Thunder** (Tuesday, 8, TNT) - Thunder and Rockets are always good.  A lot of history here and the games usually matter. This time is no different.  Rockets are on a 15 game win streak and a half game ahead of Warriors for the 1 seed. Thunder are locked in a battle for their postseason, sitting at the 7 seed they are only 1 game back of Portland for the 3 seed, but only 1.5 games ahead of Utah for the 9 seed. 
6. **Trail Blazers at Lakers** (Monday, 10:30 , NBATV)- Lakers are super hot and have won 5 straight. Blazers are hotter, winning 6 straight and 8 out of 10. Lakers are at the bottom of the bunch of squads fighting for playoff berths and need a little help from others. They can help themselves in this game.  Call in sick on Tuesday, get drunk and stay up late watching west coast basketball.  
7. **Spurs vs Warriors** (Thursday, 10:30, TNT)- Needs no further elaboration. 
8. **Rockets vs Raptors** (Friday, 7:30, LP and Local Only)- Two best records in the West and East (as of today) go head to head.  Will this be a possible finals match up? I bet most say no. So enjoy it while you can! 
9. **Lakers vs Nuggets** (Friday, 9, LP and Local)- Another head to head among the crowded second tier playoff contenders in the West. 
10. **Warriors vs Blazers** (Friday, 10:30, LP or Local)- Two red hot teams to finish you off after Raps and Rockets.  Order your pizza and buy your beer for Friday right now. 


East: 

1. **Pacers vs Bucks** (Monday, 7 PM, LP or Local only)- Current 4 seed Pacers going against current 7 seed Bucks. 2 games separate them in the standings. 
2. **Pistons vs Cavs** (Monday, 7 PM, NBATV, LP or Local) - Cleveland is still working out some kinks and has likely written off the 1 seed.  This will be back to back years LeBron has not had the 1 seed, can he make the finals again with his new crew? Pistons are 4 out but the Bucks and Heat have only barely capitalized on them losing 8 of the last 10. Not a ton on the line here standings wise, but several larger narratives at play.  
3. **76ers vs Heat** (Thursday, 7:30, LP or Local Only)- Heat are sitting in the 8 seed with 4 games between them and the 9, the Pistons. 76ers and 1.5 games back from having first round home court advantage. Trust the Process, but Free Hinkie.   
4. **Celtics vs Wolves** (Thursday, 8 PM, TNT)- Celtics want to catch the Raptors for the 1 seed (2 games back), the Wolves are a half game away from the 3 seed. But 1.5 games from missing the playoffs.  
5. **Cavs vs Clippers** (Friday, 10:30, NBATV)- Cavs are more looking for chemistry than climbing the rankings, the Clippers are on the outside looking in for the western playoffs being a half game out as of Monday morning.

Last week I went on a road trip to visit some old buddies from college who still live in that area, and I overheard a few young students talking about this case. So I'll share it with you all, since I was actually there when it happened.


In my junior year of college, I got a part-time job in downtown Santa Cruz, just down the hill from the university. It was one little office in a big building full of other small businesses. We were affiliated with the Registrar Division on campus, and if you don’t know what that is, they basically handle student enrollment, records, graduation, etc.


My office’s task was to print, prep, and ship the physical diplomas you receive when you graduate with a degree. It was boring work, but since little supervision was required, my boss was hardly ever around and I could blare music or Netflix while working. A handful of other people worked there too, but I often ended up on the late-evening shift by myself.


One day, my boss hired a new employee named Stephanie. I actually knew her already; she was a freshman on campus, and was the younger sister of my close friend Brianna. She had guys crawling all over her, so we spent the long evenings talking about all the terrible dates she’d go on each weekend. Stephanie was chronically in search of a boyfriend, so each Monday she’d have a new story to tell me about an awkward, boring, or creepy date. Nobody was good enough for her. I found the tales of her romantic conquest to be incredibly amusing.


-----------------------


Eventually one of my coworkers quit, so I moved into her position, which was more administrative and required that I sit in front of a computer all night. Stephanie took over my responsibilities as a printer/assembler, so I had to train her on how to prep the diplomas. A part of this process involved gluing a shiny gold seal with the university logo onto the paper. 


My company used this horrible aerosol glue that smelled like varnish, and its fumes were so intense we couldn’t spray it in the office. Instead, whoever got stuck with the gluing had to go down a floor into the underground parking garage. The building was in a guarded business complex, so there weren’t any homeless people or weirdos hanging out down there; it always felt pretty safe. But it was lonely. And dark. 


I hated being down there, because by the time I was just arriving for the late shift, everyone else in the building had already gone home. Every little sound echoed on forever, so when the pipes clanked or the building shifted, it always felt like there was someone - or something - skulking around nearby. 


Stephanie was terribly creeped out by the parking garage, so I agreed to come down and check on her every twenty minutes while she glued. Whenever she was down there, she wore her iPod earbuds so that random little noises of the building wouldn’t freak her out. Occasionally I’d sneak up and scare her, and she’d smack me. Her playfulness made the job tolerable, and we goofed off more than we worked on most nights.


--------------------------


About a month into our new positions, Stephanie excitedly told me she’d met a guy she liked. His name was Tommy, and he didn’t go to our university. He lived nearby, and they’d met while she was waiting for a bus one morning. According to her, Tommy was handsome, smart, and hilariously funny. His parents lived in Maine and owned a huge house and a bunch of land and horses. He wanted to take her there to visit.


For about two weeks, Tommy was all Stephanie ever talked about. Whenever I visited her in the parking garage, she’d prattle on and on about their most recent date, or a movie they watched together, or something sweet he’d done for her. This guy was so invested in her that his romantic gestures even gave me some ideas for my then-girlfriend (now wife!) Faye.


But as time passed, I started to notice a change in Stephanie’s personality. She’d come in to work exhausted and lethargic, sometimes totally spaced out. Then, she’d suddenly perk up and talk my ear off for hours. Then she’d go quiet again. I figured that she was adjusting to the ebb and flow of stress as midterms passed. Or maybe she’d started some medication. I never brought it up; we weren’t close enough for me to ask about stuff like that. But eventually, she began to worry me.


One night, as I stepped out of the elevator to go check on her, Stephanie’s rolling laughter filled the parking garage. It was drawn-out and swelled in waves, like a person watching a funny movie. My first thought was that she was listening to Dave Chappelle on her phone, whom she often talked about, but when I rounded the corner I found her diligently gluing and stacking diplomas with her earbuds dangling around her neck. When I asked her what was so funny, she told me that Tommy had taken her out for pizza the night before, and that he’d tripped while carrying his food and fell face-first into it.


I got back into the elevator after our conversation, but just as the doors closed, I heard Stephanie try to conceal an explosion of laughter, then whispered, “They freak me out! I don’t know how.”


--------------------


Rather than confront her about it, I decided to just pay attention to Stephanie’s behavior and see if I could figure out what the deal was on my own. She’d clock in at the office, print up a few dozen diplomas, grab her supplies, then disappear into the parking garage. Sometimes I’d hear her muttering to herself as she walked to the elevator, or slipping out a few ill-concealed giggles. 


One night, I visited Stephanie in her corner of the parking garage. She seemed too focused on her task to chat with me, which was a little odd, given her normally loquacious nature. When I asked what she was listening to on her earbuds, she replied, “just random shit. This guy has a weird voice.” As I left, I hung back in the shadows and watched her. She hummed and sang nonsensical phrases to a song I’d never heard, occasionally pausing to look up into the darkness at something I couldn’t see. When she leaned over to grab the glue, the cord of her headphones spilled out of her sweatshirt. The jack wasn’t plugged into a phone or an iPod. She wasn’t listening to anything. 


It was at this point that I realized she’d probably become addicted to drugs. One of my best friends fell into meth years back, and I’ll never forget his psychotic behavior whenever he was frying. I finally confessed my concerns to Brianna, but her reaction surprised me. She angrily assured me that her little sister had never done drugs in her life, and that she’d know if she did. Brianna was skeptical when I told her about Tommy; she swore to me that her sister had never mentioned him, and that she wasn’t seeing *anyone*. When I asked Brianna if she’d noticed any unusual behavior in her sister, she replied flatly, “nope.”


---------------------


I sat on my concerns for a while and considered two possibilities: that Brianna had been totally duped by her sister, or that she was lying to protect her. I struggled to accept either one. Brianna was whip-smart and saw right through people’s bullshit, especially that of her friends’ and family’s, and she was honest to a fault. The only other explanation I could come up with was that Stephanie acted weird at the office, but not anywhere else.


The next time I went to work, I perused the office, looking for anything that might cause someone to act strangely: asbestos? A gas leak? I’d even heard about electrical wiring and how it causes people to feel like someone’s watching them. My thoughts fell on the horrible glue we used, but I had worked with the stuff for months without much more than a few headaches. 


When Stephanie came in that night, she seemed to be in a good mood - for the first hour. But after printing up her diplomas and grabbing her supplies, she eyed me suspiciously and set off toward the elevator without so much as a nod. I suspected she was angry at me for having spoken with her sister, but as the night passed by, I realized she was vacillating back and forth between cheerfulness and looking like she’d seen a ghost.


I visited her twice that night in the parking garage. The first time, she was warm and friendly, and told me all about how Tommy had taken her to the movie theater where they’d first met. When I reminded her that she’d told me they’d met at a bus stop, she paused for a long time, then said, “No, I hardly ever use the bus.” I asked her if she had a photo of Tommy on her phone because she’d never showed him to me, and she replied that he hated having his picture taken. Alarms were going off in my head. I was pretty sure this girl needed some psychiatric attention. But aside from her weird stories, she seemed completely lucid.


The second time I went to visit Stephanie that night, I found her crying beside a splay of diplomas and a mess of glue on the pavement. I ran over and asked what was wrong, and she told me through stutters and sobs that Tommy had dumped her for a new girl. I tried to pry more information out of her, but the echo of distant footsteps shattered my focus. I looked out to the far end of the parking garage and saw a man speed-walking through the shadows toward the exit. His movements seemed too furtive for a businessman leaving work late, and when he heard me shout “Hey!”, he bolted. I chased after the man, wanting to catch sight of him in case I had to make a police report. But he vanished into the night.


I went back to ask Stephanie if that guy was Tommy, but she was gone. The diplomas lay neatly stacked where she’d been sitting, and the glue canister was nowhere to be found. I found Stephanie upstairs in the office, reading off the names from another pile of diplomas and laughing hysterically. I demanded to know what the fuck was up with her, and when she ignored me, I whipped out my phone and told her I was going to call 911 and get her to a hospital. She dropped the diploma she was holding and shot me a furious glare. When I looked into her eyes, I didn’t recognize the person staring at me. All I could see was rage; everything else about her presence felt hollow. It was as if Stephanie had vacated her body to make room for some demented spirit.


After staring daggers at me for a few seconds, Stephanie jumped up from her chair and dashed out of the office, screaming and babbling as she went. I couldn’t understand a word of it, but I was absolutely certain at this point that she was experiencing a psychotic break.


I told two police officers everything that had happened, and gave them Stephanie’s phone number, as well as her sister’s and my boss’s. They assured me they’d find her and get her the help she needed, then left. 


-------------------------


Two days later, Brianna called me and asked me if I’d seen her sister. I told her I hadn’t worked another shift yet, and tried to ask her what was going on, but she hung up on me. When I went into the office, my boss told me Stephanie hadn’t clocked in all week. The police visited me in my dorm, this time with a police detective and a few school officials. They took a much more detailed account of my interactions with Stephanie, then left without telling me much. They only said that a missing person’s case had officially been opened.


The days came and went. They blended to weeks, and I watched Brianna slowly break down and drop out of her classes. She took a leave of absence and went back home. Losing someone you love to an untimely death is terrible, but when they vanish altogether, it’s sometimes even worse. You never know when to start the grieving process. You never know when to let go.


A little over a month after her disappearance, Stephanie was found.


I couldn’t believe the news. They wouldn’t tell me anything over the phone; I had to go down to the station at the base of campus, and then to the headquarters downtown. The details made no sense to me.


The first tip came in from a police department in Portland, Maine. An old couple had witnessed a young woman walking around on their property completely nude, just before dawn. She was shouting and behaving strangely. The couple lived near the ocean and said that the girl ran back and forth from their beachfront yard to the water, screaming at the lighthouse in the distance, begging someone named Tommy to come get her and take her out there. The man called the police and went outside to talk to the girl, but she ran away.


Stephanie’s wallet, with her student ID and credit card, was found on the rocks just beneath the lighthouse. This particular lighthouse is accessible only by boat, and only operators are permitted on the island. It is not a tourist destination. How her possessions ended up there was beyond the local law enforcement.


But it only got weirder - and more terrifying - from there. Twelve hours later, Stephanie’s body was found deep in an abandoned mine shaft, wedged between two jagged boulders - in Idyllwild, a mountain town in *Southern California.* Local hikers heard a young woman’s screams from holes in the stone walls around Suicide Rock. She was screaming for a man named Tommy. *How* she was screaming is still a matter for the police to determine. Stephanie’s nasal passages and throat were completely clogged with glue, and her eyes had been glued shut. They found the substance caking almost every inch of her hair at the roots, but none of it was found on her hands, suggesting she had not been the one who’d applied it.


In the following weeks, I was informed that Stephanie’s credit card had been used to purchase a one-way plane ticket to Maine. No return ticket had been purchased. The cops pulled her cell phone records and found that no calls or texts had ever been made to anyone living in Maine, nor anyone named Tommy. All of her recent phone correspondence was investigated, and although Stephanie had gone on many dates and texted many guys in the months leading up to her death, all of them had alibis and the case currently has no leads.


I sometimes wonder if Tommy was real. If he was some psychopath who preyed on young, unstable girls. If he gave her drugs. I wonder if Stephanie had simply given herself brain damage by sniffing too much glue. And I wonder if the woman spotted in Maine was really Stephanie at all, or just an elaborate ruse to complicate her kidnapping and murder. Stephanie died eight years ago, and on my old campus she has become a dark legend known as “Glue Girl,” talked about only in the meadows on Friday nights by stoners trying to scare each other. But I will never forget the murder in her eyes when she glared at me, nor the sincerity in her voice when she talked about the man of her dreams - *Tommy*.

drazion,2018-02-19 22:29:51+00:00,The Lion of the Union: The Pelvic Wound of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain -,"Following the battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, Chamberlain suffered from “neurasthenia” or Civil War illness syndrome (the modem day equivalent of posttraumatic stress disorder). In November of the same year, he contracted typhoid fever whose severe respiratory symptoms caused him to take a long sabbatical.  During his recovery in the winter of 1864, he was given administrative duty on a court martial board. As his health improved, he could no longer stand this idle life and yearned to return to battle. His wish was granted in April 1864 when he was appointed brigade commander of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, 5th Corps of the Army of the Potomac which was about to embark with Grant and Meade on the Overland Campaign

Following the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, the Union army campaign focused on the siege of Petersburg, Virginia, which was considered the door to Richmond, the rebel capital. Here the Confederate army was deeply entrenched for its defense. Chamberlain's brigade found itself at the Union front at a place called Rive's Salient on June 18, 1864. Chamberlain was given the command to attack and, although accustomed to following orders, on this day he was hesitant. He reported back to his superiors: ""I am advanced a mile beyond our own lines in an isolated position. In front of me at close range is a strongly entrenched line of infantry 3,000 strong with projecting salients to my left and right, such that my advance [will] be swept: by a constant cross fire. Despite these adversities, Chamberlain was ordered again to attack. 

While turning to his right to direct an oblique movement of his advance, Chamberlain felt a burning in the right hip. A Confederate soldier shot missed, but the bullet ricocheted upward off a rock and struck Chamberlain in the right pelvis. The examining surgeon’s report described that the ball entered from the front and a little below the right hip, then passed obliquely upward through the bladder and emerged in the rear of pubic area near the head of the femur (thigh bone). The minie ball used at this time produced a ghastly aperture rather than a neat little hole. Surgeons of the day noted that ""interior human organs tended to be torn apart by minie ball's hot path”.

Fearing that his men would lose heart, Chamberlain jammed his saber into the ground as a make shift cane to help him remain upright. As blood ran down both legs and filled his right boot, weakness overcame his willpower and he fell to the ground. His artillery commander, while observing the day's action through field glasses, noticed Chamberlain fall to the ground and dispatched 4 men with a stretcher. Convinced that the wound was fatal, Chamberlain pleaded with them to take care of the other men who were wounded. When a nearby shell burst covered them with mud however, all discussion ended and Chamberlain was carried off the field. Chamberlain's blood pooled for nearly an hour into the clay soil, causing him to joke in later life that ""I am not of Virginia blood, but she is of mine."" 

By the time he reached the field hospital 3 miles to the rear, several hours had passed. The minie ball had entered the right hip, severed arteries, fractured the pelvic bone and injured Chamberlain’s bladder. The prognosis was grim. Civil War surgeons were skilled at removing limbs for extremity wounds, but ""gut wound” soldiers were left to die. Word of the injury reached Chamberlain’s brother Tom who was still in the 20th Maine regiment. Tom recruited 2 men to join him searching field hospitals during the night until they found his brother. 

By this point the surgeons had begun an unprecedented open wound surgery on Chamberlain in the field hospital with him receiving morphine and chloroform sedation. Halfway through the operation, even with the sedation, the pain became sheer torture for Chamberlain and the surgeons laid down their instruments, thinking that Chamberlain’s agony had gone on long enough and that he should be left to die without further pain. However, a groggy Chamberlain encouraged them to continue and they did, reconnecting severed urinary organs and removing the minne ball that had done so much damage. Hope for recovery was nonexistent as, shortly after finishing, the exhausted surgeons noted that the surgery had not completely closed, and that urine was still exiting from it. 

To understand the extreme circumstances under which this procedure was attempted one must have some Civil War medical background. Field hospitals, although sometimes located in houses, barns, or shacks, were often located outdoors in tents amidst rain, heat, flies, and stifling humidity. Coughing, groaning and filthy men with fresh amputations were scattered about the place. The instruments used for one surgery were the same as those used for another conducted minutes before with the attending surgeons simply wiping off blood from the first surgery on his apron before proceeding to the next. These surgical instruments were rudimentary at best and consisted of items easily found today in kitchen drawers. All of these procedures were performed in an age without antibiotics, sterile preparations, efficient sutures, drains, or virtually any modern surgical conveniences. In Chamberlain’s surgery, anesthesia was apparently limited as evidenced by the fact that Chamberlain's observed suffering caused the surgeons to stop. They only continued when he insisted that they do so. 

On hearing of the wound and assuming it to be fatal, Chamberlains commanders recommended his promotion to Brigadier General. Grant, recalling Chamberlain's many prior acts of bravery, promoted him immediately. Eight stretcher bearers were dispatched to carry Chamberlain 16 miles to City Point, Virginia on the James River north of Petersburg.  Here he boarded the hospital ship Connecticut and was transferred to the Naval Academy hospital in Annapolis, Maryland. He arrived with his boots and spurs on, “blood soaked and smeared, hair and beard matted with blood and dirt, pale as death and weak as water."" General Gilmore, after visiting Chamberlain on July 5, described his condition in a letter reporting that ""His wound is severe, the ball severed the urethra so near the bladder that by no artificial means can all the urine be voided (urinated) without some urine escaping and passing out through his wound. It is feared that ulcers will form in the abdomen and terminate his life "" 

Miraculously, Chamberlain began to recover.  By the end of July, surgeons started to admit that the danger of death was passing and recovery was certain. The 2 favorite items that constituted his reading material during this recovery were the special order promoting him to Brigadier General and his obituary released by the army to the New York newspapers. Ironically, he would ultimately die of this wound, but not until he was 85 years old. Although he did not die, Chamberlain did have to suffer with the insertion and keeping of an inflexible silver catheter in his urethra on multiple occasions for multiple days during his recuperation from surgeries. Such catheters would inevitably be necessary for past surgical urinary drainage. 

The first known recorded reference to the use of a catheter was in a report sent by Doctor Vanderkieft to surgeon J. H. Brinton on September 20, 1864. He noted that after only 5 days of use the catheter had become encrusted and concluded that if prolonged catheterization was necessary it should be changed frequently to avoid this complication. This “changing” unfortunately did not happen with Chamberlain whose catheter was apparently left in for multiple days without being changed. 

The result was an infection and the non-healing of the fistula (an opening ... in this case of the urethra) just in front of the scrotum.  Catheters in the late 1800s were cast of wood or metal. Accordingly, it is easy to imagine that an urethro-cutaneous fistula(a hole in the urethra) could develop from prolonged use. That Chamberlain’s fistula (opening) formed from prolonged catheter use rather than a direct, bullet hit seems evident after examining the bullet path and postoperative records. During his lifetime, Chamberlain suffered greatly from this injury. He was plagued with incontinence (urinating in one’s pants requiring a diaper), impotence, recurrent cystitis (bladder infection), epididymo-orchitis (infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum) and osteomyelitis (infection of muscle and bone), which in an era without antibiotics were especially prolonged and miserable. Given Chamberlains suffering, almost anyone else would probably have retired to their home, comfortable that they had served their country well and believing that now was the time to attend to themselves. But Chamberlain's dedication to the Union cause brought him back to the battlefield again. Although able to walk only short distances and unable to mount his horse without assistance, he returned to the command of his brigade in November 1864.  Interestingly enough not much had changed in the Virginia theater. Union forces were still concentrating on the siege of Petersburg.  

Aboard his horse Chamberlain gallantly spurred his troops on again. His men, never realizing how uncomfortable he was, fought brilliantly and were involved in the very last action of the war. Although relatively generous in his surrender terms, Grant insisted on a formal surrender of the Confederate arms and colors before a representative of the Union army. He chose Chamberlain, a superb soldier and a man he rightly deemed of all great ability and character. Therefore, he handled the surrender with dignity and respect, with the 2 armies according each other the final salute of worthy opponents. 

Chamberlain’s wound ultimately required 4 subsequent surgeries. Little information is available regarding these procedures, but they could represent attempts at opening up the urethra from the growth excessive scar tissue within the urethra. This was the case for 3 of the procedures, including the first in February 1865, the second in 1866 and the fourth in 1893 in New York City. More information is available about the third repair performed in Boston in 1883. An article from The Portland Transcript dated April 25, 1883 details how, with Chamberlain under the influence of ether anesthesia, the fistula (opening in the urethra)  was closed by what appears to have been some kind of flap coverage procedure. Despite the optimistic description of the technique, surgery failed and the fistula remained open.

Throughout the rest of his life Chamberlain suffered constant pain in both hips and the lower abdomen in addition to recurrent infection and inflammation of the testicles and scrotum. These episodes would often send him away from his duties for extended periods of recovery during which his discomfort was unimaginable. We have no direct evidence as to whether Chamberlain was impotent but it is hard to imagine maintaining potency after the urethral disruption and multiple surgical procedures.


As with most great men the story never seems to end. Chamberlain returned to teaching for a short period and even served as President of Bowdoin College for a time. He found himself drawn to politics
and was urged by the Republican Party to run as candidate for Governor of Maine. Chamberlain won,
serving 4 distinguished terms. In 1914 Chamberlain died at the age of 85. The cause of death listed on Chamberlain's death certificate is ""a bacterial infection throughout his entire body probably caused originally by a urinary tract infection.”


CONCLUSIONS
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain survived smallpox, heat stroke, malaria, typhoid and tuberculosis. 
His horse was shot from under him 5 times and 6 times he was hit with rebel lead causing his obituary to be sent to the New York papers on 2 occasions. The most devastating injury was the pelvic wound, the complications of which he endured for almost 50 years. Despite this medical history, he engaged in
innumerable skirmishes and 24 battles, capturing 2,700 prisoners and 8 battle flags. He won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his effort at Gettysburg and was subsequently promoted to Major General. This former theology professor is not only among the most remarkable soldiers ever to serve, but also one of America's greatest heroes. His exploits under fire and later accomplishments despite his infirmities pay tribute to the men and women who fought to preserve and later expand the United States of America into the 20th century

This man was a true American hero and a badass.  In another interesting note to this amazing person, his Medal of Honor was lost and then [sub-sequentially found](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/09/13/chamberlains-lost-medal-of-honor-found-in-book.html)

sp00kybees,2018-02-16 07:53:44+00:00,[Effortish post] Are the Jazz the first team in NBA history to win 11 games in a row and not move up in the standings?,"**UPDATE**: Well alrighty folks, I'm glad this post seems to be well-received thus far, but I'm afraid I dun goofed. Over at basketball reference, the win streak list they provide requires one to infer that any win streak over 11 games implies that an 11-game winning streak was a thing for that team at one point. I failed to do this initially. So, there's some updatin' about to go down. First time readers, don't mind the strikethroughs and italicized additions to the list. Onto the good stuff.

---------------------------------

Short answer:

No.

Long answer:

**(TL;DR no, but still an impressive streak. The reasons may shock you!)**

I decided to only do 11-game winning streaks (so anything 12+ is out). No ABA or BAA. According to [this page](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/tstreak.cgi?request=1&amp;year_min=1947&amp;year_max=2018&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;team_id=&amp;opp_id=&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;is_current=&amp;is_overtime=&amp;game_location=&amp;c1stat=pts&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=opp_pts&amp;c2stat=&amp;c2comp=&amp;c2val=&amp;c3stat=&amp;c3comp=&amp;c3val=&amp;c4stat=&amp;c4comp=&amp;c4val=&amp;m1stat1=&amp;m1math=s&amp;m1stat2=&amp;m1comp=ge&amp;m1val=&amp;offset=100) on Basketball Reference, there have been ~~70~~ 185 such streaks in the NBA since ~~1954~~ 1950. Of these ~~70~~ 185, ~~10~~ 30 lasted through one season and into another. So, I voided those which brings it down to ~~60~~ 155. From here, I used [this page](https://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/standings.fcgi?month=2&amp;day=15&amp;year=2018&amp;lg_id=NBA) to find specific day standings.

So, of those ~~60~~ 155 streaks, ~~15~~ 38 teams were either at the top of their conference already or their streak began on the first game of the season. So these were voided, which brought the total down to ~~45~~ 117. Of the ~~45~~ 117 remaining 11-game winning streaks, there were ~~8~~ 16 where the team did not move up in the standings (keep in mind that I used the standings from the day after the 11th win, since the update is reflected next day) **[italics indicates newly added team in update]**:

1. *Rochester Royals*, 1949-1950 season. From February 17th through March 11th they stayed in the 2nd seed behind Minneapolis while improving from 36-17 to 47-17.

2. *Cincinnati Royals*, 1963-64 season. From January 30th through February 16th they stayed in the 2nd seed behind Boston while improving from 33-19 to 44-19.

3. Boston Celtics, 1966-67 season. From January 16th through February 1st they stayed in the 2nd seed behind Philadelphia while improving from 30-12 to 41-12.

4. New York Knicks, 1972-73 season. From December 28th through January 16th they stayed in the 2nd seed behind Boston while improving from 28-10 to 39-10.

5. *Milwaukee Bucks*, 1972-73 season. From February 28th through March 22nd they stayed in the 2nd seed behind LAL while improving from 46-22 to 57-22.

6. *Boston Celtics*, 1980-81 season. From January 4th through January 23rd they stayed in the 2nd seed behind Philadelphia while improving from 30-9 to 41-9.

7. *Philadelphia 76ers*, 1984-85 season. From December 22nd through January 13th they stayed in the 2nd seed behind Boston while improving from 20-6 to 31-6.

8. Milwaukee Bucks, 1984-85 season. From January 9th through February 2nd they stayed in the 3rd seed behind Boston and Philadelphia while improving from 23-14 to 34-14.

9. Dallas Mavericks, 1987-88 season. From February 14th through March 4th they stayed in the 2nd seed behind LAL while improving from 29-17 to 40-17.

10. *Houston Rockets*, 1990-91 season. From March 3rd through March 23rd they stayed in the 6th seed behind Portland, LAL, Utah, Phoenix, and San Antonio while improving from 32-24 to 43-24.

11. Detroit Pistons, 2004-05 season. From March 30th through April 19th they stayed in the 2nd seed behind Miami while improving from 43-27 to 54-27.

12. Phoenix Suns, 2005-06 season. From February 8th through March 6th they stayed in the 3rd seed behind Dallas and San Antonio while improving from 31-17 to 42-17.

13. Cleveland Cavaliers, 2008-09 season. From November 22nd through December 12th they stayed in the 2nd seed behind Boston while improving from 9-3 to 20-3.

14. *Denver Nuggets*, 2012-13 season. From February 23rd through March 15th they stayed in the 5th seed behind San Antonio, Oklahoma City, LAC, and Memphis while improving from 34-22 to 45-22.

15. *San Antonio Spurs*, 2015-16 season. From December 26th through January 17th they stayed in the 2nd seed behind Golden State while improving from 25-6 to 36-6.

16. Utah Jazz, 2017-18 season. From January 24th through February 14th they stayed in the *10th seed* behind Golden State, Houston, San Antonio, Minnesota, Oklahoma City, New Orleans, Portland, Denver, and LAC while improving from 19-28 to 30-28.

Takeaway: this has definitely happened before, but the most impressive part about this is that, within these ~~8~~ 16 occurrences, most teams were either in the 2nd or 3rd seed to start their streak, with one team in 5th and one in 6th, making the Jazz by far the lowest seed to pull an 11-game win streak off while staying put. In fact, they are the 2nd lowest seed in conference play (next to the 2016-17 Heat team that started a 13 game tear in the 14th seed at 11-30) to ever to start a win streak and bring it to 11 wins in a row. Of all ~~45~~ 117 streaks recorded where the team wasn’t already in the top spot or the streak started 1st game of the season, there were two teams in the 9th seed (also impressive) when they started their streak: Phoenix in 1996-97 and Minnesota in 2000-01. Respectively, they moved up to 7th and 6th seeds after 11 straight wins.

pdxcranberry,2018-02-04 16:51:53+00:00,I’ll Poop Wherever I Like,"This sub is a dream to me. I have experiences like this constantly. I think it might be due to having spent 17 years in the service industry. I just have that look. I’ve started wearing earbuds everywhere I go, but obviously that’s not something I can do in restaurants and bars. 

My buddy was taking me out to a fancy French restaurant as a treat and I was pretty gussied up. I really enjoy getting dolled up and wearing a beautiful dress to enjoy a wonderful meal. However, the city in which I live (Portland, Oregon) has a reputation for diners dressing down, even in fine dining restaurants. It’s a running joke among locals. You’ll go into a restaurant where a couple will easily drop a couple hundo on one meal and over half the room are wearing hiking clothes or yoga pants. I only mention this because the staff tends to be better dressed than the clientele. I was wearing all black with my hair in an elaborate up-do and chandelier earrings. I think the all black is what started everything.

This particular restaurant has a well-known (and frankly down-right foxy) chef who typically works at a station expoing and plating where everybody can see him. It’s also near the door to the only washroom and the server station. It’s a huge restaurant and with only the one washroom, there was a bit of a line. I waited and waited and at one point I think the chef and I exchanged a few pleasantries. When I was next in line a middle-aged man in a Portland-issue plaid button up and jeans got in line behind me. He had cranky energy and was shifting from foot-to-foot. It didn’t seem like he had to go badly, just that he was impatient. I had been waiting much, much longer than him and found his constant sighing and scoffing irritating.

When it was my turn I reached for the door only to have this awful man push in front of me and nearly knock me over shoving himself into the open door. I was so taken aback I just sort of froze and said, “excuse me I was next.” Which is when he wheeled around started YELLING about how he wasn’t about to wait while, “some waitress changed her tampon.” And then yelled at the chef that he should have a staff bathroom, because it’s “disgusting” that the staff use the same bathroom as guests and implied he might not pay for his meal because of it. 

I stood there in absolute shock (and a full bladder) while this man took care of his business. Clearly taking his sweet time out of spite. Maybe. Something about his personality made me think he hadn’t taken a normal shit in years. The chef apologized to me and a waiter who had been at the server station commiserated. 

I decided fuck it. I DON’T work here, but even if I did there is no reason to be treated like I’m not a human. Seriously, dude. You’re wearing muddy Teva sandals and suddenly acting like we’re in fucking Downton Abbey. 

When he came out I used my entire body to block his path out of the bathroom and gave him a stern, but quiet lecture about how a) I actually wasn’t an employee and b) there is nothing wrong with sharing the bathroom with the staff and told him that he had ruined what should have been a special night out. 

Again, this all happened in full view of the entire kitchen staff and several members of the wait staff. I hadn’t realized it at time, but this jerk was actually seated directly next to my friend on the banquet. His female dining companion was sitting next to me. I had been gone easily twenty minutes and my friend was confused and annoyed. I figured at that point I had nothing to lose, so I loudly explained what happened while gesturing to the awful man and making pointed eye contact with the woman. The man looked furious and the woman just silently glared at him.

After a few minutes the waiter wordlessly dropped their check. They were mid-meal and hadn’t been offered dessert. It was clearly a very pointed, but polite, “fuck you, get out” from the staff after his rant. They paid without incident and as they got up to leave he tried to put his hand on her shoulder only to have her jerk away and say, “don’t touch me.” TFW you realize your partner is a complete jackass who got you thrown out of a restaurant for screaming about tampons. 

We got a cheese plate and glasses of sparkling rose as a gift from the restaurant. Cheers!",IDontWorkHereLady,10666

The original in Spanish can be found [here](http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2102340-agradezco-el-carino-pero-no-estar-en-el-all-star-es-lo-mas-justo). This is a rough translation into English:

------

""I really appreciate and I’m thankful for the time and effort that everyone gave to get me into the All-Star Game. I understand the people’s love and I’m encouraged by so much generosity, but I didn’t deserve to be even close to that game. It’s a show for players who have a better present than I do, like Curry, Harden, Westbrook, Klay Thompson, Jimmy Butler, Lillard, McCollum, Lou Williams, Chris Paul… They deserve it more, simple as that. I already had my opportunities and I enjoyed them, because it’s fantastic to be part of it, but now it’s time for others. An All-Star Game is not an honorary award for your career, it’s not an Oscar or a Martín Fierro **(Translator's note: An award for Argentinian media, a local version of the Oscars)*. It’s an award for the best players of the season.

I must confess that in the beginning, when all this All-Star campaign started, I found it funny that some people were convinced that I deserved to be there. If you look, stripped of all emotions, at how the NBA develops, the numbers, and the influence of certain players in their teams, you realize there was no chance for me to get in. When this voting campaign started to grow, when it stopped being something from my usual followers, and people from the football National Team, the president, and people from Argentinian TV entered the scene, I started to get worried because I didn’t know what to do with all that support.

The good thing about this story is that the NBA changed the All-Star voting system some years ago, allowing choices to be more balanced. Before the fan vote was mainly considered, and now they added the vote from the players themselves and the media. That looked to me like a correct decision, because it gives an impression of legitimacy for the participants. If the main actors don’t vote for you and neither do those who analyze the game, then something is up. I value people’s affection, especially from those in Argentina, but it’s good that the NBA has this rule because it allows that players having the best season get into the starting five, and not only the most popular players. In short, I appreciate the love from everybody, but not being an All-Star is fair.

Now that all that madness is behind, I go back to focus on the injury I suffered the other day against Atlanta. I got scared at first, because my leg had never reacted like that. When I got to the locker room, my quadriceps was swollen up. I’ve had other similar bruises, but this one worried me because I had a big edema. However, the swelling went down and I relaxed. Now I’ll start running and shooting the ball, as my intention is to be tomorrow back again on the court, against Indiana.

I’ve been enjoying myself, truth be told, and that’s why I want to play. I’m at a moment where my confidence is helping me, and for that reason I had games where I scored a lot. For moments last year I never found my shot. And the same happened at the start of this season, because I was helping the team but not scoring anything. During the last games things changed, although it’s clear that, with Kawhi being out, the ball is in the hands of others and that gave me confidence too. With the closings against Boston and Dallas, plus the games where I scored more points, like Phoenix and Portland, I went through a nice moment that didn’t happen to me since a long time. I got into that kind of streak and I enjoyed a lot. With my feet on the ground, but I enjoyed it. Logically, knowing that these moments are part of the highs of a season which also has lows. 

In that context, I know that the schedule comes into play, which is a bit complicated and weird. The NBA improved a lot the situation with the back-to-back games, which went from 17 to 14, but this year we had trips of six or seven days before returning home. And that happened a couple of times. Luckily, yesterday we played the Toronto Raptors in our last away game of this tour and now we stay in San Antonio for several days. This will help us regroup a lot. Not only from the physical aspect, but mental too, because it’s good to stay at home, get some fresh air and relax… We can even train a little. I think this is going to help us out before going into the Rodeo Trip.

This season is a bit strange because of the injuries we’ve had. I think I’ve never witnessed a season like this one, with our main guy, Leonard, playing two games and resting another two or three to recover and feel better. This is a team built to play around him. We can’t find a balance. I think that we're doing okay defensively and that has kept us where we are. But offensively we are having trouble scoring the ball. Anyway, we have been supported by the terrific season LaMarcus has been having, and his performance has kept us in a lot of games. But we are missing points and we obviously miss the healthy Kawhi, not the one that plays two games and can’t play the next two. We have to wait for him to get better, so he can play the 30 or 35 minutes that the team needs from him to play as it should.

But it’s not only about Kawhi, because we also suffered the injury of Kyle Anderson this season; when he came back, Rudy Gay got injured, and he is our second top scorer; after that was Danny Green, who had pain in an adductor muscle… It was all really strange. Pop was experimenting a bit to see with what he played. This doesn’t allow us to be as stable as we’d want. We are contending nonetheless, far from Golden State though. But we are among the top teams and with a good record of win and losses. There are still more than 30 games left and we have time to get ready for what is important, the playoffs, and that is essential for this team. Our objective is focused there.""

&gt; ""I think it's a million things that say that's not true,"" Lillard replied. ""I think for me personally, I don't think market size matters as much as it used to because of social media and all that stuff. I have a signature shoe that does well. I got a social media following; there's a lot of people following my music. There's a lot of things that I've been able to be successful at while playing in a small market because of social media. But I still think playing in a big market, there's a difference in a big market and a small market. That's just the way it will always be. You can't look at Memphis and New York City and say, 'Oh, well, if you're a star, you're a star.'""

On the infographic:

&gt; ""I try to speak on that stuff to a minimum because I don't want to look too sensitive,"" Lillard said to ESPN. ""My issue is, when I see something is wrong, I have to [address it], so it comes off as sensitive or overly bothered. I might be a little bit bothered, but it really ain't that deep. So I try to minimize it as much as possible so people don't ever get the wrong idea. But the thing is, it just happens to be me [getting left out] a lot of the time, so I'm just like, 'Man, what's going on?' I'm like, 'Yo, what's going on?' You know? That's like something simple. There's a lot [of] records that's like your first couple years in the NBA [and you made] this amount of 3s. I hold a lot of those records. So if we're speaking of records where I'm the previous record-holder, why wouldn't I be on there? And that's something small. I didn't even think about it that long other than when I mentioned it. So, it's whatever.""

Also comments on Lonzo getting more votes:

&gt; ""He plays for the Los Angeles Lakers, one of the most, if not the most, storied franchises in that big of a market,"" Lillard explained to ESPN. ""So, so many people are going to support him throughout that, and also with his dad and all the attention that's been surrounding him since college.

But he looked like an casual fan and didn't really understand the concept of the trade has to look like a Win at the moment of trade for both teams. If you think your team is losing with the trade what's the point of it?

But let's recognize it's not easy to suggest trades in r/nba . Fan bases numerous times overstate the value of their players and there are player haters everywhere.

&amp;nbsp;

Movable trade pieces: Shumpert SG, Frye C

Assets: Love PF/C , Osman SF, Zizic C, 

Draft Assets: 2018 Nets 1st OR 2018 Cavs 1st, 2020 Heat 2nd rounder, 2021/22/2023/24 Cavs 1st, 2023/24 Cavs 2nd rounder.

&amp;nbsp;

**What are we looking for**

Wings. Modelling the team to beat Golden State.

**What challenges are presented to us?** 

1. I believe Love in many ways is redundant to LeBron in his best abilities.
2. I believe that the Cavs don't have a lot of movable pieces AKA Tristan Thompson to combine with that Nets.
3. The Cavs don't have a lot of assets, so you got to be creative with trades.
4. The Cavs are in vunurable position so they may have to overpay in trades.

**My End game**

Getting a death lineup of Thomas, Crowder, X, Y and LeBron. Where X and Y are capable shooters and good defenders, while also having options on the bench to always have such players on the floor

&amp;nbsp;

**Trade 1A**

Atlanta Hawks receive: JR Smith + Osman + Zizic + Cavs remove all protections from 2019 pick - It becomes unprocted
Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Kent Bazemore
http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=y8vhls6o  
&amp;nbsp;

Why does the Hawks do it?

Before anything remember: JR Smith's 2019-20 contract is only 3 million guaranteed. Osman and Zizic are young players going to a rebuild team. Zizic is a guy that was pretty hyped last year in Europe and Osman 3 and D upside makes sense in Hawks time line. 

They also now have a guaranteed 1st round pick in 2019, what makes it easier to plan their future while they might being sit in a gold mine if things fall apart in Cleveland like the last time LeBron left. 2019 Draft is likely to have 2 classes (out of HS players might be able to declare, so that gives premium value in 2019 draft picks) Bazemore has a enormous contract and is set to make 37.3 million dollars in the next 2 seasons while being 29 yo in the first month of July.

Why does the Cavs do it?

Like I said, get creative with assets. Using their protections as an asset is useful as well because now Cavs get 2 new assets to trade: 2021 and 2022 2nd rounders are in full unconditioned own of the Cleveland Cavaliers.

That might be an overpay, so the Cavs might consider asking for more in return like Belinelli or a future 2nd rounder, but if they don't get it it's ok, Bazemore is a solid player and freeing up the . This also forces Cleveland to at least trying to contend in 2019 even if LeBron leaves, what seems possible and we have to keep in mid in future trades.

&amp;nbsp;

**Trade 1B:**

Hawks Receive: JR Smith, Osman, Zizic, Frye (expiring) + Removing protections 2019 pick
Cavs receive: Bazemore and Belinelli

add: http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=y75arcph

Same as last trade, but now Hawks pay a little bit more. I will move on with 1A because it's more likely.

&amp;nbsp;

 **Trade 2A**

Magic receive: Shumpert, Frye + 2021 Cavs first rounder + 2021 Cavs secound rounder
Cavs receive: Evan Fournier

http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=ycg9lspo 

This goes against my: ""don't a trade a pick that the player you're trading for is not likely to be contributing when it conveys"", but Fournier is signed until 2019-20 and does have a PO in 2020-21, so he might be there.

**Why does the magic do It?**

Receiving a first and a second for Fournier is solid value, shumpert is 27 so maybe they can make his value go up and trade him at the deadline next year for a contender, Frye is back, but he's just an expiring. They could add Speights in that deal to equilibrate the roster spots.

(top 12 protected, top 10 protected in 2022, conveys to 2023 and 2024 second rounders)

Why does the Cavs do it? 

Founier is a good playmaker and 3 point shooter, while an decent defender with good size.

**Trade 2B**

If the trade 1 doesn't go down, shumpert + osman + zizic + future second might be enough value for acquiring Fournier.

&amp;nbsp;

The Following trades are of players rumored to be moved, whose value I believe to be:

[**Trade 2C**](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=yb7d2ary)

Portland acquires: Shumpert + 2021 1st rounder (more heavily protected, top-20)

Cleveland acquires: Moe Harkless

[**Trade 2D**](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=ybna95cy)

Jazz acquires: Shumpert + Frye + 2021 1st rounder (same protections as 2A) + 2021 Cavs secound rounder

Cleveland acquires: Alec Burks + Epke Udoh

(Edit: Sefolosha out for the season)

&amp;nbsp;

**Trade 3**

We're out of movable trade pieces. So now it's time to acquire more of these, alongside some assets trading Kevin Love. But this is hard, because it's hard to figure out a team that would want to trade for him. So let's go with a team that already tried to.

Nuggets receive: Kevin Love + Calderón (Salary) + Trade Exception of 3.5kk for Barton

Cavs receive: Will Barton, Keneth Faried, Wilson Chandler + 2018 Nuggets 1st rounder

http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=yba4jekp

&amp;nbsp;

That's a tough one, I do believe it'd easier to make this happen if the Cavs acquired Belinelli from the Atlanta Hawks in the first trade.

Nuggets was up for trading Harris + pieces+ 13rd pick on a loaded draft, Now is pretty much pieces + a non lottery pick.

**Why Nuggets do it?**

Great player going forward for cheap. Nuggets try to consolidate value, paying Barton might be hard after Jokic and Harris new contracts, and if Chandler opts out for his last big check at age 31 he'd probably be gone as well. With a good pool of talent that 1st rounder might not be that valuable to them, so it might be seem as 2 expirings + a 1st rounder for a big upgrade on Faried for Love. Faried game probably won't age nearly as well as Love's game will, and he's only  1 year younger than love, so going forward would be solid value. 

The big problem here is: Depth at SF for Nuggets and Trey Lyles. That trade going forward might take some minutes from Lyles when Millsap comes back, and trading Chandler, who plays 30 minutes a game, 75% of them at 3 spot, makes them lose 23 minutes at SF. That's problematic because the teams lack depth at the position, their option would have to be going Nuclear on Gary Harris at 3, giving some minutes at the position for Love, Lyles, Beasley and Millsap, what's not farfetched, since Faried is averaging some minutes at 3 as well.

Cavs making a move for Thabo Sefolosha (For a secound rounder) and including him on this trade may make more likely, but Nuggets could act on their own to get a substitute.

&amp;nbsp;

**Why do the Cavs do it?**

To make a move for a great wing. Faried and Chandler at 12M a year is solid value, and Barton is a interesting piece going Forward for a lot of teams. Nuggets 1st rounder is more to work with. Making more for moves.

&amp;nbsp;

**Trade 4** - The most unlikely one, but possible.

Bucks receive: Will Barton, Faried, **Nets 2018 1st rounder**, Nuggets 2018 1st 
rounder, Heat 2020 2nd rounder and Cavs 2022 2nd rounder.

Cavs Receive: **Kris Middleton**

All-In.

http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=y7ja8db3 


&amp;nbsp;

**Why Bucks do it??**

WARNING this will be long: It's almost like a deal between these two teams: You contend now, I contend later. Trading the Brooklyn picks diminishes the Odds of the Cavs landing a great piece going forward if they by luck win the lottery, what could make Lebron stay and Cavs eastern kingdom last for longer. Instead they go win now mode, while Bucks take a forward approach, 3 years from (2021-22 season) now the player from that pick will probably be a great contribuitor. Giannis will still be 26, Parker will be 26 as well and the Warriors will be ending their dinasty, or at least be close to beatable. 

1. The Bucks should take a more forward aproach because the Warriors can't win forever.

2. **1 in 8 chances of land top 3**. This draft is front loaded, and It could very well have 3 ""Tier 1"" (Potential superstars as in: 2012 Davis, 2014 Wiggins, Parker, Embiid, 2015 KAT, 2016 Simmons, 2017 Fultz &amp; Ball) players. Pairing Giannis and Parker with that kind of talent might be 1 in 8 chances of starting a dinasty 3 years from now. No other team has had 3 tier 1 talents since Chad Ford started to write down this kind of groups.

3. This Draft : Superstar potential in DeAndre Ayton massive upside, Marvin Bagley III motor, size and mobility, Trae Young great shooting along transcedental passing and playmaking, while MPJr. might be an risk worth taking, and even if you don't believe Doncic superstar potential you have to admit he has an perennial all star ceiling. Nets pick right now is most likely to land in no. 7, while having a 12.7% chance to be in the top 3 (but keep in mid the no. 6 has a 21.5% chance), 1 of Bamba or Jaren Jackson Jr. is supposed to be here and would be a great fit in Bucks. 

4. ‎It's a business. Selling a player at it's higher possible value just makes sense. Middleton is 26 with a good contract going forward and proven value. With Jabari Parker back, Middleton won't be able to play at his best position and will also see his role on offense reduced. Many redditors at talking about trading Jabari, but is it really the best move to sell a injured player at his last half year of rookie contract? Parker value has never been lower during his NBA career.

5. Bucks need guards. Barton is a great player who probably won't gather great attention in the FA and could go for cheap

6. ‎Faried gives Bucks 1 athletic big with more than 15 pounds or muscle, who they currently lack. 

7. ‎ Nuggets pick right now is at 15, but with Love's addiction it could move up to early 20s. Cavs, Wolves, Spurs, Rox, Ws, Raps, C's are all locks to be ahead of them, so at max It would a 23 pick. 17-23 pick are solid value, differently than an late 20 where the draft usually gets ""flat"" although guys like Kuzma and Butler sometime come out of it. 

&amp;nbsp;

You know who could go to Bucks in this trade as well? Rose, if he agrees to (can Rose be traded to a place he don't want to go? Not sure) Milwaukee could offer a most important role for him while it's closer to home in Chicago and he could still go to playoffs. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Trades to evaluate**

Trade bad contract for bad contracts is all we have left.

**Tristan Thompson for Bismarck Biyombo**

Similar contracts for overpaid players, both at the same position drafted in the same year. Thompson sometimes shows a little more of upside putting the ball on the flor and trying to get a bucket, but it's a rare things. A change of scenario could benefit both teams going forward, specially if Magic see in Jonathan Isaac the capacit to do a little bit of what Biyombo does. 

&amp;nbsp;

Let's say all of it gets done 1A, 2A, 3 &amp; 4. That would be a Nucleus of 



Guards | Wings | Bigs
---|---|----
Thomas| James | Biyombo
Wade| Middleton | 
Fournier | Crowder| 
Rose | Chandler| 
 | Korver | 
 | Bazemore | 
 | Green| 


Chasing a possible buyout in Greg Monroe would give them some depth at center. Another possibility is asking for Mo Speights in that Magic trade for Fournier.

Many of the trade proposal could be an overpay in terms of value acquired, but some of these just aren't in the trading block and teams would want a lot to get rid of them.

&amp;nbsp;

So, What do you think of my proposals? Can these core compete better against the Dubs?

glansberg_stephen,2017-12-15 23:59:49+00:00,What would the NBA look like if the #1 and #2 picks from the last 20 drafts were reversed?,"I'm a big fan of what-ifs. The NBA draft is arguably one of the easiest sources of what-ifs, and I found myself today thinking how different the league might look if Portland had taken Kevin Durant instead of Seattle (sorry Blazer bros). Got me to wondering how the league would look if some other drafts were flipped.

1998:
#1 - Clippers - Mike Bibby
#2 - Grizzlies - Michael Olowakandi
This does not change much historically. Grizzlies never get Bibby, which means Sacramento never gets Bibby, which maybe means that the Lakers don't have the big, tough rival Kings to deal with (though J-Will was awesome). Grizzlies get the shittiest kandi a kid can think of.

1999:
#1 - Bulls - Steve Francis
#2 - Grizzlies - Elton Brand
Another draft where the end result didn't truly matter either way. In real life, Francis pouted his way out of Vancouver before ever suiting up, eventually heading to Houston. I think if the Bulls take him, he ends up playing for Chicago for a bit. No backcourt mob with him and Cat Mobley. Memphis, meanwhile, would be trotting out a Kandiman - Elton Brand... AKA the exact line-up the Clippers sucked with a few years later. 

2000:
#1 - Nets - Stromile Swift
#2 - Grizzlies - Kenyon Martin
Take note: Grizz have had the #2 pick three years in a row. Christ. It hurt me having to think about Stromile Swift being the first overall pick in any draft ever (though his dunks were on point). K-Mart to the Grizzlies means they now have drafted three big men in a row. Sixers fans know what I'm talking about.

2001:
#1 - Wizards - Tyson Chandler
#2 - Clippers - Kwame Brown
Overall, the Wiz still wiff on this pick, with Pau Gasol coming off the board at #3. But Tyson is and has been infinitely better than Kwame, even if Kwame kind of got shit on unfairly during his career. This would be sooooooo mid-2000's clippers though to end up with Kwame. Instead they used Chandler to trade for Elton Brand in real life.

2002:
#1 - Houston - Jay Williams
#2 - Chicago - Yao Ming
This is probably the first draft that has some legitimate implications. Yao is a franchise-altering big. And Williams had moments as a potential stud point guard during his rookie year. Honestly, who knows if either player gets hurt in this scenario. Remember, Houston doesn't have Francis in this scenario, so Jay Williams and Mobley would form a nice backcourt. Of course, they'd rather have Yao. and Chicago gets a STUD to eventually pair with Hinrich, Deng, Gordon, etc. Also fat Eddy Curry has to move to the bench in this scenario

2003: 
#1 - Cavaliers - Darko Milicic
#2 - Pistons - LeBron James
hahahahahahahaha holy shit hahahahahahahahahahaha
But really. Cavs fans would be on suicide watch. They had already had a very rough last ten years leading up to this draft. Darko would be the nail in the coffin. And Pistons fans? Imagine Chauncey, Rip, LeBron, Rasheed, and Ben Wallace with Tayshaun off the bench. Is that 70 wins year in and year out? Fuckin A. Obviously this never would have happened but it's fun to imagine I suppose

2004: 
#1 - Magic - Emeka Okafor
#2 - Bobcats - Dwight Howard
While the Magic never won a title, it's hard to imagine them being relevant with Okafor at all, even though he was an incredibly serviceable big man for a long while. Charlotte gets the perfect building block to start their rebuild; maybe they are still the Bobcats if Dwight leads them to success, and maybe no one hates Dwight Howard. Eh or maybe everyone still does

2005: 
#1 - Bucks - Marvin Williams
#2 - Hawks - Andrew Bogut
One of the blander Top 2's. I suppose you could make the case that Bogut going to Atlanta means no Bogut going to the Dubs, which maybe means no Warriors dynasty. Maybe. Bucks would have been pissed with Marvin Williams. Hawks may have been fun though; Bogut's play style was similar to Horfords back in the day in regards to passing out of the high post (obviously not the shooter Horford was/is). Hawks don't change too much I don't think

2006:
#1 - Raptors - LaMarcus Aldridge
#2 - Bulls - Andrea Bargnani
Of course, the Bulls ended up trading Aldridge to Portland for Tyrus Thomas (ow). Bulls fans, would you rather have had Tyrus Thomas or Andrea Bargnani? I'll take a pair of adidas socks and some beats by dre over either guy, thank you. Raptors are scary as shit though. Aldridge + Bosh? that's V E R S A T I L I T Y. Maybe Bosh never goes to Miami, and there is no big three (also, LeBron is in Detroit killing it so he ain't leaving). 

2007: 
#1 - Blazers - Kevin Durant
#2 - Sonics - Greg Oden
So, in this scenario, Portland does not have Aldridge; instead they have Tyrus fucking Thomas. BUT they still have Brandon Roy. So we get at least a few good years of Roy - Durant, which is absolute dynamite. Maybe a lesser scoring load means Roy's knees hold up longer. Who knows. For the Sonics, it's a punch in the nuts. I've been saying injuries may not have happened in different scenarios for some of these guys, but I believe Oden would have been hurt no matter where he ended up. But maybe by not having Durant, the Sonics/Thunder would have kept Harden, meaning we still see a Harden/Westbrook backcourt. Could there have been some Durant/Roy vs. Harden/Westbrook matchups? I'm sad there wasn't.

2008:
#1 - Bulls - Michael Beasley
#2 - Heat - Derrick Rose
At this point, the big three in Miami probably isn't happening, as LBJ is in Detroit winning titles and Bosh is leading Toronto deep in the playoffs with Lamarcus by his side. So Wade needs a side-kick. How about another dynamic, slashing guard? No one would be able to contain a Rose/Wade backcourt; it would have been disgusting. The Bulls would have been fucked. Now they have Beasley, Deng, Hinrich, and Yao. Solid squad... but not a contender like they were with Rose.

2009:
#1 - Clippers - Hasheem Thabeet
#2 - Grizzles - Blake Griffin
If this exercise has taught me anything, it's that things could have been much worse for the Clippers. In our scenario, we have the Clips ending up with Thabeet and Kwame Brown as top 2 draft picks. Fuck. Clips bball would still be dead today. Grizz would be nice, pairing Griffin with Marc Gasol and Mike Conley. that's a championship contending trio right there.

2010:
#1 - Wizards - Evan Turner
#2 - 76ers - John Wall
Process? fuck the process! Sixers wouldn't need to tank, as a team with John Wall, Jrue Holiday, and Andre Iguodala would be supremely athletic. That might not be a title nucleus, but they'd be a perennial playoff team for years. The Wizards... not so much. I mean, maybe Turner gets a chance to shine as the lone scoring option, but his inability to shoot would have hindered him wherever he ended up. Wiz would be screwed.

2011:
#1 - Cavs - Derrick Williams
#2 - Timberwolves - Kyrie Irving
Man Cavs really getting dicked here. No LeBron, and now no Kyrie. But hey, Derrick Williams! Crazy to think that these two guys went back-to-back; ones out of the league and ones a bonafide star. Minnesota has a Kyrie - Love tandem, which is funny. And Cleveland continues to be horrific, all the time. That Mo Williams - Derrick Williams - Darko trio would have been lit

2012: 
#1 - Hornets - Michael Kidd-Gilchrist
#2 - Bobcats - Anthony Davis
Hey! Bobcats score a stud! In our redraft, the Bobcats have gotten AD and Dwight in an 8 year span. Im retroactively ordering bobcats gear as we speak. The hornets get Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, which is who he currently plays for, but the Hornets are the Pelicans and the Bobcats are the Hornets so... yup.

2013:
#1 - Cavs - Victor Oladipo
#2 - Magic - Anthony Bennett
The Cavs finally get their superstar. Oladipo has proven to be the best player in the NBA this season and, possibly, the best player of all time. Can't believe the Magic eventually traded the GOAT for half a season of Serge Ibaka. For the Magic, this is sad, and also not happy. They get Bennett, who enjoys those Florida eats and balloons to 430lbs. Nothing magical about that.

2014:
#1 - Cavs - Jabari Parker
#2 - Bucks - Andrew Wiggins
Jabari has been great when he's healthy. He just hasn't been healthy. Are the Bucks dramatically better with Wiggins running next to Giannis? Maybe. I think he'd be dynamite as the second option there. A Wiggins/Middleton/Giannis wing trio is long as shit. For the Cavs, they now get Jabari to pair with Oladipo, which is a lot of athleticism and a lot of posters. 

2015:
#1 - Timberwolves - D'Angelo Russell
#2 - Lakers - Karl-Anthony Towns
Remember, in this scenario the Wolves have Kevin Love and Kyrie already. Russell would be pretty great as a combo guard next to Kyrie, but that backcourt defense would be a turnstyle. The Lakers get a year of KAT+Kobe, and then can begin to rebuild around an absolute stud. Not even Earvin himself could fuck that up

2016:
#1 - 76ers - Brandon Ingram
#2 - Lakers - Ben Simmons
Sixers fans, don't freak. You still have Embiid in this set-up. Ingram is not Simmons, but he's been pretty solid this year and could still turn into a stud. His scoring would look real nice on Philly. For the Lakers, Simmons + Towns is the best young core in the NBA. Durable and dominant.

2017:
76ers - Lonzo Ball
Lakers - Markelle Fultz
LaVar Ball is so fuckin pissed. But now the Sixers have a big baller to play next to Embiid. Is a Ball/Covington/Ingram/Saric/Embiid team a playoff contender? I think so. For the Lakers, maybe their organization doesn't rush a kid out onto the court who can't shoot without looking like your chubby friend at the rec. 

TL;DR - The league looks pretty different",nba,1094

Morezingis,2017-12-12 20:32:24+00:00,[OC] Every team's best lineup so far in the 17-18 Season - December Edition.,"Using this [Stat Tracker from NBA.COM](https://stats.nba.com/lineups/advanced/?sort=TEAM_ABBREVIATION&amp;dir=-1) I managed to compile every team's best line up.
3 big factors are at play here. Offensive Rating, Defensive Rating, and True Shooting.

NET RATING is the positive or negative difference between the ORTG and DRTG.

Sample size matters, but it is not the definitive factor. If a rarely used lineup has posted astronomical numbers, I may choose them over the team's second best. It's all situational.

This is the second edition. [I did the first back in the beginning of November.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7bxh8n/oc_every_teams_best_lineup_so_far_in_the_1718/) If it takes off as well as the first one did, I can do it twice more this season, too.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Atlanta Hawks:** L.Babbitt, K.Bazemore, D.Dedmon, T.Prince, D.Schroder

I mean... there isn't much to work with here. At 71 minutes, this is the Hawks most used lineup, but a +3.1 NET RTG is nothing to get excited about. Swapping out Dedmon for Collins makes them far better on offense, but far worse on defense. 

With Dedmon: 107 ORTG, 104 DRTG. 61% TS.

With Collins: 129 ORTG, 120 DRTG. 73% TS.

Personally, I'd go with the Collins unit just because you need to get your rookie experience, but with only 6 games played together, there isn't enough sample size to say it's definitely their best option.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Boston Celtics:** A.Baynes, J.Brown, A.Horford, K.Irving, M.Smart

This is easily the Celtics best lineup. Having appeared in 7 games, this group has posted a Net RTG of 51.8. For comparison, their most used lineup, which swaps out Tatum for Smart, puts up a NET RTG of +16.3. The Tatum lineups offer offense on the same level, but it's the defense that puts this one over. In fact, it's the best defensive lineup in the NBA.

People who wonder why Celtics fans love Marcus despite his shooting woes will tell you its his hustle on the defensive end, and it shows with a 73 DRTG. Tatum will get you the shot you need. Smart will get you the stop you need. It's all situational and both are deadly. 

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Brooklyn Nets:** D.Carroll, A.Crabbe, S.Dinwiddie, R.Hollis-Jefferson, T.Zeller

None of the above names are particularly sexy. You won't be carrying anyone to a title with Spencer Dinwiddle leading the way, and I'm not even sure which Zeller brother this is. Still, the stats don't lie. As Brooklyn's most used lineup, they've had the most chances to screw up their numbers. They haven't. A +25.2 NET RTG, thanks in large part to a stifling defense, has led this group to success. I'm interested in seeing what they can do with Russell mixed in.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Charlotte Hornets:** D.Howard, M.Kidd-Gilchrist, J.Lamb, K.Walker, M.Williams

The Hornets don't have any exceptional lineups, but they at least have consistency when it comes to this lineup. Their second most used group puts up a modest 13.5 NET RTG and puts up a DRTG above league average at 100.6. 

All 3 of Charlotte's best lineups use Dwight Howard. 

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Chicago Bulls:** J.Grant, J.Holiday, R.Lopez, L.Markkanen, D.Nwaba

Chicago has just five qualified groups. All of their starting lineups are a black hole of efficiency and every lineup uses some combination of Lopez and Holiday. They had two options here - one using Dunn and one using Grant. The one with Dunn offers a solid ORTG of 110 and good defense. The one with Grant offers exceptional defense and has twice as much playtime. So I went with that one.

A DRTG of 86.3 is serious. This lineup doesn't score much, but it still posts a NET RTG of +13.7. You could go either way, honestly, as the Dunn lineup has far better shooting numbers. They're just not tested enough.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Cleveland Cavaliers:** C.Frye, J.Green, L.James, K.Korver, D.Wade

Hear me out, dammit. At 70 minutes, this is the Cavs second most used lineup. Defensively, the Cavs usually suck, but this group turns them into the fucking 1988 Pistons for some reason. They've posted a 90.2 DRTG together to go with a 117 ORTG and 62% TS. Compare that to the starting lineup, which posted a 108 DRTG.  

When you need points, however, James/Wade/Love/Smith/Korver is the way to go. A 129 ORTG on 67% True Shooting will get the job done. I'm excited for the return of Thomas to integrate into their offensive units.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Dallas Mavericks:** J.Barea, Y.Ferrell, D.Harris, D.Nowitzki, D.Powell

This lineup is incredible and Carlisle knows it. I like Dennis Smith, and I'm excited to watch him grow, but this is arguably the best lineup in the NBA - just as they were the last time I posted it. In 94 minutes, their 2nd most used group, they've posted a NET RTG of +42.8 anchored by a 74.4 DRTG! 

The Mavs main unit(106 minutes) of Barnes/Kleber/Matthews/Nowitzki/Smith is a -8.6 NET with a 116 DRG. If the Mavs are truly tanking, expect their usage to rise.

But if they want to win a chip, go with that first lineup.  

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Denver Nuggets:** W.Chandler, G.Harris, N.Jokic, P.Millsap, J.Murray
 
At 224 minutes, this is the 8th most used lineup in the NBA. The fact that they've maintained a +12.0 NET RTG with that much playtime is impressive. it was their best lineup the first time I ran this OC, too. 

Among all lineups with 200 minutes played, only the Warriors starters have played better.

Statistically, there are stronger Nuggets lineups. Swapping Barton for Harris jumps their NET RTG up to +31.7, but a 44 minute sample size just can't weight against the Harris lineup.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Detroit Pistons:** L.Galloway, L.Kennard, E.Moreland, I.Smith, A.Tolliver

A.Bradley, A.Drummond, T.Harris, R.Jackson, S.Johnson is the second most used unit in the NBA. They also might just be the Pistons worst lineup, posting a NET RTG of -7.5.

Detroit has 5 qualified lineups. All of them are negative except L.Galloway, L.Kennard, E.Moreland, I.Smith, A.Tolliver, which posted a slightly-above-the-line +2.1 NET RTG. SVG is allergic to experimentation.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Golden State Warriors:**  S.Curry, K.Durant, D.Green, Z.Pachulia, K.Thompson

I mean... what did you expect? It's the third quarter team. The warriors only have 4 lineups that have played more than 5 games together. This one is utilized 4x as much as the others, and for good reason. An ORTG of 120.1, a DRTG of 99.2, and an absurd 66% True Shooting make the starting lineup unstoppable. 

Not much else to say here. Warriors got their game down to a fine science. It's worth noting that the famous ""Death lineup"", swapping Zaza for Iggy, has been a negative this season. That's probably why they've only played 58 minutes together.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Houston Rockets:** R.Anderson, T.Ariza, C.Capela, E.Gordon, J.Harden

When CP3 gets more time under his belt, this is going to change. But as it stands, the Rockets most used lineup is also their best. At +22.3 NET, these five destroys the opposition.

For some strange reason, CP3 is in only one positive lineup, which swaps out Gordon for him. In 97 minutes, they are the team's worst DRTG lineup with a 122.1. Don't ask me why exchanging Eric Gordon for the best point guard defender in the league makes them worse on defense. The Rockets are weird, but my God are they good.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Indiana Pacers:**  B.Bogdanovic, C.Joseph, V.Oladipo, D.Sabonis, L.Stephenson

The Pacers have 14 freaking lineups. I'm not sure what's going on over there, but it's kind of fun to watch. The above lineup is the 6th best in the NBA. With a Net RTG of 40.9 over a 6 game sample size, this group is damn near unstoppable. Almost 70% True Shooting! 

That said, if you want a larger sample size, the most used lineup of B.Bogdanovic, D.Collison, V.Oladipo, M.Turner, T.Young is perfectly acceptable. While a 3.9 Net is nothing to call home about, they get the job done. 

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**LA Clippers:** P.Beverley, D.Gallinari, B.Griffin, D.Jordan, M.Teodosic

The Clippers can't keep a lineup on the damn floor. There is no large sample size to work with here so we're going to get the Clippers fans excited about their healthy future. This Teodosic lineup, which appeared in only two games this season, posted one of the 5 best NET RTG's in the NBA. An ORTG of 126 against a DRTG of 83? Incredible.

P.Beverley, D.Gallinari, B.Griffin, D.Jordan, A.Rivers is a +8.3 if you want a truly tested lineup to work with, though. Man... so many injuries. What a shame. I, for one, was looking forward to the Clippers this year. 

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**LA Lakers:** L.Ball, K.Caldwell-Pope, B.Ingram, K.Kuzma, J.Randle

This is one of the best defensive units in the NBA. For all the shit Lonzo gets for his shooting, he is a solid defender, and it shows with this lineup. They posted an 86 DRTG over 15 games to give them a +28 NET RTG. 

Alas, Luke Walton's most two used lineups swap out Randle for Lopez, and it makes the Lakers worse in every way. I hope Brook gets his shit together because he looked like a borderline all-star with the Nets last year, but he's looking more like a Mosgov this year. 

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Memphis Grizzlies:** D.Brooks, T.Evans, M.Gasol, J.Green, A.Harrison

Over a 7 game sample, this group has put up a solid +21.7 NET. No Grizzlies lineup has played 100 minutes, and at 44 minutes, this group isn't exactly ""tested,"" but they put up points in bunches. Grizzlies fans don't have much to be excited about right now, but at least Tyreke is finally showing flashes of his rookie season. 

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Miami Heat:**  W.Ellington, J.Johnson, T.Johnson, K.Olynyk, D.Waiters

Over 12 games, this group has delivered time and time again - mostly thanks to absurd defense(93.2). The ball moves extremely well in this group. Their best lineup, G.Dragic, J.Johnson, J.Richardson, D.Waiters, H.Whiteside, has only 33 minutes over 7 games under their belt, but it has been even better, posting a net of 33.6. The Heat are one of the deepest teams in the east and it shows in their lineup variety.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Milwaukee Bucks:** G.Antetokounmpo, E.Bledsoe, J.Henson, K.Middleton, T.Snell

After a lot of early season experimentation, the Bucks have found their lineup. Despite Bledsoe joining the team late, this is their most used group, posting a Net of +17.1 and a 63% True Shooting. Swapping Bledsoe out for Brodgon yields the same results with slightly worse defense in exchange for betting shooting. 

As Bledsoe builds chemistry with this team, I predict we will see great things from the Bucks. Giannis has slowed down some after a start to the season that had many people calling him the MVP favorite, but I don't think we've seen the last of the Greek Freak's hype this year. As arguably the second best player in the East, finally playing with an above average point guard, the Bucks are in a fantastic place. 

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Minnesota Timberwolves:** J.Butler, T.Gibson, T.Jones, K.Towns, A.Wiggins

The Wolves second-most used unit has posted a +16.4 NET RTG in 90 minutes together. They have the best defense on the team out of 11 qualified units.

Funny side-note since the Thibs minutes thing is a hot button right now: The starting lineup with Teague has logged 535 minutes together. That's almost 150 more minutes than the second most used lineup in the league. But they're a positive, with a +7.5 NET RTG. They are one of the most consistent lineups in the league. If only the bench would stop blowing leads.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**New Orleans Pelicans:** D.Cousins, D.Cunningham, A.Davis, J.Holiday, E.Moore

The Pelicans haven't had a chance to really find Rondo's best place in the Davis/Cousins/Rondo healthy circle. Because of that, the most used lineup including him is actually a negative. Cunningham has played more than Rondo, and as part of their most used lineup, I was surprised to see the Pels post a +6.6 with him on the floor. I think this team is an outlier. They have no ""good"" lineups yet. Is that because of the player's erratic health, or is it because of their coaching? That's for Pels fans to decide.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**New York Knicks:** J.Jack, E.Kanter, C.Lee, D.McDermott, K.Porzingis

This seems to be Jeff's little ""sekrit lineup"". They have played in more games than all but one of the Knicks lineups(11 games) but they have only spent 27 minutes together. They come out for like 2-4 minutes, murder the opposition, and send out the main squad again. With a +25.4 NET RTG(an incredible 79 DRTG), this is by far the Knicks best group.

If you want a true sample size, the starters—the only Knicks lineup above 50 minutes—of Jack/Kanter/Lee/Porzingis/THJ are a +5.6 in 15 games(233 minutes). They get the job done. But maybe they should throw Doug out there in that group and see what he can do with the team in more minutes.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**OKC Thunder:** S.Adams, C.Anthony, P.George, A.Roberson, R.Westbrook

This lineup only wins because of sample size - 319 minutes. No other OKC Lineup has hit 70 minutes. That being said, this not a bad lineup. Their DRTG of 94.8 is one of the best starting groups in the league, but their shooting isn't great(52.8% TS). 

One lineup they use swaps Grant for Adams and posted a +24.8 NET, but their absolute best line up is Abrines, Adams, George, Grant, and Westbrook. With a DRTG of 76.0, this is the fourth best defensive group in the league. 

Their primary bench unit of Felton, Abrines, Grant, Patterson, and George, is one of the worst in the entire league with a negative 18.3 NET in 11 games. Swapping Roberson for Abrines, their second most utilized lineup, is also dreadful. Yet Donovan keeps going to these same line-ups game in and game out. The Thunder aren't losing because of their starters. They're losing because of their bench. 

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Orlando Magic:** E.Fournier, A.Gordon, S.Mack, J.Simmons, N.Vucevic

This is the best lineup in the NBA. Over 10 games, they've posted a +54.4 NET RTG and a 72% True Shooting. Alas, the lineup swapping Mack for Payton is used 4x more often and is a Negative 11.7 NET. 

Magic people, if you're reading this, please check your lineup stats. All of your main lineups are totally ass.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Philadelphia 76ers:** R.Covington, J.Embiid, J.Redick, D.Saric, B.Simmons

Don't fix what isn't broken. This is their best and most used lineup. An ORTG of 112 against a DRTG of 96 is the perfect balance.

When Embiid is injured, the Sixers can swap in Amir Johnson and swap TJ for Saric to give them an incredible +30.2 Net, but they've only appeared in 9 games for 28 minutes together, their 5th most used lineup. 

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Phoenix Suns:** D.Bender, D.Booker, T.Chandler, M.James, T.Warren

This group puts up points in bunches. Over 8 games(Small sample size because the Suns have 11 qualified units), they have an ORTG of 134.5 with a 71% TS. 30 minutes isn't much to work with, though.

Booker/Chandler/Chriss/Ulis/Warren is their best ""tested"" lineup with a Net RTG of +9.2 and a 61% TS in 91 minutes. Swapping Ulis for Mike James gives them a +4.7 over 104 minutes. 

The Suns are better than their record shows. I don't think people realize how much Alex Len hurts the team. He is responsible for 4 of the 5 worst Suns lineups. The 5th lineup will never happen again because it was Eric Bledsoe's group. With all of their bigs, maybe its time for the Suns to move on from the Len experiment.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Portland Trailblazers:** A.Aminu, D.Lillard, C.McCollum, J.Nurkic, E.Turner

This was the same lineup I chose last time I did this. The thing is... the Blazers don't have any other good lineups. Their most used swaps Harkless in over Turner, and that puts up a modest +4.8. 

But the lineup using Turner posts an incredible +36.9 NET RTG, one of the best in the league, with an impressive 75.4 DRTG. Alas, with only 8 games to work their magic, they haven't had a chance to make much difference together.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Sacramento Kings:** B.Bogdanovic, W.Cauley-Stein, B.Hield, K.Koufos, F.Mason

7 of 9 lineups are huge negatives for the Kings. This one has played 6 games for 49 minutes together and put up a respectable +7.9 NET RTG. They have just two lineups above 100 minutes and both have horrible numbers -  both use George Hill. In fact, George Hill is not part of a single positive lineup for the Kings. 

Bogdanovic is the only King in both of the positive lineups. (the second has a +15.5 NET over 30 minutes)

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**San Antonio Spurs:** L.Aldridge, K.Anderson, P.Gasol, D.Green, P.Mills

Chose sample size here. With a +10.5 NET, this lineup does the job. That being said, Tony Parker's return has led to amazing things for the Spirs. Swapping Mills for Parker increases their Net RTG to a baffling +38.0 and a 65% TS. They've only had 30 minutes together, as opposed to the 155 by the chosen unit, but it's been their most effective group of the season.

With Kawhi returning, we may as well throw all of this out the window. 

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Toronto Raptors:** O.Anunoby, D.DeRozan, S.Ibaka, K.Lowry, J.Valanciunas

Toronto needs to face the facts. OG is better on the starting lineup than Powell. With Powell, this lineup posts a Net of -11.3 in 131 minutes. With OG instead, they are a+13.2 in 194 minutes.

Last time I did this, their best lineup was the all-bench unit of OG, Miles, Poeltl, VanVleet, and Wright. They are still the most effective bench unit in the NBA, posting an 88 DRTG for a +12.6, trailing just behind the starters. As with the starters, swapping OG for Powell turns them into a massive negative(-12.4 NET). 

What's a coach to do? The team is just 100% better with OG. Do you beef up the starters with him? Do you beef up the bench? Either way, Powell hurts them with these two groups. Hopefully they find a place for him to contribute.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Utah Jazz:** A.Burks, D.Favors, J.Ingles, J.Jerebko, D.Mitchell

Jazz, what is you doing? Their three most lineups are all huge negatives. The lineup of Favors, Gobert, Rubio, Ingles, and Mitchell is especially atrocious, posting a net of -31.7 over 86 minutes and a putrid 48% True shooting. Swapping Hood in for Mitchell(their most used group) isn't much better, posting a -11.2.

And so we're forced to dig a little deeper. The chosen lineup put up an incredible 141.5 ORTG on an amazing 72% True shooting. They have just 40 minutes together, though, while the starters have all played between 80 and 110 minutes. 

There is not a single positive lineup using Gobert. Hopefully they figure that out soon because you kind of need your best player. 

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Washington Wizards:** B.Beal, M.Gortat, K.Oubre Jr., O.Porter Jr., J.Wall

The Wizards don't experiment. With a +22.5 NET RTG, you don't really have to. This group has both the highest ORTG(114) and DRTG(92) of all their lineups. Swapping Oubre out for Morris makes them worse. 

I'm no expert on the Wizards, so I'd be interested in asking their fans: Do you think Kelly should be a starter, or do you need his scoring punch off the bench?

&amp;nbsp;

EZmisery,2017-12-07 14:15:59+00:00,One of my roommates isn't my roommate,"“It is a soft, wet sound.  In your fingers it would feel like damp velvet.  Red.  Drenched in something cold.  Maybe water.  Maybe something thicker.”

I found that note beneath my bed.  It was shoved beneath one of the feet of the bedframe.  I only found it because I decided to rearrange my room.  The note was written on notebook paper with a pen.  I didn’t know what to make of it.  I had two roommates, I thought maybe it was one of them playing a joke.  

I walked into Harold’s room.  Harold was my best friend since college.  We were constantly playing pranks on each other.  “Hey man, did you write this?”

He looked up from his computer.  I showed him the note and he dropped it in revulsion.  “Ew, no.  This is some Poe shit.”  He paused for a second, looking a bit guilty.  “But I did find something like that yesterday in my bag.”

He showed me an almost identical note, written on the same paper.  It read, “It smells like fresh earth or dying worms.  The stifled sound of filling the host’s fingers, putting yourself in the legs, stretching out in the shoulders.  Ripping the skin that doesn’t fit.”

We locked eyes, sharing something like fear.  “Let’s check with Dan,” he suggested.

We walked together to Dan’s room.  Dan worked with Harold at the realty office.  He was on his bed, reading a book.  We showed him the two notes.  His face was hard.  “I thought you guys were fucking with me.  I found one too.”

His read, “It tastes like wood shavings slowly grating the back of your throat.  For human eyes it would look like a new language.  Some unpronounceable alien thing that demands to be seen at the edge of a blade.”

That just left Nate.  We found Nate on craigslist when we needed a roommate and he fit in well.  We walked to his room.  He was scribbling in his journal.  “Nate,” I said in almost a whisper.  “Did you leave us these creepy notes?”

He scowled at us.  “I thought it was you guys being assholes.”  He reached into his pocket and pulled out the last one.  

It read, “Blue is the color you see before you die.  I don’t do what humans do.  I don’t find it funny when the squirming ends and the suit is ready for wearing.”

All four of us went into the living room.  We put the four notes together and they fit into one sheet of paper.  Harold spoke first, “Maybe it’s just a coincidence.”

“How the fuck is that possible?” I retorted.  

“It’s just paper.  It’s not going to hurt us,” Nate said anxiously.

Dan said, “Yeah, but it’s creepy, right?  Not normal.”

We stood there for a few moments.  It was getting dark.  Something felt strange.  “Let’s just head to bed,” I said reluctantly.  “We can fight about it in the morning.” 

The other guys laughed.  Some of the tension melted away.  It was nice to just be calm again.  We all started to walk to our rooms when something dawned on us.

There were only three bedrooms.  

But there were four of us.  

I shook my head, confused.  “Wait, how many of us live here?”

“Three,” the others said in unison.  

“Three?”  I stared at the others.  A horrible look fell over my face.

That’s when the realization came over all of us.  There should only be three people living here.  But there were four.

“Why the hell are there four of us,” Dan screeched.

“I don’t know,” I said shakily.  “But no one moves until we figure this out.”

“Fuck this!” Harold went to leave but I grabbed the paperweight off the desk beside me.  

“Look man, I don’t want to hurt you.  But no one leaves.”

The look he gave me was full of betrayal.  He sunk down into the east corner of the living room.  Nate followed suit and sat in the west corner.  I backed up into the north corner and Dan chose the south.  We all just stared at each other.  The completed note sat on the desk still, fluttering in the breeze from the open window.

After some silence, Nate perked up.  “So one of us isn’t who he says he is.”

“Yeah, but I swear I know all of you,” Harold responded.

Dan said, “I definitely know all of you.  I have memories with all of you.  We’ve been living together almost a year now.”

I chuckled.  “Maybe we’re just going crazy.”

“Let’s call Leigh, she’ll know,” Harold urged.  Leigh was Harold’s girlfriend.

Nate shakes his head.  “We can’t trust her.  She might just say whatever you want her to.”

“I’ve known Harold since we were kids,” I whispered.  “He’s real.”

“How can you possibly know that?”  Nate stands.  “I’m going to get a sandwich.”

“I don’t think so.”  Dan stands as well, balling his fists.  “No one leaves this room until we figure this out.”

“So we’re just going to starve?”

“Not if we get to the bottom of this.”

“Guys, sit down.”  I rub my thumb over the paperweight.  “We need to know who everyone is.  Then we can figure out who is lying.”

“Why do you know so much about this?” Dan demanded.

I let out a long breath.  “I’ve read about this kind of thing.  It happened to some sorority girls in Ohio.  They said there wertr too many girls for the number of beds.  They didn’t figure out who it was, and almost all of them died.”

“Died?”  Harold’s voice shook.

“Yeah.  Died.”  I looked up, finding all three men staring at me.  

Nate wiped his forehead.  “Same thing happened in Portland I think.  An entire office building was killed because there were too many workers for the cubicles.  The few survivors said the extra workers were not human.  They called them…fuck I don’t remember.”

Dan laughed.  “So you’re saying one of us isn’t human?  That’s ridiculous.”

“That’s exactly what it would say,” Nate yelled at him.

“It’s late,” I said calmly.  “We aren’t thinking right.  Let’s figure this out in the morning.”

“I don’t want to sleep,” Harold said.

Nate responded, “We’ll sleep in shifts.  Three awake, one asleep.  That way if one of us attacks we can stop him.”

Dan sniffed.  “We have to sleep out here?”

“Yes,” Nate replied.  “You go first.”

Dan huffed and was obviously frustrated.  He grabbed a pillow off the couch and curled into a ball.  The rest of us sat in silence.

And that’s what happened last night.  I wrote down everything that has happened so far.  I want you to know that we’re still here, still watching each other.  If anyone has any information on whatever killed those people or what the note means please answer me.  We are completely stuck.  I don’t trust anyone except Harold.  If you don’t hear from me by tomorrow, we are at 112 Ocean Avenue.  Send help.

I will try to update as soon as possible.  I have enough phone battery to respond to comments so please, help me.  Help us.

boundbythecurve,2017-11-20 22:10:43+00:00,"Jeff Flake (R-AZ), the senator that announced his retirement by calling Trump out, has done nothing to oppose Trump since that speech. He's voting on the Tax Bill soon. Here's his twitter page. Let's tell him how we feel about how he should vote.","He's not the only senator that can be influential in swaying the vote. Here's a list of 5 senators that have shown interest in voting against this tax bill. And ways to contact them:

--------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bob Corker** (R-TN):

https://twitter.com/BobCorker

DC Office:202-224-3344

Memphis Office: 901-683-1910

Nashville Office: 615-279-8125

Knoxville Office: 865-637-4180

Jackson Office: 731-664-2294

Tri-Cities Office: 423-753-2263

Chattanooga Office: 423-756-2757

He's not running for re-election and he says he won't pass a tax plan that increases the deficit. This tax plan will increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion. Let him know.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Jeff Flake** (R-AZ):

https://twitter.com/JeffFlake

DC Office: 202-224-4521

Phoenix Office: 602-840-1891

Tucson Office: 520-575-8633

We all heard his speech. Let's tell him to put his money where his mouth is. If he really stands for any sense of justice, he won't pass this tax bill.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Ron Johnson** (R-WI):

https://twitter.com/SenRonJohnson

DC Office: 202-224-5323

Milwaukee Office: 414-276-7282


Oshkosh Office: 920-230-7250

Madison Office: 608-240-9629

He's already come out as not in favor of this tax plan. Let's just remind him that we aren't either.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

**John McCain** (R-AZ):

https://twitter.com/SenJohnMcCain

DC Office:(202) 224-2235

Phoenix Office: (602) 952-2410

Tuscan Office: (520) 670-6334

Remind him how he predicted exactly what would happen after Bush's tax plans in 2001 and 2003. The deficit went up. He was right and he voted against those tax plans. Let's tell him how much we're trusting his instincts and that this tax plan will make the deficit even worse (because it will, on top of bankrupting most middle class families).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

**Lisa Murkowski** (R-AK):

https://twitter.com/lisamurkowski

DC Office: (202)-224-6665

Anchorage Office: (907) 271-3735

Fairbanks Office: (907) 456-0233

Juneau Office: (907) 586-7277

Mat-Su Valley Office: (907) 376-7665

Soldotna Office: 907) 262-4220

Ketchikan Office: (907) 225-6880 

She has been one of the few republican voices to oppose Trump. She voted against the ""skinny repeal"" healthcare bill. And that's what she's most concerned about with this new tax bill. The budgetary cuts will result in an estimated 13 million people losing healthcare. Remind her.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit: It has been brought to my attention that Susan Collins is also on the fence. Let's help her decide.

**Susan Collins** (R-ME)

https://twitter.com/SenatorCollins

DC Office: (202)224-2523

Bangor Office: (207) 945-0417

Augusta Office: (207) 622-8414

Biddeford Office: (207) 283-1101

 - **Criteria:** The player has to have appeared in at least 1 game in any of the various Major Leagues and/or any of the various Negro Major Leagues (1920-1948). No career minor leaguers. 

 - Under **Years** I listed their first and their last year in baseball, so they may have missed time in between. Some guys missed a ton of (major league) time, mainly cuz they were languishing in the minor leagues.

 For NLB players I listed their first year in any organized Negro League, even if it was before 1920 (the first year of what is considered the first Negro Major League), but I listed their Primary Team by their primary Negro Major League team. 

 - MLB players have a link to their bb-ref page, NLB players have a link to their player page on seamheads.

Morezingis,2017-11-10 00:07:35+00:00,[OC] Every team's best lineup so far in the 17-18 season.,"Using this [Stat Tracker from NBA.COM](https://stats.nba.com/lineups/advanced/?sort=TEAM_ABBREVIATION&amp;dir=-1) I managed to compile every team's best starting line up.

3 big factors are at play here. Offensive Rating, Defensive Rating, and True Shooting.

NET RATING is the positive or negative difference between the ORTG and DRTG.

Sample size matters very little. If they hit the qualifier, they are eligible. Very few lineups have hit the 100 minute mark and I, in no way, believe these will last for the entire season. This is just how things are looking so far.

&amp;nbsp;

*****


**Atlanta Hawks:** L.Babbitt, K.Bazemore, M.Belinelli, J.Collins, I.Taylor.

It's only fitting that Luke Babbitt is part of their best lineup. The Hawks are an interesting team in that Budenholzer has not stuck with a single lineup for more than 50 minutes. That may be because every single lineup has posted a negative Net RTG — except this lineup, which has posted a +13.1. 

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Brooklyn Nets:** T.Booker, S.Dinwiddie, J.Harris, C.LeVert, T.Mozgov.

The Nets actually have some solid lineups. None moreso than this one. Theyve posted an incredible +38.7 on 68% True Shooting. This isn't to say D'Lo is holding them back, as he is a member of the second best lineup(32.2), consisting of Booker-Carroll-Crabbe-LeVert-Russell. 

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Boston Celtics:** S.Ojeleye, T.Rozier, M.Smart, J.Tatum, D.Theis. 

What? No Kyrie or Horford? Crazy, I know, but this lineup put up an amazing +62 Net RTG in the short time they shared the floor and a 76%!! true shooting percentage. Not far behind is the lineup of A.Baynes, J.Brown, A.Horford, K.Irving, M.Smart, who put up 53.2(a 70.2 DRTG) in the time they shared the floor. 

The Celtics are a great team, as the only negative lineup was when they trotted out Morris and their defense fell apart.  

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Charlotte Hornets:** D.Bacon, D.Howard, F.Kaminsky, M.Monk, K.Walker. 

This was the third best lineup in the entire league. Posting a 125/52 ORTG/DRTG, these five have stifled their opponents together in the 4 games they've appeared in. Steve Clifford doesn't seem aware of just how good they are, as he favors swapping Kaminsky and Monk out for Lamb and Williams(103 minutes, by far the team's highest usage).

On paper, there's nothing particularly special about this lineup. The true shooting is normal, the group has their lowest pace, and their stats are all about on par with the other lineups... but opponents simply cannot score against them for some reason. It's worth noting that this is the only lineup Monk and Dwight show up in together.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Chicago Bulls:** J.Grant, J.Holiday, R.Lopez, L.Markkanen, D.Nwaba.

Coach Fred Hoiberg has trotted out a grand total of six lineups this season and only two are in the positive. The other line up of Holiday, Dunn, Lopez, Zipser, and Valentine posted a better Net RTG, but with an ORTG of just 84 and a 46% TS, I couldn't give them the nod. The first actually produces offense. 

I don't have many positives to say. They both score below average, but at least they outscore the opposition.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Cleveland Cavaliers:** J.Crowder, L.James, K.Korver, K.Love, D.Rose.

There are two options here. Swapping Rose for Wade gave an incredible Net Rating of 57.1, the best on the team, but they haven't had a single offensive rebound and very little passing is done. Their offense is above average in that lineup but their defense is borderline incredible(Yes, incredible defense on the Cavs.) With the Cavs current problems, this might be their best choice.

But the first lineup posted the 4th highest ORTG in the entire league(146) and the second highest TS% in the league(78.6). The Cavs aren't going to be able to rely on stifling defense to win this year. They need to score, score, score, and only one or two lineups in the NBA are better at scoring than this one. 

Tyrone Lue has used 11 lineups. Only 3 of them are positive.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Dallas Mavericks:** J.Barea, Y.Ferrell, D.Harris, D.Nowitzki, D.Powell.

This is the best lineup in the NBA. With an ORTG of 150.8(2nd in the NBA) and a DRTG of 53.7(3rd in the NBA), this lineup has it all. Only one of the twelve Mavericks lineups have played over 40 minutes together, and that lineup does not include Yogi Ferrell. The three top Mavericks lineups do include Yogi Ferrell.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Denver Nuggets:** W.Chandler, G.Harris, N.Jokic, P.Millsap, J.Murray.

Mike Malone knows exactly what he is doing. This lineup has 182 minutes(2nd most in the league). Posting a 9.9 Net RTG and a 57% TS, the stats don't seem special. But they're consistent, they have chemistry, and they win games. 

Plus, that's kind of a sexy lineup. All five players are a legitimate threat on offense, but they compliment each other well enough to keep their DRTG under 100. 

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Detroit Pistons:** A.Bradley, A.Drummond, L.Galloway, T.Harris, R.Jackson.

This is the Pistons least used of their 7 lineups and it posted, by fucking far, the best defense in the entire NBA—a 33.6 DRTG, almost 20 points better than the second best defensive lineup! Not only that, but they get buckets, posting a net RTG of 89.2. 

A.Bradley, A.Drummond, T.Harris, R.Jackson, S.Johnson is the Pistons only 30 minute+ lineup, coming in at a whopping 155, and they have a -9.9 Net RTG. That's how big of an impact removing Stanley Johnson makes. Now I'm not saying Stanley is bad, but there are plenty of other lineups he can mesh with.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Golden State Warriors:** S.Curry, K.Durant, D.Green, Z.Pachulia, K.Thompson.

No surprise here. A team TS of 67.4% makes you pretty good.

Let's instead discuss the Warriors worst lineups so we can try to forget about their invincibility for a second. Green/Iggy/Klay/West do NOT play well together. At all. One lineup uses Nick Young(-48 Net) and the other uses McCaw(-45 Net). Both post a True Shooting of 43%. Filthy. 

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Houston Rockets:** R.Anderson, E.Gordon, J.Harden, L.Mbah a Moute, P.Tucker.

Far less used than their starting lineup, but far, far, far more effective on defense. PJ and LMaM are beasts on that end of the floor, but they can also hit their shots. With a Net RTG of +41.4 and a 74% True Shooting, Pringles should tinker around with this one more. They've only been out 3 games together. Swapping Anderson and Capela makes them just as good. 

That said, there's nothing wrong with the staring lineup and their +23.3 Net, and the Rockets have so many lineups that destroy the opposition. R.Anderson, E.Gordon, N.Hilario, L.Mbah a Moute, P.Tucker have the 4th best defense in the NBA. They have 4 lineups with a net over 20... and they don't even have Chris Paul back.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Indiana Pacers:** D.Collison, C.Joseph, V.Oladipo, D.Sabonis, T.Young.

+61.7 Net RTG. 72% TS. This has been the best Pacers lineup so far. They have won more games with Myles sitting, but I don't expect that to keep up. Myles is way too good. 

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**LA Clippers:** P.Beverley, D.Gallinari, B.Griffin, D.Jordan, M.Teodosic.

The only lineup with Teodosic is also their best. A +43 Net to go along with a high pace of 106. To put that speed in perspective, the pace of the current starting lineup with Rivers is just 89. I like Austin but Teodosic is 100x more fun. 

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**LA Lakers:** L.Ball, K.Caldwell-Pope, B.Ingram, K.Kuzma, J.Randle.

The Lakers have two really good lineups. With a net of +54.7, this is the Lakers most all-around and tested lineup, having appeared in 7 games. That being said, there's a hidden gem lineup of Clarkson, Hart, Ingram, Kuzma, and Randle with a +62 Net on 77% TS. 

Oddly enough, only two of the Lakers seven lineups are a negative. Both contain Ball and Lopez. Lonzo seems to work way better with Randle on the floor.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Memphis Grizzlies** D.Brooks, M.Chalmers, T.Evans, M.Gasol, C.Parsons

The best Grizzlies lineup, surprisingly, does not include Conley. Conley appears on a few solid lineups, but none compare to this one. With a 104 pace, this lineup keeps the ball moving constantly on their way to a +39 net over 9 games. They are producing a defensive rating of 67.3! We see you, Rio.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Miami Heat:** W.Ellington, J.Johnson, T.Johnson, K.Olynyk, J.Richardson

Not joking. This is a top 10 defensive unit, posting a 106 ORTG and a 58 DRTG in the three games they've appeared in. Coach Spoelstra is still testing the waters with his squads, as no lineup has played more than 45 minutes together.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Milwaukee Bucks:** G.Antetokounmpo, M.Dellavedova, J.Henson, K.Middleton, T.Snell.

A +67.9 Net RTG over 4 games. This is one of the best lineups in the league. Jason Kidd does not experiment much, as he's only trotted out 5 qualified groups this season. The best thing about this unit is that they can swap Snell for Brogden and still retain a +50 Net. The latter has a 73% TS. 

It's a shame the Bucks can't earn a positive without Giannis on the floor. The guy is going to be worn out come playoff time. 

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Minnesota Timberwolves:** N.Bjelica, J.Crawford, T.Jones, S.Muhammad, K.Towns.

This lineup has appeared in 7 games and they've kicked ass every time. 62% TS and a +30 Net. Thibs receives a lot of heat for benching too many starters sometimes, but this one works well. It's also the only positive Shabazz appears in, especially if you look at the J.Butler, J.Crawford, T.Jones, S.Muhammad, K.Towns lineup. With a 146 DRTG, it's the third worst lineup in the NBA. Don't ask me how switching Butler for Bjelica makes such a difference. Butler is our best defender.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**New Orleans Pelicans:** T.Allen, D.Cousins, A.Davis, J.Holiday, J.Nelson

The definition of stifling defense, this group has put up a DRTG of 61 in their four games together. They're well-rounded offensively, move at a good pace, and shoot the ball at an above average clip. There's no reason this shouldn't be their ""clamp"" lineup at the end of games when they're trying to hold a lead, but Gentry keeps putting the Clark/Moore lineup out there, raising their DRTG to 119...

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**New York Knicks:** R.Baker, T.Hardaway Jr., D.McDermott, K.O'Quinn, K.Porzingis.

I wish Hornacek trotted out this lineup more often because it is absolutely beastly. They only showed up in two games, but they put up an incredible offensive display. With a 127 ORTG on 72% True Shooting, I can't understand why Jeff keeps going with Lee/Jack over Baker/McDermott or even Frank/McDermott. 

The lineup of Jack, Lee, KP, KOQ, and THJ allow a 131 DRTG. Oh, and the Knicks should never ever ever play Sessions again.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**OKC Thunder:** A.Abrines, S.Adams, P.George, J.Grant, R.Westbrook

I love Melo. He has the prettiest shot in the league, he's still an offensive juggernaut, and when he plays alongside Roberson and Adams, he performs well. But Melo CANNOT play when Roberson sits.

OKC has just 6 units, and the only truly excellent one they've shown is the one I just posted. With a Net Rtg of +24, this unit brings defense to the table even while their best defender sits with a 75 DRTG in 9 games.

The lineup of S.Adams, C.Anthony, P.George, J.Grant, R.Westbrook is the single worst lineup in the NBA, posting a league worst 159 DRTG for a whopping -77 Net RTG. This group has only played in 3 games, so I hope Billy learned his lesson. If not, I hope he browses Reddit and sees this statistic. 

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Orlando Magic:** E.Fournier, A.Gordon, S.Mack, J.Simmons, N.Vucevic

Shooting? Check. Defense? Fantastic. Offense? 130 ORTG. 

Don't fix what isn't broken. This unit has excelled in the 6 games they've played. Just keep Hezonja away from them. 

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Philadelphia 76ers:** R.Covington, A.Johnson, T.Luwawu-Cabarrot, T.McConnell, B.Simmons

The 76ers are incredible. They have just ONE negative lineup. Four have a net over 20, but this one in particular is just absurd. +126.5 ORTG, 59.1 DRTG, 66% TS. They've only appeared in three games, but it's the perfect lineup when Embiid needs a break. 

The line up Covington, Embiid, Redick, Saric, and Simmons is just as good offensively - and over a longer sample size. 


&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Phoenix Suns:** D.Bender, D.Booker, T.Chandler, M.James, T.Warren.

The Suns are at their best when Booker, Bender, and Warren share the floor. Over 6 games, they've put up an ORTG of 138. You're not going to get much defense out of many of the Suns lineups, but with a pace of 110, you sure can outscore and tire out the other team.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Portland Trailblazers:** A.Aminu, D.Lillard, C.McCollum, J.Nurkic, E.Turner

The perfect balance of Offense(112) and Defense(74). Over 6 games, this lineup has delivered. And the best part about it? The Blazers can swap out McCollum for Harkless when he needs a rest. That second lineup has an even better defense(59) without much of an offensive dropoff.

The Blazers have come a long way under Stotts and I believe he's finally figured out exactly what to do with his roster. Lillard has taken huge leaps defensively. Excited to see what they can do.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Sacramento Kings:** B.Bogdanovic, D.Fox, K.Koufos, S.Labissiere, G.Temple.

Of their ten lineups, this is the only one capable of scoring. Sac went and signed all of this veteran talent over the summer when, quite frankly, they didn't need to. Aside from Fox, Sacramento doesn't have the most ""attractive"" list of young players in the league, but I think we're all going to be surprised at what they can do in a few years. With an ORTG of 123, this group can put the ball through the hoop. 

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**San Antonio Spurs:** L.Aldridge, K.Anderson, D.Green, D.Murray, B.Paul.

This may come as a shocker, but the Spurs defense hasn't been at its best without Kawhi Leonard. There's not many lineups to choose from, and coach Pop is the best at the league at managing minutes and creating chemistry. This particular lineup has posted a DRTG of 71 in their five games. 

I don't know what else to say. The Spurs aren't a very sexy team without Kawhi. They do the job, they get wins, and Aldridge is playing his ass off. Good enough for me.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Toronto Raptors:** O.Anunoby, C.Miles, J.Poeltl, F.VanVleet, D.Wright.

Lol I know, right? But seriously. This is the Raptors 2nd most used lineup. They have a Net Rtg of +12 and the teams best defense(89). The starting lineup is fine. The Raptors are just blessed to have a bench they can completely trust. Not many teams can rest their entire starting lineup in 8 games and pull these numbers. 

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Utah Jazz:** A.Burks, J.Johnson, D.Mitchell, T.Sefolosha, E.Udoh

I don't come up with these stats, it is what it is. Having played 4 games together, this lineup has posted the best ORTG of the team(127) and a DRTG of 75. That's a +52 Net. 

For whatever reason, the Jazz starters are not meshing yet. Favors, Gobert, Hood, Ingles, and Rubio are their most used lineup and post a net of -11.2. Their second most used lineup swaps Hood for Mitchell and gets even worse at -22.4.

This team is clearly revolving around Gobert and Rubio right now, and Mitchell should be a big piece in the future. R.Gobert, J.Ingles, D.Mitchell, R.Rubio, T.Sefolosha is their best lineup featuring those 3. It's the only one that can score AND defend. Yet they've only played 3 games. 

&amp;nbsp;

*****

**Washington Wizards:** B.Beal, M.Gortat, K.Oubre Jr., O.Porter Jr., J.Wall

The coach knows what he's doing. This is by far their best lineup, and it's also their most used. 121 ORTG, 90 DRTG, 61% TS. Every single lineup featuring Wall, Beal, and Gortat is a negative except this one. Otto Porter is the only player who can play with the bench and outplay the opponent. 

People don't realize just how big Otto and Kelly is for the Wizards. Swap Otto out of this top lineup for Scott and the Wizards go from +22 to -18. Swap Kelly for Morris and they become a -17 Net team.

This lineup loves each other. They work together perfectly. Let Otto run with the bench unit when Beal and Wall get rest, and the Wizards will go far.",nba,1153

hateboss,2017-10-06 15:16:29+00:00,For those of us that want to help the homeless/panhandlers but feel conflicted about handing money: carry granola/snackbars,"**UPDATE: A few keen redditors brought it to my attention that a lot of homeless have dental issues, an issue I am embarrassed to have overlooked. So in place of granola bars you can opt for something softer such as a Nutra Grain bar or even those little self serving tubs of Peanut Butter. Really, anything that is calorically dense, has a high shelf life and doesn't require refrigeration or utensils is ideal** 



This post isn't to argue about the merits of panhandling and whether panhandlers genuinely are people in need, it's about how you can help without handing out cash and feeling good about it along the way.

Where I live (Portland, Maine), panhandlers are a frequent sight in the medians at traffic lights. We have it bad in Portland (because of the 7 months of temperate weather and richer areas) but I used to live in San Francisco where it was even worse. I like to help people who ask when I can. I used to hand out change but I always felt conflicted. I have worked with and volunteered for various homeless social programs and I am all too familiar that it is a life that is rife with mental illness and substance abuse. Not only that, but there are those out there who pose as homeless and can make decent money just holding a sign.

So I always felt bad giving cash. Aside from it possibly going to a posing individual, I mostly worried that it wouldn't be used appropriately and while I know it's not my place to judge, I want to make sure I am actually helping them get by. Even after I would hand a buck over, I always felt a twinge of guilt.

Now, I carry a box of granola bars with me in my car. 


I pick up a spare box or two everytime I go shopping and will hand them out by the bar when I can. I found it is great for several reasons:

1) I know I'm offering direct aid in the form of food.


2) Unlike fresh food it wont spoil, its small enough to put in a pocket and doesnt require heat, water or utensils to eat.


3) Judging by the reaction I can genuinely pick out the thankful needy from the cash seeking fakers. 



4) Because of doing this, I have made little connections with some of the more frequent people. Its nice to be able to have a short conversation about how their day is going instead of awkwardly fiddling around in my car so that I can pretend like I don't see them.


I'm not saying this will cure poverty, I've always just tried to help where I can, but giving out snack bars made me feel okay about doing it.

That's all, I just wanted to share a lifehack that maybe did some good for others and made you feel better about doing it.",lifehacks,1631

I was following behind a gorgeous Burgundy Red 1969 Porsche 912. As we approached a red light, I was able to pull alongside. The woman driving looked to be in her 70s, and had the windows down. 

I rolled mine down and this was our brief conversation:

Me-""Excuse me, but you drive an absolutely gorgeous car!""

Her-""Why thank you, it was my fathers. Unfortunately I just don't get around to driving it as much as I should, so today I 'have' to drive to Salem (we were in Portland)""

Me-""I hope you are planning on taking the back roads""

Her-""Of course!""

Me-""Enjoy every moment of it"" 

Her-""Oh I will, have a great day""

And the light turned green.

 This white guy in his 40s was hogging two seats on the extremely crowded 9 (Powell). He had his laptop out and everything. Eventually one irritated gent asked him to put the laptop away to let him sit down. Laptop dude refused straight up. Irate dude starts saying aloud what laptop dude is doing on his computer. Finally, laptop guy snaps and exclaims to be left alone. Smirking, not-as-irate guy stops but continues to stand over him. Then another guy tells the bus driver this guy is hogging a seat and he immediately stops the bus and comes back to tell the guy he needs tok put the laptop up and share the space. 

Laptop STILL argues he shouldn't have to move. His reasoning: he's a bigger guy so he gets two. 

Bus drive is like nah, you need to put that up right now. Or get off the bus. 

Laptop guy finally, begrudgingly shuts his laptop and stands up, while continuously bitching and calling the irritating guy a pussy. Now others are chiming in to tell him he has to share the bus. I even told him if everyone says you're an asshole you're probably being an asshole. (His response is he knows that but that's besides the point...). 

Finally, he quiets. All in all, proud of you today Portland. Fuck entitled assholes.

tl;dr 

Entitled assholes gets told by the whole damn bus to  share the seats with people.

&amp;nbsp;

Assuming that the edge of the Earth is somewhere in the Pacific Ocean, cities on the Western Coast of the US would be considered close to the edge of the Earth. I narrowed teams in the NBA down to the Portland Trailblazers, the Sacramento Kings, the Golden State Warriors, the LA Lakers and the LA Clippers. 

&amp;nbsp;

Do Kyrie’s stats while playing in these cities appear to be any worse due to playing close to the edge of the Earth?

&amp;nbsp;

**Averages over 2011 to 2017 in cities close to the edge of the Earth:**

**2011/12:** 21.0/2.0/4.0

**2012/13:** 22.6/3.0/6.6

**2013/14:** 11.8/2.6/3.8

**2014/15:** 22.4/3.2/5.0

**2015/16:** 21.5/2.0/5.0

**2016/17:** 27.0/3.8/4.8

&amp;nbsp;

**Regular career averages between 2011 and 2017:**

**2011/12:** 18.5/3.7/5.4

**2012/13:** 22.5/3.7/5.9

**2013/14:** 20.8/3.6/6.1

**2014/15:** 21.7/3.2/5.2

**2015/16:** 19.6/3.0/4.7

**2016/17:** 25.2/3.2/5.8

&amp;nbsp;

This data is interesting due to Kyrie actually scoring *more* points per game on average against teams closer to the edge of the Earth annually in each season in comparison to his regular season averages, barring 2013/14. Compared to rebounds and assists, which were lower in every city close to the edge of the Earth on average over the season compared to regular season averages (except rebounds in 2016/17 and assists in 2015/16 and 2012/13). 

&amp;nbsp;

From this information it can be gathered that perhaps Kyrie is concerned with jumping off the edge of the Earth while attempting to grab a rebound and concerned that he will pass the ball off the edge. These reasons can explain the lower rebound and assist rates while in cities closer to the edge of the Earth. I cannot think of a reason why Kyrie’s points per game are the opposite of what I expected and are higher while playing close to the edge of the Earth. Perhaps he wants to end the game quicker by having a blowout victory and therefore gets buckets.

&amp;nbsp;

**Here are some other stats:**

**Averages @Por:** 18.6/2.6/3.8

**Averages @Sac:** 19.8/2.6/5

**Averages @GSW:** 21/4.6/5.6

**Averages @LAC:** 20/3.3/5.5

**Averages @LAL:** 23.8/1.5/5

**Win rate @Por, @Sac, @GSW, @LAC, @LAL:** 0.79

**Total average in cities close to the edge of the Earth:** 21.0/2.8/4.9

**Career average:** 21.6/3.4/5.5

&amp;nbsp;

tl;dr Kyrie is scared of the edge of the Earth.

DevinBookerGOAT,2017-07-22 21:50:13+00:00,A requiem for the Miami LeBron era,"I'm sitting in the airport bored right now, so I started watching some old NBA highlights and a wave of nostalgia hit me. I couldn't stop thinking about how much I liked basketball back then. The league was just more fun the the Heatles were together. Plain and simple. I didn’t start seriously following the sport until around 10 years ago, so there’s a lot I didn’t experience. But I miss the days when LeBron was in Miami. The league was just better. I reminisce fondly, and I'm sure a lot of you guys do too.


-----------------------------------------


Now, for a trip down memory lane.


What I miss the most about the Heatles era was the unique storyline that every season seemed to have. It felt like each team was competing against each other rather than everyone competing against the Warriors or Cavs. It wasn't one big arms race to take down the top- it was a fight to get to the top. Each season had something different in store. Sometimes it really is about the journey I guess.


Yet I digress. Some crazy shit happened in this time period that we may never see again. To kick it off, we had The Decision. One of the worst PR moves in the history of professional sports besides Donald Sterling ramming his head up his ass repeatedly. The jersey burnings, the Gilbert letter, dearing down the poster. It was a sight to see. Sorry KD, but LeBron did it better.


The Heat instantly became the most hated team in the NBA. I hated them. I bet you did too. And that’s great. Because they embraced that villain role.  It was fun to hate the Heat. That’s just what you did. In my opinion, it made the league that much more exciting. Warriors hate is alright, but none of them other than Draymond can really play that villain role. Wouldn’t that be awesome? 


Instead, we get an overly dominant dynasty led by baby-faced assassain Steph Curry. I'm sorry, but the guy is just not meant to be a villain. Always the underdog, he's vividly remembered for Davidson's Cinderella run back in '08 or whenever. He's too nice for me to hate in the same way I hated LeBron in Miami.


As for KD, this is where vitriol for him fades into a grey area. It's popular to hate him after leaving OKC. Speaking as a Suns fan, I don't hate him like thunder fans do. It's not an enemy kind of hate. It's more of a feeling of disappointment and disgust. He tipped the scales too far in the league. Simply put, I'm just sad about his choice.


Draymond is a popular candidate to hate. His loud-mouthed, energetic, and naturally moving style of play is polarizing. However, it's just not the same. Draymond is a great player, a Swiss Army knife on the court. At the end of the day though, he doesn't lead the team to victory. That's Steph and KD. With that in mind, I just can't hate Draymond in the same way that one would hate Steph, LeBron, Kobe, etc. He's not enough of an independent star to be the face of a team and carry them to victory.


------------------------------------------


October 2011. The Heat arrived, ready to win. However, Derrick Rose stole the show in 2011, winning the MVP and leading the Bulls to the one seed. Meanwhile out west, it was more of the same with San Antonio and the Lakers winning the top two seeds. The regular season was all Heat in terms of scrutiny and coverage. You might also remember this season for the trades. The Jazz dealt Deron Williams to the Nets shortly after he ran Jerry Sloan out of town. Also, the Knicks gutted their team landed Carmelo Anthony in a blockbuster deal which saw the Nuggets become Knicks lite for a few years.


The playoffs got a little spicy. Memphis knocked off a banged-up San Antonio in six to start the postseason off. Questions abounded about the Spurs demise. Hilarious in hindsight, I know. This blew the west wide open. The Thunder made quick work of Memphis and clinched their spot in the WCF. The Mavericks, fresh off a scare against Portland, sweeps defending champion Los Angeles and starts them down a tailspin. Dirk ascends into one of the all time greats with clutch performance after clutch performance, beating a young and promising OKC in 5. Meanwhile, LeBron and co. run through the east, including that same Bulls team who beat them out for the top seed. Miami looked unstoppable. The were heavily favored against the Mavs and rightfully so. On paper, the Heat were overwhelmingly talented. However, Dallas did not back down. After falling down 2-1, they stormed back behind Dirk’s otherworldly scoring and upset Miami. LeBron was crucified after this loss for being a choker. He did shrink on the biggest stage, probably the most profound black eye on his legacy. The Mavericks got sweet, sweet revenge for 2006 and Dirk his ring. This was one of the best title runs of all time and a great series to watch as a fan and an outsider.


Unfortunately, the joy was simply a distraction for the upcoming labor dispute. There was a real possibility that there wasn’t going to be a next season. Wouldn’t that have sucked? Anyways, the league barely got the deal done in time. They had to cancel six weeks, pushing the start back to Christmas Day. You might remember the offseason for the Chris Paul saga. The league denied a trade sending Chris Paul to the Lakers citing “basketball reasons.” Instead, he got dealt to the Clippers. As a Suns fan, this was hilarious. Well, until next year. But anyways, this was crazy at the time and still is.


The shortened regular season began with all eyes on the Heat once again. This year, LeBron won MVP again and led the Heat to the second seed behind the Bulls. The Celtics and Pacers both quietly put up great seasons in the shadows of Miami and Chicago. And who could forget Linsanity? Jeremy Lin exploded, stealing the spotlight from Carmelo which was a big no-no. He salvaged their season in Melo’s absence, but the magic eventually wore off. Mike D’Antoni resigned mid-season after feuding with Melo. Across the Mississippi, the new-look Clippers are fun to watch but still a flawed team. San Antonio continued to dominate with OKC not far behind. Sadly, Brandon Roy had to bring his career to a close. We missed out on a good one. The Mavericks, fresh off of their magical title run, let Tyson Chandler walk, beginning the end of their perennial top four seed.


Playoff time in 2012 was thrilling as an outsider (again). For the involved fans, emotions ranged from ecstasy to crippling depression. For the second year in a row, an eight seed knocked off a one when Philadelphia beat Chicago in six. To add insult to injury, Chicago's young star Derrick Rose tore his ACL, sidelining him for all of next year. He will be remembered as an all-time great ""What if?"" Elsewhere, San Antonio steamrolled the Jazz and Clippers only to be shocked by OKC in the conference finals. The Spurs won ten straight before dropping four in a row to Durant, Westbrook, Harden, and Ibaka. The Clippers and Grizzlies faced off for the first time with LA outlasting Memphis in 7. Extremely underrated series between these two. 


However, the east stole the show this postseason. Philly beating Chicago opened the door for a Celtics vs. Heat conference finals (after Boston beat the Sixers in 7). And what a conference finals that was. The last hurrah for the Celtics' big three, LeBron battling the choker label, and that otherworldly game 6 from the king. With his back against the wall, LeBron dropped 45 and 15. And this was a man who got crucified for shying away on the big stage! This cemented him as a ruthless killer. Remember those ""KD is not nice"" commercials? This was his ""LeBron is not human"" announcement. The underdog Celtics did a great job battling an overwhelming Heat team but ultimately fell. 


The Finals seemed so anticlimactic. LeBron had just exorcise his demons against the Celtics and arrived as possibly the most complete basketball player of all time. Miami made quick work of Oklahoma City, winning in five. Harden notoriously laid an egg while LeBron put up a triple double in game five on his way to finals MVP. It was all good though. The Thunder were bound to make it back with their incredibly young and promising stars.


Well, sometimes things are just too perfect. Someone had to pay Harden, KD, Westbrook, and Ibaka. And it sure as hell wasn't going to be Clay Bennett. To avoid the tax, Presti had to deal Harden to Houston for cents on the dollar. Eventually this turned into Steven Adams, so the Thunder got something out of it. Enough on that though. I'm not Simmons. In fact, this wasn't even the biggest trade of the offseason. That would be the end of the Dwightmare in Orlando. In a wild four team trade, the Lakers got Dwight, Philly got Andrew Bynum (process alert), Denver got Iguodala, and the Magic got a shitload of picks/prospects. The Lakers had their star center once again. Pairing him with Kobe seemed like a ticket to the finals. But what is this? LA made another trade? That's right, they sent a shitload of picks to God's favorite team, the Suns of Phoenix for franchise icon and two time MVP Steve Nash. As a fan, this was the end of our greatest era. It was sad. My favorite player got traded to the Lakers of all teams. I was resigned to having some kind of bastardized happiness when he got his ring. They even brought in D'antoni too! What the fuck was that?


Anyways, this Lakers team was the next superteam on paper. It was too perfect. After a 1-4 start, they fired Mike Brown and hired Mike D'Antoni. My motherfucking coach! Nash was constantly injured, Dwight was unhappy, and Kobe looked like Shaq broke into his house and shit all over his carpet. They got it together and actually resembled a good team by the end of the year. However, Kobe tore his Achilles right before the playoffs, punching the city of LA right in the collective dick.

And now for the rest of the league. The 2012-13 season was another great one. Without Harden, the Thunder got the top seed and put up a 60 win season. Not to be outdone, Miami won 66 and nearly set the record for longest winning streak in a season. IMO, this was LeBron's peak as an all around player. He's probably smarter now, and was more athletic in Cleveland, but he was so balanced and versatile that you really didn't have a weakness you could even point to. I mean god damn, the man shot 40% from three! Imagine that today. 

I remember this year for the one-hit wonders, namely the Nuggets and Knicks. Largely forgotten, those two teams were seriously fun to watch. The Nugs were fast paced, high flying, and full of hustle. Iggy, Gallo, and the manimal. Ty Lawson prior to his career imploding too. They beat out some good teams for the three seed. Their Eastern counterpart was the New York  Knickerbockers. This team was before their time. Bombing threes at a record pace, giving Steve Novak serious minutes, young JR in the city. Now that was fun. Definitely Melo's finest season in New York, but it was really Jason Kidd that made that team go in my opinion. 


Meanwhile, the Pacers came to play behind the leadership of emerging star Paul George and fearsome big man Roy Hibbert. San Antonio continued to win, Atlanta kept their playoff streak going, the Grizz and Clips were neck and neck all year, Bucks in 6 was born, and some team from Oakland made the playoffs for the first time in a while. Even the Nets did well with the play of the highest payed man in the NBA, Joe Johnson.


The postseason started with the Heat and Thunder, last year's finals teams, slotted with the one seed in their respective conferences. A rematches seemed likely, but it was not meant to be. Russell Westbrook was injured in a collision with Patrick Beverly, knocking him out of the playoffs. They got by Houston but fell to the Grizz in 5 next round.


Speaking of the Grizz, this was perhaps their finest season ever. They came back from down 2-0 to beat the Clippers and later advanced to the conference finals. Great job Memphis.


Injuries didn't just derail Oklahoma City. Denver lost Danilo Gallinari to a torn ACL while the rest of the team suffered a spinal laceration at the hands of Andre Iguodala. The fast-paced and fun Nugs lost to Golden State in six.


All in all, the Spurs ran through the western conference. Fuck me, right?


The East was far more exciting this postseason. Unfortunately, the Bucks fell in 4, falling short of their prophecy. The Rose-less Bulls won an oddly entertaining series against Brooklyn, the Pacers made quick work of Atlanta, and New York exorcisms their demons and beat the Celtics in six. 


Against Indiana, the Fighting Dolans did not fare as well. JR Smith absolutely vanished after playing so well all year. Amar'e's corpse was useless. The dream had died in New York.


This set up a Miami-Indiana conference finals, an oft-overlook classic. A lot of us forget how close this series really was. Hibbert, George, Hill, and West played out of their minds. Unfortunately, they ran into the best LeBron to ever play IMO. The man shot 51-44-78 on 29 points a game while being the leader in assists and rebounds on the Heat against the best defensive team in the league. Unreal. The series went the full seven, but the Pacers fell just short of doing the impossible.


Part of the reason we forget that conference finals was the epic that followed. Round one of Spurs-Heat showed it's not how you start, it's how you finish. The first five games, save for the initial bout, were not particularly close. That served to set up 6 and 7 as instant classics. With their backs against the wall, LeBron ditched the headband, Bosh made the most important offensive rebound in the history of basketball, and Jesus hit that infamous three to send it to OT. 


We tend to forget game seven in favor of six which is a complete disservice to ourselves in my opinion. Game seven may not have had the high-strung suspense of its predecessor, but it was a classic in its own right. (Quick tidbit- Only five guys on Miami scored in game seven and Birdman only added three. So essentially, LeBron, Wade, Battier, and… Mario Chalmers outscored the Spurs.) I remember Tim Duncan missing an easy layup and slapping the floor just as well as Allen hitting the three. LeBron turning the corner, NOT PASSING THE BALL, and hitting the series clinching midrange shouldn't be forgotten so easily. What a way to end the season.


Well boys, it happened this offseason. The single worst trade in NBA history. After trading Doc to the Clippers, the Celtics were in a full rebuild mode. Meanwhile, the Brooklyn Nets were buyers looking to win. So they sent KG, PP, Jet, and DJ White in exchange for (brace yourselves): Gerald Wallace (who they just traded a first- Damian Lillard- for), Kris Humphries, MarShon Brooks, Kris Joseph, Keith Bogans, three first round picks and the right to swap in 2017. 


Jesus Christ on the cross. The Nets mortgaged their future for three guys above 35. Not only did they trade three first round picks, they even went out of their way to use a pick-swap loophole to give the Celtics another one. I know we love to be armchair GMs but I really think any knowledgeable NBA fan would never have made that trade. Not in a million years.


In all honesty the rest of the offseason pales in comparison to the trade. Damn near half the league fired their coach, even Memphis who had made the conference finals. Phil Jackson made his return to basketball. Masai Ujiri left for Toronto. The Knicks traded a first for Andrea Bargnani, the Warriors got Iggy in a sign and trade, and the Sixers shipped Jrue Holiday to Nawlins for Nerlens Noel and a pick. 


Shameless plug here- the Suns had a lowkey great offseason. We got Gerald Green (good for us), Miles Plumlee (good for us for one year), and a first for Luis Scola. We also dumped a shitload of money to the Wizards for Emeka Okafor and a first. Best of all, we got Eric Bledsoe for Jared Dudley. We got younger, better, and opened up cap space.


When I think of the 2013-14 season, the team that sticks out to me the most is the Clippers. Not the Thunder, Heat, or my beloved Suns. The Clips had the strangest season I've ever seen. IMO this was their best team- Collison as backup PG, Big Baby Davis getting minutes, Matt Barnes starting- and could've won it all. 


They breezed to the third seed to face the Warriors of all teams. Easily favored, the Clips were all but set to move on.


Well, until Donald Sterling ran his racist, senile mouth. He told V. Stiviano not to bring black people to his games and not to associate with them. On a related note, he didn't get his second lifetime award from the NAACP he was supposed to in May. Life comes at you fast.


Subsequently, Sterling received a lifetime ban from the NBA. There was no place for him in the modern league. All the while, his team was casually playing in the postseason. The Clippers were pissed and distracted. Why wouldn't they be? Their fucking owner wouldn't want to associate with all but two and a half of them. LA got by in seven regardless.


The next round was a forgotten classic against MVP Kevin Durant. The Clippers orchestrated one of the greatest comebacks of all time to tie the series at 2 to set up a pivotal game five. I'll never forget the sequence of events at the end. Less than a minute left, Clips up 104-97, KD hits a three. Jamal misses his layup, KD makes his. Two point game. Right off the inbound, Westbrook rips CP3 and passes it to Reggie Jackson who seemingly loses it out of bounds. After a lengthy review, the officials incorrectly rule possession for OKC. On the ensuing play, CP3 (debatably) fouls Westbrook's 3 point attempt. He hits all three giving OKC a one point lead. LA calls timeout with 6 seconds left. On the other end, Paul loses the handle, sealing OKC's win. A crusher. The Thunder take game six and move on. 


I'd like to take a moment to remember how LA got screwed that game five. And it wasn't just against Houston that they seemed cursed.


The 2013-14 season as a whole was probably my favorite since I started watching. The Pacers starting hot and sputtering at the end, Kawhi's emergence as a star, Dallas, Memphis, and Phoenix vying for the last two spots in the west, the Bobcats making the playoffs, the Raptors winning a comically bad Atlantic Division, Damian and LaMarcus bringing Portland back to the playoffs, and on and on. 


I admittedly think back fondly to this season because of our unexpected success. I remember Bill Simmons saying his life would be a failure if he watching five of our games. And you know what? He was right at the time. We sucked.


But sometimes you catch lightning in a bottle. Goran Dragic, God bless that man, came home and led the offense like Nash and Kidd before him. PJ Tucker was hitting corner threes, Miles Plumlee was hitting hook shots, and the Morris brothers weren't being fat dickheads. Dragic played valiantly, earring third team all-NBA, but we feel one game short of the postseason. Such is life.


Speaking of postseason, 2013-14's first round was the best ever. San Antonio was pushed to 7 by the eight-seed Mavericks, powered by old man Carter's iconic buzzer beater. Oddly enough, Dallas was San Antonio's biggest challenge. OKC with MVP Durant faced Memphis and promptly went into overtime four times before blowing them out the last two. Shoutout to Zbo for getting suspended for game seven. The Clips beat GS in seven (quite the series). In fact, the only western series that don't go to seven was Houston vs Portland. LaMarcus and Dwight killed it all series. Troy Daniels was the Hero of the Day for Houston once. However, one play defined that whole series- Dame's buzzer beater. Iconic as fuck.


Across the Mississip' was another classic first round. Top seeded Indiana needed seven games to beat 38 win Atlanta. To this day Indiana's implosion is a mystery. Miami laughed Charlotte off the court. Toronto and Brooklyn went to seven as well. I irrationally got really into this series. I was really rooting for Lowry and co to pull this one out. That very last play in game seven couldn't have been more telegraphed. Fuck you Casey. Lastly, the Wall Star made his playoff debut, knocking off Chicago behind the expert tactician Playoff Wittman's leadership.


In the semis OKC beat LA (see above) and San Antonio ran through a bench-less Portland. The Wizards kept it close, but collapsed in game 4, blowing a shot to tie the series. Indiana survives. Miami made quick work of Brooklyn even though Brooklyn swept them in the regular season. Who knew?


This set up a pair of rematches in the conference finals. The Spurs had lost to the Thunder in 2012 but had a new weapon- Kawhi Leonard. To make matters worse for OKC, Serge Ibaka was out for the first two games. Subsequently, San Antonio took the first two quite easily. In game three, Ibaka made his triumphant return. His defensive versatility led OKC to wins in games three and four with a rematch with Miami looming. San Antonio surprisingly responded by eviscerating OKC in game five and later edging them out in OT. Old man Duncan rode again.


Meanwhile, Indiana may have been running on fumes but were ready to put up a fight. They came out swinging in game one but fell in the next three. Indy came back from a double digit deficit to force a game six but it was all for naught. Miami advanced once again, crippling Roy Hibbert's career in the process.


The Finals, well, were not so good. You remember game one for the AC going this the LeCramp debacle. Game two actually was close with Miami evening it up. Then it got ugly. The Spurs' team ball and use of dribble handoffs stymied the Heat's hyper aggressive switching. Kawhi became the guy while Wade fossilized on court. The Heat were simply too thin, slow, and old for San Antonio.


This, coupled with some fortuitous lottery luck, made coming home an appealing option for LeBron. On July 11th, 2014, he made his choice. The rest is history.


-----------------------------------------


The past three years, we’ve known the finals matchup far beyond the playoffs started (and even the champion in the preseason last year). I recognize the greatness of the Warriors. They were arguably the best team of all time and will continue to dominate the league. That’s impressive. Likewise, LeBron made the finals for the seventh straight year. What a testament that is to his legacy. I doubt we’ll see such an extreme dominance of a conference by one man in a long time. 


But the playoffs, especially pre-finals, just aren’t as exciting as they used to be. Have we had any pre-finals moments like 2014 when like half the first round series went to game seven? The Pacers pushing the Heat to the brink in 2013 behind Paul George’s emergence as a star? The upstart Warriors shocking the Nuggets? The Grizz knocking off the 1 seed Spurs? The inexplicably thrilling Nets vs Bulls first round matchup? Chris Paul and the Clippers getting hosed by the refs against OKC (loved that Clips team)? The Knicks looking like contenders for a year? These are some of my fondest memories of the NBA- but they were also meaningful. We just haven't had anything like that recently.


Sure, LeBron’s Heat was nearly lock for the finals. But those Pacers gave them a run for their money twice. And the Celtics didn’t go down without a fight. Miami couldn’t coast their way to the finals back then. They had to work for it, and without fail, they always kept it exciting. You could always bet on the East giving the Heat one challenger.


Then there’s the West. What more do I need to say? Even though my team got drilled these years, it was always a blast following the West throughout the season. Things always seemed to shake out differently. The Mavericks went on their legendary title run and promptly dismantled the team. OKC’s young, promising core made their first (and last) finals, an all-time great what-could-have-been. San Antonio’s revival spurred by beautiful team ball and Kawhi’s breakthrough. 


The competition wasn’t just the the top; Every team always came to play. Has there ever been such competitive play from the 8 seed? Let’s reminisce. The Grizz knocked off the top seeded Spurs in 2011. The Mavericks pushed San Antonio to the brink. (Vince Carter buzzer beater anyone?) The new-look Rockets with their freshly acquired James Harden made it a series against his old team.


Competition doesn’t just mean the postseason though. The regular seasons meant more for two reasons: more teams had a legitimate shot at the Finals and the advent of The Process™ had not yet reached the league.


I’ve gotten used to the Warriors vs Cavs finals. 2015 was a surprise for Golden State, but the past two years, we’ve pretty much known they were both going back. To make it worse, the much-beleaguered KD defection worsened the talent disparity. In other words, get ready for more Cavs vs Warriors.


Back then, you had to fight during the regular season because seeding mattered. You didn’t want to slip up towards the end and get matched up with the Grizz. San Antonio, OKC, LA Clippers, Memphis, and Dallas all were serious contenders at least once during this era. The little things during the season could change the course of the playoffs, be it one trade (looking at you Danny Granger), injury, etc. You never knew how things were going to shake out.


I will admit out east it was top heavy. Generally, there was the Heat and one or two other challengers. And in all honesty, that’s better than what we have now. It was fun watching the Bulls and Pacers steal the one seed from the Heat. Old man Garnett making his last stand against a pissed off LeBron. PG force feeding Birdman his shit. Other than that though, it wasn’t nearly as wild as the west. 


------------------------------------------


In a trade that will live in infamy, Philadelphia swapped all-star Jrue Holiday for Nerlens Noel and a top-five protected pick in 2014. This was newly-acquired GM Sam Hinkie’s first big move in Philly. A collective feeling of ""what the fuck?"" filled the air; Holiday was Philly's best player and supposed second banana to Andrew Bynum. Maybe I was just a stupid kid at the time, but it made no sense to me. This is what we can look back to as the start of the process. Hinkie became the first GM to outright say the league is flawed. You need a superstar, and realistically one or two more, to win the finals. The Sixers were nowhere near the bottom or the top. But shit, they had just recently beat the top-seeded Bulls in round one and took the Celtics to seven. This was not a bad team. But that's not what the NBA was about, Hinkie asserted. GMs and coaches can usually keep their jobs by being not bad. Why wouldn't they? Only one team wins. 29 lose. Not one owner could expect to win every year, and cleaning house after each season is definitely not the way to succeed.


But Hinkie didn't want to settle. Complacency was the enemy. He knew the only reliable way to land a superstar was in the draft. Specifically, the top of the draft. 


So the Sixers got bad. And I mean real bad. They lost and lost and lost, but they got their top picks. Just as importantly, they got their assets too. By taking on bad contracts, vets, and exploiting Sacramento, Philly had a treasure trove of picks down the line. They used a lot of their ammo to acquire Markelle Fultz- one of those franchise changing superstars.


Controversial as it may be, tanking has become widespread in the NBA. Since Golden State and Cleveland seem unbeatable, many teams, including my beloved Suns, have decided to start a “youth movement” in the meantime. (Sidenote: Props to Minnesota, Denver, Boston, Toronto, and all the other teams who aren’t rolling over. Godspeed to all of you)


What we have now is an extremely polarized sense of championship or bust. What was about 10 total contenders between 2011-2014 has been whittled down to 3. As a result, tanking has become an epidemic. The Sixers have their well-documented process. Mark Cuban admitted to tanking. My Suns sat veterans who could’ve added a few wins. The Hawks just blew it up. The Knicks are expressing interest in a “youth movement”. Orlando is doing something. 


Can you blame them though? Winning any time soon seems like an impossibility. The west looks like a meat grinder this year, but the Warriors are just too good. And when you know who’s going to win from day one, the entertainment value just isn’t the same.

notDAME,2017-07-14 16:44:41+00:00,[OC] How often do players play more than 82 games in the regular season?,"I was playing NBA 2k16's MyCareer gamemode and I just won MVP (again) in 2020. Looking at my stats, I noticed something. Not that I averaged a 42 point triple double, but that I didn't play 82 games that season. In fact, I played 83.

At first I was confused but I quickly realized how this occurred. I started the season playing for OKC but I requested a trade to Portland. The timing of the trade resulted in me playing more games than one team plays in an NBA regular season (82 games). For example if a player was on Team A and Team A faced Team B in the NBA regular season opener, that player would have one game played. Directly after the game, he was traded to Team C, who didn't play their season opener yet. The player played all 82 games for Team C and would end the season with 83 games played.

I was curious and decided to check basketball-reference to see if this has happened before. And if so, how often?

41 players since 1946 have played over 82 games in an NBA season. 20 of them played 83 games, 19 played 84, 6 played 85, 2 played 86, 1 played 87, and Hall of Famer Walt Bellamy played a whopping 88 games in the 1968 season. 

Playing 83 games in a season is unlikely but possible. However, how the hell did Walt Bellamy manage to play 88 games? In 1968, Bellamy played for the Knicks and played 35 games before being traded to the Detroit Pistons*. At the point of the trade, the Knicks had played 6 more games than the Pistons. Naturally, the Pistons had to make up those games and after playing all 53 games for Detroit, Bellamy finished the season with 88 total games played.

Is it possible that this record will ever be broken? No, not really. Back then, the NBA didn't have charted flights and the schedule were unbalanced to account for travel. I don't believe that in today's league a team would have 6 more games played than another team, although I could be wrong. Between the 1977-78 season and the 2016-2017 season, the most games played by a single player was 85 games played, which occurred three times (Shareef Abdur-Rahim 2003-2004, Theo Ratliff 2003-2004, Chris Gatling 1999-2000).

No player has played over 83 games since Casey Jacobson in the 2004-2005 season. Since then, only three players played over 82 games, all of which are active. Jarrett Jack, Ramon Sessions and most recently Josh Smith in the 2014-2015 season. 

Anyway, should this record be mentioned when people discuss the most unbreakable records in sports? 88 games played in an 82 game season? Maybe it should. 

*This trade sent another Hall of Famer, Dave DeBusschere, to the Knicks. Blockbuster trade, anyone? Fair to say that the Knicks won this trade, too. Howard Komives and Walt Bellamy for Dave DeBusschere, who ended up winning two championships with New York and receiving many different achievements such as All-Defensive First Teams, while Bellamy and Komives didn't make it to a single All-Star game after the trade.",nba,1060

Vito_The_Dogfather,2017-07-10 17:53:14+00:00,NBA teams as Kanye West songs (OC),"As a huge fan of both the NBA and Kanye West, I wondered how I could combine the two into a OC project. So after a long car trip and listening to all of Kanye's albums, this is what I came up with. 

Atlanta Hawks: Mercy- Not only does the song feature Hawks fanatic 2 Chainz but the Hawks ""let the suicide doors up"" this summer by letting Paul Millsap walk without an offer and embracing the rebuild.

Boston Celtics: Champion- The Celtics boast the most championships in NBA history at 17 but the song also contains the line ""Every summer he'd get some brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from"" which is actually the motto of Celtics GM Danny Ainge.

Brooklyn Nets: Only One- Both make me cry.

Charlotte Hornets: I am a God- Fun fact, Cody Zeller listens to this song before every home game and always shouts the line ""In a French-ass restaurant hurry up with my damn croissant"" at an uncomfortable Nic Batum.

Chicago Bulls: N/A- Kanye never talks about anything that could relate to Chicago.

Cleveland Cavaliers: New God Flow- ""Went from most hated to champion God flow, I guess that's a feeling only me and LeBron know"" Perfect.

Dallas Mavericks: Bad News- Shams reported that after DeAndre agreed to resign with the Clippers last summer, Mark Cuban was heard sitting in his office blaring this song on repeat.

Denver Nuggets: Gorgeous- Denver Nuggets fans Trey Parker and Matt Stone were confirmed unwavy when creating the song ""Gay Fish"" which prompted Ye to write the line ""Choke a South Park writer with a fish stick."" Gorgeous could also refer though to the passing ability of Nikola Jokic.

Detroit Pistons: Everything I Am- I could have gone with quite a few car puns here but instead the ""Everything I'm not, made me everything I am"" struck me as very Piston-y. The Pistons are not contenders and haven't been for awhile, but their refusal to tank makes them who they are. A consistent close to .500 team.

Golden State Warriors: Stronger- This team just won the NBA Championship and they actually improved by adding Omri Cassipi and the legend himself, Swaggy P. Also ""Stronger"" was Kanye's 3rd single to hit Number #1 in the U.S. and I'm not sure if it's well known but the Warriors hit lots of 3's. C O R R E L A T I O N.

Houston Rockets: Facts- ""James Harden running up the budget"" Congrats on the contract extension James.

Indiana Pacers: Heard Em Say- Paul George leaving was their ""Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today"" moment.

LA Clippers: Family Business- ""How's your son? He made the team this year?"" Welcome to the year of Austin Rivers, starting Point Guard, Clippers fans.

LA Lakers: All Falls Down- From being one of the best run franchises in sports to the Jim Buss era, the mighty sure have fallen on hard times but there is a potential savior. ""Shawty holla where the ballers at"" Los Angeles that's where the ballers at, the big ballers.

Memphis Grizzlies: Clique- Name 4 guys on a team you'd want to get in a fight with less than Mike Conley, Tony Allen, Zach Randolph, and Marc Gasol. Ain't nobody fucking with their clique.

Miami Heat: Diamonds from Sierra Leone- Pat Riley has definitely extorted a third world country for profit at one time or anoter. He looks so much like a Wall Street villain that the Movie ""Wall Street"" actually based the look of villain Gordon Gekko on Pat Riley.

Milwaukee Bucks: Flashing Lights- ""Don't believe in shooting stars"" Giannis shot 28% from 3 last season. Also, do Greeks believe in shoes and cars??

Minnesota Timberwolves: Runaway- If you watch the full length film it's 34 minutes, or 14 minutes less than Thibs plans on playing his starters this season. 

New Orleans Pelicans: Monster- Anthony Davis and Demarcus Cousins are monsters when paired side by side. ""Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?"" Demarcus has, in this rumor that I'm hoping that will eventually be confirmed in a Woj bomb.

New York Knicks: POWER- ""No one man should have all that power"" How is James Dolan still in control of an NBA franchise? If there were a series of Survivor: NBA Owners edition, James Dolan would be the first voted off the island.

Oklahoma City Thunder: Love Lockdown/Real Friends- Listen to this song and imagine Kevin Durant singing this song to Westbrook. Seriously, it works perfectly. Real Freinds as Westbrook's rebuttal to Durant.

Orlando Magic: FML- They tried to turn one of the most athletic bigs in the game who shoots 28% from 3 into a corner specialist. FML.

Philadelphia 76ers: Saint Pablo- ""People tryna say I'm going crazy on Twitter"" If you're not following Joel Embiid on twitter what are you doing? ""This generations closest thing to Einstein"" Hinkie died for your sins Sixer fans.

Phoenix Suns: School Spirit- The Suns roster current roster has 4 Kentucky Wildcats but eventually will be made up entirely of Coach Cal students causing him to come to Phoenix to finally prove Kentucky is better by itself than most NBA franchises.

Portland Trail Blazers: Get Em High- ""Why you think me and Dame cool? We assholes"" 

Sacramento Kings: Pick any sad, depressing Kanye song and it fits here

San Antonio Spurs: RoboCop- Kawhi's alter ego??

Toronto Raptors: Two Words- Lowry and Derozan will combine to make just over 60 million so they're living by two words, ""fuck you, pay me""

Utah Jazz: Slow Jamz- The Jazz played at the slowest pace in the league this past NBA season and Ricky Rubio looks like if you came over to his house he would definitely throw on some Marvin Gaye and some Luther Vandross.

Washington Wizards: Welcome to Heartbreak- Game 7. Kelly Olynyk. Sorry Wizards fans",nba,1921

Scarment,2017-07-07 16:50:24+00:00,[OC] Ranking all NBA teams by how cool their players names are,"EDIT: Just want to say thank you to this subreddit for making my karma increase by 6x. I know some people may disagree, but these are my rankings. Have Fun! Also, this is definitely a shit post

In honor of the Off-Season, we are gonna be looking at ranking all 30 NBA teams by player…NAMES.
The only criteria is that there is no criteria and I’m just going off of coolest names in my opinion. (Nicknames will also apply). I’m looking for names that flow well, sound like fun to say, however, if it’s a pretty generic name, but it flows well and just goes with the team or is just cool, it gets points. 
These names are names you want on the back of that jersey you bought on clearance from the NBA store cause the player just got traded at the deadline (R.I.P my DeMarcus Cousins Jersey) and also have to be fun to have NBA commentators say. So Bonus points to starters too!
Names that are good also resonate HYPE. We gotta get HYPED in the off-season, and the best players have these names. 

EDIT: FIXED THE FORMATTING. SORRY IM NEW TO SHITPOSTS

30) Utah Jazz

Poor Utah, they lost Free agency and they lost in these rankings. Although their back-ups can compete with “Shelvin Mack and Raul Neto”, none of their starters have cool names. Sure, “Gobert” and “Hood” are alright, but they ain’t cool. Especially on a legendary team that has boasted “The Mailman” and “Stockton” 

29) Cleveland Cavaliers

The Beast in the East is a mouse compared to these other teams. The names “LeBron” and “Love” put this team above Utah, but not much else. “Kyrie” is kinda cool, so there is that and “Tristan” is a name I like, so props to them, but it ain’t cool. The nickname “The King” is actually pretty cool. But what they lose points for is the fact that “Kyrie” doesn’t have a nickname yet, so he’s like a ghost or a phantom that doesn’t exist in the cool world. 

28) Memphis Grizzlies

Da Bears would be much higher on this list if they didn’t lose so many good named players in Free-Agency. The Power Forward position is stacked with cool names like “Ivan”, “JaMychal Green”, “Deyonta Davis” and “Jarell Martin” but every other position is generic like “Mike Conley” and “Tony Allen” and “Chandler Parsons”. God I hate the name Chandler. But I’m Russian so a name like “Ivan” and “Marc Gasol” gets some respect from me.

27) Oklahoma City Thunder

As opposed to the Utah Jazz, who got last place because they lost star players, the Thunder drop spots because they added a star player. “Russell Westbrook”, “Semaj Christon”, and “Dakari Johnson” elevate this team, but “Paul George” sounds like an old American general who served Washington. And as much as I respect the god-damn US of A, we talking bout basketball. Thunder boast a lot of American general sounding names like “Steven Adams” and “Doug McDermott” (McBuckets ain’t gonna score here.). So the 27th spot for you.  

26) Los Angeles Lakers

BIG BALLER BRAND.
BIG BALLER WAY
BIG BALLER ONLY ONE 

25) San Antonio Spurs

The San Antonio Spurs have been a staple of the NBA for a while. They have also played non-exciting, very methodical, and very boring basketball…Just like their player’s names. With the exception of “LaMarcus aldridge” and “Kawhi Leonard”, everyone else is meh. “Tony Parker” sounds too much like Peter Parker and that is just okay. Overall, Not too strong, but has some hope. 

24) Orlando Magic

Bismack Biyombo and Nikola Vucevic help, but this ranking is solely because Mario Henzonja plays here. I’m surprised they don’t play the Mario theme or play “It’s a Me, Mario” as his opening. So for that, they get 24. Everyone else has an average name. “Elfrid Payton” and “Evan Fournier” sound kinda cool. But kinda cool doesn’t get you higher than 24

23) Washington Wizards

“John Wall”, “Bradley Beal”, and “Otto Porter” and pretty decent names, especially because Wall rhymes with Ball like Ball is life. And you can’t go wrong with “Markeiff Morris” and “Marcin Gortat”. Overall average. Also, a name like Jason Smith, which is super American, belongs in the Capital. So they have that appeal to them. 

22) Boston Celtics

If you are a fan of the letter J, Boston is your team. “Jae Crowder, “Jaylen Brown”, “Jayson Tatum”, “Jabari Bird” and “Jonas Jerebko” are all solid names. Also, the name “Guerschon Yabusele” is hype AF, so got to give it credit there. Everyone else is pretty average, like “Smart”, “Horford”, but they do alright. 

21) Brooklyn Nets

Hey! The Nets aren’t last in something! With names like “D’angelo” and “LeVert” and “Rondae Hollis-Jefferson”, Nets fans have something to be hyped for. “Sean Kilpatrick”, “Timofey Mozgov”, and “Aleksander Vezenkov” round out a solid outing of names. Sadly, “Trevor Booker”, “Spencer Dinwiddie” and “Joe Harris” are not hype. 

20) Houston Rockets

Chris Paul and James Harden might be some of the best players in the NBA, but names like “Chris”, “Paul” and “James” ain’t hype. “The Beard” is a cool nickname, so bonus points for that. The starting lineup does not provide that much hype, but the bench does. Names like “Nene Hilario”, “George De Paula”, “Bobby Brown” (sounds like a rapper), “Jared Uthoff” and “Chinanu Onuaku” and “Zhou Qi” are definitely cool. But, minus points because half these players will play for .0001 minutes per game

19) Dallas Mavericks

When you have a player whose name is “Yogi”, you get some love. Every NBA fan loves Yogi Bear, so that’s pretty cool. “J.J Barea”, “Dorian Finney-Smith” and “Dirk Nowitzki” are all pretty fun and definitely worth some points. “Dennis Smith Jr.”, may not sound like a cool name to most, but the combination of the first and last name are pretty chill and can really come off well.


18) Indiana Pacers

Golf player sounding names like  “Glenn Robinson the Third” and “Lance Stephenson” are not hype. But “Victor Oladipo”, “Domantas sabonis”, “Myles Turner” (with a “Y”), “Ike Anigbogu” are all pretty cool with a mix of unique last names, but also great first names like “Victor” (another Russian sounding name). “Thaddeus Young” is a great name though. “Thaddeus” is a great name that should spur legends of hype all through Indiana.

17) Denver Nuggets

“Nikola “the Joker” Jokic” is a pretty hype name and sounds cool all the same. But the main man in Mile High is supported by some great first names such as “Emmanuel”, “Jameer”, “Malik”, “Vlatko”, and “Alozno”. “Juan Hernangomez” is also pretty hype, but it took too many tries to spell out. So Meh. 


16) Chicago bulls

Names like “Lauri Markkanen” (WITH TWO K’S) and “Joffrey Lauvergne” are pretty cool, along with “Robin Lopez” and “Paul Zisper”. But this team is formed with players straight out of a hype action movie. Like a movie about an awesome kick-ass character named “Denzel Valentine” and his buddy “Zach LaVine” who work with this guy named “Dwayne Wade” ( Kinda rhymes?) to take down “Cameron “The Pain” Payne”. Also “Bobby Portis” is the Comedic Relief. 

15) Toronto Raptors

Look, the 6 is here because the entire city of Toronto is cool and is filled with hype. From the Raptors logo, to Drake, Toronto has it all, but it only receives half bonus points because a Velociraptor isn’t going to be beating LeBron James in the Eastern Conference Finals next year. (Even then, I’m pretty sure James would dunk that extinct bird back to the ground). The Raptors have some respectable cool names though. In the starting lineup, “DeMar DeRozan”, “Jonas Valanciunas”, “Serge Ibaka”, and “Kyle Lowry” all have pretty good names that just go so well. The backups also back up the names too. “Fred VanVleet” and “OG Anunoby” and great names so the Raptors get points for that.

14) New York Knicks

It’s hard putting the Knicks so high on this list because of the dumpster fire they have been this off-season, but the player’s names are also pretty fire. “Kristap Porzingis”, “Mindaugas Kuzminskas”, “Willy Hernangomez”, “Joakim Noah” “ Sasha Vujacic”, “Ognken Jaramaz” and “Frank Ntilikina” are all very cool names. But they are very hard to pronounce, so that’s not cool. Overall, fire, like their front office, but not super cool. Bonus points for “Carmelo” being a cool name.

13) Philadelphia 76ers

76ers might be on the rise in these rankings. “J.J Redick”, “Markelle Fultz”, “Melo Trimble” “Joel Embiid” and “Dario Saric” are all pretty cool. Even “Ben Simmons” is a pretty good name. But Nik “SAUCE CASTILLO” Stauskas” is a god damn national treasure. They even made special sauce after him. That alone is amazing and cool and I envy this man who has his face on the side of hot sauce siracha.

12)  Atlanta Hawks

The Hawks definitely have some fly names (hehe puns). But the overall cast is lacking. That being said, names like “DeAndre Bembry” and a guy whose last name is “Prince” are pretty cool. But this team is carried by two reserves “Alpha Kaba” and “DIAMOND STONE!!!”. I mean Alpha is number 1 and “Diamond Stone” is a generational name that is amazing. Sadly, both are pretty buried on the depth chart, so they only take the team so far, but they do it for the Culture. 

11) Miami Heat

“Goran “The Dragon” Dragic” carries this team, but he has some help. “Justice”, “Hassan”, and “Udonis” are great names, and “Dion Waiters” is a hype name. These names have style and personality. They get bonus points because these players play prominent roles in the team so commentators love saying “The Dragon” and “Justice” so props to them.

10) Minnesota Timberwolves

Some people might think this is too high for this team. But like Reservoir Dogs, The Timberwolves are Suave. “Karl-Anthony Towns” and “Jimmy butler” are suave and fashionable names that bring mystique. “Taj Gibson”, “Gorgui Dieng”, “VJ Beachum”, and “Shabazz Muhammad” are also incredibly chill and just sound awesome. These first names belong in a Fast and Furious movie and that gets them points. “Andrew Wiggins” isn’t the greatest name, so they lose points for a name that sounds like a rugrats ripoff. 

9) Golden State Warriors

The Dubs are here solely on nicknames alone. Between “Slim Reaper”, “Iggy” “Chef Curry”, “Swaggy P”, Matt “The Champion” Barnes, this team is very cool. Names like “ZaZa” add flavor, but the nicknames are the real reason the Warriors are competing here. Sadly, not much else is going on for this team. Names like “Kevin” and “Klay” and “David West” and just meh. So they can’t really advance higher than this. 

8) Milwaukee Bucks

“Giannis “The Greak Freak” Antetokounmpo” carries this team here like he did in the regular season, but this time he has help! “Thon Maker”, “Jabari Parker”, “Matthew Dellavedova” and Rashad Vaughn” are great names that can definitely get someone hypes. These combinations of first and last names make an All-Star name squad. Unfortunately, “Gary Payton”, “Greg Monroe”, and “John Henson” are meh. But they aren’t starting so bonus to them.

7.)Portland Trailblazers

The Trailblazers have some swag to them. “Damian “Dolla Dame” Lillard” is an aspiring rapper and that resonates with Hype savants. Names like “Moe Harkless”, “Al-Farouq Aminu”, “Jusuf Nurkic” and “Caleb Swanigan” are all names that make you nod your head and go “Yeah, that’s pretty chill”. This names are fun to pronounce, look good on jerseys, and just exude swag. The team is very balanced, even generic names like “Evan Turner”, “Jake Layman” and “Zach Collins” flow well and sound like pretty hyped players. So points for them.

6) Detroit Pistons

Teams in the Top 7 need to have really cool names that when you see them, you need to be thinking that these are really cool players. But they can’t have ridiculous names that are just crazy. Those are hard to pronounce and lose points. The Pistons are right there. Players like “Ish Smith”, “Tobias Harris”, “Stanley Johnson” and “Luke Kennard” are simple yet elegant names that make you wanna watch this player. But “Andre Drummond” is a great name. “Drummond” is an elegant and beautiful name. “Andre” reminds you of greats like Dr.Dre and Andre the Giant. The whole team is a great source of these kind of names, thus they are very cool. Motor City is also the epitome of cool. The team has always had suave and elegant player names like “Ben Wallace” and “Chauncey Billups”. So the tradition lives on. 

5) Phoenix Suns

No team has been carried more by one player than the Phoenix Suns. “Dragan Bender” is the greatest name in the NBA. But sadly, this is a team effort, thus they lose points. “Eric Bledsoe” and “Marquese Chriss” are cool names, but “Devin Booker”, “Josh Jackson”, and “Tyson Chandler” are meh. BUT GOD DAMN THIS GUYS NAME IS DRAGAN BENDER. LIKE THAT IS AN OP LAST AIRBENDER TYPE AVATAR-****.  

4) Charlotte Hornets.

Sometimes names come up and you just gotta say, damn, that’s pretty cool. “Michael Kidd-Gilchrist” and “Michael Carter-Williams” rock the double last name and you just gotta say that is pretty cool. These jerseys look cool and the names are just overall cool. But these guys are supported by “Cody Zeller”, “Malik Monk” and “Kemba Walker”. All these names are incredibly cool and you just oogle at these guys. Names like “Dwight “Superman” Howard” and “Johnny O’Bryant” may make some people think that these are generic names, but flow is incredibly important in these rankings, and these two names are very chill. Also, they have a guy named “Dwayne Bacon”. Yep. 

3) Los Angeles Clippers

The Clippers may not have a star player (a star name of course), but as a team have incredible balance on the cool scale. Last names like “Griffin”, “Thornwell”,”Gallinari” “Mbah a Moute” and “Beverley” are all incredibly cool last names that just make you want jerseys of them. Even the first names, ranging from an ever-lasting cool “Blake” to “Sindarius” to “ Danilo”, you’ve got  great combination of names.  

2) New Orleans Pelicans

Clean, Cool, and Calm. The three things that are emphasized on the Pelicans. Names like “Solomon”, “Holiday”, and “Anthony Davis” just ooze a clean cluster of coolness that you only find in fancy parties in the movies. Names like “Chieck Diallo”, “Donatas Montiejunas”, “E’Twuan Moore” and “Omer Asik” are fun and exotic. And of course, “DeMarcus “Boogie” Cousins” has one of the best nicknames in the NBA. The Brow and Boogie make a great team, and the supporting cast does an excellent job of creating an atmosphere that just states coolness. 

	
1)	Sacramento Kings

I mean, who else really. This team boasts quality names with  “Skal Labissiere”, “Georgios Papagiannis”, “Buddy Hield”, “De’Aaron Fox” “Kosta Koufos” and “Malachi Richardson”. But wait, there’s more! With free agency, they got “Vince Carter” (which is an awesome name) and “Zach “Z-Bo” Randolph”, so that is completely epic for a stacked team already. And how can we forget “Willie Trill Cauley-Stein” who LEGALLY changed his name to have Trill in it. I mean this team is completely dominant and destroys the competition. So many great names, and so much hype around this team. This is confirmed…that the Sacramento Kings are the greatest team in the NBA.

I utilize collaborative methodologies to understand how rural mountain communities recover from natural disasters using the catastrophic 2015 Nepal earthquakes as an example. AMA!","Natural hazards, such as earthquakes and tsunamis, are difficult to predict and control. They can also have devastating impacts on life and property. These natural hazards become natural disasters depending on how social and ecological systems experience them. The same hazard can have drastically different outcomes in alternate contexts. Factors such as social and economic inequality, weak government response, and poorly planned and constructed infrastructure can force a hazard to shift to a disaster. 

Ethnographic and survey research after natural disasters can provide valuable insights on what factors facilitate or hinder recovery and how to build on local resilience. Identified factors could then be used preemptively in disaster preparedness to inform local planning and vulnerability analyses in other locations; these factors may also assist in facilitating disaster response in comparable contexts, making interventions more appropriate and sustainable in the long-term. 

In my research group, we are currently developing a linked quantitative and qualitative model that predicts adaptive capacity to natural disasters (Drawing Lessons from a Catastrophe). I’m honored to talk with you about my applied anthropological research and share the stories of these earthquake survivors. Please ask me anything!

I found that there are roughly 400 million NBA fans in the world and about 150 million likes for every NBA team. I took 400 million/150 million and multiplied by each team’s likes to get as realistic as possible of an estimate at each teams’ fan bases then started to research how many of their namesake there were in the world. Brace yourself for many wild assumptions.
 
 &amp;nbsp;

76ers:
 
Fans: 3,961,197
 
What an actual 76er is: 1776, the year the Declaration of Independence was signed. Whether this means the actual year, anyone born in 1776, anyone in alive in 1776, or the signers of the Declaration is unclear
 
Actual 76ers: Actual people that were born or were alive in 1776 are all dead now and there is only one year of 1776 so either 0 or 1
 
More 76ers fans than 76ers

Pelicans

Fans:
4,241,700
 
What an actual pelican is:
Genus of large water birds characterized by a long beak and a large throat poach
 
Actual pelicans:
Estimated at 650,000
 
More Pelicans fans than pelicans
 
 &amp;nbsp;

Bucks
 
Fans: 4,270,717
 
What an actual buck is:
A male antlered animal: deer, reindeer, antelope, caribou, goat, sheep
 
Actual bucks:
There are over a billion goats worldwide and assuming half of them are male, plus the male populations of the other animals, there are a lot of bucks.
 
*More bucks than Bucks fans*

 &amp;nbsp;

Bulls
 
Fans:
48,980,735
 
What an actual bull is:
Adult male non-castrated cow
 
Actual bulls:
There are over 1.3 billion cows in the world and I assume at least the 1/27 of that figure, which would be 48 million, are adult, male, and non-castrated
 
*More bulls than Bulls fans*
 
 &amp;nbsp;

Cavaliers
 
Fans:
23,315,744
 
What an actual cavalier is:
 
There are several definitions:
 
* A supporter of King Charles I
 
* A mounted soldier
 
* A small spaniel
 
Actual cavaliers:
 
I’d say the modern day supporters of King Charles I are closer to 0 than 23,315,744
 
The US Army says they only have 176 horses and I doubt the rest of the world has the other 23 million needed
 
Only 4,259 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels were born in 2014 so I’d say their population is significantly smaller than 23 million

More Cavaliers fans than cavaliers
 
 &amp;nbsp;

Celtics
 
Fans:
22,975,028
 
What an actual Celtic is:
The six Celtic nations are Scotland, Ireland, the Isle of Man, Wales, Cornwall, and Brittany
 
Actual Celtics:
Adding up the populations of those six nations I came up with 20,030,471 Celtics
 
More Celtics fans than Celtics
 
 &amp;nbsp;

Clippers
 
Fans:
9,982,912
 
What an actual clipper is:
A very fast sailing ship used in the middle third of 19th century.  They were fast, yacht-like vessels, with three masts and a square rig. They were generally narrow for their length, could carry limited bulk freight, small by later 19th century standards, and had a large total sail area. Clipper ships were mostly constructed in British and American shipyards, though France, Brazil, the Netherlands and other nations also produced some. Clippers sailed all over the world, primarily on the trade routes between the United Kingdom and its colonies in the east, in trans-Atlantic trade, and the New York-to-San Francisco route round Cape Horn during the California Gold Rush. Dutch clippers were built beginning in the 1850s for the tea trade and passenger service to Java. The boom years of the clipper ship era began in 1843 as a result of a growing demand for a more rapid delivery of tea from China. It continued under the stimulating influence of the discovery of gold in California and Australia in 1848 and 1851, and ended with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869.
 
 
Actual clippers:
The *Cutty Sark* is the last surviving clipper, so 1

The sound caused by lightning. Depending on the distance and nature of the lightning, thunder can range from a sharp, loud crack to a long, low rumble (brontide). The sudden increase in pressure and temperature from lightning produces rapid expansion of the air surrounding and within a bolt of lightning. In turn, this expansion of air creates a sonic shock wave, similar to a sonic boom, which produces the sound of thunder, often referred to as a clap, crack, peal of thunder, or boom. Some might even say the sound is ""supersonic.""

philwelch,2017-06-18 23:18:27+00:00,The Golden State Warriors and the McBench,"Golden State has the most dominant starting lineup in the NBA. But what about the bench? It's no secret that Iguodala and Livingston--two guys who would be starters on a lot of NBA rosters--bring a lot of power off the bench. But I think the real secret to success has been the Warriors' consistent philosophy of developing their McBench. After drafting James Michael McAdoo in 2014 and Patrick McCaw this season, the free agent signing of JaVale McGee brings the Warriors 3/5 of the way to a serious McSecondUnit that can give the starters some rest. McGee might already be a better center than Zaza ""The Wrecking Ball Of The NBA"" Pachulia, while Patrick McCaw is a legitimate spot-up three point shooting threat. McAdoo is more of a project, but his PER has technically been above average for 2 of his 3 NBA seasons.

So how can Golden State fill out their McBench over the next couple of years? Here's a breakdown of every NBA player and near future draft prospect not already playing for Golden State with a McLastname:

* [Ray McCallum](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mccalra01.html): 6-3, PG, 26 years old, 6.9/1.6/2.7. Free Agent. This player can probably be had for a minimum contract, but is unlikely to contribute much of anything. However, if Golden State signs one of the other players on this list with very similar names, dyslexic or easily confused wing defenders might overcommit to McCallum, opening up space for others to shoot.

* [Sheldon McClellan](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mcclesh01.html): 6-5, SG, 24 years old, 3/1.1/0.5. Rookie for the Washington Wizards, this undrafted free agent managed to play 17 minutes in the playoffs this year, racking up an impressive 22.4 postseason PER with 29.6 points per 36 minutes and 40.9 points per 100 possessions. Despite these promising statistics, he has disqualified himself from consideration for the McBench by [legally changing his name to Sheldon Mac](https://www.sbnation.com/2017/2/22/14704920/wizards-rookie-sheldon-mcclellan-now-goes-by-sheldon-mac-who-is-not-shelvin-mack).

* [C.J. McCollum](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mccolcj01.html). 6-4, SG, 25 years old, 23/3.6/3.6. McCollum is contracted with Portland until 2021 with a salary starting at $24 million next season. Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston are both free agents this year; their salaries add up to about $17 million together. If Portland is desperate to clear out cap room while remaining in ""win now"" mode, a trade might be possible, but McCollum is not a realistic target for the Warriors unless they are serious about confusing backup wing defenders with a McCollum/McCallum backcourt.

* [T.J. McConnell](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mccontj01.html), 6-2, PG, 25 years old, 6.9/3.1/6.6. This third year player is contracted with the Sixers until 2018, with an option for 2019, at league minimum salary. An undrafted free agent, McConnell has earned a starting role at Philadelphia. However, with Philadelphia's impending trade for the first overall pick in this year's draft, they may seek to trade McConnell for an NBA veteran with championship DNA. Consider a sign-and-trade of Shaun Livingston for T.J. McConnell one of the most likely moves for Golden State to refresh their second unit.

* [Chris McCullough](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mcculch01.html), 6-11, PF, 22 years old, 2.2/1.2/0.1. This second year player has been in and out of the D-League while serving out his rookie scale contract after being drafted in the first round by the Brooklyn Nets. Washington may be interested in offloading McCullough, but Golden State already has a McPowerForward on the bench who doesn't get that many minutes in McAdoo, so unless Jerry West sees a lot of potential in the 22-year-old, this is an unlikely signing.

* [K.J. McDaniels](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mcdankj01.html), 6-6, SG/SF, 24 years old, 4.2/1.7/0.3. With a career three point percentage of 29% and a career spent bouncing from team to team and in and out of the D-League, K.J. is not well suited for Golden State. To make matters worse, he has a $3.33 million dollar a year contract that lasts until 2018. Consider K.J. an unlikely target, unless Brooklyn is so desperate to offload him that they are willing to trade him and several years of first round picks for David West and Kevon Looney.

* [Doug McDermott](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mcderdo01.html), 6-8, SF, 25 years old, 9.0/2.7/0.9. McDermott follows a long, proud tradition of token white wing players who can hit three-pointers. He is contracted through 2018 at a rookie scale deal, but the Warriors could probably swap some bench players for this guy if they really wanted to--and really, why wouldn't you want to be the first NBA franchise to win a title with a bench entirely composed of players with last names beginning with ""Mc""?

* [Mitch McGary](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mcgarmi01.html), 6-10, PF, 25 years old, 4.4/3.5/0.3. This free agent has been in and out of the D-League, doesn't even shoot three pointers, and was waived by Oklahoma City, making him an unlikely replacement for David West coming off the bench. 

* [Rodney McGruder](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mcgruro01.html), 6-4, SG, 25 years old, 6.4/3.3/1.6. This Miami Heat rookie is signed through 2019. Despite hitting about 33% of his three-pointers, he probably isn't worth what it would take to trade for him. Consider Rod an unrealistic target.

* [Dominic McGuire](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mcguido01.html), 6-9, SG/SF/PF, 31 years old, 2.7/3.4/1.2. This veteran utility player also doesn't shoot three pointers and has been a free agent since 2013. Why does Basketball Reference still list him as an active player?

* [Ben McLemore](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mclembe01.html), 6-5, SG, 24 years old, 8.1/2.1/0.8. This restricted free agent is definitely good enough, and after four years in Sacramento may decide that he wants to stay in northern California but does not want to play for an incompetent franchise that is clearly rebuilding around Buddy Hield and Willie Cauley-Stein. Definitely one of the more plausible targets on this list.

* [Jerel McNeal](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mcneaje01.html), 6-3, PG, 30 years old, 1.5/0.5/0.3. This free agent is a scrub who played six games for Phoenix in the 2014/15 season. His Twitter account has been suspended, so I have no idea what he has been doing with his life since 2015.

* [Jordan McRae](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mcraejo01.html), 6-6, PG/SG, 26 years old, 4.4/1.1/0.5. McRae was waived by the Cavs in 2017 and the combo guard may very well be hungry to win a ring at his former team's expense. With a career 3P% of 38.4%, consider McRae a possible bench presence.

* [Josh McRoberts](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mcrobjo01.html), 6-10, PF/C, 30 years old, 4.9/3.4/2.3. This veteran Miami stretch big is contracted through 2018, but hasn't had a lot of minutes since joining Miami, making him a plausible target. His $6 million dollar salary might be a sticking point, however.

And now the draft prospects:

* [Brandon McCoy](http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Brandon-Mccoy-90025/), 6-11, C, 19 years old. This five-star prospect has committed to UNLV. Scouting reports indicate that McCoy is an athletic rim protector who lacks drive and has poor decision-making ability. Sounds like a young JaVale McGee to me. McCoy is definitely a 2018 draft target for Golden State if they are willing to commit to the McBench strategy.

* [Connor McCaffery](http://www.espn.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/199887/connor-mccaffery), 6-4, SG. This high school senior is a four-star recruit who has committed to Iowa. I can't find any more data on him.

* [David McCormack](http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/David-McCormack-98354/) ([ESPN](http://www.espn.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/215744/david-mccormack)), 6-10, C. A 4/5 star prospect in the class of 2018, he hasn't committed to a college yet. He [impressed at the NBA Top 100 Camp](http://alabama.247sports.com/Bolt/NBA-Top-100-day-two-David-McCormack-controls-the-paint-53204683) and is likely to commit to Duke, so look for him to be a prospect for Golden State to try and pick up if they need to replace McCoy or McGee.

Are there eight players in here to make a McBench? Out of these players, I would take McConnell, McDermott, McLemore, McRae, and McCoy to supplement McCaw, McGee, and McAdoo. Those eight players would cover all five positions, provide some three-point shooting off the bench, and replace aging veterans like Iguodala and Livingston to keep Golden State contending for years to come. There would definitely be a hit to Golden State's depth by pursuing this strategy--among other things, there's no clear replacement for Iguodala in the death lineup--but it's entirely possible that Golden State will continue to win titles even pursuing this completely arbitrary strategy.",nba,1611

&gt; ""I've always held the bar up very high for Kobe and he's not only reached that bar, but he's jumping over the top of it right now,"" Phil Jackson said. ""It's the best that I've seen a player of mine play with an overall court game.""

&gt; ""I never asked Michael to be a playmaker,"" Jackson said. ""That's the greatest player I ever had, that I could consider the greatest player in the game. Yet I never asked him to be a playmaker in those terms. I asked him to be a playmaker when he was doubled or tripled. Kobe has to set up the offense, read the defense, make others happy and he's doing a great job of it. Kobe has become the floor leader on a basketball team that was looking for that player who can not only be a scorer, but also be a playmaker who can consistently make big plays at critical times. It was very important for Kobe to step into that role he was envisioned at.""

[Source](http://www.nba.com/playoffs2001/finals/west/recap_lal_sas_010519.html?nav=ArticleList)

&gt; O'Neal said it wasn't the points but the way Bryant scored them that was so impressive. 

&gt; ""That's where I've been trying to get him all year,"" O'Neal said. ""He's been getting his points, getting everybody involved, drawing and kicking, doing the right things. Somebody once said the mark of a great player is how you make the other players around you play. I now can truly say that Kobe Bryant is the best player in this league."" 

[Source](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/nba/01playoffs/conffinals/2001-05-27-lakers-spurs-game-4.htm)

&gt; ""I can't believe how much better Kobe is, scoring, defensively, giving us open shots,"" Derek Fisher said. ""We all feed off him.""

[Source](http://a.espncdn.com/nba/playoffs2001/2001/0531/1207916.html)

&gt; ""When he took over, it's what Michael always used to do,"" said Spurs reserve and ex-Bull Steve Kerr. ""A team would start to come back and make a run, especially in their home building, and their fans would get behind them, and all of a sudden -- bam! -- he just sucks the air out of the place. That's what Kobe was doing.""


[Source](http://articles.latimes.com/2001/may/31/sports/sp-4630)

&gt; In the playoffs, O'Neal is averaging 34.0 points at home and 23.6 points on the road. The discrepancy would be of greater concern if Bryant weren't so up for the challenge of the road. It's one other department in which Bryant can handle whatever chores Shaq leaves unfinished. Kobe is averaging 28.2 points at home and 35.8 on the road.

[Source](http://a.espncdn.com/nba/playoffs2001/2001/0531/1207916.html)

&gt; Did you hear what Gregg Popovich said after Bryant and the Lakers used Pop's Spurs to mop the courts at the Alamodome and Staples Center in the Western Conference Finals?

&gt; ""He's not just going up and down the court anymore, playing on talent,"" Popovich said. ""He's using his ability and playing wisely. He knows what time of the game it is, what the situation is and where his teammates are. That takes time to learn. In terms of development, he's really made a big leap.""

[Source](http://www.nba.com/playoffs2001/finals/west/recap_lal_sas_010519.html?nav=ArticleList)

&gt; With 93 points in consecutive games, Bryant was drawing a comparison with the greatest big-game player ever -- Michael Jordan. 

&gt; Horace Grant kept referring to Bryant as ""No. 23,"" the number Jordan wore. It wasn't a mistake. 

&gt; ""I knew what I was saying,"" Grant said.

showgoing,2017-06-03 16:16:59+00:00,We make and curate free Spotify playlists of bands with tour dates in your city. They are continually updated with the top songs and bands that you can go see perform live near you. They are basically playlist versions of all your city venues' event calendars.,"We love live music and what we used to have to do to plan what shows we wanted to see was go to each venue's event calendar, then click the link to each artists page to listen to their music one at a time. It's a slow process, but how else are you going to discover cool new music you can go see live? Well, we thought we could make that process easier, so we made [https://showgoing.com]( https://showgoing.com). 

You just listen to the playlist and any artist you want to see live you can check out their tour dates in Spotify tapping on ""Go to Artist"" and it's under ""Tour Dates"", or if it's not there (sometimes Spotify doesn't list every tour date) all the tour dates are listed for each playlist at [https://showgoing.com]( https://showgoing.com).

Right now we are in three cities (nyc, la, and dc) but if this gets popular it's totally scalable so we will hopefully have demand to grow to all the big cities.

From our site: ""About SHOWGOING™ WHY WE THINK THIS IS GREAT

It's free. It's easy.

Maybe you're listening and your favorite band comes on. You just found out they're coming to town!

Maybe you're listening and discover some amazing unknown band. Feel like impressing your friends with how in touch you are with the live music scene?

Maybe you're the type of person who would go to shows but you don't have time to figure out which ones you'd want to see. If only someone would just make a playlist for you...

This is for you. We made this because we love you :)""

Here’s a link to our Spotify profile where you can find all the playlists in case our shitty server gets hugged to death: [https://open.spotify.com/user/showgoing](https://open.spotify.com/user/showgoing)

Let us know what you think:

Are there other genres you'd like to see?

What other cities should we add?

Does this even make sense?

Any and all feedback is welcome. We're just trying to make something cool. We hope we're on the right track


Edit: ok, we are setting up playlists for Chicago and Austin and should have them up and running by the end of next week. Next up is looking like Nashville and Portland we think. Keep the city requests coming in!


Edit 2:  we also need the right two or three letter abbreviations for your city, so let us know those too!  CHI for Chicago and ATX for Austin right?  NSH Nashville and PTX Portland?  


Edit 3:  we're overwhelmed by all the incredible feedback!  We have had a lot of people ask us to make playlists for specific cities or genres.  We're going to do our best, but if you also enter the city/genre you'd like into this form, we'll email you when we make the playlist you're interested in!

I'm 20 years old and have spent 1/3 of my life playing Minecraft. Although I mostly stopped, about 10 months ago to do something.

Over the years I've been in many Minecraft communities. I've logged thousands of hours. I'd spend several hours a day on school nights and most of my weekends playing. Addiction is a term that might fit. Through this game though, I've made many friends. People I've only talked to online, some I had seen some pictures of, but I'd never met them in real life. Despite that, I still considered them to be friends. A several years ago that was a pretty weird sentiment. It's becoming more and more acceptable these days though.

Throughout my time playing this game I built countless castles and bases, and redstone contraptions. I ran my own UHC server for about two years (shout out to the /r/ultrahardcore subreddit), and I played on the Jsano Fan Server. One day while me and my friends were messing around, I jokingly said I was going to visit them. I even found a map of the US and in MS paint I drew up ""my route"". It was entirely a joke.

Out of the innumerable jokes I've made in my life, that one really stuck with me. It bounced around my head and would randomly come up. In my last year or two of high school I started running out of time to play. I'd sometimes just log onto the server and sit there and do homework rather than actually play. For those of you who have completed highschool, you know how the last two years there's a big pressure on what comes next. What will you do after you finish high school? Which university will you go to? Have you applied yet? What about scholarships? How are your grades you're keeping them up right? What are you doing playing Minecraft all the time don't you have homework to do? I work hard in highschool, and I was almost valedictorian. I was part of many extracurriculars as well. By the end there I was really afraid of burning out. I worried that I'd go to university and then all that pressure that had been building up would finally just explode like a bed in the Nether. So I realized I needed a year off before university. So what do you think was still bouncing around in my mind, like Steve on a slime block? 

So in my final year of high school I decided to do it. I got a job and saved up the money, I more thoroughly planned out the route. I messaged people that I had fallen out of contact with. (My parents are separated, dad in San Francisco, and I live with my mom in Toronto). So when I was in California for Christmas with my dad I mentioned it to him very casually as if it wasn't even a real plan. He actually really liked the idea. After I had gotten back home to Canada, I fine tuned my plan a bit more and in February told my mom. She took it okay. She was far from pleased that instead of going to university I was going to walk across the US to meet some people I played videogames with, but she understood me as a person and could see I was dedicated to this. 

I graduated high school June 28th, 2016. I got a second job a few days later and worked 60 hours a week until I quit both jobs. On August 14th I set off walking, from the small town of Waterdown, Ontario, to the American border. I crossed it and began my walk across America.

Over the last 9 months of walking I met 9 Minecraft friends. In Ohio, Kentucky, Louisiana, Utah, Idaho, and Washington. In that time I walked 3,600 miles. I also met tons of other people along the way, I had experiences I never dreamed I could, I've been on TV, the radio, and even a newspaper. It's all because of that one joke, those friends I made, and this game. 

It's impossible to quantify the impact this game has had on my life. I'm posting this now because I met up with my last Minecraft friend in Seattle about a week ago. I'm not quite finished with my trip. I will finish in San Francisco in about a month from now. I'm currently in Portland, Oregon. 

TL;DR I kinda like Minecraft, it's fun.

Bernie Sanders should be held responsible for his rhetoric during the campaign that allowed such a climate to thrive. Every American should be scared of the way Bernie supporters are allowed to speak their hateful thoughts. This justifies the mobilization of an ""anti-hate"" mob that should attack any visible Bernie supporter so that something like this never happens again.

Many of the tools currently available for diagnosing these diseases are incapable of detecting their presence in the early stages after their onset when treatment would be optimal, and treatments, where they exist, are often costly, invasive, and can damage healthy cells. In recent decades, advances in chemistry, materials sciences, and nanotechnology have laid the groundwork for personalized medicine—the idea that we can develop products to diagnose and treat specific maladies in individual patients.
 
In my lab, my research group and I are currently developing nanostructured materials that preform a number of functions essential to the early diagnosis and treatment of disease, including targeted drug delivery and imaging agents (http://web.pdx.edu/~mackiewi/main.html# , and http://web.pdx.edu/~mackiewi/main.html#).

Last month, I was fired from my position as a section editor for the Vanguard, the student-run newspaper at Portland State University, after I tweeted out a video of a Muslim speaking at an interfaith event. The tweets were shared on my personal social media.

In the video, the panelist is answering a question about if a verse in the Qur'an permits the killing of ""infidels.""

Four days later, I was fired from my job after Breitbart wrote an article based on my tweets. My editor-in-chief said I was “predatory and reckless” towards the Muslim student and I had put him and his family in danger.

I wrote about the incident in an op-ed in the National Review on May 12: http://www.nationalreview.com/article/447563/free-speech-islam-portland-state-vanguard-editor-fired-tweets

This is the response by my former editor-in-chief:
http://psuvanguard.com/in-response-to-fired-for-reporting-the-truth/

My firing doesn’t affect much outside of my small PSU community; however, this story isn't really about me or the panelist. The firing has implications and connections to the larger trend towards self-censorship in the name of political correctness. As a student journalist, I was trained on how to treat different groups of people differently based on their defined privilege or oppression.

Last night while returning home from a business trip I boarded my last connection in Portland at 10:00 PM.  On the plane was a family, Man, wife and 3 very young children.  They were obviously of Muslim faith as the wife was in a hijab and the father had a headscarf as well.  The man had obviously suffered some trauma as his movement were almost epileptic and his speech was very slurred.  The three children were all very obviously scared and screaming at the top of their lungs....non-stop.  They were clinging to their mother and as FAA rules dictate they sit in their own seat with a seatbelt the anxiety, lack of communication, fear escalated when the flight crew was trying (carefully) to seat them.   This lasted 1 hour sitting on the tarmac.  People were graciously and willingly trying to give up their seats to have the children be as close to their mother as possible.  One man broke out his phone and started sharing fishing videos with one boy (this worked fabulously!).  I cannot say enough and with emphasis how well the flight crew of Alaska Flight #2346M handled themselves and the situation.  They were heroic (I do not toss that term around lightly) in the way they handled what could have gone very bad.  Oh, one more little fact.  Upon arrival at the airport (12:15 am) they were greeted by a large group of people holding a sign saying ""Welcome to America"", you see, this family were refugees from war-torn Somalia.  They were welcomed with grace, understanding and compassion in a challenging situation.  Yes, welcome to America.  This is the USA I hope for.""",Portland,1128

Today's Mid-day MAMA MAGA thread is about -- you guessed it -- based Moms everywhere... and some other people with a uterus who deported a wonderful, then-uncorrupted child.

First - to every mother out there: 
#HAPPY *MAMA* DAY!!!

For those of us who have had their mothers in their lives, let's take a moment to appreciate them, who braved the Fetal Harvest Lobby to spawn your ungrateful ass.
She made you. She taught you. She forgave you. She supported you. She comforted you. She believed in you. 
She put up with your [temper tantrums](http://webmshare.com/QPz6a). She wants you to call her. She always loved you.

So go, thank her for giving you life. Thank her for wiping your shitty ass when it was soiled. Thank her for putting up with your bullshit. Thank her for voting for President Trump. 

So that's your mom. Who was Donald John Trump's Mom? 

[Mary Anne MacLeod](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0e/Mary_Anne_Trump.jpg) (there can be only one) TRUMP was born, the youngest of 10, in Tong, Lewis, Scotland. In 1930, at age 17, she jumped on board a ship, with a dream of a destiny in America. She only had 50$ in her pocket, but hoped that will help her find a better life. And she found one. Rising from maid to the matriarch to a multi-billion dollar family, she gave birth to 5 children, including our PRESIDENT. Her legacy is ours: the American dream. Mary Anne became an American early, naturalized in 1942. She spent most her life as an American. This based mom went from that minuscule 50$ to leading one of the most successful families in America, if not the world.
#

Some other Mothers who are celebrating this day:

#Hit List

KellyAnne Conway - Mother extraordinaire. Whereas Hillary ripped off her donors, the Democratic party, and Haitian Children during her pathetic grasp at the White House, KellyAnne broke the glass ceiling: she being the first woman to lead a successful Presidential Campaign. She did it while raising 4 wonderful children, and being pro-life all the way. ""We are pro-life. The fetus beat us. We grew up with sonograms. We know life when we see it.""  Women like this are mothers -- and we owe them our lives.  **LITERALLY** owe them our lives.


Melania Trump : FLOTUS, the wife of a God-Emperor, Mother of a Barron, business magnate; and everything 3rd wave feminists hate about themselves.

Candy Carson - She is the mother of 3, and [wife of Secretary Ben Carson](http://www.trbimg.com/img-510c0002/turbine/bal-bs-bs-ae-proposalson20110211163306/600/600x338). This based Mom **triple-majored at Yale**, and went on to earn her **MBA from John's Hopkins University**.  Her husband and she have more than a last name in common: they've co-written four books, one of which became a (cucked) NYT best-seller, and then wrote her own memoir. They both **BIGLY** have gifted hands - she is a professional violinist and conductor, he a neurosurgeon. They co-founded a Carson's Scholar fund, delivering  thousands of $1K scholarships for  hard-working, principled kids.

#Shit List

Upon further consideration, I won't shit on these moms: the [uber-triggered mom from Portland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw7KV3J29u4 ), [the pedophile from France](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/06/brigitte-trogneux-macrons-wife-60-seconds/), and the entitled, but [""Coronation's Cancelled"", Bitch!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thNjxRMYOII)
 

#THE BEST Mom, according to me

Thank you Mom, you've always worked extremely hard. You've been my no. 1 advocate as I've grown, supported the man I've become, and always understood me (or at least my point of view). I know I've made mistakes - some large, most minor, and you will always be part of me. Your legacy isn't me, it's our lineage. We'd never exist without you. Your struggles are integral to our story. I'll meet you in a later life, and I'll forever honor your sacrifices. You made me. I love you.

We fed the homeless folks we'd gathered to help and went on an awe inspiring march over the Willamette river in Oregon' capitol city where hundreds of patriots honked their horns in support - all this within the cucked Peoples Republic of Oregon. I even met some nice Portland pedes. Remember to organize yourselves locally folks! Thx for reading and our group is the Nothwest Trump Alliance for Change. Find us on Facebook!!

merryjane,2017-04-20 13:34:03+00:00,"I’m Congressman Earl Blumenauer from Portland, OR, co-founder of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus. It’s 4/20. AMA!","Hi, I’m Congressman Earl Blumenauer from Portland, OR, co-founder of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus. 
 
From fighting to decriminalize marijuana in Oregon in 1973, to championing common-sense cannabis laws in Congress, I believe it’s past time to reform our outdated marijuana laws. 
 
After helping my home state of Oregon legalize marijuana in 2014, I spent a lot of time in 2016 campaigning for marijuana efforts across the country.
 
This past February, I launched the Congressional Cannabis Caucus to continue the conversation and action on marijuana legalization. Click [here](https://blumenauer.house.gov/issues/marijuana-and-drug-reform) to learn about more about my efforts towards marijuana reform. Many thanks to [MERRY JANE](https://www.reddit.com/user/merryjane) &amp; /r/trees for presenting this AMA today – now let’s talk cannabis reform!

Proof: https://twitter.com/repblumenauer/status/854821050135134208

From /u/repblumenauer: ""Wow we've covered a lot of ground and I really appreciate the thoughtful participation and questions. Sorry I was unable to answer every one. But I'm on my way to a dispensary here in Portland to check in and see how they are doing!""

***
[MERRY JANE](https://www.reddit.com/user/merryjane) thanks /r/trees for hosting this great 4/20 AMA, &amp; all of you for your excellent questions! Happy 4/20 to all! If you want to keep up with our efforts to protect canna-legal states &amp; end the federal prohibition on marijuana, sign our petition [here](https://www.change.org/p/merry-jane-protect-legal-cannabis-end-the-federal-prohibition-on-marijuana). #FreeWeed!

I completed several studies examining how feeling overqualified at work affects morale, well being, performance and retention. A recent paper I have forthcoming in Journal of Management examines how coworkers react to these workers. Companies often debate whether it makes sense to hire the overqualified job applicants, often struggle with the stigma attached to it, and employees deal with this demoralizing perception. I study over-qualification among new college graduates, as well as employees in various industries. Let's talk about it!

He is now 1 away from breaking the record.,"[CONGRATULATIONS TO WESTBEAST!](http://imgur.com/a/dLapF) He finished with 12 points, 13 rebounds, and 13 assists tonight in [27 minutes and 5 seconds.](http://imgur.com/a/i4BYC)

[Reactions](http://imgur.com/a/tQOg6), [Fun Fact 1](http://imgur.com/a/FAkLg), [Fun Fact 2](http://imgur.com/a/fCrkQ), [Fun Fact 3](http://imgur.com/a/67z5e) [MVP Comparison](http://imgur.com/a/acmJb), [Skip Bayless](http://imgur.com/a/7G92o)

Here's the Westbrook update: in OKC's last five games of the regular season, Westbrook will need to average roughly 5ppg/0rpg/4apg to average a 30-10-10 stat line.

He currently has 41 TDs ([7 consecutive TDs as of now](http://imgur.com/a/YwVjH)) and has [tied Oscar's triple double record](http://imgur.com/a/00b4f) and is one away from breaking it. 

Additionally, Westbrook has recorded a TD against 27 out of the 29 opposing teams (Portland and Chicago).

5 Game Totals for 30-10-10 stat line: 

- 2435/2460 points = 25 points=5ppg

- 820+ rebounds = ACCOMPLISHED=0rbg

- 804/820 assists = 16 assists=4apg

TL;DR: For a 30-10-10 stat line, Westbrook needs to average a 5ppg/0rpg/4apg stat line in his last 5 games.

jaynay1,2017-04-02 04:23:08+00:00,THE DALLAS MAVERICKS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED FROM PLAYOFF CONTENTION.,"The Mavericks are a little trickier, but with 44 losses, they can only hope to tie the Trail Blazers in some way and then win the tiebreaker, in which they must place first.  If the Trail Blazers lose out and the Mavericks win out, since the teams have tied the season series at 2-2, the tiebreaker is conference record, which the Trail Blazers have clinched with their 25th win to Dallas's 28 losses (52 total conference games means the best and worst they can finish are 25-27 and 24-28 for Portland and Dallas respectively), so Portland wins the 2 team tiebreak.

So then in order for Dallas to make it, we need a 3rd team that can tie both teams (Which eliminates everyone other than Denver and New Orleans), and Dallas has a winning record over them, and a better record than Portland, and that team doesn't have a better record against Dallas + Portland than Dallas has against them + Portland.  Since Dallas can't finish better than 2-2 against either of those teams, the very best case for them is that everyone ties at .500, and in that case, Dallas is still eliminated because they have a worse conference record than Portland, which is still the next tiebreaker.

Foreskin_Commando,2017-03-26 11:22:16+00:00,"Housemate forced me to pay her rent for a month, so I made her terrible life that much more awful","So there I was, newly arrived in the city of Portland. I was excited to start apartment-hunting and was crashing with a friend of mine in the meantime. After some searching, I came upon a house with a rent amount of $500. Neato, I'll call the number and get interviewed. The girl I chatted with sounded really nice, and we clicked on a lot of things. She said she hates drugs, has two dogs, is ultra clean, and just a whole host of other things I like in a person.

I checked out the apartment and it was spotless. The dogs were fucking adorable. She seemed cool and clear-cut. Man, was I in for a good time. 

The day I moved in, everything changed. I unpacked everything, plugged in my computer, and asked if she had any wi-fi. ""I don't know what that is."" I was a little shocked, but whatever, I explained it to her. She laughed saying how the internet is for nerds and she personally never uses it (I saw the ad for the apartment online).

Okay that was a little weird, but whatever, I'll get an internet connection. I wake up, and notice that there is dog shit on the floor of the living room. I tell her and she gets P I S S E D. Starts yelling like crazy at the dogs, and locks them up in their cages as punishment. They're constantly locked in her room for seriously like 20 hours at a time. Its fucking ridiculous. She tends to beat them on occasion too because she's gotta be a terrible human being in all regards I guess. There was shit on the floor every single fucking day.

Anyways, none of my business. I love dogs, but those ain't my dogs and I'm not telling someone how to raise them. The final straw was when this supposedly drug-free woman invited her friends over to do tons of cocaine. When I asked her about it, she said, ""No dude, cocaine is pretty much on the same level as alcohol and weed lol, don't be such a nerd!""

Rent is due so I ask her if she's paying with a check or something. She says she currently doesn't have any money but if I cover a couple months of rent, she'll pay me back. Every red flag on planet Earth was waving in my head. Hell-fuckin-no, I ain't about that life. Luckily, I hadn't signed anything when I moved in, because I guess she didn't understand how that stuff works.

So begins my plan of escape. I call the police and SPCA. I let the police know that she's having another druggy party on a particular day. I let the SPCA know of the absolute fucking FILTH the dogs go through (I also let the police know about that). I called up my friend and let him know I was crashing at his place again and I would give him 100 bucks if he helped me transport my shit. 

It was the perfect plan. She came into my room in the morning, wondering if I was planning on leaving. My heart was racing, but I was like, nah dude this place is awesome. She left for ""work"" (to this day, I still don't know what it was she did for a living) and this was the same exact day as the druggy party. I called my bud and he helped me transport my shit. I was out of there. I changed my phone number, deleted my email address, and became pretty much invisible to her. 

A few months later, I called a private investigator and paid her $100 to find out everything she knew about my awful housemate. I was pretty worried about those doggos. I learned the following:

-She was arrested and charged for intent to distribute drugs (apparently she had a huge amount of drugs that I didn't know about) alongside other drug-related charges

-She was charged with some kind of animal abuse

-She was no longer living at that address due to an eviction

-She's currently serving time in prison

Life is good.

Where I rank the NBA's 30 franchises based on their front office competence and on-court success the past several years (weighed slightly more towards the present), from best to worst.  Hope you enjoy!

By: /u/25_Star_General_

#Lord of the Rings Trilogy Tier


30) **San Antonio Spurs**

The gold standard.  547 consecutive 50-win seasons, dating back to their time in the Mesoamerican League where they dominated the Mayan hoop ball game. Timoteo Duncano led the league in their first year with 7000 points and 3 ritual sacrifices.  The addition of conquistador Gonzalo Ginobili in their 7th year really helped establish a dynasty.

29) **Golden State Warriors**

This silicon valley darling is light years ahead.  Their entire franchise is run by their proprietary SkyeNet^^TM supercomputer, removing human bias and fallibility, and drafts/trades are determined by an algorithm combining PER, TS%, BPM, ORPM, DRPM, RAPM, WAR, WS/48, 3pAR, VORP, and the Ashe Conformity experiment to determine level of malleability when the AI takes over.

28) **Boston Celtics**

The winningest franchise in NBA history.  Power couple Danny Ainge and Brad Stevens (henceforce known as BrAingelina) continue to run the model franchise after a 2008 title.  The Nets and Kings should be placed in a Battered Women's Shelter because they've been repeatedly abused by the Celtics in some of the worst trades I've ever seen.  

#Jurassic Park Tier

27) **Houston Rockets**

We all know MoreyBall.  It's where you try to win a trade with Houston, and you end up juggling Daryl Morey's balls in your mouth.  You wake up the next morning hungover, hoping you didn't have unprotected ~~sex~~ picks on the table last night.  Harden is a revelation at PG, D'Antoni's *Seven Seconds or Less* has been vindicated, and the Rockets' black magic has resurrected the corpses of Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon.

26) **Toronto Raptors**

This team is deep, and they convinced two All-Stars to stay -- something they never managed with Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady. Lowry and DeRozan are pluses, but Drake being their mascot is a minus.  I watched a 10-minute interview on TSN during a Raptor's game and Drake is the phoniest basketball fan I've ever seen.  They asked him to go through the entire roster and what they bring to the team.  He answered ""hustle and teamwork"" for all 15, like a kid in front of the class discussing his [book report](https://youtu.be/Mp_EArT4H_E) on a book he didn't read.  I think he went a little too hard with that lint roller and cut off the circulation to his brain.



25) **Oklahoma City Thunder**

That this team never won a Championship is completely insane.  Drafting Durant, Westbrook, Harden and Ibaka might be one of the greatest feats in NBA history.  The league shot them in the left foot grandfathering Durant's contract, causing gangrene. Then OKC said ""we'll take it from here"" and amputated their right foot by mistake and let Harden go to avoid the luxury tax.  That trade produced Steven Adams, and OKC was the best team in the NBA last season, where Klay Thompson recreated the [debate scene](https://youtu.be/_yYDzLUH1NE?t=1m5s) from Old School and singlehandedly ended a dynasty.  Sam Presti is a great GM, but it's hard to feel sympathy for cheap crooks who [stole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9Dp20ydm1E) the team from Seattle.

I'd ask Clay Bennett what defeat smacks of, but that would imply he could ever get the taste of David Stern's ass out of his mouth.

24) **Atlanta Hawks**

The Atlanta Hawks have been a great organization for years now, as the Mike Budenholzer era produced great ball movement and unselfish play that produced a 60-win season and an ECF berth.  The franchise was recently sold off due to racist comments, with the sale being handled by Goldman Sachs, while trading away Jeff Teague and putting their faith in Dennis Schröder to run the team.  There's nothing more reassuring than a German ascending to power while a bank hiding gold in Switzerland is brought in due to racially-motivated remarks.

#Forrest Gump Tier

23) **Cleveland Cavaliers**

That look when you're a dumpster fire franchise but the best player in the world happens to be born in your state.  Only 3 of the 7 best-run franchises have won a championship in the past 20 years, but hey, who needs organizational discipline, good scouting, a strong analytics team, trust, and a lack of dysfunction when you can luck into three #1 picks in four years and get LeBron back for free?  This is the most undeserving franchise, in the most deserving city.  David Griffin has done a very good job, but so have the GMs of at least a dozen other franchises.  

Never underestimate the power of bungling incompetence to produce high draft picks that reward stupidity.

#French Connection Tier
^Yes, ^there's ^a ^French ^Connection ^sequel.  ^No, ^you ^shouldn't ^watch ^it.



22) **Utah Jazz**

Man, the Utah Jazz are looking really good! Although I may be overly excited about them since I just saw *Book of Mormon* on Broadway. How about that Gordon Hayward, though?  Is this the year he hoists the Larry O'Brien Trophy? I haven't seen Utahans this excited following a white guy's quest for shiny metal since Joseph Smith found the [golden plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates).  Rudy Gobert is an absolute beast.  Quin Snyder is a great coach.  Their front office has loaded the team with talent.  ESPN is [gushing](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18273165/zach-lowe-utah-jazz-gordon-hayward-rudy-gobert-nba) about them.  

Not only are they a small market team, but most of us have a place in our heart for the Jazz as our default team in *NBA JAM*.  I could probably only name 8 NBA players in the mid-90s, and one of them was Jeff Hornacek.  When your jerk friends shoved Stockton and his INJURY stat became too high, you had to swap in [The Horny GOAT](http://spreegoogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/picture-31-e1300167872288.png) for a quarter.

21) **LA Clippers**

2017 is the year I stopped believing in the Clippers.  Every year I talk myself into it, and every year they disappoint.  Chris Paul is a point god.  Nothing you say will ever convince me Blake Griffindor wasn't the best player in the NBA through the first month of the 2015 playoffs.  He destroyed the Spurs.  He made Houston look foolish.  Then he just completely ran out of gas. He would disappear in the second half of games. Now he's punching people. And his quad has the structural integrity of the Death Star.  No matter how many times you rebuild it, it keeps blowing up.  Their bench has been a constant disappointment.  Doc Rivers has not gotten it done on the GM end, and the team has had full of drama with the infamous *DeAndre Does Dallas*.  They're still a great team with three All-Stars, but it's either Finals or bust for them this season.


#Blade Runner Tier

20) **Milwaukee Bucks**

Giannis Alphabetsoupo is a legitmate superstar. Jabari Parker and Khris Middleton are great pieces, and Malcolm Brogden, Tony Snell, Greg Monroe, Thon Maker, and Delly make this team interesting as hell.  Parker tore his ACL, and they were already (Khris) middling this year, but nevertheless they're still young, and I'm optimistic.  If Jason '*The BillieKingslayer*' Kidd can avoid the temptation to make another coup, I'm confident in his ability to lead this team to greatness.


19) **Portland TrailBlazers**

If the TrailBladerunners manage to snag the eighth and final spot in the West, the Spurs better watch out, given Kawhi is likely a replicant.  If there's one thing ~~Deckard~~ Lillard is good at, it's retiring powerful foes (Just ask Houston.)

Neil Oshley went from being the NBA front office equivalent of Ari Gold on *Entourage* to Charlie Runkle on *Californication* in the span of one year, because spending $150,000,000 on Evan Turner and Allen Crabbe is a lot like getting caught masturbating in your office.  You're still one of the most talented execs in the business, but now people are definitely kinda sorta looking at you funny when you walk by them in the hall.

The most popular safe word in Oregon is ""DON'T SIGN EVAN TURNER"" because there's only so much pain BDSM enthusiasts can take.

#Rocky VII: Adrian's Revenge Tier

^No ^longer ^contenders, ^yet ^still ^refuse ^to ^quit.

18) **Dallas Mavericks**

I love Dallas.  Everything they do is just so ballsy and entertaining.  They tore down their 2011 title team believing they could do better (they couldn't).  They gave up a ton of assets making a swing for the fences with Rondo (they whiffed).  They almost orchestrated the signing of DeAndre Jordan (they didn't.)  Oh, Brave, Brave Sir Cuban.  Who nearly fought the Dragon of Angnor...  Who almost stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol... And who had personally wet himself at the [Battle of Badon Hill](https://youtu.be/d-6kuVhKzmk?t=12s).

Despite all this, they still managed two Finals appearances, culminating in a Championship.  Their head coach, Rick Carlisle, is a dark wizard.  Their owner is genuine and kind.  And unlike the Miami Heat, they paid Dirk.  It's a classy franchise with a winning culture, and even when it would be easier to tank, they're still grinding it out for a playoff spot, throwing Harrison freakin' Barnes  the max, and giving us the Curry/Bogut/Barnes lineup we craved.  

17) **Miami Heat**

They finally did it.  The maniacs.  They really did it.  They blew it up.  They disrespected the shit out of Dwayne Wade over and over and he finally left, proving definitely *La Familia* was always complete bullshit.  They amnestied Mike Miller.  LeBron left. Bosh's career is over.  The stories of ""you're making the biggest mistake of your life"" with Bron and the falling out with Shaq are now public record.

Despite all that, the Heat are still one of the best franchises in the NBA.  Four straight finals, 3 rings, one of the best coaches in the league, and Pat Riley is still a mastermind.  He orchestrated getting LeBron and Bosh, nabbed Ray Allen, traded for Dragic, turned Whiteside into a max guy, swindled Justice Winslow in the draft, and found diamond in the rough Tyler Johnson.

As their 13 game win streak proves, never underestimate a winning culture to get the most out of players.  As for getting the most out of their fans? Well... if ever there's a fire at American Airlines Arena while they're down 10, there's no need to worry, because they've all already left.  Safety first!

#Alien Quadrilogy Tier

^Might ^scare ^a ^favorite ^in ^the ^first ^round ^or ^two, ^but ^will ^decline ^as ^they ^progress.

16) **Memphis Grizzlies**

The Memphis Grizzlies are a solid organization.  Marc Gasol is an excellent basketball player -- and quite loyal!  Ditto Mike Conley.  Zach Randolph has been a key piece for years.  Vince Carter keeps defying father time.  The Grit and Grind Grizzlies have been a post-season fixture for awhile now, giving the 2015 champs a run for their money.

They've done well for a small market team, and I don't really have anything bad to say about them.  They gambled on Chandler Parsons and lost, which sucks, but a franchise in Tennessee has to take chances since they won't lure big ticket Free Agents.

I should say at least one bad thing about them.  I guess that Memphis Grizzlies fan was a giant [douchebag](http://www.totalprosports.com/2017/03/13/grizzlies-fan-trolls-chandler-parsons-right-to-his-face-say-i-ruined-the-grizz-season-baby-video/) to Parsons.  That guy looks like he lives in a frat house, takes intramural sports too seriously, and causes girls keep their hands over their drink cups at parties.

15) **Washington Wizards**

The Washington Wizards are on an absolute tear right now.  They're #3 in the East. Their starting five of John Wall, Otto Porter Jr., Bradley Beal, Markieff Morris, and Marcin Gortat is fantastic.  Things are finally looking up!

Except their bench may have, some certain, minor, you know, peripheral flaws, that in the wrong light, may, you know, sort of, ^kind ^of, ^be ^^interpreted ^^as, ^^^uh, [^^^^slightly ^^^^flammable.](http://i.imgur.com/2fdXFcW.png)  But I want to stay positive, so I'd say their secondary unit has a certain bucolic, roasting-marshmellows-by-the-fire quality, which I would in no way describe as a flaming dumpster of a bench.

The Wizards also have the distinction of leading the NBA in arrests since 2000 (honorable mention to the Jailblazers, who ranked second).  By that metric, the franchise has featured about as many guards as it has criminals. Who needs the Princeton Offense when you have the Stanford Prison Experiment!

14) **Indiana Pacers**

Paul George is having a down year, and probably heading to Lakerland after next season.  Meanwhile, Monta Ellis has fallen off a cliff, and is locked in for 3 seasons. Ditto Al Jefferson, who is a minus -- both at 10 million a pop.

They still have Myles Turner on a rookie scale contract, and he seems quite good, but I'm not sure what Indiana's plan is.  They treated Roy Hibbert badly.  Bird also fired head coach Frank Vogel despite his successful tenure there.  Not a good look for the franchise.

Hell, David West set **fire** to 11 million dollars to get away from the Pacers.  Then he got eliminated by the **Thunder**, only to join a team on the **water** in the Bay Area.  He's either chasing a ring or filling out a Pokédex. 

13) **Charlotte Hornets**

Charlotte created a lot of buzz last season, with an epic playoff battle against the Heat, featuring a classic battle between Dwayne Wade and his Pokémon [Rival](http://i.imgur.com/6nQmjCe.png).

While they've regressed this season, they still have a great coach, their front office has been noticeably better the past few years, and Kemba Walker is a monster on wheels.

It seems they'll have to wait until next season to have another go at it, as FiveThirtyEight only gives them a [2% chance](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2017-nba-predictions/?ex_cid=rrpromo) of making the playoffs.

#Jason Bourne Tier

^The ^franchise ^reboot ^tier!

12) **Minnesota Timberwolves**

CAT (Caterpillar Inc.) stock may be down due to a federal raid, but KAT (Karl-Anthony Towns) stock is up. Way up.  Sell your condo on Waiters Island and buy some KAT equipment while you can, this kid is going to be a freakin' superstar.  The T-Wolves are finally turning it around.

Rubio is on fire as a distributor (how stupid would that Derrick Rose trade have been?), and Wiggins is a legit scorer.  It appears Thibodeau may indeed be the right man for the job.  They're all on cheapo contracts and locked up for next season, too.

The only danger is Thibs running the team into the ground like he did in Chicago.  When it comes to his own players' knees, it's like he's on an Inigo Montoya [revenge spree](http://i.imgur.com/g7PElFn.png).

11) **Detroit Pistons**

Detroit is fighting for the 8th and final playoff spot in the East.  My general policy is the more Van Gundy's in the NBA, the better.  The Pistons have some nice pieces, but can't seem to get over the hump.  They played great against the Cavs in the playoffs last year, so I'm surprised they haven't improved.

I'd say just tank and wait it out until LeBron James retires in 2024, but that's the same year LeBron Jr. is coming into the league. Piston's LeBron-induced PTSD should see us well into 2045, when Detroit fans will finally emerge from their underground caverns petting their 2004 replica rings whispering *my precious*.

The Eye of LeBron is ever watchful.



10) **Philadelphia 76ers**

Trust the Process. I'm a huge Sam Hinkie fan.  The man gave 76ers fans hope, and a future.  Embiid is a superstar if he can stay healthy.  Saric is going to win ROTY.  Ben Simmons is a #1 pick.  They're flush with assets, cap space, and could even land the #1 and #4 picks [this](http://i.imgur.com/DzYHO4d.png) draft.  

What could possibly go wrong?

BRYAN: ""Once we trade away Okafor and keep Noel -- or was it keep Okafor and trade Noel? Gosh, it's so hard to remember who's who!  One is a centerpiece in the mold of Tyson Chandler, and the other is a defensive sieve who gives zero effort and can't play in a modern offense?  I just can't seem to remember, dad!""

JERRY: ""I'm busy pushing the guy who acquired all these assets in astute trades and long-term planning, you handle it, son!""

9) **Denver Nuggets**

They have the Joker, a 21 year old phenom and franchise centerpiece.  'Nuff said.

8) **LA Lakers**

The Lakers lack what Minnesota, Denver, New York, and New Orleans have -- an All-Star caliber player to build around.  [Tank Commander Byron Scott](http://i.imgur.com/0Z37ale.jpg) is gone, but his mission lives on.  Los Angeles has a 55.8% chance of keeping their pick if it falls in the 1-3 range, and they've shut down all their veterans except for Nick Young (to avoid looking too shameless).  Instead, they'll just play Iggy Azalea music every time he goes to shoot.

Don't want Swaggy P accidentally making one!

7) **Orlando Magic**

They say every time the Orlando Magic draft a Center, a 30 for 30 *'What If'* documentary gets its wings.

Orlando seems like it's in a pretty bad place.  Their Ibaka trade was a bust, they have the third worst record in the NBA, and they are the only team in the NBA without a single player over 1.0 RPM. How is that even possible?  How do you not have a single player worth 1 extra point per 100 possessions over the average NBA player?

It's hard to have any confidence in a team paying Jeff Green and Bismack Biyombo a combined $32,000,000 a year.

Hopefully they can get a great pick in this deep draft and turn things around.  The Magic's 2017 Team Photo doesn't exactly [inspire](http://i.imgur.com/eipugIu.jpg?fb) confidence.

6) **New Orleans Pelicans**

New Orleans is the world capital of Voodoo, yet for some reason it was the Houston Rockets that reanimated the corpses of Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon.  Ouch.

You know what Anthony Davis could really use?  Some three-point shooters spacing the floor to open up the offense.  Pelicans fans will defend letting them go due to the fact they were oft injured, but nevertheless, those guys sure look good in the Lone Star State right now.

Instead, they made a splash and traded for Demarcus Cousins for cheap, a move which I like and they very much had to make.  It has worked out horribly thus far, but we'll see if they can figure it out next season.  There's definitely some inherent risk, given their 1st round pick could be quite valuable this year and Boogie might walk in 2018.

To keep him, they'll need to re-sign Jrue Holiday, the only other good player on the team, but given that they're already at $89,000,000 without him for the 2017-2018 season, will they have any money left over to sign FAs?

That contract they gave Omer Asik was fucking terrible, and will hurt their ability to put a team around their two All-Star bigs.

5) **Phoenix Suns**

The Suns' three best players are Devin Booker (age 20), Eric Bledsoe (age 27), and Tyson Chandler (age 34).  That's some perfectly normal spacing between births -- if you're a Vulcan mother going through [Pon farr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pon_farr) every 7 years.  It's fucking terrible if you're an NBA franchise.

For comparison, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green are all between the ages of 26 and 28.

I don't know what the hell the Phoenix Suns are doing, but signing Brandon Knight to a 5-year, 70 million dollar contract through 2020 doesn't seem like the answer.  They have some serious issues to address, both in terms of shot creation and nacho bowl creation, at least according to [Charles Barkley](https://youtu.be/uTOzKTxckd0).

4) **Chicago Bulls**

The Fire GarPax [movement](http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/chicagoinc/ct-garpax-protest-chicago-inc-spt-0303-20170302-story.html) is in full swing in the windy city.  The pair reportedly [lowballed](http://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/244760/Bulls-Threatened-To-Cut-Jimmy-Butlers-Minutes-If-He-Didnt-Sign-Extension-In-2014) budding superstar Jimmy Butler and told him ""if you don't sign this extension, we're going to play Tony Snell over you. We are going to give you his minutes and that's going to drop your numbers"" in order to depress his market value as an RFA, in true piece of shit fashion.

Butler also warned new players about Randy Brown being a front office rat reporting on players, something Rip Hamilton [confirmed](http://www.thescore.com/nba/news/1223297-rip-hamilton-coaches-warned-me-about-bulls-front-office-snitch) in February.  They also unceremoniously pushed former coach Tom Thibodeau out the door.

The franchise is a complete disaster at the moment, the team is dysfunctional, and the players have zero trust in the Bulls' Tony Soprano-wannabe front office.

But hey, they've shaken up things a bit, and GarPax has hired a [new assistant coach](http://i.imgur.com/Lay7rBq.jpg) to regain the player's confidence, so things are looking up!




3) **Brooklyn Nets**

The Nets don't have their own first round pick until 2019.

Billy King traded away 7 first round picks in 3 years in exchange for 1 second-round playoff berth.

Everything about this franchise makes me sad.  I feel like Horatio on the castle platform at the beginning of *Hamlet*, watching the dispirited corpse of Nets fans, their flair faded, crying out for justice against the King who slew them and forfeited their picks.

It's fitting the Brooklyn Nets official color is black.  Even Hamlet's mother loved Brook Lopez so much she wished him to another team, saying ""Good [HamLopez], cast thy nighted colour off.""  To which the ever-loyal Brook replied:

HAMLOPEZ

*'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,*


*Nor customary suits of solemn black,*

[...]


*But I have that within which passeth show;*


*These but the trappings and the suits of woe.*


2) **Sacramento Kings**

The only thing that keeps this franchise out of the #1 spot is that Vivek Ranadivé helped keep the team in Sacramento, and that there doesn't seem to be the same level of evil fucking assholes and front office snitches that permeate the Bulls and the Knicks.

It seems to just be sheer levels of staggering incompetence.  The Kings are like *The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo*... if the movie ended after he unchains her from the bed 30 minutes in.  No wonder Adam Silver intervened and sent Sam Hinkie packing.  What he did to Sacramento via trade was pretty unforgivable.

On top from the revolving door of coaches and political infighting, they let Isaiah Thomas and Seth Curry go for nothing, sent Boogie packing for peanuts, whiffed on almost every draft pick, got repeatedly trade-raped, and according to Zach Lowe, were reportedly **unaware of the stretch provision**.

How is that even fucking possible?  I've never been within 500 feet of an NBA front office (or Angelina Jolie, for that matter, thanks to a very unfair restraining order), and even I know about the stretch provision.  And that judge completely misunderstood the fan fiction I sent her.  I was biting Angelina's neck to Sire her, not injure her, so we could be together forever as Vampires.  It was completely innocent.

What were we talking about again?

#Braindead Tier

1) **New York Knicks**

Fitting that we begin and end with Peter Jackson-directed films, as intelligence and success, like [George and Elaine](https://youtu.be/1AjxoQA7EcE?t=30s), shift between the two P. Jacksons the longer Phil remains championship abstinent with the Knicks.  Constantly harping about how the triangle would help NYK win without the right personnel doesn't make sense.  The only triangular-shaped object that would make the Knicks champs is a flux capacitor inside a DeLorean traveling back to 1973.

The centerpiece of this shitcicle, of course, is Knicks owner and Sackville-Baggins hobbit James Dolan.  Petty and vindictive, he is constantly banning people from MSG, because that's what insecure trust fund babies do.  From Woody Allen to Charles Oakley, no one is safe from this poster child for nepotism.  Deeply mistrustful, he has spies everywhere in the organization, and has played a key role in the ~~Scouring of the Shire~~ Knicks' playoff drought.

Their treatment of former players is embarrassing, their conduct shameful, and their basketball decisions (outside of drafting Porzingod) have been just as bad.  This is the worst franchise in the NBA, something I didn't think possible with Sacramento existing, but here we are.  Their PR machine tweeting ""hope he gets some help soon"" put them over the top for me.

It takes some seriously braindead and malicious front office behavior to top the Kings and the Nets, so congrats to the New York Knicks.  You truly are a dumpster fire of a franchise.

#EDIT:

&gt;What he's trying to say is that the disclaimer that it's only ""slightly more towards the present"" is inaccurate and that it's heavily more weighted towards the present.

Err, yes, I misspoke. I meant weighted more towards the present while looking **only** at the last few years.  I should have clarified.

Otherwise the Heat would be in the Top 5 looking ten years back, the Lakers would be Top 3 going back forever (at the very least), and Golden State would be in the Bottom 3.

&gt;There are people in this thread getting angry for the inaccuracy of their team's description/ranking made by a dude who described Spurs as a franchise with 547 consecutive 50-win seasons, dating back to their time in the Mesoamerican League where they dominated the Mayan hoop ball game. Stop what you are doing for a moment and just think about this.

Yes, I should have expanded my opening paragraph to better explain this isn't meant to be accurate, and was purely for entertainment purposes.

I don't know your personal team's entire transaction history better than you, and I apologize if I upset you.  There are a lot of Heat fans who are pretty incensed about my Miami section and think I hate them (I don't.)   ",nba,1250

bigbird41,2017-03-15 18:16:12+00:00,Joel Embiid needs to learn how to fall,"“I don’t know if I’ve ever seen something so violent”

These were the words of 29-year old Gerald Henderson, reflecting on a Joel Embiid dunk during the first few days of training camp. A new addition to the roster over the summer, Henderson had very limited - if any - experience watching Embiid play. Asked to elaborate on Embiid’s dunk, Henderson says:

“It scared me. I was on his team - it was a post-up. I won’t mention who was guarding him because it’s one of my teammates, but it was violent. It shook me up, man. I had never seen something so powerful.” [link](http://www.slamonline.com/the-magazine/features/joel-embiid-interview-cover-story-sixers/#7XDwcuxqKiP3VJga.97)

Henderson won’t spill the beans ([it probably looked something like this](https://streamable.com/rale5), and you know it was Jah), but he does a nice job capturing the essence of the Embiid experience. Lauded for rare skill and agility at his size, the most impressive aspect of his game is the brute strength and decisive violence with which he brandishes that size. We’ve seen him [forcefully defend the rim](https://streamable.com/c511f) on defense, and then turn around to [forcefully abuse its counterpart](https://streamable.com/b84w6) on offense. He’s particularly physical [when jostling with opposing centers](https://streamable.com/kzt52), and his size presents a problem for anyone [trying to stop him from going where he wants to go](https://streamable.com/f8l56).

I’m here to talk about what I consider his most glaring issue: the force and power in Embiid’s game tends to place a lot of stress on his body - and to deal with it, he needs to learn how to fall.

Look at [the play against the Trailblazers](https://streamable.com/b1hw6) where Embiid hurt himself (*trigger warning for 76ers fans*). It’s a perfect microcosm of the Embiid Paradox: is it sustainable for a 7’2’’ 275lb human to make these kind of moves on a basketball court? In an ironic twist of fate, will Embiid’s outlier physical gifts preclude him from achieving his outlier potential? 

I’ve noticed that many of Embiid’s scarier moments this season came at the conclusion of perimeter dribble drives to the basket - one of his favorite moves - when his breathtaking physical cocktail of size and velocity is on full display. Take the play against Portland for example, as well as [this play from later in the same game](https://streamable.com/tld9j) (a game which he was somehow allowed to re-enter...I’m still baffled). It’s not surprising that his body finds itself in precarious positions when tasked with [landing the plane](https://gfycat.com/EuphoricDelayedGermanshorthairedpointer) - this is often the case with NBA athletes. 

But I can’t help but think that what makes Embiid’s situation more volatile are the extra inches and pounds he’s moving up and down the court. Most players who [move like this](https://streamable.com/hkxb3) are not a legitimate 7’2’’ with a frame reminiscent of a young Shaquille O’Neal. That’s why these moments grab the viewer by the jugular and demand that they pay close attention to what they’re watching - because watching the evident talent exist alongside the evident risk is captivating stuff.

Just so we’re clear: I have no medical expertise whatsoever, and if someone out there does, I’d be interested in hearing your input. But during his abbreviated rookie year he often landed with a lot of force [coming down on one foot](https://streamable.com/dalhs), and it seems like Embiid could benefit from continuing his fall all the way through until he’s fully prone. Instead of trying to stay upright [using the first foot to hit the floor](https://streamable.com/h6ml7), would going all the way to the ground help? Steph Curry and Dwyane Wade are examples of great players who minimized the risk involved with essential elements of their game by learning the safest way to fall. Instead of placing the burden on his feet/knees/back [when landing](https://gfycat.com/EarnestRegalArcticwolf), maybe a good ol’ tuck and roll would help Embiid.

One cause for hope is Embiid’s inexperience. There were plenty of moments when Embiid looked like a [newborn fawn](https://streamable.com/pedhe) taking its first pair of ice skates for a spin. When you consider the [physical transformation](http://dsz7vodgjx60a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/BIL-JOEL-EMBBIED.jpg) he’s gone through - and his 2-year absence from the sport altogether - [moments like these](https://gfycat.com/ImpishClearCanvasback) are excusable as well as expected (and even endearing). But as much fun as it is to watch an inexperienced Embiid [unearth his own capabilities](https://streamable.com/t9dbt) like an amnesic Jason Bourne, the [other side of the coin](https://streamable.com/lu762) leaves countless Philadelphia-area buttholes very clenched - but it also reminds us that Embiid has played a grand total of 31 professional games. As he settles into his own body and the game itself, there is hope that the injury scares will be fewer and farther between.

Do I have any idea what I’m talking about when it comes to anatomy, physics, and how they relate to injury probabilities? No. But I’m sure some of you remember reading about [how Russell Westbrook changed the way he runs](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/5sl42d/forefoot_striking_a_look_at_how_russell_westbrook/), and how his body is better off for it. This got me thinking: what can Embiid do to protect his body as he redefines the way a man his size moves on the court? He obtained his massive stature relatively recently, so he needs time to learn the controls. But in the interest of a long and dominant career for The Process, developing a way to control his falls might be helpful.",nba,1561

Eyesores1,2017-03-13 04:06:21+00:00,I Hate the Rogue Brewery!!,"Hi Redditors, I know there's a ton of hate for Rogue and I've read a bunch of your posts and comments and I've lurked but never posted anything before. 

I worked for Rogue a few years ago, briefly, it was so horrible. I worked in their gross, filthy warehouse in southeast Portland where they had a sales and marketing team, sent out their overpriced crappy merchandise, and tried to ferment grain and open a bottle shop. Jack Joyce was still alive and he used to sit in this dark little room at the back of the warehouse and verbally abuse employees and drink coffee and chain smoke. Anyway, I worked there as an ""assassin"" (I still don't know what that means) for $12 an hour, I did data entry and shuffled paperwork and sent out mass emails to people about the latest disgusting stunt beer they were trying to market to mid westerners. I got fired two weeks before Christmas. Because I wasn't ""Rogue enough,"" which means I got fired for no reason at all. They do this all the time to their flocks of employees but they allow us to collect unemployment which seems to save them from legal action, although eventually it might catch up to them (I'd love to hear about that).

Anyway, so there I was in the middle of December unemployed and broke and pretty upset about it. Part of ""being Rogue"" apparently meant that the company wouldn't pay for software, because paying for software licenses is too corporate and we were ""rogues."" They bragged about this to all their employees that they then fired! They didn't pay for any of their Microsoft Office Suites that all their employees used, it was all pirated. They also only paid for a couple of SalesForce logins that they then shared with the entire company, all of this is fraud and it is not legal. So, being that I had nothing to do, I contacted BSA The Software Alliance, Microsoft, and SalesForce, and told them everything I knew. And then I kind of forgot about it, because I had to move on with my life and get another job. 

About six months later I got a thank you letter and a check from The Software Alliance for $1,672, which I do believe would have been 10% of the fine levied on Rogue. A $1600 surprise windfall for doing my civic duty!! I used that money to take my wonderful boyfriend to the Atlantis Resort in the fucking Bahamas, and we drank and laughed and frolicked in the ocean, and had a grand ol' time courtesy of Brett Joyce, king of the fat assholes. Suck it Brett Joyce!!!

MissLauraChase,2017-03-11 08:35:59+00:00,The town I grew up in was torn apart by a serial killer [part 2],"[part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5ykc9g/the_town_i_grew_up_in_was_torn_apart_by_a_serial/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage)


Before Carol Grott, there weren’t any murders in Middlefield’s history. Sure, sometimes cowhands got into fights when they’d had one too many beers at The Bar, and that ended with Sheriff Williams carting them off to the one cell jailhouse so they could *work some stuff out*. But there was never really any serious crime. Cow tipping, underage drinking, and sex were part of growing up.

Of course, just because there aren’t murders don’t mean there aren’t deaths. The old church down the road from the Jenks’ place joked that they hosted as many wakes as they did sermons, since Sunday morning was a day to sleep in after a hard week’s work. Mr. Tom White doubled as a pastor and the county veterinarian, specializing in equine births or something of the like, so he was often tired, too, and more than happy to hold off a sermon in return for another few hours of sleep. 

Life didn’t take a break in Middlefield, is what I’m saying. Babies were occasionally born, old folks died. There were tragedies on occasion, as well. Ten years before I was born a boy belonging to the Millers had drowned when he went up to Lake Owyhee on his own. His body had never been found. When I was five, a young boy hung himself in his parent’s barn for reasons my dad would never speak of. There were rumors, of course, but nothing ever came of them. Similarly, just two years before Carol Grott disappeared one of my friends had died going into labor. She was twenty and married, so no scandal there: but it was sad to say the least. 

The thing about the Surgeon is he never really gave us time to have peace. He wasn’t, of course, officially a serial killer until Jeremy and Charlotte’s bodies turned up, but that wasn’t until June. In the meantime, I’d turned 18. The search never really wound down. We were always on the edges of our seats, just waiting for the two to turn up. The detectives, two white 30-somethings who had driven down all the way from Portland, seemed at a loss. The extra police from Eugene would get in their cars to drive home only to come back again, claiming they couldn’t bear it if another kid was taken and they had just given up.

But we were all losing hope toward the end of May. School was back in session, and finished. Freddy had a summer vacation and I had the rest of my life. Of course I hadn’t applied to college, my family didn’t have the money and what good would it do me to have a college education if I was just going to work on a farm my whole life? Once upon a time Jeremy and I had talked about getting married and moving to Bend or Eugene or Salem, starting up our own family or a little farm or maybe even a bookstore or a restaurant. We didn’t have any set-in-stone goals, we only wanted something exciting and new.

June 5, 1988 was the day of my graduation ceremony from high school. I got to put on the cap and gown with my small class of seniors, and we were to sit on fold-out chairs on the football field in the blazing sun while Mayor Radcliffe gave some speech about education, and then we’d all go home and have barbecue or else play a friendly game of soccer or football, and the next day some of us were planning to truck up to Lake Owyhee and go swimming.

But those things never happened, I’m sure you could guess, because June 5 was the day that Jeremy came back into my life. 

I was the one who found Jeremy. I think it must have been planned that way. I think during his imprisonment with the Surgeon, Jeremy must have told all about Middlefield. Maybe even all about me. I found Jeremy from my bedroom window, looking out at the road and watching the dawn on the day that I was supposed to get my diploma. I knew what it was before I even really *knew* what it was. That doesn’t make sense, I know. But I ran down the stairs and out into the front yard without thinking about it, and there he was.

His hair had been trimmed, and he didn’t have a beard. His eyes, brown and empty and staring up at the lightening sky, obscured only by the large purple petals of the orchid that had been planted on his face. His mouth was opened wide, and the long tentacle roots had been somehow planted through his nose and were emerging again through his mouth, snaking their way down his chin. It looked like he was vomiting roots, his mouth hinged open with those green snakelike veins coming out. Stem and leaves and even a bit of root were coming from his nose, reaching to the sky.

I was sick, of course. I can’t remember much but that image. Someone must have found me, because I heard screaming. I leaned down and tried to put him in my arms. He was dressed in white: a white shirt that had been starched so stiff it felt like cardboard under my hands, and white slacks, and white shoes. All white, as I held him the screaming got louder, like there were more people joining, and I heard my dad calling my name and then he was yelling too. There were lights. Blue and red, flashing. Screaming, screaming, screaming. It hurt my ears, it hurt my head. And it was only when Sheriff Williams squatted down beside me and put his hand on my shoulder that I realized the screaming was coming from me.

That’s all I remember. What I’ve heard since is that my dad carried me up the stairs and put me in my bed and the doctor came around and gave me a sedative, and I slept for almost a week straight on drugs dreaming of nothing and remembering nothing and coming around only to learn from Freddy that Charlotte’s body had turned up too, and that Tom White Jr. And Olivia Frank and Sandy Green had been taken, and there had been a foot on the Frank’s porch and also on the White’s porch but not the Green’s, and that the detectives figured the Surgeon was trying to figure out how much damage he could do and how many he could take all at once. 

I stopped going out. I just wanted to stay in bed. The doctor came, and Freddy came and sat by my bed, and even a specialist from Eugene came to talk to me about trauma and grief. There were different pills to take, and most of them make those next few weeks before the latest three turned up fuzzy. 

That’s how I learned the details then, in a state of half consciousness. So I hope you’ll forgive me if I don’t get them all right. The ME had found that Jeremy’s death was as inexplicable as Carol’s. Charlotte’s death, though, had been by strangulation. There was nothing forensically left on the body that would have been useful. Apparently there had been some hope when seminal fluid had been found on Charlotte. But then the DNA matched for Jeremy. Both of them had bruises and scars and lacerations beneath their white clothing. Jeremy, post mortem, had been castrated. Charlotte had been found with an orchid just as Jeremy had.

I didn’t want to hear any more. I wanted to block out the world. Freddy was my only source of sanity in that time. He used to get in bed with me and hold me while I cried for hours. He hauled up the old TV and VCR and took Dad’s car and drove all the way to Boise and back (4 hours round trip) to get brand new movies and cold cheeseburgers that we could heat up and eat. It was comforting, even though the buns were chewy and the fries were soggy. It was comforting to the extent that anything can be comforting when you see how your boyfriend has been murdered and turned into a pot for a plant.

It was the middle of July when the three latest bodies turned up. I was still in bed, though I’d been taking small walks in the afternoon. Freddy had even convinced me to get on a horse one day, and I’d gripped the reins until my knuckles went white while Freddy spoke soothingly to the mare so she wouldn’t buck. Then after about ten minutes I got off and Freddy took my hand and we walked back home, and I got back into bed. The morning after I’d gotten back on the horse (heh), the bodies turned up.

I’ll spare you the details, except to tell you it was more of the same. Orchids, rape and torture. One body with no identifiable cause of death, while the other two had been strangled. The ME guessed they’d all been killed at the same time, all kept for a day or two before their bodies were planted back at home. 

None of the funerals had taken place. All of the bodies were being kept in cold refrigeration units until the investigators decided there was nothing else of use. Of course, it wasn’t those two detectives from Portland anymore. They’d been replaced by feds in black SUVs. 

People were leaving by then. In some cases, leaving was making them go broke. Several families I knew had just picked up and left in the middle of the night, spooked, saying they were going to stay with family in Eugene or Bend or Boise. Others sold off all their farm animals and tried to move ship and sell their land. No one wanted to buy, not in a town where children kept going missing. So they ended up losing most of what they had but got to keep their children. In the two weeks between the end of July and when the Surgeon took his next victims in August, the town became a shell of itself. 

I woke up from a nightmare on August 10, 1988. In it, I’d been making love to Jeremy when suddenly roots sprouted from his mouth and ears and nose, and he started gurgling and choking and then fell dead on top of me. Even though I was screaming, the roots took hold of me, winding their way into my ears and nose and mouth, forcing their way down my throat. I woke up gasping.

I hate to say it. I do. I hate what I’m about to tell you, because I think it makes me a terrible person. But part of me wishes I hadn’t woken up that night. Part of me wishes I’d taken some drugs to go back to sleep. Then I never would have had to go through it.

But I did. I didn’t sleep through it. I did wake up, and hear the rustling outside the window again, just like the night before Jeremy went missing. I did reach into my nightstand with my heart pounding and grasp my flashlight. I did go to the window. I did see a figure.

Two figures. A black vehicle of some sort. There was a figure, tall and large and shadowy, dragging another across the grass of my front yard. 

It was Freddy. I knew it was Freddy. And without even thinking — without even doing anything remotely smart like you’d think I’d have done — I ran down the stairs without my shoes and out onto the front porch. I ran into something strange and soft and cold, and across the grass toward the figure. And I started yelling at that point, telling Him to get away from my brother. The lights went on in my house, I think, because the shadows got worse. 

I was on him, then. He hit me hard across the face, then in the stomach. He picked me up like a rag doll and threw me in the back of a box truck. The metal sheet was rolled down, and the world was black. I felt around with my hands, desperately reaching around for something to use to get out, but the only thing my fingers found were two sets of legs.  I could hear yelling outside. There was banging on the back of the door, and I was screaming for my mom, my dad, for help. Then we were moving. It was pitch black in the back, and all I could do was feel around on my hands and knees. There were two other bodies back there, and one at a time I felt until I could identify their chests and pressed my ear to them, listening for a heartbeat. I kicked against the side of the vehicle where the driver would be. I slammed my fists on the metal.

My heart was pounding. I told myself it was another dream, as we drove further and further away. I screamed until my throat went numb, even though I knew it wouldn’t do any good. I banged on the metal. I tried to open the back hitch. 

Finally the car slowed. I started to cry. I knew I was going to die. I knew Freddy was going to die. Whoever else was in that trunk with us was going to die. And we were all going to die after something truly horrible was done to us. Then we would be dressed in white and orchids would be planted in our skulls, and we would be deposited back at home.

We were going to die.

The hitch slid open. I lunged, scraping and kicking and screaming for all it was worth. I got a hand to the throat, a quick dart that sent me breathless and gasping for air.

There was a hissing sound, and the sound of metal tumbling in the back of the van. I’d lost my voice and my air. I was going to die. I was going to die. I was going to die. 

It hurt. The gas. I looked for new air, but couldn’t. The air I gulped down was anything but pure and clean. It burned the inside of my throat, my nose, my eyes. I tried to scream, but couldn’t. I choked, sucked in more air to try and compensate, choked. The world got fuzzy. My stomach contracted and I vomited. I felt my thigh wet and thought I’d peed myself. I coughed, sucked up air, choked. I could feel myself suffocating, could feel my brain trying to get oxygen.

That’s all I remember, until I woke up in the Surgeon’s Room. 

I'm sorry. I just don't think I can discuss any more of this tonight. I'll try to finish telling the story tomorrow. It just brings up so much pain.

Thank you for your patience.

I am Emily Fitzgibbons Shafer, Ph.D., an Portland State U assistant sociology professor. I recently published a study in the journal Gender Issues showing that education is predictive of whether or not men care if married women change their surnames. We found that,

•Men with a high school diploma or less view women who keep their last names as less committed wives, whose husbands should accept fewer late workdays and are more justified in divorcing them. 

•Among men with more education and all women, surname choice has little effect on perceptions of a wife’s commitment to her marriage or the standards to which she is held.

Despite the relative gains women have made since the 1960s, the trend toward gender equality has plateaued. Additionally, positive trends in U.S. women's health, such as life expectancy, have slowed in recent years. I study whether partners' long work hours affect individual health, how a woman's surname choice in marriage affects how others perceive her, and the determinants of breastfeeding duration in the United States.

Traveling_wonder,2017-02-28 13:14:14+00:00,"If nearly all sailors were gang-pressed into service, does that make Sea Shanties/Chanties slave songs?","The Sea Shanty on the front page of /r/videos which is [here](https://youtu.be/49FWp7WLYKw?t=23s), sent me on a slight historical bender about the lives of sailors in both military and non-military circumstances pre-American Revolution. So many individuals were gang-pressed into service, some kidnapped from pubs, off the streets, etc in order to fill the crew of some passing ship. Sea Shanties were often sung as a means to pass time during work on a ship by the sailors. So if they are held against their will, then could it be considered a form of enslavement? And if it is, does that make older Sea Shanties slave songs?


&gt;Sea Shanty/chanty: a song with alternating solo and chorus, of a kind originally sung by sailors while performing physical labor together.

&gt;Gang-pressed, press-gang·ing, press-gangs. 1. To force into military or naval service. 2. To force or coerce

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**EDIT**

Some common comments reoccurring is that very few individuals were gang pressed/shanghaied, which is incorrect. I am also incorrect by saying '*nearly all* sailors were gang pressed'.

The comment threads are leaning towards 'certain areas/time periods had higher press gang rates than others'. 

Example 1:
&gt;At the time of the Battle of Trafalgar **over half the Royal Navy's 120,000 sailors were pressed men**. The power of the Impressment Service to conscript was limited by law to seafarers, including merchant seamen, longshoremen and fishermen. There is no basis to the widespread impression that civilians without any seafaring background were randomly seized from home, country lane or workplace by press gangs or that the latter were employed inland away from coastal ports. Source: John Keegan, page 38 ""Battle at Sea""

Example 2: War of 1812
&gt;The United States declared war for several reasons, including trade restrictions brought about by the British war with France, **the impressment of as many as 10,000 American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy**. Source:  J. C. A. Stagg, The War of 1812: Conflict for a Continent. p. 28.

Example 3:
Some lesser forms of impressment that led to 'riots'.
&gt;The Easton Massacre was an incident in which the British Royal Navy shot and killed three citizens of Easton, Portland, Dorset, during **an attempt to press male members of the town into service**. Source: [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easton_Massacre)

Top comment right now is: 
&gt;Impressment was only really a thing with the (specifically British) navy. Naval ships would have large crews and no need for sea shanties.

But no source has been provided. It it also desirable to have sources about the 'rules/laws' passed to disallow shanties on military vessels, and some historical examples of their actual enforcement.

jaynay1,2017-02-26 05:46:58+00:00,THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS HAVE CLINCHED A PLAYOFF BERTH,"With their win over the Nets, the Warriors have 49 wins and cannot finish with a worse record than 49-33.  This guarantees that they will finish ahead of at least 6 teams right off the bat, who have 34 or more losses:  Sacramento, Minnesota, New Orleans, Dallas, Los Angeles (Lakers), and Phoenix.  Finishing ahead of 7 teams clinches a playoff berth.

So then the next 2 teams in the loss column of the standings are the Trail Blazers (33 losses) and Nuggets (32 losses), who have 1 game remaining between them, meaning that depending on the result of that game, in the absolute worst case Warriors scenario either A, the Nuggets win, the Trail Blazers get their 34th loss, and thus 7 teams have a worse record than the worst possible Warriors record and they clinch, or B, the Trail Blazers win, and a multi-way tie at 33 losses is possible.

So that tie can't be less than a 3 way tie (Since all 3 of the Trail Blazers, Nuggets, and Warriors have to be involved), and that's where we'll start.

In the event of a 3 way tie, the first tiebreaker is record within the tied teams.  For these 3 teams, it would be as follows:

1. Golden State, 6-1.
2. Portland, 3-5.
3. Denver, 2-5.

So in the event of a 3 way tie, Golden State is fine.

4+ ties are a little trickier to produce, so first we'll eliminate the possibility of certain teams being involved; There are 9 possibilities, 6 who might not be in the tie for a multi-way tie.

We know OKC won't be involved because they are at best 1-3 against the Warriors, at worst 1-3 against the Trail Blazers, and at worst 2-2 against the Nuggets.

We know the Clippers won't be involved because they are at best 0-4 against the Warriors, and at worst 3-0 against the Trail Blazers and 1-3 against the Nuggets.

The Spurs, Rockets, Grizzlies, and Jazz are all possibilities.  So that's 15 combinations to be tested, all of which, I believe, leave the Warriors (2^4 minus the possibility that includes none of those teams because we've already tested it) in the playoffs.

For these, I can work them out in a comment, but this post is already getting quite long as is so I'm going to terminate it.  But basically, congratulations to the Warriors on clinching in February for the 2nd straight year.",nba,1942

During 2012 playoffs a frustrated Amare Stoudemire, for unknown reasons, attacked a fire extinguisher minutes after the New York Knicks' Game 2 loss to the Miami Heat. The Knicks power forward suffered lacerations on his left hand which required stitches. He suffered the laceration on the inside of his palm, on the side of his hand closest to the pinkie. Subsequently, Amare has been extinguished from Game 3. It is important to note, that fire extinguisher's side of the story was never heard.

------------------------------

**BEEP, BEEP**

Shortly after inking a six-year, $66 million dollar contract extension, Monta Ellis torpedoed Golden State's 2008-09 season when he tore a ligament in his left ankle and sustained a high-ankle sprain in a ""low-speed"" moped accident. So not only did he screw his team over, he lost serious Man Points for getting injured not only on a moped...but while driving said moped at low speeds. 

---------------------------------------

**UPSETING THE GODS**

Tony Allen blew out his knee -- tearing both ACL and MCL -- while trying to throw one down after the whistle had blown. That's a direct message from the Basketball Gods, and it can be interpreted as: ""Thou shall not showboat, mortal fool!"" Oh, and he also missed the dunk.

----------------------------------------

**BIG BALLS TOO MUCH FOR THE WOLVES' TITLE HOPES**

The Minnesota Timberwolves' best chance of reaching the Finals with Kevin Garnett came in 2004, but Sam Cassell injured his hip before the start of the Western Conference Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers defeated the Wolves and played the Detroit Pistons in the Finals. ""All the time,"" said Flip Saunders about Cassell's injury. ""It was his hip. He made a shot out of the corner against Sacramento in Game 7 [of the conference semifinals], and he did his little Big Balls dance, and from that, he created a little avulsion fracture in his hip. No question, I think about that dance all the time. But that’s the NBA. I went to four straight conference finals in Minnesota and Detroit, and we had injury issues in each one. The team that wins the title is usually the healthiest team.""

-------------------------

**PRO BOWL**

Andrew Bynum injured his knee when going bowling, while being injured. Yes he did.

---------------------------

**NIGHT PARALYSIS**

In 2012 Kevin Love slept with his right arm extended off his bed all night and when he woke up he couldn't move it and had to miss the next game. 

------------------------

**STEVE THE SPIKE**

Lakers guard (at the time) Steve Blake suffered a puncture wound to his left foot after stepping on a spike strip in a parking lot. He was out for three weeks. Blake said he hurt himself when he ""got distracted going back to my truck"". Good job, Steve.

--------------------------

**LOTION-EYEZ KILLA**

Charles Barkley missed the Phoenix Suns' 1994-95 season opener because the first layers of his corneas got burned off by body lotion during an Eric Clapton concert. Apparently, allergies and the dazzling stage lights caused Sir Charles to rub his eyes, and he got lotion in them. Phoenix Suns team doctor, Richard Emerson, said: ""It was a chemical reaction to a type of lotion that he uses. I wouldn't anticipate it'll reoccur because I don't think he'll use that type again."" 

---------------------------------


**SLEEPIN' &amp; CHILLIN'**

Prior to the 1995-96 NBA season, BJ Tyler was selected by the Toronto Raptors in the 1995 expansion draft. According to journalist Chris Young's book Drive, Tyler accidentally fell asleep with a pack of ice on his knee, severely damaging it and thus losing all the speed for which he was famed, and subsequently had to retire.

--------------------------

**DISHES GET STICHES**
Brad Miller needed nine stitches in his right index finger after almost chopping it off with a knife while doing dishes last season...on the same day he was named Western Conference Player of the Week for the second time in his career. Said Miller: ""It's the last time I help do dishes."" Said teammate Mikki Moore: ""When I saw him, it was all wrapped up. So, I said, 'You're going to drop 20 and 20 in two games and then go and cut your knuckle off?' I said, 'That's real smart, Brad.' He said, 'Nah, that's my luck.'"" 

--------------------------------------------

**""THANKS REF""**

During the 2001-02 season, Corey Maggette got so upset over a call that he slammed his hand on the scorer's table in frustration and dislocated the ring and little fingers on his right hand. Maggette ended up with a cast and a four-week vacation.


-------------------------------------

**FINALS MVP**

Ah, Darko, Darko, Darko. He was put in for what was described as a ""token"" appearance in the Pistons' Game 5 blowout of the Lakers in the 2004 NBA Finals. He played 2 minutes, finishing with 1 rebound, 1 steal, 1 turnover...and 1 broken hand. Oh yes he did. The injury required surgury and sidelines him for eight weeks. 

--------------------------

**CAN'T HANDLE THE JOE**

Derrick Coleman -- whose NBA career was limited and cut short largely due to injury problems -- got injured again, only this time it happened while filming an episode of the TV show Pros vs. Joes. DC was participating in a rebounding challenge against some ""average joe"" when he came down from a jump and landed awkwardly, hurting his always-troublesome knee. This means that Coleman probably has the dubious distinction of being the first Pro to ever get injured during battle with a Joe.

-------------------------------------------

**SLICING AND DICING**

The Bulls rookie (at the time) Derrick Rose was forced to miss some practice time because, get ready for it, he cut himself under the elbow on his left forearm. In bed. From a knife he used to slice an apple. Said Rose: ""Silly accident this morning. I went to get a bottle of water, forgot the knife was there and sat down and sliced my arm. I panicked when it first happened. I called [Bulls trainer Fred Tedeschi]. We got it stitched up about 8 [a.m.]. It was a large wound, but they healed it up. I'm good. I could have practiced, but they told me to wait until [today]. I can still dribble, shoot, do all that stuff. I'm hoping they'll let me play.""

------------------------------------

**HOW TO PUT ON A SHOE 101**

In December 2001, before a game against the Washington Wizards, DirK Nowitzki sprained a tendon in his ankle when he put his shoe on improperly and the stomped his foot on the floor to make sure it was on right. The injury was so bad he missed the game. 

---------------------------------------

**HIDDEN DANGERS OF A WALK-THROUGH**

Eddy Curry had to miss a game due to a badly sprained left ankle suffered at...a walk-through at his team's morning shoot-around. Nope. I'm not kidding. Said teammate Malik Rose: ""How do you explain something like that?"" Good question. A very good question.

----------------------------

**E-CITY VS PHYSIOBALL**
Speaking of good questions, here's another: Can a player suffer a more embarrassing injury than spraining his ankle during a walk-through? Well, the answer is ""yes"" my friends. From the New York Daily News: ""Poor Eddy Curry. He sat on the giant blue physioball during a break from Monday's practice and the ball exploded. Eddy fell and scraped and his wrist but should be okay. The ball, which is used for stretching exercises, was pronounced dead at the scene."" This also answers the classic ""How do you know when you're too fat?"" question.

-----------------------------------

**""I TRIED TO WARN HIM"" - Eddy Curry**

Francisco Garcia broke his arm...on a physioball. No, really. At least he wasn't so fat it exploded on him...

-----------------------------

**DIAL 555-INJURY**

Prior to Game 3 of the 1992 first round playoff series between the Indiana Pacers and the Boston Celtics, George McCloud ""held his ankle in a funny way"" while talking on the phone. This somehow injured the ankle so badly he couldn't play in the game and had to sit on the bench in street clothes as his team got eliminated. 

----------------------------

**AGENT ZERO'S BARBERSHOP**

File this one under ""unfortunate pube shaving accidents."" Very unfortunate. I'll let Gilbert Arenas tell the tale: ""When I was new in the NBA the team veterans convinced me to shave, you know, down there, because they said the hair stinks. I used my girlfriend's razor, which was rusty and gave me keloids. The doctor prescribed medicine to dab on, but I just poured it all over. Three days later I woke up screaming. The skin was burnt off my scrotum, down to my crack, everything -- just raw flesh. I still had to run and play, so I used a numbing spray for a month until it healed. Now I use clippers.""

-----------------------------

**OFF TO A GREAT START**

Greg Ostertag fractured the third metacarpal on his right hand in October of 2004 when he tripped on a footstool while getting out of bed. Mind you, this happened after his first day of practice with his new team, the Sacramento Kings.

--------------------------

**THE LUGGAGE CONSPIRACY**

1991 Jeff Ruland made a comeback for the Sixers. He was out of action for five years but attempted to return for the 1991-92 season. However, the comeback ended because of...a luggage cart. Yes, a luggage cart, which was (allegedly) rammed into Ruland's leg by a Celtics employee as he waited for a team bus outside Boston Garden. (It should be noted that Ruland was not a popular in Boston, and he was even nicknamed ""McNasty"" by the Celtics' late great broadcaster Johnny Most.) Ruland said: ""I got run over by a luggage cart. That's hard to swallow. It can't be accidental, they were moving too fast. Whoever could foresee anything like this happening?""

------------------------------------

**PERK'S TIC-TAC-TOE**

Boston's big man (at the time) Kendrick Perkins missed time due to a right big toe that was injured when he dropped a bed on it. ""I was asleep. I guess whoever put my bed together didn't put it together right when I moved, so one side of my bed fell. My bed was tilted, so I got out of my bed to go push down on the other side. And when I was about getting ready to push down on the other side, the headboard started coming in. So I tried to push the headboard back so it wouldn't fall over. My foot was under the bed and the other side of the bed fell on my foot."" Man, I hate it when that happens.

-------------------------------

**CRIPPLING BUZZER-BEATER**

During the mid-90s, Kevin Johnson won a regular season game on a buzzer-beating shot and received a crippling bear hug from teammate Charles Barkley. And I mean ""crippling"" in the literal sense. Chuck squeezed Kevin so hard his shoulder was dislocated. (At least Barkley didn't rub any body lotion in KJ's eyes.) He was out of action for the next two weeks. KJ also had hernia surgery in 1996 after years of abdominal problems that were allegedly brought on by picking up teammate Oliver Miller to celebrate a play.

----------------------------

**TALL PEOPLE PROBLEMS**

Kobe Bryant hurt his back. Vacuuming. But he says it's because of vacuum size discrimination. 

------------------------------

**AIR TAKES OUT BIRD**

In the fall of 1988, Larry Bird was attempting a comeback from dual achilles surgery when he permanently injured in his back. How? He was undercut by Michael Jordan, who then fell on Bird...in the Kenny Rogers Charity Basketball Tournament in Kentucky. According to his second autobiography, Bird Watching: On Playing and Coaching The Game I Love, Bird said: ""We were in the final minutes of this charity basketball game when I went up for a rebound and came down a little sideways. Michael Jordan was going for the ball too, and he landed on my back. Right away I knew I was in trouble. I had torn additional portions of the disc wall, and my back was really traumatized. I didn't know it then, all the way back in 1989, but that was the beginning of the end…I never came all the way back."" 

------------------------

**""I GOT A YACHT TO FEED""**

Latrell Sprewell, the man whose hands once said 'hello' to his coach's neck, broke his hand by taking a swing at the boyfriend of a female party guest who threw up on his yacht. But it seems that Spree's punches were roughly as accurate as his jumpers (42 percent lifetime): He whiffed and punched the wall instead. Sprewell tried to cover up the incident, but some of his guests leaked the story and the Knicks fined Spree $250,000 for not reporting the injury. Sprewell complained about it to the press. ""They talk about being a family but they're not sticking with me. The biggest thing to me is that I'm hurt. So don't kick me when I'm down."" 

--------------------------

**DNP - GAMING**

Lionel Simmons suffered an injury during the 1990-91 season: He missed two games with wrist tendonitis caused by overtraining on his Nintendo Game Boy.

Note that, a year later, Derrick McKey missed seven games with the same injury.

-------------------------- 

**AQUA LUC**

During the 1996-97 season, the Bulls lost Luc Longley's services for seven weeks after he got hurt body surfing. Yeah. Luc was body-surfing off the coast of Los Angeles coast when an unexpectedly strong wave drove him shoulder-first into the ocean floor and knocked his clavicle and shoulder out of place.

--------------------

**HIS SMOKENESS**

Although Michael Jordan  was already kinda sorta unofficially retired (again), Jordan severed a tendon in his right index finger (i.e., on his shooting hand) while using a cigar cutter in January 1999. Officially listed as a ""a laceration of the flexor tendon,"" Jordan needed surgery to repair it and six weeks of occupational therapy to rehabilitate it.

--------------------------

**HIGH MUGGSY**

Muggsy Bogues, the tiny, tiny man (who was playing for the Toronto Raptors at the time) missed the second half of a game against the Portland Trailblazers after accidentally sucking in some ointment fumes during a halftime treatment. Said Bogues: ""Never happened to me before and I hope it never happens again. That was one of those fluke things you don't even dream about.""

---------------------------

**TEAM BONDING**

This entry harkens back to 2003, during Portland's infamous ""Jail Blazer"" era. Ruben Patterson ended up with a shiny black eye thanks to a five-knuckeled ""hello"" from teammate Zach Randolph. Patterson, who earlier that season had been arrested on suspicion of domestic assault, was arguing with Qyntel Woods, who himself had been recently cited by Portland police on marijuana possession charges after a traffic stop, when Randolph stepped in and sucker-punched Patterson. While, it should be noted, Patterson was being restrained by teammates. Nice, huh? Patterson then promised not to retaliate...until his probation expired in May (it was April at the time). Good times all around. 

-------------------------

**EXTREME HOBBIES**

While playing for the Chicago Bulls during the Michael Jordan-less 1993-94 season, Scott Williams had a string of bizarre injuries. First, he missed four days of practice after straining his shoulder at the team's annual bowling outing. A few days later, he hurt his back lifting a TV he bought on sale. Then, later in the season, he injured a tendon behind his right kneecap while stretching, and that was the end of his season.

--------------------------

**RADMAN'S WINTER X-GAMES**

In February of 2007, Vladimir Radmanovic separated his shoulder falling on a patch of ice in Park City, Utah. Or so he claimed. But a few days later, Radmanovic admitted that he had actually hurt himself in a fall during a jump while snowboarding. Said the Radman: ""The truth is that I hurt myself in a fall while snowboarding. Being young and sometimes immature, I initially panicked and made up a false story about how I hurt myself. However, over the past few days my conscience has been bothering me terribly. I am not a dishonest person and could no longer live with this deception. Therefore, I came forward today and told the truth to the Lakers."" Mind you, his contract specifically banned him from taking part in activities that involve significant risk of injury, including skiing and snowboarding. The space cadet was fined $500,000.


------------------------------------

**LIGHTS OUT**

Carlos Boozer broke his hand after tripping over his gym because it was too dark to see at 6PM. Somebody was knocking at the door, and Boozer rushed to answer. On the way, he tripped over his big gym bag in the hall and fell. He went down awkwardly on his right hand and felt it pop. The neighbours later testified they heard an extremely loud ""AHHH AND-ONE!"" echoing through the neighbourhood.


",nba,5229
lolathon234,2017-01-26 15:37:38+00:00,Statistically Analysis: Russell Westbrook's rebounding numbers are the result of extreme statpadding(OC),"After having watched the Thunder a dozen or so games in the last month, I've come to notice that their entire rebounding scheme is designed around boxing out bigs and letting Westbrook crash the glass uncontested. This isn't to say Westbrook isn't a great rebounder relative to his position, because he's one the best, but his rebounds are absolutely inflated.    

Westbrook is leading the NBA in uncontested DREB's with 7.9 rpg, even higher than guys that are anchored around the rim for defensive purposes like Whiteside, Gobert, Jordan, and David.    

http://stats.nba.com/players/defensive-rebounding/#!?sort=DREB_UNCONTEST&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=DREB*GE*5&amp;Season=2016-17&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season   

Beyond that, Westbrook has BY FAR the lowest contested DREB% in the league for any player averaging &gt;5 RPG.   

http://stats.nba.com/players/defensive-rebounding/#!?sort=DREB_CONTEST_PCT&amp;dir=-1&amp;CF=DREB*GE*5&amp;Season=2016-17&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season    

One might start to wonder how a PG could be accumulating so many uncontested rebounds, digging into Westbrook's shot contests gives a clearer picture  

http://stats.nba.com/players/hustle/#!?sort=CONTESTED_SHOTS&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2016-17&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=1610612760&amp;CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*&amp;PerMode=Totals

Westbrook has contested a grand total of 160 FG's on the ENTIRE SEASON.   

That number is staggeringly low and to be frank, flat out embarrassing. To put his 3.4 contests per game in perspective, OKC backup PG Cameron Payne is averaging 4.1 contests per game while playing in less than half of the minutes that Westbrook is.   

Westbrook ranks dead last in the NBA in contested shots among players averaging 30 or more MPG by a considerable margin. Hilariously, the only two players who have contested less 3P FGA's are Rudy Gobert and Whiteside, who have contested 53 and 64 respectively. Russell Westbrook is at 69 while having playing close to the same amount of minutes...Yes, DeAndre Jordan has contested more 3P FGA's this season than Russell Westbrook.  

http://stats.nba.com/players/hustle/#!?sort=CONTESTED_SHOTS_3PT&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2016-17&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=MIN*GE*1400&amp;PerMode=Totals  

Some people may point to other names on that list, i.e. Jimmy Butler, showing they have fairly lower contest numbers as well. The difference being Jimmy Butler's counterpart is attempting 4 fewer FGA than Westbrook's.  

Westbrook is contesting approximately 3.4 of his PG matchup's 13.1 FGA while on the floor. The player he's supposed to be defending is attempting 74% of their shots without a contest from Westbrook. Butler on the other hand is right around 45%.  

http://www.82games.com/1617/16OKC1.HTM

Ignoring the fact that he leaving his man with regularity to chase rebounds, even when Westbrook contests shots he's the worst guard in the league in expected FG% against.   

His opp. +6.9% over expected FG% is dead last in the NBA among guards. The only other players over 4.5% are Sean Kilpatrick, Kyle Korver, and Emmanuel Mudiay.   

http://stats.nba.com/players/defense-dash-overall/#!?sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2016-17&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*300&amp;PlayerPosition=G   

Back to Westbrook's raw rebounding numbers. Beyond his absurd REB rate on uncontested FGA, Westbrook is averaging an absurd 1.2 uncontested DRPG on missed FT's. All of the top rebounding bigs in the league are between 0.4-0.7 per game, Westbrook is doubling their frequency while operating out of 3 position.  

Rather than operate under the typical box out on opponent FT's, OKC is instead placing Westbrook in the 3 position and pinching the opponent FT rebounders, forming a triangle which allows Westbrook to slide into position and ""steal"" rebounds. While this technique is often employees when a team has a decisive front court disadvantage, the Thunder implement it all times with Westbrook on the floor despite featuring two 7 footers who are elite rebounders in their own right. This has enabled Westbrook to further add to his rebounding numbers, almost doubling the next highest uncontested FTREB in the league.  

One might ask why this matters? It essentially opens the paint offensive rebounds on missed FT's to anyone that isn't operating in the 4 or 5 position. As a result, OKC is actually 2nd worst in the NBA in FT defensive rebounding. 

http://stats.nba.com/player/#!/201566/rebounds-dash/   

Here is a video clip from fansided demonstrating the technique   
https://mtc.cdn.vine.co/r/videos/28AB2730E91432134400392466432_597b112affa.43.0.56161B28-6E7D-4DC4-BAEA-991A58EB5C04.mp4?versionId=GL_iej_GnMNDV.kkj5xrZXvwFiaVGklr    

Finally, and probably the most damning statistic, is that 7.0 of Westbrook's 10.4 rebounds per game are coming on missed FGA from 13+ feet. The largest proportion of those, 4.2, are from 19+ feet. That number ranks 4th in the NBA behind only Whiteside, Jordan, and Drummond. 83% of those rebounds on misses from 19+ feet are uncontested rebounds, meaning Westbrook had 0 competition for the board.  

Why is a point guard able to grab rebounds on missed long shots without contest so frequently? Why is he not guarding the opposing point guard when there's a FGA so far away from the basket? The opposing PG obviously isn't in the paint next to Westbrook, or the rebound wouldn't be uncontested. Is he just abandoning his man when a player has the ball on the perimeter and is likely to shoot?


Summary: Westbrook is almost never contesting shots, instead he's leaving his man open and blatantly attacking the paint in search of defensive rebounds with a numbers advantage. Beyond this, the entire rebounding culture of the team has been centered around the bigs boxing out and deferring rebounds to Westbrook. Additionally, due to his position being perimeter oriented, his constant search of rebounds has compromised OKC's perimeter defense, which ranks dead last in the NBA in opp. guards expected FG% by a considerable margin.   



**EDIT: let me add some additional things that are frequently being asked/used to criticize the data**

I've seen many reference OKC's transition offense as a reasoning for scheming around Westbrook rebounds. OKC ranks 13th in the NBA in transition offense and averages around 17 fast break points per game, ~4 higher than league average. Given their overall offensive ranking of 16th overall, transition offense actually has little overall effect on their team efficiency given it's responsible for less than 20% of their total offensive possessions.    

After running the numbers, OKC would only average ~0.5 less PPG if they were completely average in transition(efficiency and volume). 

OKC's slightly above league average with 27.0 uncon DREB. Factoring for variance and Westbrooks superior PG rebounding skills, he's grabbing right around 40% of all possible uncontested DRBS when on the court. OKC grabs 51.8% of all rebounds with Westbrook on the court. Without Westbrook, they're at 50.9%. That 0.9% drop is largely non-significant. Further more, last season OKC was the greatest rebounding team in NBA history +8.4/game. This season, they're still above average at +3.4, but nowhere near as dominant despite Westbrooks historic REB rate.    

http://www.82games.com/1617/16OKC1.HTM#onoff  

He's contesting 3.5 FGA per game, that's less than their backup PG and the worst in the league by a considerable margin for a player averaging&gt;30 mpg.
http://stats.nba.com/players/hustle/#!?sort=CONTESTED_SHOTS&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2016-17&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=MIN*GE*30   

He's contesting less than half of the shot attempts that he was last season(3.4 vs 7.4) and the ones that he is contesting, he's doing a terrible job, as he ranks dead last in the league in opponent expected FG%.  

Westbrook's rebounding effect on W/L's has been overstated. They're 5-4 and allowing 108 ppg in games he's had &gt;13 rebounds. Their opponents in that 9 game stretch are Golden State, Washington, Denver, Miami, New Orleans, New York, Detroit, Charlotte, and LA.  

These are his opponents he's had &gt;11 rebounds and OKC won. @T Wolves, Suns, @ Kings, @ Kings, @ Celtics, Pelicans, @ 76ers, Celtics, Magic, Grizzlies, @ Hawks, Suns, @ Pistons, @ Knicks, Pelicans, Heat, and Nuggets. 

 These are his opponents that he's had &gt;11 rebounds and OKC lost: Warriors, Hawks, Pacers, Clippers, Hornets, Wizards, Pistons, @ Kings, @ Twolves.   

In addition to being terrible at contesting shots, he's also dead last in the league in opponent drives  

http://stats.nba.com/players/defense-dash-lt6/#!?Season=2016-17&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PlayerPosition=G&amp;sort=FREQ_WHOLE_NUM&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=FGA_LT_06*GE*75&amp;PerMode=Totals  

His opponents are driving on him with the 4th highest frequency while shooting 10.8% above average when guarded by Westbrook.  

He's dead last in the NBA in contested shots in a position that leads the league in FGA. Westbrook's allowing his opponent 4.6 wide open(not within 6 feet) shots per game, which is 1.8 FGA higher than any other player in the league.   

The only 2 players averaging &gt;30 minutes per game and contested less 3PA are Gobert &amp; Whiteside.   

In contrast with last season, overall, defenders are shooting 6% higher from the field, 2% higher from 3, 10% higher from 2, and 9% higher inside 10 feet this season vs Westbrook than they did in 2016.


**2nd Edit: Those referencing Westbrook's rebounding in wins and losses.**    

Here are the teams they've beaten when he gets 10+ boards  

Atlanta  
Boston X 2, one was without I. Thomas   
Brooklyn  
Denver X 2, both without Jokic  
Detroit  
LA Clippers without CP3 and Griffin  
LA Lakers  
Memphis  
Miami without Dragic  
New Orleans X 3  
New York  
Philly the 2nd game of the season  
Phoenix X 2  
Sacramento  
Utah  
Washington when they were 6-11  

http://bkref.com/tiny/2Xn82  

Additionally, Westbrook played 34 or more minutes in all but one of those games, against the Clippers
Meanwhile OKC has lost a total of 9 games where Westbrook failed to record 10 rebounds. The minutes played in those games were as follows  

L 80-114 Memphis 23 minutes 5 rebounds, Memphis shot 53% from the field  
L 95-114 Portland 27 minutes 6 rebounds, Portland shot 54% from the field  
L 96-122 @ Golden State 29 minutes 6 rebounds, Warriors shot 52% from the field  
L 98-120 @ LAC 29 minutes 5 rebounds, Clippers shot 55% from the field  
L 89-109 @ Utah 30 minutes 5 rebounds, Jazz shot 58% from the field  
L 94-98 @ Milwaukee 35 minutes 7 rebounds, Bucks shot 48% from the field  
L 109-111 @ LA Lakers 35 minutes 8 rebounds, Lakers shot 51% from the field  
L 116-118 @ Houston 37 minutes 8 rebounds, Rockets shot 48% from the field  
L 112-102 Toronto 38 minutes 7 rebounds, Raptors shot 52% from the field  

His poor rebounding in losses isn't the causation, rather it's the other team shooting a much higher percentage from the field thus reducing rebound opportunities and Westbrooks minutes due to the games being blowouts.


**Edit 3: Westbrooks increase in rebounding over the past 4 seasons**  

After looking into his numbers, the only difference between Westbrooks rebounding numbers from 2013-present has been his uncontested defensive rebounds.  

#######2013-14   
Westbrook averaged 5.7 rpg   
3.7 of those rebounds were uncontested DREBs  
http://stats.nba.com/player/#!/201566/rebounds-dash/?Season=2013-14&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season  

#######2014-15  
Westbrook increased his average to 7.3 rpg, 1.6 more than 2014  
4.5 of those rebounds were uncontested DREBS, an increase of 0.8  
*Kevin Durant was injured for the majority of this season. OKC was forced to play with 2 SG's in place of a SF which likely led to Westbrook's career high in ORB.* 

#######2015-16  
Westbrook increased his average to 7.8, 2.1 more than 2014  
6.0 of those rebounds were uncontested DREBs, an increase of 2.3 from 2014   

#######2016-17  
Westbrook increased his average to 10.7 rpg, 5.0 more than 2014  
7.9 of those rebounds were uncontested DREBS, an increase of 4.2 over 2014  

So he's rebounding at roughly the same rate in all areas over the past 4 seasons sans uncontested defensive rebounds, where he's greatly increased his production and his overall rebounding has scaled almost linearly.",nba,3866

While this is called a “rookie report”, I include players some players that are effectively rookies, though they technically were already in the league before this year. For more information on why I do this as well as which such players are included, please read #Before We Begin.

#Introduction

One of my favorite things to follow every season is the mystery and the promise of the NBA rookies. However, there isn't too much coverage of how these guys play. So, I’m posting a statistical summary of this season’s rookie class around the end of every quarter of the season. It’s true that the rookie season is not all that indicative of the rest of a player’s career. However, I want to share this stuff with you guys (1) because I think it’s fun; (2) the players that show noticeable improvement from the beginning to the end of this season are probably worth keeping an eye on; and (3) oftentimes fans (myself included) form their opinions of a rookie after seeing them once or twice, and on any given night a rookie can look like he’s polished beyond his years or a complete disaster.

All stats for this post were recorded on 1/22/17 from [Basketball-Reference](http://www.basketball-reference.com/), meaning the last day of games included was 1/21/17.

You can find my spreadsheet with all the stats [here]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CpkYigXRKF6BY_ee1y-gSkHxqtOnk_EK9LLBQdA-f7c/pubhtml)

#Before We Begin

*Small Sample Size Police*

The sample sizes are too small. That’s just the name of the game when you look at what rookies are doing. As a reminder to everyone, take all the stats with a grain of salt. But let's not get too hung up on this and instead enjoy the rollercoaster of absurd highs and lows that such small sample sizes will take us on throughout the season. That said at some point the sample size is just too small to be of even minimal value. So, for a rookie to be included in my reports, he’ll have to have played at least a number of minutes equivalent to averaging 5 minutes per game in at least half of the time period of the report. So, to make it into this post, a rookie must have played at least 105 minutes (21 Games x 5 MPG).

*Growing Pains*

A sentiment I see frequently is “[Rookie] sucks!” or “[Rookie] doesn’t deserve playing time because he’s trash!” This attitude implies that there are some rookies that are good and some rookies that are bad. The truth is, as you'll see, that rookies all pretty much suck by NBA standards. Even the guys who impress in the box score begin to lose their luster when you look to advanced stats that account for efficiency and defense. It’s a difficult adjustment to play in the NBA and the statistics bear that out. Also, the fact that stats like VORP are not too kind to rookies says as much about the rookies themselves as it says about just how good a replacement-level NBA player is at basketball. So, it’s not wrong to say a rookie “sucks,” but that should not be the end of the analysis as we try to suss out what kind of player a guy is going to be in the future. “Sucking” is just sort of part of the process of being a rookie. Lastly, this means we should just be that much more appreciative when we see a rookie who is putting up a stat line that actually resembles a quality NBA stat line.

*“Rookies”*

I identified 86 players for consideration in this report. That number includes the 2016 draft class, undrafted players (domestic and foreign), players from earlier draft classes playing their first minutes, **and players who played fewer than *200* minutes of NBA games prior to this season**. I included that last group just because it seemed a little unfair to count as rookies guys who have had professional training for multiple years before coming over or starting their rookie season, but not to count other guys in a similar position who just happened to end up on the basketball court for a few minutes during garbage time. 
In my first report, I set the cut-off at 400 minutes played prior to the start of this season because I felt like somebody who played in a full 82 games but averaged less than 5 minutes per game is someone that I would say still hasn’t really played a season of NBA basketball. However, most of the feedback I received was that this cutoff was too generous. I reduced the cutoff down to 200 minutes, which eliminated all the players that were specifically called out in the last thread.

Between changing the cut-off and waivers, the following players did not make it from the last report: Terry Rozier, Chris McCullough, Aaron Harrison, Cristiano Felicio, RJ Hunter, Salah Mejri, Jonathan Gibson, Darrun Hilliard, James Michael McAdoo, Montrezl Harrell, Joe Young, Jarell Martin, CJ Wilcox, Arinze Onuaku, Lucas Nogueira, Delon Wright

And we also had some new additions to the available pool: Pierre Jackson, Chasson Randle

*Final Notes*

Last time, I misused the term “replacement player”, erroneously tying it to VORP and not BPM. I’ve corrected that for this report.
I also started recording WAR this report as I felt it helps clarify what some of the advanced stats mean for teams and players.
There was a request last time to include per 36 stats. Since that would almost double the work I have to do for these, I opted not to include those yet. However, I’m planning on adding those to the year-end report along with some other stuff like ORtg and DRtg.
All stats are cumulative, so they go back to the start of the season and are not limited to just the games that took place between now and my last post.

#Rookie of the Year

Joel Embiid (PHI) continues to tighten his grip on the ROY award. He’s averaging 19.8 points per game—over **10** more points than the next best rookie (Dario Saric at 9.4). He’s putting up 7.8 rebounds, 2.1 assists per game, 2.5 blocks per game, and 0.8 steals per game. And yes, those numbers are all improved from my last post. He has far and away the highest Usage rate of any rookie at 36.2% (Dejounte Murray comes in second at 26.2%). Oh and let’s not forget he’s a 7-footer whose shooting 34.8% from 3, just under league average (35.9%) on 3.1 attempts per game. His BPM is 3.7. His VORP is 1.1, translating to 2.97 wins above a replacement-level player (WAR). Even with his minutes restriction, he’s third among rookies in minutes per game. Nobody else comes close to these numbers this season. Every game he plays is a must watch for fans that follow young players and their development.

Runner Up: Malcolm Brogdon (MIL): 9.4 PPG, 44.2% FG, -1.2 BPM. 0.2 VORP, 0.54 WAR

A couple other players are posting similar box score stats (Dario Saric (PHI), Buddy Hield (NOP), and Brandon Ingram (LAL)). However, when you turn to advanced metrics, all those guys look like net negatives for their teams. So, to me they don’t really challenge Brogdon for second place.

#Notable Improvements

Malcolm Brogdon. He is averaging 9.3 PPG (third among rookies) on 54.4% TS% up from 6.8 PPG on 45% TS%. Last quarter he was sitting at -3.8 BPM and -0.1 VORP, but has since improved to -1.2 BPM and a positive VORP of 0.2. He’s also improved to 2.8/4 R/APG from 2.6/2.6 R/APG and has earned 5 more MPG in the Bucks’ rotation. From a middling second round pick to arguably the best player in his draft class, with heavy emphasis, *right now this season*. It’s hard to say what his ceiling is beyond this. But he is giving the Bucks exactly what they could hope for out of a 24-year-old rookie: an instant contributor.

Buddy Hield. Hield got off to a shaky start to the season. At the time of the last report, he recorded a sad BPM of -6.1. He was inefficient from the field, managing 7.6 PPG on a dismal 35.8% from the field (22.9% from 3, 43.3% TS%). Today he’s still digging himself out of that hole, but has improved to 9 PPG on 39.5% from the field. Most exciting is that he’s heating up from deep, boosting his 3P% all the to 37.2% on 4.3 attempts per game. His BPM is still below the rookie average at -3.5 and his VORP has not improved at all from the -0.3 of the last quarter. Nonetheless, he’s starting to look more like the Buddy Hield we were all expecting to see after his career at Oklahoma. If he can keep this up, I think he will have had one of the better seasons out of all the rookies this year when all is said and done.

Caris LeVert. It’s a little misleading to call his work an improvement as he was hurt for the entire first quarter of the season. Regardless, his play has been impressive since his return. He’s shooting 45.5% from the field (33.3% from 3, 58.2% TS%) to the tune of 6.9 PPG. His BPM is decent at -0.7 with a VORP of 0.1, translating to 0.27 WAR for a team struggling to secure wins. The Nets failures are a tragic meme these days, and that tends to overshadow a series of shrewd moves by their front office, of which LeVert is just one of the latest. From snatching RHJ from Portland to picking up Sean Kilpatrick to hiring Marks and Atkinson, they’ve shown some real savvy in managing their team. I’m excited to see what this staff can cook up once their larder is fully stocked again.

And, as detailed above, Joel “The Process” Embiid went from best to bestest.

#Cooling Down

Nobody cooled down more than Jonathan Gibson (DAL) who went from my pick for ROY runner-up in the last post to being waived in favor of Pierre Jackson. He was a fun storyline while he lasted, but the fact remains that he was 29 years old and probably just enjoying a high mark in his statistical variance during the last quarter. I wish him the best in his future endeavors.

Jamal Murray was another guy swimming around in the Embiid’s ROY wake last quarter. At the time he was averaging 9.9 PPG and shooting 41.1% from the field and 45% from 3. He was adding in 2.4 RPG and 2.2 APG and beating out replacement-level status by a decent margin at -0.6 BPM. Today he’s cooled off, sinking to 36.9% from the field and 31.9% from 3. His APG are also down to 1.7 and he’s scoring a little less at 7.8 PPG. But most troubling of all is his BPM which has dropped below replacement-level to -3.4. All in all, this sort of looks like what most expected from him: a very streaky shooter who, at only 19 years old, would need some time to develop consistency and efficiency. Don’t be surprised if he’s back to the top of the report by the time the 3rd quarter ends.

Jaylen Brown. At the time of the last report, Brown was looking efficient and impressive. He was scoring 6.1 PPG on 52% TS% (44.7 from the field and 33.3% from 3). And his BPM of -2.3 suggested that he was treading rookie water as a replacement level player. While his FG% is mostly unchanged, he’s cooled off from behind the arc (30.2%) and is now averaging only 4.9 PPG. His BPM sank to -4.9 and he’s posting a VORP of -0.4, which translates to -1 WAR. Last time, he looked like he was developing much faster than anyone expected, and today we are reminded that looks can be deceiving as he has regressed toward what will probably look like his mean this season. Accordingly, he’s lost a couple minutes in the rotation down to 13.2 MPG from 15.5. He is of course a 20-year-old drafted for his upside and not his immediate contributions, but his hot start certainly got the best of me and it’s been sobering to see him come back to earth.

#Averages of this Rookie Class

* Points Per Game: 4.86 (up from 4.49)

* FG%: 41.9% (down from 42.8%)

* 3P%: 29.4% (down from 32.2%)

* TS%: 50.8% (down from 51.1%)

* BPM: -3.1 (up from -3.3)

* Kris Dunn (MIN): 2.3

†Please note that even though Semaj Christon made it onto a leaderboard, he really is terrible. He’s scraping together 3.2 PPG on a cringe-inducing TS% of 37.8%. His abysmal BPM of -7.1 is only bested by Paul Zipser’s tragic -8.1 BPM. He has a rookie-class worst VORP of -0.7, which translates to a WAR of -1.89, which basically means his presence so far has made the Thunder 2 losses worse than if they just had replacement-level John Q. Basketball in his stead. Also, sorry Nets fans, but Christon is actually tied for the lowest VORP with Isaiah Whitehead, who is also posting a -0.7 VORP.

#Better Late than Never

Malcolm Delaney (ATL) and Mindaugas Kuzminskas (NYK) are the oldest true rookies at 27 years old.

#Happy Birthday!

The following rookies or “rookies” had a birthday since the last report: Alan Williams (PHX), Pat Connaughton (POR), Daniel Ochefu (WAS), Sheldon McClellan (WAS), Malik Beasley (DEN), Jarnell Stokes (DEN), Henry Ellenson (DET), Rakeem Christmas (IND), Deyonta Davis (MEM), Troy Williams (MEM), Malcolm Brogdon (MIL), Buddy Hield (NOP), Josh Huestis (OKC)

#Riding the Pine

The following teams are not giving their rookies or “rookies” much playing time:

* Charlotte Hornets

* Detroit Pistons

* Indiana Pacers

* Los Angeles Clippers

* Orlando Magic

* Sacramento Kings

* Utah Jazz

It’s interesting that by and large these teams are in their conference’s scrum for the 8th seed. That kind of makes sense if you think about it. Our average WAR for this rookie class is -0.26 and we’re talking about for the most part playoff-hungry teams for whom 1 win could make all the difference. Is an 8th seed worth sacrificing a year of development for your young players? At the same time, maybe Joel Embiid’s stellar season suggests that maybe actual playing time isn’t a crucial factor in player development. I’d say that Embiid is such an outlier, no decisions should be made with his performance as support or justification.

Just as a side note, it’s hard to blame the Utah Jazz for ending up on the list since their only rookie is Joel Bolomboy, and I wouldn’t be going out of my way to give him minutes either. Likewise, the Clippers only have two rookies to speak of, one of whom has been hurt all year (Brice Johnson).

*I made 18 points a hard cut-off because I really feel that 20 points, though arbitrary, is what makes a game “notable” for me. But when I started going through game logs, it became clear that setting it that high would limit me to pretty much only Joel Embiid highlights. So I lowered it to 18. In other words, my hard 18 is really just a soft 20, and I wanted to keep it that way. So, my apologies to Brandon Ingram fans since he’s hit 17 points in multiple games.

#Hopefully Next Time

Here are all the players that didn’t meet the minutes requirement for this report:

Demetrius Jackson, Jordan Mickey, Treveon Graham, Christian Wood, Pierre Jackson, AJ Hammons, Nicolas Brussino, Michael Gbinije, Henry Ellenson, Damian Jones, Chinanu Onuaku, Rakeem Christmas, Georges Niang, Brice Johnson, Diamond Stone, Ivica Zubac, Thon Maker, Cheick Diallo, Marshall Plumlee, Josh Huestis, Stepehen Zimmerman, Chasson Randle, Ben Simmons, Derrick Jones, Tim Quarterman, Malachi Richardson, Skal Labissiere, Georgios Papagiannis, Bryn Forbes, Fred VanVleet, Bruno Caboclo, Joel Bolomboy, Sheldon McClellan, Daniel Ochefu, Danuel House

#Conclusion

That’s a wrap on this rookie report. Things are beginning to coalesce more along the lines of expectations, though there have been some nice surprises and storylines starting to open up, too. Anyway, my goal here isn’t to draw too many of my own conclusions and instead just give you all a one-stop shop for some select stats that you can analyze for yourself. But I will close by saying that in the end, everything is in the shadow of Joel Embiid, a god among rookies.

I am The Process. The Process is with me.

Let me know if there are any stats or anything else you want to see in later posts.

**EDITS**

Buddy Hield played for Oklahoma, not Indiana. Thanks u/boomerx23 and apologies to Okalahomans everywhere.

Do you know what this means?

Donald J. Trump is the first President to come directly from the people *ever*. He hasn't played the fucking games and kissed ass to become the president. He **KICKED ASS** to become president. The people have become the rulers of this great nation!

He hasn't had his face buried in a political science textbook since he was a freshman in college. He hasn't written a thousand papers and kissed the ass of liberal progressive professors to gain his credibility.

He hasn't been through the Franklin School of Marxism to learn how to bullshit people into feeling guilt for being good at something.

He's Howard **motherfucking** Roark- he sees and he builds and he makes deals. He has produced buildings and as proof of his success he has made **BILLIONS**. Because he loved doing it- he loved being a developer.

I've watched and listened to Donald J. Trump for almost 40 years- he has had the same vision for our nation the entire time- he has always known its problems and he has always known how to fix them. He knows America- we build shit, we go to the moon, we conquered a continent, we met and fucking defeated the NAZI's in Europe, we proved the Soviets wrong, we changed the world and we loved it. We love to see the world play catch up- not only because it makes our lives better- but it makes everyone's lives better- everyone on the planet. When America is truly first we change the fucking world- we aren't the ship- **America is the tide**- we shall lift all by being great **for ourselves**- for the American people. Americanism is our credo!

**WE MUST SET THE EXAMPLE FOR THE WORLD AND DONALD J. TRUMP IS THE MAN FOR THE JOB.**

Now we have to remind some folks who ain't from Trump country who we are. 

You gotta remember where you come from- they can't starve us out and they can't make us run- so here is some Bocephus!

This song always reminded me of good neighbors and uncles that saw the horrors of Vietnam, Korea and WW II. They liked Monte Carlos and could never find enough Mason jars... for some [REASON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhrw9NGIPsE&amp;t).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvaEJzoaYZk


You've seen the fuckers on TV and all those [CUNTS](https://gfycat.com/ImpeccableAdorableIberiannase) who come to our Domreddit- trying to convince us that we are the crazy ones- when they are in fact the degenerates and mentally ill- they want fucking WW 3. Russia might be dicks, but why the fuck would we have ever followed the establishment to go to war with them!?

I lived in housing projects and was pretty poor- but I had two parents. My dad always worked and set a good example. But, I saw how other people lived and then some time in the early 90's I was [INTRODUCED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZLAv0Mqbe4) to people who had some of the same problems I had. I'm not Straight Outa Compton- but songs like this helped me realize something is wrong with the [FUCKERS](http://i.imgur.com/icr2U6O.jpg) who are running out country.

&gt;After suffering a challenging, 115-107 loss to Milwaukee, Ezeli, in street clothes, addressed the team in the locker room with a stern speech centered on playing with urgency, sources told ESPN. Then two games later, after a crushing defeat in Memphis, Ezeli once again started giving a team speech, but he was cut short.

&gt;McCollum interrupted Ezeli in midsentence and told him that was enough, sources told ESPN. Portland was in the midst of an emotionally draining December, losing 11 of 13 games. Players were desperately pouring out every ounce of effort trying to change the trajectory of the season, and being lectured by someone who wasn't even playing wasn't received favorably.

goran_dragic,2016-12-24 23:04:57+00:00,Earl Watson is quietly making a run at being the worst coach in NBA history,"Let's begin our history of Earl Watson's coaching career with some background. After playing for the Portland Trail Blazers in the 2013-14 season, Watson confirmed his retirement by agreeing to become an assistant coach for the D-League Austin Spurs. The Spurs would lose in the 2nd round of the D-League playoffs to the Santa Cruz Warriors, ending a solid but unspectacular season. 

In June 2015, Watson accepted an assistant coaching position with the Suns. Many thought that a lot of this had to do with the Suns' pursuit of LaMarcus Aldridge in free agency (Watson and Aldridge were good friends in their Portland days), and he was [almost immediately involved in Aldridge's recruiting process](http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/7/1/8880971/lamarcus-aldridge-phoenix-suns-free-agency-rumors). 

6 months later the Suns [promoted Watson to the front of the bench as lead assistant coach](http://www.nba.com/suns/press-release/suns-announce-coaching-staff-changes) without any clear reason. By the end of January, with a 14-35 record, head coach Jeff Hornacek was fired and Earl Watson, who had quietly received multiple promotions that he may or may not have actually deserved in a very short amount of time, was named interim head coach.

Watson finished up his interim season with a 9-24 record (.273), a worse winning percentage than Hornacek's 14-35 (.286). Still, less than a week after the season's end, the Suns inexplicably decided to not only name Watson permanent head coach, but did not even make an effort to interview anyone else. GM Ryan McDonough [explained the decision](http://arizonasports.com/story/636740/suns-gm-ryan-mcdonough-earl-watson-continued-to-stand-out/):

&gt; “Throughout the last month or so of the season, we had a number of players come to us unsolicited and say ‘hey look, this is the guy that should be our head coach. We believe in him, we feel like he believes in us. We sense some of the changes around here in terms of the culture and the mood,'” McDonough said on Burns &amp; Gambo on Arizona Sports 98.7 FM.

Many, if not most, Suns fans (including myself) actually bought into this. We were tired of all the negative energy surrounding the franchise after the Morris twins and Dragic situations and saw the value in a head coach who the players apparently believed in. What's the worst that could happen, right? Earl Watson spent the summer on social media preaching about brotherhood, family, culture, [including whatever the fuck this 6 step plan to make the playoffs is](https://twitter.com/Earl_Watson/status/753266625877606400).

So how has this all supposed emphasis on an unselfish family environment actually played out on the court?

* [The Suns rank dead last in the league in assists per game](http://stats.nba.com/teams/traditional/#!?sort=AST&amp;dir=-1)

* [The Suns are 29th in the league in potential assists per game](http://stats.nba.com/teams/passing/#!?sort=POTENTIAL_AST&amp;dir=1)

* [The Suns rank 24th in the league in secondary assists per game](http://stats.nba.com/teams/passing/#!?sort=SECONDARY_AST&amp;dir=1)

* [The Suns are 25th in the league in turnovers per game](http://stats.nba.com/teams/traditional/#!?sort=TOV&amp;dir=1)

* [The Suns have racked up 36 technical fouls this season, 8 more than the 2nd placed Knicks](https://www.sportingcharts.com/nba/stats/team-technical-fouls/2016/)

* [Only the 76ers give up more fastbreak points per game than the Suns](http://stats.nba.com/teams/misc#!?sort=OPP_PTS_FB&amp;dir=-1)

* [The Suns rank 25th in the league in 3 point attempt frequency](http://stats.nba.com/teams/scoring#!?sort=PCT_FGA_3PT&amp;dir=-1)

* [The Suns are top-10 in the league in the number of iso possessions they run, and bottom 10 in iso efficiency](http://stats.nba.com/teams/isolation/#!?sort=PPP&amp;dir=-1)

* [The Suns are 28th in the league in contesting shots](http://stats.nba.com/teams/hustle#!?sort=CONTESTED_SHOTS&amp;dir=1)

None of these stats point toward anything but a backwards culture and an emphasis on exactly the wrong way to play basketball.

But, well, sure, we all know the Suns suck, but it's a young team and at least he's developing the kids, right? Right? Wrong:

* Booker - he's attempted to turn him into some sort of psuedo-Kobe-Steph hybrid, who attempts more than [65% of his shots off the dribble and 62% of his shots with tight defending](http://stats.nba.com/player/#!/1626164/shots-dash/). [25% of his points come from mid-range and 58% of his shots are unassisted](http://stats.nba.com/player/#!/1626164/), and his efficiency has greatly suffered as a result. 

* Bender - despite being the 4th pick in the draft this year and showing flashes of potential when he's gotten a chance to play, he hasn't had anything resembling a fair shot so far. Nearly all of his minutes have come in garbage time and he hasn't gotten any consistent reps. Just this Tuesday, [Watson said](http://arizonasports.com/story/969207/earl-watson/):

&gt; “For us, what I do not want to happen is I never want Dragan Bender to consistently know what it feels like to not play. That can’t happen”

He then responded by giving Dragan a combined 2 minutes and 19 seconds of playing time in a blowout loss to the Rockets and a home game against the 76ers because fuck you Dragan, apparently.

* Tyson Chandler (34 years old), PJ Tucker (31), Jared Dudley (31), and Leandro Barbosa (34) have averaged 28, 27, 23, and 14 minutes per game respectively, and appeared in all games when healthy. Alex Len (23), Marquese Chriss (19), Dragan Bender (19), and Tyler Ulis (21) have averaged 23, 17, 11, and 9 minutes per game respectively with a combined 20 DNP-CDs.

Through this all, the Suns have the worst record in the western conference at 9-21 and the 3rd worst record in the league overall. Watson is neither winning games by playing his veterans heavy minutes nor losing games with the bigger picture of developing young players in mind.

His work thus far has been a complete and total disaster, with no direction whatsoever and absolutely no positive signs that he or the team have any idea what lies ahead. It's clear that Earl Watson was not, is not, and likely will never be a qualified NBA head coach.",nba,2128

A Reddit user mentioned that the organization Fund for the Public Interest was paying people to protest Trump 

http://sli.mg/00dXH8

2) their website shows they are taking applications. Check out where their offices are. I did find it interesting that the Portland protests were so huge. 

3) Wikipedia says that Ralph Nader founded this non-profit. It's had some controversy for not paying employees minimum wage. Confirmed here, a large class action lawsuit against them: http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2009/07/15/the-liberal-sweatshop.html

If you read reviews of the organization on indeed.com, most employees are extremely disgruntled. This is the type of non profit who hires kids out of college and works them to death, canvassing in the streets all day. Most employees only last a few weeks. 

4) I found some reports of FFPI paying protestors in the past. They put ads on Craigslist for people who wanted to help get Obamacare passed and the second link is another mobilization climate change. Apparently Soros put 5 billion into FFPI and other similar organizations for this purpose.

http://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/environment/item/20008-now-hiring-rent-a-mobs-mobilizing-global-warming-activists-for-2015-action

5) This points out that many of the umbrella organizations UNDER FFPI are funded by Soros. (So clearly FFPI is as well.)

I am 5000% for Donald Trump now and I am sincerely sorry for helping vote in the worst president in the history of America, I was blinded by emotion, misinformation and undiagnosed mental illness. 

I honestly believe if every person took the time and effort I did to actually look into each of these candidates they would plainly see that the ONLY logical choice is Mr. Trump.

I voted Donald Trump because I feel he is a man of his word and he will go to any length to make America great again. 

I also plan on getting involved in my local political groups in order to drag Oregon out of the gutter by force, I am sick and tired of seeing homeless vets on the streets in Portland and something needs to be done.

seamonkey89,2016-10-25 19:34:14+00:00,"Why I, a certified bleeding heart liberal, just voted Trump. Hoping to engage other Liberals. Not start a fight.","I just wanted to share this, in hopes of reaching some other Liberals who are about to hold their noses and vote for Hilary. 

First, my liberal cred. I'm a six year long monthly donator to Planned Parenthood. I've gathered signatures for them, and happily wear a ""hapPenis"" sticker daily on my bike commute. I was a staging captain at my cities pride parade. And oversaw two other staging personnel for hours. I've volunteered for Pflag, Obama's first run, and marched in Portland for socialism. 

Now here's why I just voted Trump.

It used to be us. We used to be the group that shouted at anyone who would listen, that you shouldn't treat someone differently or poorly based on their race or skin color. That all sexes, sexualities, and genders deserve the same treatment. Especially the poor and rich. Now we shout that white CIS males are scum. We happily share headlines where Trump is accused of sexual assault, but ignore Bill's 17 Rape victims and video footage of Hilary calling them tramps and whores. When it happened to Bill Cosby, we knew he was a rapist outright. But Bill Clinton is our darling, so we cover up his rapes. -Hilary is clearly guilty of about 5 acts of treason but, knows the right people and paid them off so she will walk away Scott free.

We went astray. We don't act right anymore. We gave up the high ground. But, I see the alt right fighting for equal treatment now. For rule of law, not matter who you are and how rich you are. 

I don't know of that makes sense to you, but I'd love to hear what you have to say about my decision.

Edit: Thanks for the great comments and positivity! This is why I come here! Also, RIP inbox.",The_Donald,2554

I used the thread at the top of r/nba as a basis for the rosters.

If I missed something or if I was incorrect, feel free to tell me and I'll edit this.

**EDIT:** Added a couple of DUIs (they seem to love those)

**EDIT 2:** ALRIGHT, deleted some of the Cunningham stuff as it was some pretty heavy accusations that have been proved to be fabricated.

**DISCLAIMER:** This is not a list of criminal record as much as it is a list of arrests. I know that in a few of these cases charges have been dropped, but sometimes even *that* doesn't mean the guy is innocent, just as an arrest does not automatically mean he's guilty.

iltdiTX,2016-08-22 23:35:56+00:00,Make Rallies Great Again - Tracking Trump Rallies,"As we all know, Trump is HIGH ENERGY and has lots of STAMINA, especially for his age. To prove this, look no further than his absolutely insane rally schedule. When I jumped on the train [(of which there are NO BRAKES!)](http://i.imgur.com/pp7oHE1.jpg) back in March, I was blown away by the sheer number of rallies he does and yet it seems every time he pulls in [massive crowds](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d_nlIszUIpE/maxresdefault.jpg), regardless of where the rally is. 

&amp;nbsp;

This got me thinking. How many rallies *does* he actually have and how long has he kept this schedule up for? Does he really draw massive rallies *every* time or do those just get the most attention? Does he draw massive crowds only in red states or does he also draw them in blue and purple (battleground) states as well? Will he continue to shitpost after he becomes President? [God I hope so.](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/653856168402681856)

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I started digging into this and couldn’t really find anything or anyone tracking his rallies. [Color me surprised](http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/slatest/2016/01/slatest_160128_trump6.gif.CROP.original-original.gif). So I decided to do it myself to Make Rallies Great Again!!

#BEFORE WE GET INTO THE DATA, HERE'S SOME MAJOR STUMPING POINTS!!
* TRUMP HAS DONE 222 RALLIES OVER 429 DAYS, OR **ONE RALLY EVERY 46 HOURS!!** EXTREMELY HIGH ENERGY!!
* TRUMP'S 2ND RALLY EVER DREW 15,000 PEOPLE!!
* AVERAGE # OF PEOPLE AT ALL RALLIES: **5,494** YUUUUUGE!!!!
* NO RALLY WITH LESS THAN 1,000 PEOPLE **SINCE MARCH 30TH** [Meanwhile, Crooked can't fill a high school gym!](http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cp7k8zgXgAAbR8v.jpg)

* TOTAL # OF PEOPLE IN ATTENDANCE AT ALL RALLIES: **1,219,627**!!! WOWWW
* TOTAL RALLIES IN RED STATES=**75** BLUE STATES=**36** AND PURPLE STATES=**111**
* TOTAL PEOPLE AT RALLIES IN RED STATES=**525,608** BLUE STATES=**239,100** AND PURPLE STATES=**454,919**
* AVERAGE SIZE OF RALLIES IN RED STATES=**7,008** BLUE STATES=**6,642** AND PURPLE STATES=**4,098** WHICH MEANS DESPITE HAVING LESS RALLIES IN BLUE STATES, HE DREW ***JUST AS MANY PEOPLE*** COMPARED TO RED STATES AT EACH RALLY!! MEDIA STUMPED!!

#CENTIPEDES, GET THIS DATA OUT!! WE NEED TO USE THIS TO BFTO THE MSM, SHILLS, SJW'S, AND CUCKSERVATIVES! THIS IS A MOVEMENT, FOLKS, BELIEVE ME!! RALLY SIZE DOES CORRELATE TO POPULARITY AND NOW WE HAVE THE NUMBERS TO SHOW THEM!! GO FORTH AND SHITPOST, SHITPOST SHITPOST AND DON'T LET YOUR MEMES BE DREAMS!

ALSO, I DIDN'T COMPARE THIS TO HILLARY'S RALLIES OR ANYONE ELSE (OBAMA, BUSH, SLICK WILLY, ETC) BUT FEEL FREE TO DO THAT. I CAN UPDATE THIS POST WITH THOSE MEMES.

&amp;nbsp;


I WAS GOING TO MAKE GRAPHS, CHARTS, ETC SHOWING ALL OF THIS DATA BUT HAVEN'T GOT TO IT YET. IF ANYONE WANTS TO DO THAT FEEL FREE OTHERWISE I WILL GET TO IT EVENTUALLY. I FELT I NEEDED TO GET THIS OUT ASAP, ESPECIALLY AFTER SEEING THE GOD EMPEROR [TWEET ABOUT IT](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/767505383430782976?lang=en)

&amp;nbsp;

Reddit wouldn't let me copy all sources here so please reference the original file which has all sources for each rally listed [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/820728/Trump%20Rallies.xlsx). Feel free to browse the list if you want to see how many rallies in your state for example.

&amp;nbsp;


 ^(Disclaimer: This only captures rallies with Trump at them, not Pence. With a few exceptions, I didn't tally up fundraisers, Townhalls, Press conferences, policy speeches, etc. Numbers account for people at the venue itself [including overflow rooms], not people turned away [except Costa Mesa and the Phoenix ones because those rallies were HIGH ENERGY and fuck the haters] There were only a few rallies I couldn't get hard numbers on, so I just estimated based on venue capacity, descriptions [ie: full event], pictures/videos which I have posted the sources for. Purple states assumed to be FL, MI, NH, OH, PA, VA, CO, IA, NV, and WI based on) ^[Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state#Swing_states_for_the_2016_election) ^(If I've missed any rallies let me know and I'll add them to my collection.)

Maggle_Cole,2016-08-15 02:21:20+00:00,Fell for a scam today at GP Portland BEWARE,"Was outside the elevator area at the GP today, and reorganizing my binders after a couple days of trades.  When off to my right, a dude falls down the stairs outside, less than 500ft from me and looks to be in pain.  I run over to him to see if he is ok, and he is holding his hip and leg but keeps telling me he's ok. 

I was attending to this guy for about 45 seconds to 1 minute and I turn back around and my entire backpack and binder was gone. My entire life of saving up cards and collecting was completely gone in an instant.  I looked down both halls to my left and right and saw nobody.  Turn back around, and that horribly hurt guy was gone as well.

Filed a police report and told the organizers, but it was clear I got scammed like a big idiot I apparently am.  I decided to extend my stay in Portland by one day, and I'm gonna go to some of the LGS's tomorrow and ask them to be on the lookout.

I know it has been said here 1000 times, but for the love of everything DO NOT leave stuff unattended for even 1 minute. A one minute mistake cost me about 10 grand and a ton of heartbreak over the game I love to death. 

EDIT: not only have many people reached out to me to help me rebuild my collection, but WotC reached out to me directly.  The community response has really been amazing, and while I have little hope of recovery at this point, just the fact that people are willing to help a complete stranger gives me some faith in humanity and let's me know that the world isn't as shitty of a place as I thought it was about 12 hours ago. 

I sincerely and genuinely appreciate everyone's kind words and everyone who offered help to me. From the bottom of my heart, thank you all. ",magicTCG,1140

ALLFATHER2233,2016-07-26 20:36:37+00:00,"It's only fair, right?","I work at a logistics company and my job is to find drivers to take freight from A to B. I work with the same trucking companies a lot, but sometimes I get one-off drivers. This is one of those. 


A truck driver calls me asking about a load for the next morning coming out of Laredo TX going to Portland OR. 


TD: What is rate?


Me: We can pay $3,500 on it


TD: How about $4,000? 


Me: Sorry, customer is strict about the rate on this one. Has to be 35.


TD: Oh man, I need this. I need to get home to see my son and my wife is sick. 


Me: Then we need 35 on it. Customer will not go higher. 


The guy ends up taking it. If you think I’m being too hard on him, keep in mind there really isn’t a whole lot heading from TX&gt;OR at any given time, so I could try to get him his rate but I’d risk losing the load to another driver. If he really needs to get back, why does he want to go back and forth negotiating on price and risk it? 


The answer is because he’s full of shit. 


The next morning I get a call from the customer saying that the facility that’s receiving the freight has been changed. It’s still going to be in Portland, just in a different place. Something like a 20-30 mile difference, tops. Should be a complete non-issue, considering the driver has just started a 2,200 mile journey, so it’s a drop in the bucket. 


I call him back.


Me: Hey, just a heads up, receiver called to say that it’s going to deliver at a different address. It’s XXXX, Portland, OR


TD: Oh well, you can send me rate confirmation with little bit more money. 


Me: … What do you mean?


TD: Agreement has changed, need to renegotiate. 


Me: … seriously? It’s like a 20-30 miles difference from the original one. 


TD: 20-30 miles is kind of long way to go. 


Me: (humoring him) Okay what do you think you need for the new rate? 


TD: Ehhh, $4,000 should do it. 


*OOOOOH REALLY? THE ORIGINAL RATE YOU WANTED HUH? WOW WHAT A COINCIDENCE.* 


Me: Are you serious? 


TD: It’s only fair. 


I put the driver on hold just to spite him for trying to handle me like that, and I start working on something else. Out of curiosity, I check the address for the original delivery facility compared to the new one. Turns out the new receiver is actually 25 miles *closer* to the shipper in Laredo. New travel distance is 2,175 miles. I pick his line back up. 


Me: Hey we will change up the rate after all. 


TD: (very excited) Okay, send to me the confirmation.


Me: Okay, we ran the miles and the new receiver is actually 25 miles *closer* to Laredo, so we’re going to need to reduce the rate to $3,000. 


TD: Wha… *what are you talking about??*

Me: Well, we’re cutting 25 miles off the trip and it’s kind of a lot of miles to cut. It’s only fair, right? 


TD: Ahhh, ah hah hah hah… ahhhh so, ah that's… yeah, so $3,500 still good? 


Me: Of course it’s still good. I’m not going to change the rate by $500 because of a 25 miles difference. *I’m not an asshole.* ",pettyrevenge,5743

sjchoking,2016-06-26 22:57:36+00:00,How a 50 team NHL alignment and expansion should look be.,"Now that Las Vegas is a confirmed team the NHL will have 31 teams. To expand to 50 this is the route I would take. 

The first thing I would do is revive teams that have been defunct which are the Quebec Nordiques, Hamilton Tigers, Hartford Whalers, Kansas City Scouts, Cleveland Baron and Altanta Thrashers. 

For the next 13 expansion teams I first looked at the most populated cities that have a team in NBA, NFL, and MLB, but not the NHL which is only Houston. Then cities with at least 2 teams in NBA, NFL or MLB: San Diego, New Orleans, Baltimore, Seattle, Indianapolis. Then most populated cities with at least 1 team: Sacramento, San Antonio, Portland, Salt Lake City, Orlando, Oklahoma City. Then I threw in Saskatoon because I needed another Canadian city in the West. 

The season will be expanded to 106 games. With 4 games(2 home, 2 away) against each division opponent and 2 games(1 home, 1 away) against the other 45 teams. Also,the playoffs will be expanded to 32 teams.

For alignment of the divisions I decided to group teams into 2 Conferences(East and West) with 5 division of 5 teams within each conference. Then for divisions I grouped teams geographically and culturally and ignored some rivalries.

**West**

* Vancouver Canucks
* Calgary Flames

Discount_orgies,2016-05-06 05:29:43+00:00,I am legally migrating to The Donald,"Dear /r/the_Donald

I am filled with excitement. I am an 18 year old Oregonian attending high school in the city of Portland. Most people in this city are staunch liberals, as I once was. When I began seeing Bernie Sanders on the front page, I fully supported him. Up until a couple months ago, I would've gone to war for him. Over these months I decided to look into the commotion of Donald Trump. What I found astonished me. I found that The Donald wasn't actually a racist, and was indeed a strong, kind, and caring leader that I've always wanted. At first this confused me, but then it began to fill me with excitement. I am writing here now to tell you that I fully denounce Grandad Sagglers and his ideals. I wish only the best for this wonderful country, and Trump is truly the best. Today, I filled out the Oregon Primary ballot, where I am proud to announce that I have voted for Trump and fully commit myself to supporting his campaign. Night Night Bernie Sanders. GOOD MORNING AMERICA",The_Donald,1300
aspurofthemoment,2016-05-04 13:04:20+00:00,"To my wife, thank you","Thank you. 

Thank you for everything. Everything I have, everything I am, i owe to you. You were my light, and I cherish every moment we had together. 

I remember when we met. It was during freshman year, and I was messing around with my friends on the field. We were stupid, my friends and I, punting the ball as high as possible. It eventually was punted high into the sky, and as I ran, I managed to drag my knee into your best friend's nose. Through taking her to the sick bay, we talked, and I was smitten. 

Cue the new week. I had done some intensive math training during spring break, and had been moved up in classes. The teacher, a crazy balding eagle, was obsessed with alphabetical order, so we ended up next to each other. I was so nervous, as you were amazing. But just like that, you gave me that stunning smile of yours, and I gave you my heart. 

High school flashed by so fast. We were inseparable. Everything was great, from studying/debating in our special grassy corner of the school, to me taking my best female friend to prom and you taking your disabled friend,  and us being perfectly great with it. I remember our history trip to China, and the picture of you standing on top of the Lijiang mountains still draws such raw emotion from my heart 15 years later. 

I remember us fighting about going to different colleges. I remember us being furious with each other before making up and crying that we loved each other. We broke up to 'experience life', but my life was already complete, I just didn't know it.

I'm home. That's what I remembered. The image of you walking towards me in Portland International; long flowing hair, shriveled leather jacket, worn eyes from jet lag,  struck a cord within me. We were inseparable once more, and we married in Summer. The wedding, on the beach, was unforgettable. The way you glowed, the way you laughed as we wrestled in our wedding gear in the sand, and how we all spent the ceremony in the water. 

You were barren. That's what I remember. I held you as you shook in my arms in the office. Should we have had a child? Maybe. Maybe not. 

What I do know is that you didn't deserve what you got. You didn't deserve it at all. Diabetes Type 1. The killer. You collapsed during work and hit your neck on a table side. Your spine cracked and you lost about 90% of your basic motor functions. You passed away 4 days later.

You once told me something. It was corny as hell during our first few months as teens, but it's what stood out for me as the most significant. We climbed the local stadium's roof, and watched the sun rise. We lay under the rise of the glorius sun, and you turned to me and spoke. 
' I pray to God everyday that Death takes me first so I don't have to endure a day without you'. 

What about me? What do I do now? We had no children, no legacy? You were my soulmate. I every night wake up shaking, feeling for where you should be. You're not there. When we were apart, I knew that as long as you were happy, so was I. But now you're gone, and now, 
I feel alone. 

Thank you Sarah, for everything.

UPDATE: I just wanted to say thank you to all you people. I just came here to vent and say goodbye, and the support I got was overwhelming. It makes me hopeful to encounter people such decent, supportive people. Although I've lost someone dear to me, I know the answer; her legacy lives on with me. Your support has meant so much to me. Thank you all ",offmychest,1511
YoungModern,2016-05-04 09:43:53+00:00,"EMERGENCY!!!: Calling all exmos in the Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington area: Please get in contact and with this girl who is having a familial rejection and suicidal crisis and offer personal support and preferably a safe place to stay if possible. Upvote for visibility","**Update:** the girl [**has updated and she's ok**](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/4hvgzc/im_ok_i_think/). A big thanks to the local support who got in contact with her. I want you to get in contact with each other's social media and phone numbers for trying each other as a group *outside* of this sub so that you can form a team so that there isn't just one person who may or may not be available in case of an emergency. Offer your numbers to frakkity, and vet each other to make sure that things are kosher. 

It seems like she's living in a precarious situation and she's already been kicked out of her parents house, and faces being kicked out of her grandparents as well. She's also been blackmailed about her belongings. She's having to hide in the LGBT closet as well, which is very difficult on its own but adds to an already difficult situation. 

Don't let her slip through the cracks. Be prepared to support. 

**Original post:**

Alright /r/exmormon, it's time we put our money where our mouth is and come together act to help a vulnerable LGBT teenage adult girl in a crisis.

/u/frakkity_bye posted [**this cry for help**](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/4hthz8/someone_please_give_me_one_single_reason_to_not/) an hour ago.

&gt;someone please give me one single reason to not die : exmormon

&gt;I don't want to

&gt;But I'm not wanted where I'm living

&gt;I'm a burden to my only friend

&gt;I have no future

&gt;I'm alone

&gt;The walls are closing in on me and this time I don't know if there's a God to scream to or if there's only a void

&gt;the church didn't ever help and if I could only get on my own I'd have moved past t but I don't have the finances

&gt;I can't take another day like every single day this past week has been

&gt;I can't take the humiliation I'm being subjected to by people that are supposed to love me

&gt;I'm lost and frankly everyone would be better off if I'd never existed I'm so damned insignificant I wonder why I don't just do the brave thing and remove myself from the equation. make things easier on everyone

&gt;help please

&gt;I'm sorry I don't know where else to go you guys have been there for my transition out of hell into a new kind of hell and I just need one good reason not to give up

People in this state of mind, and especially those who have been raised in Mormon culture, feel like a burden and are too ashamed too ask for the kind of substantial, necessary help which goes beyond comforting words, and will often decline offers for substantial help.

**So if any of you stable exmos couples or single female exmos live in the Portland, Oregon or Vancouver, Washington area**, please reach out to /u/frakkity_bye and be **persistent** in **insisting** on offering a safe haven, ongoing friendship and support. If there is more than one offer from people in that region, pool yourselves together and form a crisis-team.

If you are able to offer community support, PM /u/frakkity_bye on her user page. 

If you are in contact with any of the Portland, Oregon or Vanvouver, Washington area ex-Mormon meetups, or LGBT and lesbian support groups, alert the people in the group about a vulnerable LGBT adult teen girl in need of our collective help.

Don't think because someone else has made an offer, everything is fine. Things can fall through. Get in contact with each other and make it a group effort to make sure that all of the bases are covered and that you can all pitch in when you can and ""cover shifts"" when you have the time, so to speak. 

If she deletes her post, make your own post alerting her that if she can see it, you'd like her to contact you on an offer for support.

The sub Automoderator automatically deletes Facebook posts, so make sure that you PM her your email and/or your Facebook invites so that you can connect outside of this sub. 

It's your time to shine, /r/exmormon

Please upvote for visibility

Edit Update: she is a confirmed legal adult ",exmormon,1326

master_of_chocolate,2016-04-29 18:49:24+00:00,IAmA master chocolatier. AMA anything about making sweets!,"EDIT: Thanks a million, Redditors! This was a fun experience for me outside of my kitchen. I love my job, I love my work and it never feels like work dealing with chocolate. If you ever need to change careers, you might want to consider chocolate in any form. I hope you try our chocolates one day and you might have a little more insight now on how I create the flavors. Maybe we will do this again. :) 

Greetings, Reddit! I am chef and master chocolatier Julian Rose of [Moonstruck Chocolate](http://www.moonstruckchocolate.com/), an artisan chocolate company based in Portland, Oregon. I have been making pastries, chocolates, confections and other sweets for more than three decades. I was director of the Barry Callebaut Chocolate Academy in Quebec for 8 years, a professional training center specialized in chocolate and one of only 15 such schools in the world. More than anything, I have a passion for incorporating many of the unique, gourmet flavors I discover locally and abroad – such as beer, champagne, basil or curry – into my recipes.

I’ve just returned from an international culinary festival and would love to answer any questions you have about making confections, or what it takes to become a master chocolatier. I am French Canadian and willing to answer any questions you may have in French as well! Let’s see what you’ve got, Reddit – AMA!

Since I introduced myself in the ACS AMA last year (http://redd.it/3fqnqo) , I’ll only say that I’m the Director of the [American Chemical Society’s Green Chemistry Institute](http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry.html) where we work to catalyze and enable the implementation of green chemistry and engineering throughout the global chemistry enterprise.  At the moment we’re getting ready for the 20th Annual Green Chemistry &amp; Engineering Conference, held in Portland, OR June 14-16 (http://www.gcande.org/) and I hope you can join us for what is shaping up to be a great Conference..
So, feel free to ask me anything about the current and future states of sustainable and green chemistry and engineering.  Like last year, feel free to ask me anything about how sustainable and green chemistry is implemented in industry, or how you can apply it in your research, or what challenges you’re encountering in your work as you work to implement it. 

**I will be back at 11 am ET to answer your questions, Ask me Anything!**",science,1236

A quick description of what you should expect to see below...

&amp;nbsp;

First, you should see the horizontal bar graph displaying the distribution of respondents by fandom.

Then, you will find four sets of tables and graphs for each series below:

1. A table and pie chart displaying the predicted outcome of the series among all respondents (this does not take into account series score)
2. A table and bar chart displaying the predicted outcome by series score among all respondents
3. A table and bar chart displaying the predicted outcome by series among fans of the higher seeded team
4. A table and bar chart displaying the predicted outcome by series score among fans of the lower seeded team

I have also included the head-to-head season matchup for each series at the beginning of each set of tables/charts.

Last, there will be some initial observations of the data. I welcome deeper analysis and discussion in the comments!

I apologize to mobile users in advance. I'll see what I can do in the future to make it more mobile friendly if possible. 

&amp;nbsp;

Enjoy!

momotan69,2016-04-14 05:38:46+00:00,Rise of the WWE - A timeline of Vince Mcmahon's takeover of the wrestling landscape - Part 1,"Disclaimer: I will try to be as accurate as possible. Some details may be open for debate depending on where they were sourced. 

Part 1: The Wrestling Landscape Before Vince.

In 1982, Pro Wrestling was dominated by a group of promotions with informal regional boundaries that for the most part were respected by each promoter. 

NATIONAL WRESTLING ALLIANCE

The National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) was a grouping of regional promotions. In theory membership in the NWA gave every promoter a vote on who would be the NWA world champion,  along with regular visits from this world champion to their territory. As well membership was supposed to prevent one member from encroaching on another members' territory without agreement. In the event of a ""pirate"" promotion encroaching on a given territory, all members were required to bolster the attacked territory with talent and cross promotion. Wrestlers were discouraged from working in non NWA promotions with the implied threat of being blackballed from the NWA at large. In reality the larger territories controlled the voting and bookings for the world champion, border skirmishes were frequent between members and name wrestlers were too valuable a commodity to blackball. The major NWA member promotions in 1982 were:

Mid Atlantic (Jim Crocket) - the Carolinas and Virginia
Georgia Championship Wrestling (Ole Anderson, Jim Barnet, Jerry and Jack Briscoe)
Championship Wrestling from Florida (The Grahams)
World Class Championship Wrestling (Fritz Von Erich) - Dallas
Southwest Championship Wrestling (Joe Blanchard) - San Antonio
Southeastern Championship Wrestling (Ron Fuller) - Alabama &amp; Knoxville, Tn
Pacific Northwest Wrestling (Don Owen) - Seattle and Portland
Maple Leaf Wrestling (The Tunneys) - Toronto
St Louis Wrestling Club (Bob Geigel, Pat O'Connor and Harley Race)
Central States Wrestling (Bob Geigel) - Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Iowa
Continental Wrestling Association (Jerry Jarret, Jerry Lawler) - Tennessee
Stampede Wrestling (Stu  Hart) - Alberta

Several minor NWA affiliated promotions such as All Star Wrestling (Vancouver), Superstars of Wrestling (Detroit), National Wrestling Federation (Buffalo), etc... existed as well but never hosted the NWA champion. Their affiliation was only to trade on the credibility the  NWA name implied and prevent the larger promotions from encroaching on their turf. 

MID SOUTH WRESTLING

Owned by Bill Watts, the mid south territory covered a large swath of land from New Orleans to Houston to Oklahoma City. While the NWA champion did defend his title in Mid South on a regular basis and top names in wrestling worked for Bill Watts, Mid South was an independent promotion. Upon purchasing the promotion in 1979, Bill Watts promptly pulled out of the NWA surmising that being a member was a waste of money since he controlled access to the prized New Orleans Superdome and that no other promotors would have the guts to prevent him from booking top names including the world champion. He was proven right. In 1982 he formed an alliance with Houston Wrestling promotor Paul Bosch that gave him access to the fabled Sam Houston Coliseum, a long time NWA stronghold. Mid South wrestlers would now share the ring with wrestlers from other NWA territories in Houston proving once again to Watts that he had made the right decision by dropping out of the NWA. He was getting all the benefits of being a member without the cost or politics.

AMERICAN WRESTLING ASSOCIATION

Owned by Wally Karbo and Vergne Gagne, the AWA broke away from the NWA in 1960 because the NWA board refused to give Gagne the world championship. Verne was the first to challenge the NWA control of pro wrestling and like many times after, their implied threats to blackball and not cooperate proved toothless. One of the first TV stars of Wrestling, Verne had enough power in the business to break away and suffer little consequences.  He happily made himself AWA world champion and successfully promoted the 2nd largest territory in wrestling. By 1982 he controlled a large area that included Minnesota, Illinois, Manitoba, Nebraska, Colorado, Utah and had just expanded into San Francisco, Las Vegas and Phoenix where NWA aligned promotions had failed. Respecting the unwritten rules of no encroachment on existing promotions, Vergne expanded only where there were no active promotions. The AWA also had cross promotional agreements with the CWA in Memphis, and Paul Bosch's Houston Wrestling that would produce the occasional NWA/AWA joint card. As well, the WWA in Indianapolis, International Wrestling in Montreal and Grand Prix Wrestling in atlantic Canada were affiliates of the AWA who recognized the AWA champion as their world champion. 

WORLD WRESTLING FEDERATION

The 3rd largest territorial promotion, the WWF, formerly the World Wide Wrestling Federation followed Vergne Gagne's lead and broke away from the NWA in 1963 when owner Vince McMahon Sr refused to accept the title being removed from Buddy Rogers and given back to Lou Thesz. Rogers was a big draw in the cash rich northeast that McMahon controlled and Thesz was not. With control of Madison Square Garden, Boston Gardens and the Baltimore Arena for major shows, McMahon had the clout the break free and never fear any reprisal. A little known fact is that the WWF quietly rejoined the NWA in 1971 in order to have access to the occasional appearance by the NWA champion in ""unification"" matches that would end up as 60 or 90 minute draws. By 1982 the WWF was in control of the east coast from Maryland to Maine along with New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania and were still quiet members of the NWA. Vince Sr. was ailing and his son Vince Jr. was attempting to cobble enough cash to buy out his father and their partners in the WWF parent Capitol Wrestling Corporation.


Next up Part 2: Vince lays the groundwork.

This makes up 33.5% ($48,734,847/$145,412,945) of the Clinton campaign's funding. What's the meaning though right? A lot of these funds really don't look like the kinds of interests the Sanders campaign has been talking about. ""Women's Self Worth Foundation"", ""DE Shaw Research"", ""Center for Middle East Peace"", ""Renaissance Technologies"". No big money interests here right? WRONG. Almost all of these innocuous sounding foundations represent the interests of a very select few extremely wealthy or politically aspiring people. Let's dive in shall we!

We'll start with the most insidious sounding one. #3 on our list: [Euclidean Capital](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-21/billionaire-simons-said-to-hire-ex-bofa-cio-for-family-office). Sounds kinda shady right? What's even *more* shady is that Euclidean was founded by the exact person who founded Renaissance Technologies, [James Harris ""Jim"" Simons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harris_Simons):

James Harris ""Jim"" Simons (born 1938) is an American mathematician, **hedge fund manager**, and philanthropist.

&gt; For more than two decades, Simons' Renaissance Technologies' hedge funds, which trade in markets around the world, have employed mathematical models to analyze and execute trades, many automated. **Renaissance uses computer-based models to predict price changes in financial instruments. These models are based on analyzing as much data as can be gathered, then looking for non-random movements to make predictions.**

Sounds innocent enough right? Well think again:

&gt; On July 22, 2014, Simons was subject to bipartisan condemnation by the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations for the use of complex barrier options to shield day-to-day trading (usually subject to higher ordinary income tax rates) as long-term capital gains. **“Renaissance Technologies was able to avoid paying more than $6 billion in taxes by disguising its day-to-day stock trades as long term investments,” said Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.)**, the committee’s ranking Republican, in his opening statement. “Two banks and a handful of hedge funds developed a complex financial structure to engage in highly profitable trades while claiming an unjustified lower tax rate and avoiding limits on trading with borrowed money,” said Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.) in his prepared remarks.

Not exactly the most admirable of business operations. Together, Euclidean and Renaissance contributions comprise 3.8% ($5,513,650) of Clinton's *total* campaign. Even if the average American's political contribution was $200 (it's far, far lower), that's still 27,568 times the average contribution amount.

Next let's tackle the Women's Self Worth Foundation. What could possibly be questionable about this foundation right? Well, let's take a look:

[Cheryl Saban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl_Saban), founder of the Women's Self Worth Foundation:

&gt; Playboy included her in a pictorial titled “Disco Queens. She later divorced her second husband and struggled to provide for her children.

&gt; In 1986, she accepted a job as an assistant for Israeli-American Haim Saban. Haim was an Egyptian born Jew who was raised in Israel and later moved to France where he became a millionaire selling recordings of television theme music.

Not to take anything away from Cheryl Saban but she is clearly not a self-made woman. The Women's Self Worth Foundation would not exist without Haim Saban, who just happens to be the founder of #5 on our list, Saban Capital Group.

&gt; Haim Saban is an Israeli and American media proprietor, investor, philanthropist, musician, record, film &amp; television producer.

&gt; Saban has been a generous and consistent donor to the United States Democratic Party according to his mandatory Federal Election Commission filings. Mother Jones, in an analysis of the major donors to the campaigns of 1998 election cycle, ranked Saban 155th among individual donors. **Amy Paris noted that Saban's Clinton-era ""generosity did not go unrewarded. During the Clinton administration, the entertainment executive served on the President's Export Council, advising the White House on trade issues.""The New York Times reported that Haim and his wife ""slept in the White House several times during President Clinton's two terms.""** Saban remains close friends with the former President. Clinton described Saban as a ""very good friend and supporter."" Saban contributed between $5 million to $10 million to the William J. Clinton Foundation.

My, my, my. That's a pretty cozy relationship the Saban's have with the Clintons. Together, the Sabans contribute 3.46% ($5,034,695) to the Clinton campaign. Nothing like having friends in high places! Mr. Saban also just so happens to fund this little thing called [The Center for Middle East Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Middle_East_Policy), which hosts this little thing called [The Saban Forum](http://www.brookings.edu/about/centers/middle-east-policy/saban-forums)):

&gt; On December 4 to 6, the Center for Middle East Policy at Brookings hosted its 12th annual Saban Forum, titled “Israel and the United States: Yesterday, today, and tomorrow.” The 2015 Saban Forum included webcasts featuring remarks by Israel’s Minister of Defense Moshe Ya’alon, Chairman of the Yesh Atid Party Yair Lapid, National Security Adviser to President George W. Bush Stephen Hadley, Secretary of State John Kerry, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (via video), **and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.**

If this isn't an incestuous political relationship I really don't know what is.

This leads into our next specimen, The Centre for Middle East Peace:

It was  founded by someone named [S. Daniel Abraham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Daniel_Abraham) (the creator of SlimFast):

&gt; Abraham was born and raised to an Orthodox Jewish family in Long Beach, New York. **He is frequently included in Forbes 400 list of the 400 wealthiest Americans.**

&gt; **He is a long-time donor to the Democratic Party and the Clinton Foundation.** He gave $1.5 million to the party and ranked as the number one contributor of soft money to the national parties in 2000.

&gt; Abraham is the author of the book Peace is Possible, **with a foreword by President Bill Clinton**. Abraham also published his memoirs in 2010, entitled Everything is Possible: Life and Business Lessons from a Self-Made Billionaire and the Founder of Slim Fast.

Look at that... more cozy Clinton relationships.

Closing out or group of contributors with ties to Israel we have the Pritzker Group (#4 on our list), [owned by the Pritzker Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritzker_family):

&gt; The Pritzker family is an American family of entrepreneurs and philanthropists, and one of the wealthiest families in the United States of America, being near the top of Forbes magazine’s “America’s Richest Families” list since the magazine began listings in 1982.

&gt; The family is most famous for owning the Hyatt hotel chain, and the Marmon Group, conglomerate of manufacturing and industrial service companies which has since been sold to Berkshire Hathaway. Other holdings have included the Superior Bank of Chicago, which notably collapsed in 2001, the TransUnion credit bureau and the Royal Caribbean cruise line.

The Pritzker Group isn't tied to any specific institutes or centres I could find but I just thought I would note them since they are literally one of the wealthiest families in America. [Oh and because of this this](http://blog.palestine-studies.org/2015/07/28/what-would-a-president-clinton-do/):

&gt; J.B. and M.K. Pritzker Family Foundation. The philanthropic fund of the Chicago-based Pritzker family, owners of the Hyatt hotel chain. **In 2014, the Pritzker foundation donated between $5-10 million to the Clinton Foundation.** Penny Pritzker is one of Obama’s strongest supporters, serving as his campaign finance chair in 2008 and his unofficial liaison to the pro-Israel community. For her efforts, Penny currently serves as the U.S. Secretary of Commerce. **Penny’s brother J.B. Pritzker served as the national finance chairman for Citizens for Hillary’s 2008 campaign. J.B. Pritzker’s chief of staff is Lee Rosen, who doubles as the chairman of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC).** The family has been criticized for building one of their hotels in occupied east Jerusalem following the 1967 war.

If we look at all the contributors with strong ties to Israel (including Soros), they make up 11.62% ($16,896,938) of Clinton's campaign funding.

Let's go a little farther down the list this time shall we? Sitting at #17 is [DE Shaw Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._E._Shaw_Research). Seems innocent enough right? Well this research group has ties to #6 on our list, Paloma Partners founded by [Donald Sussman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sussman), as well as JP Morgan and one of Sussman's hedge funds. Here's where things get all kinds of incestuous:

&gt; S. Donald Sussman (born June 8, 1946) is an American financier and philanthropist, the Chairman of the Board of Trust Asset Management, the founder of the Paloma Funds and New China Capital Management LLC, and a member of the Board of Trustees of Carnegie Hall. Sussman has also served on the Board of Trustees of Skidmore College, the Center for American Progress and the Portland Museum of Art.

&gt; Sussman's career in finance began in 1958, when, at the age of 12, he made a 6x return on a $300 investment in the stock of Michigan Sugar, by correctly predicting that the Cuban Revolution would disrupt sugar supplies and drive up the price of sugar commodities. Sussman went on to found Paloma Partners in 1981, a Connecticut-based hedge fund with over $3 billion in assets under management. **Paloma’s middle and back-office operations were acquired by JPMorgan Worldwide Securities Services in February 2006 for an undisclosed sum.**

&gt; Following the sale to JPMorgan, Sussman has acted as a serial investor and backer of new hedge funds such as Naseem Taleb's Empirica Capital and **David Shaw's D.E. Shaw &amp; Co.**

You guessed it. D.E. Shaw &amp; Co. is the global investment management firm behind DE Shaw Research. But wait, that's not the really incestuous part.  Remember the [Center for American Progress (CAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_American_Progress) that Sussman was on the Board of Trustees for? Well they just so happen to have had a few interesting people work for them in the past:

&gt; The president and chief executive officer of CAP is Neera Tanden, **who worked for the Obama and Clinton administrations and for Hillary Clinton’s campaigns.** The first president and CEO was **John Podesta**, who served as chief of staff to then U.S. President Bill Clinton. Podesta remained with the organization as chairman of the board until he joined the Obama White House staff in December 2013. Tom Daschle is the current chairman.

That certainly is one talented Centre.

Our next guest is [Patricia A. Stryker,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Stryker) founder of #19 on our list, the [Bohemian Foundation.](http://www.bohemianfoundation.org/) Nothing to see here right? ""Bohemian Foundation is committed to the care and enrichment of our local, national, and global communities."" Sounds innocent enough. But Stryker isn't new to politics. It seems her other company, [Stryker Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stryker_Corporation), has had a little trouble when it comes to donating to Democratic candidates in the past:

&gt; Following fraud allegations in November 2007 involving Stryker Corp. overbilling for Medicare in South Dakota, Republicans called on Democratic organizations to return donations they had received from Stryker and her brother, **Jon Stryker.**

[Jon Stryker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Stryker) is another rich, rich guy:

&gt; Jon Lloyd Stryker (born ca. 1958) is an American architect, philanthropist and activist for social and environmental causes. He is a billionaire stockholder and heir to the Stryker Corporation medical supply company fortune of grandfather Homer Stryker alongside sisters Pat and Ronda. In 2015, his net worth was estimated at $2.1 billion.

Cross another innocent sounding foundation off the list.

Our second last subject is #20 on our list, the American Federation of Teachers. How, you ask, could this possibly be questionable. Well here's the answer. The president of the American Federation of Teachers is [Randi Weingarten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randi_Weingarten):

&gt; A lifelong Democrat, Weingarten is a member of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). She was an early and critically important supporter of Howard Dean as Chairman of the DNC. **She is a superdelegate who was pledged to Hillary Clinton during the 2008 presidential primary.** In January 2009, **she was mentioned as a possible candidate in the appointment process to replace Clinton's U.S. Senate seat.**

Another cozy Clinton relationship. Those Clintons sure are popular!

Finally we have the Barbara Lee Family Foundation. I've left the least shocking for last (sorry to disappoint). [Barbara F. Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_F._Lee) is very, very pro woman politician:

&gt; Since 1999, her foundation has studied and published non-partisan research about women gubernatorial candidates. The following titles are part of the Barbara Lee Family Foundation’s Governors Guidebook Series: Keys to the Governor’s Office (1998), Speaking with Authority (2001), Cracking the Code (2002), Positioning Women to Win (2006), Leading with Authority (2008). Turning Point: The Changing Landscape for Women Candidates will be published in June, 2011. Barbara has helped elect every sitting Democratic woman governor and U.S. Senator by providing strategic advice, candidate training, direct support, and voter mobilization. Barbara frequently hosts events to raise the profile of women elected officials and candidates, such as Women’s Senate, a biennial fundraiser that provides support for progressive women Senators. In 2008, she served as the Co-Chair of the Martha Coakley for Senate Campaign and in 2004, Barbara convened Revolutionary Women, which was held in conjunction with the Democratic National Convention in Boston.

Not that there's anything wrong with that. I just found it interesting.

What's the point of all this? Well, it's simple. A whopping 17.9% ($26.0M) of Hillary Clinton's campaign contributions come from entities that are controlled, funded, owned, or otherwise heavily influenced by just 10 people (if you include Soros) and represent a very limited part of the economy (mostly hedge funds and financial sector related). And these are just the ones I had time to look into (didn't bother with Newsweb Corp because that one kinda speaks for itself in terms of sounding corporate). These 10 people directly or indirectly contribute about 961,964 times the amount of the average Bernie Sanders supporter collectively.

Oh but that's right, Hillary isn't funded by corporate interests... or [Israeli for that matter.](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/at-the-aipac-conference-trump-and-clinton-try-for-a-do-over)

&gt; Clinton’s transformation has been going on for the better part of two years. In August of 2014, in the midst of renewed violence in Gaza, she gave an interview to The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg in which she came off as a staunch defender of Israel and, at times, as a Netanyahu apologist. She made it clear that Israel could not be expected to pull its forces out completely from the West Bank in the near future. “If I were the prime minister of Israel, you’re damn right I would expect to have control over security,” she said. This amounted to backtracking not only from the official Obama line but from the parameters for peace set by Bill Clinton, which called for a withdrawal of Israeli forces within three years of an agreement. On Monday, Clinton again sought to distance herself somewhat from Obama when she said that she would “vigorously oppose” a unilateral solution put forth by the U.N. Security Council, an option that the President is said to be exploring.

DISCLAIMER: In no way am I trying to promote negativity towards the Israeli community. There is simply too great a connection here to be ignored. These donors with ties to Israel are abiding by the law and have every right to promote those who they believe will best represent their interests. Aside from how screwed up campaign finance is right now, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that in my eyes.

Edit: and of course I screw up the title of all things.

------------------------------------------------------------------



**The Future**
-------------------

To update folks on changes from last year, we have seen more clarity in the expansion process. [Atlanta United](http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/07/07/2d/a5/atlutd_icon.jpg) and Minnesota will be joining next year. [Los Angeles FC](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/685155252987809792/OZXvgFYq_400x400.jpg) will be following them in 2018. Miami is a few years behind them, but Beckham's Miami franchise is rumored to be in investment talks with Qatar Sports Investments, owners of PSG. With their help, the floundering franchise may finally start to get off the ground.

Discussion is already underway for the next round of expansion. Sacramento and San Antonio look to be the closest things to locks in this next round. Following them is St. Louis. If they can find ownership, they are virtually guaranteed a slot in MLS. The fourth and possibly finally slot is likely to be a battle between Detroit and Carolina. The former has seen some fantastic grassroots support for a local semi-professional team. The latter has two strong candidates in Raleigh and Charlotte who will be fighting to represent the state at the highest level.

------------------------------------------------------------------

**Current Format:**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MLS consists of 34 games run through the months of March to October. There are currently 20 teams that compete within the league ([listed in the comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/48dame/2016_guide_to_mls/d0ip2gl)).

While there are several unique elements to MLS, I have highlighted only a couple of the unique elements. Oddities like allocation money, the Superdraft, and re-entry draft have a relative minor impact on games and can be learned about later. I'd rather keep things relatively simple for now.

**Salary Cap:** 

The Salary Cap is one of the most unique elements of American soccer. Compared to European sports where teams can spend relatively freely, this cap provides a maximum spending limit for teams (around $3.5 million a year). The main reason this was put in place was to prevent the collapse of another American soccer league. Part of the downfall of the downfall of the North American Soccer League came teams drastically raising their spending on players to the point of financial collapse. With a cap in place, the league was able to ensure teams spend within their limits to ensure financial survival while also keeping down the price of player salaries.

In order to allow teams to grow and attract better talent, MLS passed the ""Beckham Rule"" in which teams can sign up to three designated players who contracts each exceed $457,500 (this threshold increases annually). This allows us to bring in big talent. There is the option for ""young designated players"" who are 23 or under. They have a much lower salary cap hit.

**Parity:**

The other major benefit of the salary cap is that it provides a form of parity not found in any of the other major leagues. Since MLS was founded in 1996, ten separate teams have won the MLS Cup. Only two teams (LA and D.C.) have won more than two titles. Within MLS, your team has a theoretically equal shot of winning the title as any other team within the league.

**Conferences:** 

In MLS, teams are evenly split between the Eastern and Western conference. In any given season, you play each team from the opposite conference once and teams from your own conference either twice or three times. Due to the difficulties of travel, we do not have a balanced schedule. To put this into context, the distance between Vancouver, Canada and Orlando, Florida (the two furthest teams) is 4228.1 Kilometers. The distance from Dublin, Ireland, to Jerusalem is only 4080.8 Kilometers. A balanced schedule is difficult financially for teams and takes a physical toll on the players.

**Playoffs:** 

In MLS, winning the MLS Cup is seen as more prestigious than finishing first on the table (the Supporter's Shield). Under the current format, the top 6 teams from each conference qualify for the playoffs. The playoffs can be thought of as an elimination tournament in which teams are still split between conference. The top two teams from each conference receive a ""bye"" - they are exempt from the first round of play and enter the tournament in the second round. 

The first round is a one game knockout round where the losers go home and the winners advance to face the two teams on ""bye."" 

The second round consists of two-legs much like traditional soccer tournaments. 

The two winners of the second round advance to the conference championship where they square off over two legs. 

The two conference winners then face off in the final for a single elimination match.

**Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup:** 

This tournament is named after Lamar Hunt, an owner who co-founded the North American Soccer League, was a charter investor of MLS, owned American sports teams in several leagues, and who founded and owned three MLS teams when the league began. He, also, financed the Columbus Crew's stadium, the first soccer-specific stadium built for professional soccer in America. Without his backing, MLS would never have taken off. In honor of this pioneer for American soccer, the United States Soccer Federation named the tournament and cup after him in 1999.

While MLS is a young league, many would be surprised how long the U.S. Open Cup has been in existence. This year marks the 102 year of existence for this cup. The tournament has seen several generations of American soccer dominance - from Bethlehem Steel (5 titles) in the 1910's to the Philadelphia Ukranians (4 wins) of the 1960's to the Seattle Sounders (4 wins) of the present. The tournament is open to all American teams -whether amateur, semi-pro, or professional- and the winner is guaranteed a spot in the CONCACAF Champion's League.

Note: Canadian teams do not take part in this. They compete in the the Voyageurs Cup.

**Trades:**

While transfers are the norm in the rest of the world, trades within MLS are far more common. A team may trade a player to another team for a draft pick, another player, a money, an international spot, or other incentives. The player rarely has a choice in a trade.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What's new this year?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In the off-season, MLS announced a new investment in ""general allocation money"" to go along with the ""targeted allocation money"" announced this past July. Over the next two years, MLS teams will be awarded $800,000 annually that can be used to buy down player contracts to fit within the league's salary cap. This money can also be traded for players or other forms of MLS currency.

In essence, this allows teams to sign players who normally would count as designated players and then buy down their cap hit. To make this clearer, anyone who makes over $457,500 annually in MLS counts as one of a team's three designated players. With Targeted Allocation Money (or TAM), a team can sign a player for $600,000 annually and spend $200,000 of their TAM to buy him down below DP level, saving these slots for bigger, more expensive players.

What's the purpose of this? MLS is very invested in their salary cap as a means of keeping expenditures low and maintaining parity. This new TAM allows a team to bring in better players whom might have been to expensive to fit into the salary cap previously.

Along with this, MLS announced an additional $125,000 in for Homegrown Players Funds for teams over the next two years. Homegrown players are academy signings whom do not count against the salary cap.

Yes, MLS rules are confusing and make very little sense at times.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

F.A.Q.
--------

(I can update this with new questions.)

*Why is there no relegation/promotion?*

* Unfortunately, it is not economically feasible at present. The fear is that if a team gets relegated, fans will stop coming to matches, and the owner will fold the team. The average American sports fan is used to supporting the best teams in the world at their sport (NFL, MLB, NBA, etc.). We aren't at a point yet in popularity or financial stability where the risk of promotion/relegation is worth taking. I do hope to see it within a few decades.

*Why does MLS run spring to fall?*

* It's the same reason that Scandinavia runs spring to fall. The northern part of our country gets bombarded with snow in the winter unlike most of Europe. Even in March, a handful of MLS cities are still covered in snow. This would kill attendance. Plus, we don't want to compete against the NFL, NBA, and NHL.

*Isn't MLS a retirement league?*

* Not at all. Some teams rely on signing big named and old players. For every Ashley Cole or Andrea that is signed, several young or in their prime players join the league. Of the several players who joined my team this off season, only one was 30 or above.


*Why is the Supporter's Shield less prestigious than the MLS Cup?*

* In part, America values playoffs far more than the regular season. Also, the unbalanced schedule makes it an unfair comparison between teams. Where's the fairness in playing the Union three times compared to playing LA three times? The East is typically worse than the West, meaning Eastern teams have a better shot at winning the Shield.",soccer,1761

whynotdolphins,2016-02-18 01:37:25+00:00,I went through and wrote down who every team had the opportunity to draft since 2003. Wolves fans beware.,"**The Idea**


My buddy and I were talking about how the Wolves passed up Steph Curry twice in the 2009 draft (they drafted Rubio at 5, Jonny Flynn at 6 with Steph going at 7) and how much different the Wolves would look right now. So I thought, I wonder what other teams could have had.

**The Rules**

*The player the team “should have” drafted has to be taken five spots or less later than they could’ve drafted him. This ensures the scouting opinion is consistent with the league. For example, the Wolves would much rather have Jimmy Butler (No. 30 pick in 2011 draft) than Derrick Williams (No. 2 pick in 2011), but the entire league had the opportunity to pick Butler and whiffed. So it wasn’t a case of ineptitude by the Wolves not drafting Butler, he’s just an outlier the whole league missed on.

*This isn’t a world in which the players just go to one team. Example: The Pistons drafted Chase Budinger at No. 44 in 2009 and the Wolves (I’m sorry Minnesota!) drafted Nick Calathes at No. 45. The Cavs drafted Danny Green at No. 46. In my hypothetical team building, I would give Green to both the Pistons and the Wolves, since they both had the chance to draft him. Each team exists in their own little draft universe (insert “time is a flat circle” meme).

*I’m starting with the legendary 2003 draft class because that’s just when I started following the NBA at a serious level.

*I’m just doing the first round.

*If a scrub was drafted, followed by five scrubs, I just ignored it. Or if everybody is retired.

*I’m not redoing the 2015 draft, because I don’t think rookies can be judged with less than a full season of experience. Just a personal belief.

**Keep in mind**

I know, I know. If player X went to crappy situation Y, then player X wouldn’t have developed into a good player. Each player needs the right situation to prosper. I know that. This is just meant to be a fun “ooohhh look what we could have had!” type of post. Please don’t take it too seriously and be *too* mean to me.

Ok, let’s get started. The player in parentheses is the player the team actually drafted. The number next to each player is his draft order. Bolded names are players the teams actually drafted that I couldn’t find a better replacement for. I’m starting the Wolves, because, well….

&amp;nbsp;


**Minnesota Timberwolves**

PG — Steph Curry 7 (Ricky Rubio 5)

SG — C.J. McCollum 10 (Trey Burke 9) or J.J. Redick 11 (Randy Foye 7)

Wing (I cheated, I know) — DeMar DeRozan 9 (Jonny Flynn 6) or **Andrew Wiggins 1**

PF — Tristan Thompson 4 (Derrick Williams 2) or Kenneth Faried 22 (Donatas Motiejnas 20) or **Kevin Love 5**

C —DeMarcus Cousins 5 (Wesley Johnson 4) or **Karl-Anthony Towns 1**

Bench —Ty Lawson 18 (drafted, but traded), Joakim Noah 9 (Corey Brewer 7), **Wayne Ellington 28**, **Trevor Booker 23**, C.J. McCollum 10 (Trey Burke 9), Rudy Gobert 27 (Andre Roberson 26), **Zach LaVine 13**, Leandro Barbosa 28 (Ndudi Ebi 26)

&amp;nbsp;

Wow. Could have had Boogie and Steph very easily (they were taken IMMEDIATELY after the Wolves picks). This is my favorite what-if team. I let it be a dealer’s choice for SG and PF. Whatever style you prefer to run would dictate which one you start. I do that a lot with other teams in the list, too.

Now I’ll go in the reverse order of the worst records of this year’s teams.

&amp;nbsp;


**Philadelphia 76ers**

PG — **Jrue Holiday 17**

SG — 

SF — Giannis Antetokounmpo 15 (Michael Carter-Williams 11) or **Andre Iguodala 9**

PF — Jared Dudley 22 (Daequan Cook 21) or **Thad Young 12**

C — DeMarcus Cousins 5 (Evan Turner 2)

Bench — **Nikola Vucevic 16**, **Joel Embiid 3 (who the hell knows???)**, **Dario Saric 12 (same)**, Evan Fournier 20 (Mo Harkless 15), **Mo Speights 16**

&amp;nbsp;

**Los Angeles Lakers**

PG — **D'Angelo Russell 2**

SG —

SF — Jared Dudley 22 (Javaris Crittenton 19)

PF — **Julius Randle 7**

C — **Andrew Bynum 10**

Bench — Leandro Barbosa 28 (Brian Cook 24), **Jordan Farmar 26**

Holy hell, the Lakers haven’t drafted a lot since 2003. Really no big missed opportunities.

&amp;nbsp;

**Brooklyn/New Jersey Nets**

PG — Kyle Lowry 24 (Josh Boone 23)

SG — Jimmy Butler 30 (JaJuan Johnson 27, traded to Boston)

SF —

I had completely forgotten about Mouhamed Sene. The only think I know about him is a joke Bill Simmons made in his draft diary column about how Ray Allen poured another glass of scotch upon seeing his team draft a player that wouldn’t help him.

&amp;nbsp;

edit: Added Golden State upon the request of several. Because sure, they need Reddick and PG, too.

&amp;nbsp;

edit 2: I've seen a lot of ""We didn't draft X"" comments. What I tried to do was say each team had the chance to draft some player, but they didn't. So the Celtics came away with Kelly Olynyk, the 13th pick in the draft (via trade from Dallas) so they technically didn't draft him, but they still came away with the 13th pick in the draft and they *could* have had something else. Hope that reasoning makes sense.

&amp;nbsp;

edit 3: added Spurs and Thunder &amp; correct Eric Maynor. He was not the No. 2 pick in the draft.",nba,1318
shnts07,2016-02-17 19:05:12+00:00,My Pitch to Become The Next GM of the Nets,"*smooths out very obviously cheap suit*

Good evening Mr. Prokhorov,

My name is shnts07, and while I might be a Boston Celtics fan, I live in Brooklyn and I’m willing to put that shamrock on the backburner to become the very next…

*clicks to move to powerpoint slide of a crappy MS paint shop of me behind a Brooklyn Nets emblazoned desk*

Brooklyn Nets GM!

Now, I know you might be thinking that “Heck, I’ve been burned before, how do I know you will take the job?” The good news, for you is, that I am **very** poor and will definitely take the job. I have no other prospects, so you could pay me a very uncompetitive wage and I would still take the job.

What would I do in my tenure as Brooklyn Nets GM?

Great question, I have a four pronged plan get us out of this pickless purgatory and return the Nets to umm… glory. The first point is.


*****

###1. It’s going to get worse before it gets better

It’s very important you understand this. I know my flair/demeanor/admitted Celtic’s fandom may make you distrust my motives, but I assure you that I’ve looked at this situation a ton of ways, and the fact for the matter is that we can’t afford to pay a premium to save face. I know we don’t have any incentive to tank, but we do have incentive to get younger and plan for the next time we will be able to be competitive which will be after 2019. Yes men might walk through that door and try to sell you on cap room and big name free agents, but everyone will have cap room and while there will be people who want to play in Brooklyn, it won’t be those generational guys who really move the needle.

It’s not ideal to be laughed at by the league when we fork over high lottery picks to the Celtics, but if we get younger and develop young talent, there’s a good chance we could actually lessen the value of those 2017 and 2018 picks that we are losing  and regain that “embarrassment factor” on the back end. But it’s very important that you understand the very clear and distinct ceiling for this team as is and understand that the value of dealing Lopez and Young at the peak of their value. That might not be right now, or before the deadline, but it’s definitely soon, and it’s definitely not going to be on the next iteration of “the Great Nets Team”. 

This is the real talk that you need to hear. Before I take this job, I need you to let go of the idea that this team will be competitive in a meaningful way in the next 3 years. It won’t. The sooner you understand that and internalize it, the sooner we can stop making desperate moves and afford to patient and opportunistic. Today’s fans are smart, the Barclays center is cool and valuable, the new practice facility is dope, and the Nets are going to be a premier franchise when this shit gets worked out. 2-3 years of patience will reap rewards that are going to blossom well into the future. I’ll make us competitive in the mean time if it happens organically, but it is going to be at the bottom of my Maslow-ian pyramid for “Nets rebuilding”. I refuse to prioritize at the cost of future assets.

Now, that we’ve got the “why” out of the way, let’s get to the how.

###2. I’m going to Hinkie without first round draft picks.

Hinkie got demoted to the point where he now answers to Jerry Colangelo. That said, it’s tough to argue with the treasure trove of assets he compiled. The Sixers FO didn’t have good luck by any stretch of the imagination, and it’s tough to not let that color how “The Process” unfolded. However, I think there are practical cap maneuvers that the Hinkie administration built on that we can exploit if we shift our paradigm from “desperate win-now” team to “asset gathering team”. A highly criticized part of the Hinkie administration was what was known as “the Hinkie special”, non-guaranteed four year minimum deals that 2nd round picks were forced to take virtually at gun-point. It alienated agents and players against a franchise that should have the Mecca for young fringe players trying to make a name for themselves. We can now be that team who finds the Lavoy Allens and the Robert Covingtons. 

You’ve said that you are willing to pay Mr. Prokhorov, so what’s a couple extra million at the bottom of the barrel? I say we offer “Hinkie specials”, but with the caveat that we pay above the minimum in ways that endear us to the agents. Maybe we take care of fringe guy here and now, while we have the opportunity, offering promising guys something not unlike what the Celtics offered Jordan Mickey, guaranteeing a year or two early on some of the more talented, and then that goodwill might help us in the future when it’s time to go big game hunting.

The catch there, it we don’t have second round draft picks, but guess what?

###3. I’m going to make us this year’s Portland and the last three years’ Philly

The cap jump is coming, and everyone’s scared because they don’t know what it means. I’m here to tell you that I’m flexible and I’m not going to be intimidated but the upcoming changes. Apparently, everyone’s going to have cap room, so cap room is going to be less valuable. That’s still not a reason to write of the merits of having cap room completely. For one, if we have it and don’t use it, I can save you money. Even if it means waiting until the deadline to try to hit the salary floor, even that will save you money [given the prorated nature of traded contracts and how the floor is calculated](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/40y5jk/dodging_the_salary_floor_with_david_lee_and_the/).

Even after the two big salary jumps in 2016 and 2017, the cap is going to come back down in 2018, and I’m willing to bet that some teams are going to sober up that year and find themselves in bed with a contract that looked a lot sexier the year before. Also the new CBA is coming, and who knows what player maximums will look like given the new appearingly capable leadership of the NBAPA in Michelle Roberts. It might behoove us in the pursuit of veteran FA to have a lot of cap space, and you can add that on top of the fact that it provides oppurtunity cost and literally costs nothing.

I’m going to leverage that space to be the third team in deals, and be the place that helps teams like Chicago and Miami get under the tax. This CBA’s repeater penalties are gonna really start hitting some teams hard, and I want to be there when teams like the Clipper and Cavs realize they have to make some cuts. It’s the easiest way to recoup picks without shipping out talent, and I can sell those over the cap teams on letting us in on three-teamers by creating valuable TPEs by taking players into cap space. That helps team’s get under the tax, but still maintain that wiggle room for improvement.  For example, if we had the space I”m promising to get us this offseason, I’d be on the phone with the clips about taking Lance Stephenson, and the Bulls about absorbing Noah.

Again, supposedly this cap space isn’t going to be valuable because everyone will have it. But my stance is more of a “believe it when I see it”. Let’s see what everyone does this free agency and not make any dumb moves. If we don’t create any messes we can get paid to clean up those of others.

###4. We don’t need to deal Brook Lopez or Thad Young until the right deal comes along.

Things change quickly in the NBA, and I’m not going to be pressured into a pu-pu platter of bad picks for Lopez or Young just because that’s the only deals on the market right now. When the cap jumps happen, some team is going to need to make a splash, and both Young and Lopez will be on deals that aren’t as onerous as those of the incoming FA class. I’m not dealing Young unless I get a mid-first, and I’m not dealing Lopez without multiple top 20 firsts coming back. Cooler heads need to prevail when you are rebuilding and I’ll be ice cold.

*slideshow ends*

Thank you very much, my name is shnts07 and i’d be happy to be your new GM. You know I’m the right choice.

*new slideshow begins titled “Is Amy Cheating on Sonic with Shadow canon?”*

Uhhh, wait, no.

Uhh stop, kill the power.

IMNEWTOSTREETWEAR,2016-02-07 19:29:23+00:00,List of a couple of inspo albums,"Hi guys, as you guys saw, /u/nudie made an inspo thread. I made this huge list of some of the inspo albums and I thought I should make a text post just in case you missed it or if the commentsection is a too small place too read all of the albums so I decided to make a huge list which I update as often as I can and I sorted all the albums after the alphabet. If you want to add your inspo album or any other inspo album comment it with title and link. If you want to keep updated save or bookmark this thread. I'm going to do a new one in probably half a year, just after the thread has been archived. So finish with the unnecessary text, here are the albums.

Most will also offer a free (or cheap, depending on the company) energy checkup, rebates for installing efficient appliances, and rebates for recycling old appliances, among other things.

* 8 100w-equvalent standard LEDs
* 4 recessed LEDs
* 2 high-efficiency showerheads
* 4 low-flow faucet aerators

A single 100 watt equivalent LED will run you about $14 on Amazon, the recessed ones are even more expensive, and showerheads/aerators aren't exactly cheap either. You do the math.

The list goes on... I'm sure you get the idea. If your utility isn't listed, it's not because it doesn't offer this, it's just because I got lazy. 

Try entering something like ""[your utility] free light bulbs"" into Google and see what comes up. Also try seeing if your area has an ""energy trust"" that administers this program, like the Energy Trust of Oregon for the Portland area. 

And don't get discouraged if yours doesn't offer this right now. A lot of utilities do this on a rolling basis so they can run studies about adoption. Don't forget to check for rebates as well. ",Frugal,1744

The list goes on... I'm sure you get the idea. If your utility isn't listed, it's not because it doesn't offer this, it's just because I got lazy. 

Try entering something like ""[your utility] free light bulbs"" into Google and see what comes up. Also try seeing if your area has an ""energy trust"" that administers this program, like the Energy Trust of Oregon for the Portland area. 

And don't get discouraged if yours doesn't offer this right now. A lot of utilities do this on a rolling basis so they can run studies about adoption. Don't forget to check for rebates as well.

LamarMatic,2015-11-16 22:06:50+00:00,"Hornets used to run ""Short"" for Gerald Henderson alley-oops. After him being traded, Lamb has been the recipient of it. Last night Hendo returned to CHA for first time, saw the play within 4 secs and tried to disrupt it. [lamarmatic.com]","A quick blog post on former Hornet/Bobcat Gerald Henderson returning to Charlotte, checking in the game and within four seconds facing an out-of-bounds play which we ran specifically for him numerous times over the last couple of years.

**The Hornets “Short” Play**

If my memory/research serves me correctly this out-of-bounds play, which our players and coaches refer to as “Short”, was brought over by Steve Clifford’s coaching staff. I’ve questioned myself previously about this (suggesting that it, perhaps, is the work of assistant coach Stephen Silas) but I haven’t been able to find the play executed before the 2013-14 season. That would be the season when coach Clifford, his associate head coach Patrick Ewing and assistants Bob Weiss, Bob Beyer (now in Detroit) and Mark Price (now with NCAA’s Charlotte 49ers) first started working here.

Despite opposing squads constantly getting burnt by it, the play is actually quite simple.

It starts off with some misdirection action as a big (in this case Al Jefferson) cuts from one side of the paint to the other one. In the perfect scenario, where the big is actually on his assignment (like Marcin Gortat) and not sagging off to bother passing lanes, the designated player of “Short” (in this case Henderson) sets a cross-screen for him and thus gives the defense even more reason to believe that Jefferson should be under supervision:

https://lamarmatic.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/hendo1.png?w=547

Henderson then supposedly continues his movement towards the three-point line, while the other big (in this case Josh McRoberts) is already looming to set a screen:

https://lamarmatic.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/hendo2.png?w=547

Only for Hendo to make a sharp turn to his left and curl around McBob’s screen, while his man (Trevor Ariza) is still dedicated to follow him:

https://lamarmatic.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/hendo3.png?w=547

The man in Gortat’s role is hopefully somewhat concerned by the Jefferson cut and thus doesn’t pay any mind. The player who chased Henderson is in no man’s land after committing to track him. And the defender of the screen setter (Trevor Booker), to be honest, is usually oblivious to the fact that anything is going on:

https://lamarmatic.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/hendo4.png?w=547

In Booker’s defense though, that’s a tough spot to be in. Unless you fully know what is going on, you have to out-jump Henderson with your back to the basket from a stand-still, while he has the benefit of being in motion.

Hendo’s prefer-ability of jumping off two feet and his explosiveness made him the perfect target for “Short” as he completed a few beauties for coach Clifford in those two last seasons:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY7edn1CWa0

(It’s a real shame that some broadcasts didn’t fully capture this play.)

**Jeremy Lamb – The New Recipient of “Short”**

Flash-forward to the present season. Henderson has been traded and there is an opening for the position of alley-oop dunking off “Short” if you’re up to it.

For some reason, we firstly tried out Jeremy Lin, someone you don’t exactly associate with finishing alley-oop plays. It ended badly.

https://lamarmatic.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/insta2.gif?w=547

Although in his defense, another former Charlottean in Josh McRoberts deserves credit for notifying Justise Winslow of what is about to happen and to go under the screen. I’m scared to think about what would have happened if this were Hendo and he attempted a poster dunk on Winslow.

Either way, Jeremy Lin failed the audition and Lamb was up next. Up until last night’s Portland game he was 2 for 2 on “Short” opportunities by laying in some difficult looks with the help of his lanky body:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LabZAsByIuc

**Hendo Tries to Ruin “Short”**

Said night was Gerald Henderson’s first game in Charlotte as a member of a visiting NBA team.

Hendo, being 6th in games played and 9th in points scored for the franchise (and also just a hard-working professional during his time here), received a tribute montage on the jumbotron during the first time-out.

The guard then checked in the game with :06.9 left in the first quarter to a warm reception and ironically within 4 seconds of playing time faced the out-of-bounds play, which once was his specifically designed for him and was his meal ticket for a cool NBA highlight.

Hendo, just like McRoberts earlier in the pre-season, instantly knew what was bound to happen and the broadcast even caught him depicting the play for his younger team-mates:

https://lamarmatic.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/vlcsnap-2015-11-16-23h03m27s107.png?w=547

Only this time around Nicolas Batum was the one getting his first shot at “Short”…

Touche!

Great read by Batum who has played some great basketball as of late.

Agnostix,2015-10-05 16:28:15+00:00,I quit my corporate job to play guitar full time. Here's a rundown of how it all turned out...,"Hi /r/guitar! 

You might remember me from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/2vblfv/i_am_quitting_my_corporate_job_to_play_guitar_on/), in which I announced that I was quitting my salaried job to be a full-time, solo guitarist.

Well, I did what I said I was going to do, and I'm here to tell you how it all went. If you ever wondered what it would be like to 'follow your dream' of playing guitar for a living, this post might be of interest to you. Or, if you're just curious about ""whatever happened to that guy who fucked up his career to play guitar"", then read on.

On February 23rd of this year, I submitted my resignation. I had been in the business-to-business sales industry for about 15 years at that point, and I was so OVER IT that quitting was actually really freaking easy. The liberation and exaltation was almost palpable, and I still have a crisp memory of exactly the moment when I handed over the physical letter to my boss. He took it fairly well, and when he asked me what I was going to do next, I simply said:

""Well, I'm heading out next week to drive across the country playing guitar music on the street in public places.""

...you know that look that people give you when they *genuinely* think you're crazy? Yea, I got that look. And in fact, every other time I told the people in my life what I was doing, I got a similar look. One thing I learned though, is that there was a small handful of people who *didn't* give me that look; instead they beamed a HUGE smile and said, ""WHOAH!! That's fucking AWESOME!!"". 

Those people happened to be my truest friends. This would be just one of the valuable lessons I would learn over the next few months. 

If you look at my post history, you'll see that I traveled around the US a fair amount. I played music on the street in the following cities:

Taos, NM

Santa Fe, NM

Albuquerque, NM

Phoenix, AZ

San Diego, CA

Santa Monica, CA

Venice Beach, CA

Monterrey, CA

San Francisco, CA

Eugene, OR

Portland, OR

Seattle, WA

...and a few smaller stops along the way. It was actually a pretty extensive 'west coast tour', and it took about two and a half months to complete. 

So what exactly was I playing? Well, I'm a loop guitarist. I use a Flashback X4 looper to create soundscapes that I then use to solo - here's an example of such: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bbX9mtkRbY . I essentially took my show 'on the road' and completely neglected my 'professional career' to do it. 

So. 

How did it all go, now that it's over? 

Well, I can safely say that these past 8 months have been the most growth-filled as well as the most expensive months of my entire life. I spent about half of my cash savings (near $7k) *JUST* to fund this trip, which was all by car. Watching my bank account dwindle month after month was truly humbling. 

But for what I paid for in spent savings, I made up for in incredible experiences. I met some of the most amazing people and had some of the most amazing things happen to me on the road that I could likely write a book JUST on touring California. The entire journey was THAT PACKED with remarkable events. 

As I sit here reminiscing, I can't help but get a little teary eyed...it's all good stuff. Expensive, but good stuff. 

I mean, I sometimes find it hard to believe, even myself: I packed my car and drove solo around the country and played guitar music in the street for strangers and THEY PAID ME. 

...they paid me really well. And if some mechanical bullshit didn't go down with my car, I could have probably stayed on the road ANOTHER few months touring the East (which was, after all, my initial goal). 

I want to emphasize the value of doing something like this, because I don't think it can be overstated. If you truly believe that playing music is what you want to do with your life (even if it's just for a few months), then do it. 

Don't wait until you're 40 and regretful. Do it now. It might be a bit spendy and you may find yourself scraping just to get by, but I swear to you that the character you will build and the life story you will create will be something to truly behold. 

...So then. How exactly does this story end?

Well, I got a job. And yes, it's in sales. I found a company that provides a product that I really enjoy selling, and I guess you could say I'm 'back in the game', in that respect. 

But you know? It's been a wild ride. And even though I'm a little thinner in the wallet, my passion for making music has grown beyond measure. 

Thanks for reading, guys. :)

Duckrauhl,2015-09-26 00:09:18+00:00,"Two days ago, my girlfriend's bike was stolen in downtown Seattle. She was devastated. With little hope, I set out today to see if I could track it down and get it back for her while she was at work. I succeeded.","My girlfriend commutes to downtown Seattle by bike and locks her ride to a bike rack on the sidewalk. Her work does not have any room for bikes inside so she has no choice but to lock it up outside.

When she got off work around 8:30p a couple days ago, she discovered her chain lock had been cut and her bike was gone. The cut chain was left at the scene. She then called me to break this news to me and to ask for a ride home.

She was too upset when we got home to do anything progressive about it that night so I went online to file the police report and list her bike as stolen on BikeIndex.org and Bikeshepherd.org. I also set up auto notifications on Craigslist (Seattle and Portland) and eBay for new posts for bikes of her type.


Today I set out to ride around to every pawn shop and police station in downtown and the surrounding areas to ask if they had seen her bike and to keep a lookout for it. I was even going to ride up to the bicycle cops that ride around downtown to show them pictures and ask them to possibly keep an extra eye out for it.

A few hours into my mission, I received a call for a King County Sheriff's Deputy saying that **one of his officers recovered my girlfriend's bike!** He said that the officer saw my post I made on BikeIndex.org and just happen to recognized the bike when she saw two people walking it on the sidewalk in downtown. She confronted the couple with the bike and told them it matched the description of a stolen bike in the area. The couple told her that they were ""watching the bike for a friend"". She asked to see the serial number on the frame and it matched the serial number I posted online so she confiscated the bike from the couple.

The Deputy then gave me a call and said that they had my bike down at the station and I could come claim it. I was jumping up and down on the sidewalk after I took that call.

As fast as I could I rode my bike back home and then ubered to the station to claim her bike. I claimed her bike and rode it back home to surprise her. I put her bike in our bedroom, closed the door and made no mention of it when she got home from work.

She eventually got home, hung out with me on the couch for a while and talked about her day. After an hour or so, she migrated to our bedroom to change and quickly came running back ecstatic and jumped into my arms.

I've never seen her so happy before so I knew I had to share this story and thank the hard working officers of the King County Sheriff's Office. Without their diligence and hard work, this would not have been possible.

Thank you King County Sheriff's Office for helping me give my girlfriend the best surprise I've ever given anybody. Your work truly goes unnoticed and underappreciated. Stay safe out there.

[deleted],2015-04-14 21:19:05+00:00,My sister killed on her mission by the Mission President's Wife in Portland,"I have been debating on whether to post this or not. It's obviously a sensitive issue. I decided that I want to do whatever I can to warn other families that these conditions exist out in the mission field. My sister was enjoying her mission in Portland last summer. After receiving some needed dental surgery she was sent back to work being a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The dentist warned her to contact a doctor if she felt unwell because infection was an unlikely but real risk. When my hard working sister began to have pain in her mouth she sought permission to see a doctor through the mission president's wife. This is world-wide protocol for missionaries. You aren't supposed to seek medical help without permission from your mission president.  My sister's request was denied. She was told to take some aspirin and continue the work. My sister asked to see a doctor three times over the curse of 2 weeks. Each time her request denied. My sister reached out to us, her family, through her weekly emails asking us what we thought she should do because she was in pain. Many of us told her to please go to the doctor right away. But, our Mom encouraged her to be obedient to the mission president's rules. Anyone who is familiar with the mission field rules knows that obedience without question is drilled into young missionaries minds. My sister chose to do what the mission president's wife instructed. Maybe she believed that the mission president and wife were led by spiritual inspiration. Maybe my sister thought she would be going against God by going to the doctor. Maybe my sister was just scared. Finally, the pain got so bad to handle that my sisters mission companion took her to the emergency room. Infection had taken hold of my sisters body. She was septic and admitted into the hospital for 2 days being treated with antibiotics through an IV. We didn't know if she would survive that first night. She seemed to be doing much better after medical intervention and her doctors released her from the hospital. But the infection had held on too strong. Within 48 hours of being released from the hospital, my sister passed away in her missionary apartment bed while she was asleep. She died from infection because her mission president and his wife wouldn't allow her to see a doctor when she was in pain. 
    My brothers went to Portland and confronted the mission president and his wife. They were extremely defensive and they yelled at my brothers to leave them alone. Some of us in the family want to press charges. It is difficult to go against the church. They can pay for very skilled lawyers. Our mom doesn't want to pursue any action against the mission president because she believes that maybe it was God's will. 
       I don't agree. ",exmormon,2081

**History:**
-------------------------------------------------------------------


In order to bring the World Cup to the United States, the United States Soccer Federation agreed in 1988 to bring a new professional soccer league to the country. The league began play in 1996 with 10 teams in a season in which D.C. United won the opening title. ([Check out these hideous 1990's jerseys)](http://www.dcunited.com/sites/dc/files/image_nodes/2013/10/96mls_uniforms.jpg). The teams were:

* Colorado Rapids
* Columbus Crew
* D.C. United
* Dallas Burn (now F.C. Dallas)
* Kansas City Wiz (now Sporting Kansas City)
* Los Angeles Galaxy
* New England Revolution
* NY/NJ Metro Stars (sadly now New York Red Bulls)
* San Jose Clash (now San Jose Earthquakes)
* Tampa Bay Mutiny (notably owned by the Glazers who now own Man U)

The Chicago Fire joined the league in 1998 alongside the Miami Fusion in a season in which the Chicago newcomers won the MLS Cup as well as the US Open Cup. The following year (1999), Columbus opened their stadium, the first professional soccer-specific stadium in America, at a time when teams were sharing the facilities of other professional sports teams within America.

However, hard times fell on MLS in 2002 when the league was forced to fold Miami and Tampa Bay in order to save money, having lost an estimated $250 million in the league's first five years of existence. Despite this set back, the league continued to grow as Chivas USA and Real Salt Lake entered the league in 2005. In 2006, the San Jose Earthquakes relocated to Houston and were renamed Houston Dynamo.

In 2007, David Beckham shocked the American soccer world by arriving in LA. That same year, Toronto FC became the first Canadian team to enter the league. Their entrance more or less marked the beginning of supporters' culture within the league as the team played to a sold out crowd of passionate adults despite a lackluster performance on the field. 

San Jose re-entered the league in 2008, retaining the name and legacy of the previous San Jose Earthquakes. From this point on, MLS began expanding more rapidly into cities with ravenous soccer support. Seattle Sounders entered the league in 2009 and set a new standard for fan support with their legions of supporters. Philadelphia Union joined the following years and helped establish supporter culture on the East Coast through the rowdy supporters' group the Sons of Ben (SoBs). Portland Timbers and Vancouver Whitecaps joined in 2011, expanding the new supporters phenomena further while create a fierce rivalry with Seattle (the Cascadia Cup). Montreal Impact immediately followed in 2012.

The arrival of Clint Dempsey in 2013 marked the beginning of a major return of American players that includes Michael Bradley (Toronto), Jozy Altidore (Toronto), Maurice Edu (Philadelphia), Jermaine Jones (New England), DeMarcus Beasley (Houston), and several other national team players have returned to the league, with many in their prime.

In the world of expansions, New York City and Orlando City begin play this year and look set to raise the standards of expansion teams. New York City has brought in David Villa, Frank Lampard, and Mix Diskerud while Orlando has silently brought in a very solid team around playmaker Kaka. City brings unprecedented wealth to the league while Orlando seems set to have a great fan base and a strong Brazilian presence. On the flip side, Chivas USA folded this year after a tumultuous period in MLS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Future**
-------------------

As for the future, Atlanta and a new LA team are set to join the league in 2017 while Miami is a likely candidate to join shortly after. Sacramento and Minnesota are battling for the final expansion spot this round after unprecedented success in the lower leagues. San Antonio, Indianapolis, Las Vegas, and Jacksonville look set to battle it out for future expansion spots.

Now is a fantastic time to begin following the league as it continues to grow at an amazing rate.

------------------------------------------------------------------

**Current Format:**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MLS consists of 34 games run through the months of March to October. There are currently 20 teams that compete within the league (listed in the comments).

While there are several unique elements to MLS, I have highlighted only a couple of the unique elements. Oddities like allocation money, the Superdraft, and re-entry draft have a relative minor impact on games and can be learned about later. I'd rather keep things relatively simple for now.

**Salary Cap:** The Salary Cap is one of the most unique elements of American soccer. Compared to European sports where teams can spend relatively freely, this cap provides a maximum spending limit for teams ($3.1 million a year). The main reason this was put in place was to prevent the collapse of another American soccer league. Part of the downfall of the downfall of the North American Soccer League came teams drastically raising their spending on players to the point of financial collapse. With a cap in place, the league was able to ensure teams spend within their limits to ensure financial survival while also keeping down the price of player salaries.

In order to allow teams to grow and attract better talent, MLS passed the ""Beckham Rule"" in which teams can sign up to three designated players who contracts each exceed $350,000. This allows us to bring in big talent. There is the option for ""young designated players"" who are 23 or under.

The Players' Union and MLS are currently under negotiation for a new Collective Bargaining Agreement which will likely see a significant increase in the cap starting this year.

**Parity:**

The other major benefit of the salary cap is that it provides a form of parity not found in any of the other major leagues. Spain is primarily a contest between the top two teams with Atletico sneaking in occasionally. The EPL is a contest mostly between five teams. The Bundesliga has now entered an era of dominance by Bayern. 

Since MLS was founded in 1996, nine separate teams have won the MLS Cup. Only two teams (LA and D.C.) have won more than two titles. Within MLS, your team has a theoretically equal shot of winning the title as any other team within the league. In comparison to other leagues, you do not have to accept your team being forever midtable. D.C. United is the best example of this parity. In 2013, D.C. finished at the bottom of the table as by far the worst team in the league. The following year, United rebuilt heavily and finished on the top of the Eastern Conference.

**Conferences:** 

In MLS, teams are evenly split between the Eastern and Western conference. In any given season, you play each team from the opposite conference once and teams from your own conference either twice or three times. Due to the difficulties of travel, we do not have a balanced schedule. To put this into context, the distance between Vancouver, Canada and Orlando, Florida (the two furthest teams) is 4228.1 Kilometers. The distance from Dublin, Ireland, to Jerusalem is only 4080.8 Kilometers. A balanced schedule is difficult financially for teams and takes a physical toll on the players.

**Playoffs:** 

In MLS, winning the MLS Cup is seen as more prestigious than finishing first on the table (The Supporter's Shield.) Under the current format, the top 6 teams from each conference qualify for the playoffs. The playoffs can be thought of as an elimination tournament in which teams are still split between conference. The top two teams from each conference receive a ""bye"" - they are exempt from the first round of play and enter the tournament in the second round. 

The first round is a one game knockout round where the losers go home and the winners advance to face the two teams on ""bye."" 

The second round consists of two-legs much like traditional soccer tournaments. 

The two winners of the second round advance to the conference championship where they square off over two legs. 

The two conference winners then face off in the final for a single elimination match.

**Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup:** 

This tournament is named after Lamar Hunt, an owner who co-founded the North American Soccer League, was a charter investor of MLS, owned American sports teams in several leagues, and who founded and owned three MLS teams when the league began. He, also, financed the Columbus Crew's stadium, the first soccer-specific stadium built for professional soccer in America. Without his backing, MLS would never have taken off. In honor of this pioneer for American soccer, the United States Soccer Federation named the tournament and cup after him in 1999.

While MLS is a young league, many would be surprised how long the U.S. Open Cup has been in existence. This year marks the 102 year of existence for this cup. The tournament has seen several generations of American soccer dominance - from Bethlehem Steel (5 titles) in the 1910's to the Philadelphia Ukranians (4 wins) of the 1960's to the Seattle Sounders (4 wins) of the present. The tournament is open to all American teams -whether amateur, semi-pro, or professional- and the winner is guaranteed a spot in the CONCACAF Champion's League.

Note: Canadian teams do not take part in this. They compete in the The Voyageurs Cup.

**Trades:**

While transfers are the norm in the rest of the world, trades within MLS are far more common. A team may trade a player to another team for a draft pick, another player, a money, an international spot, or other incentives. The player rarely has a choice in a trade.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

F.A.Q.
--------

(I can update this with new questions.)

*Why is there no relegation/promotion?*

* Unfortunately, it is not economically feasible at present. The fear is that if a team gets relegated, fans will stop coming to matches, and the owner will fold the team. The average American sports fan is used to supporting the best teams in the world at their sport (NFL, MLB, NBA, etc.). We aren't at a point yet in popularity or financial stability where the risk of promotion/relegation is worth taking. I do hope to see it within a few decades.

*Why does MLS run spring to fall?*

* It's the same reason that Scandinavia runs spring to fall. The northern part of our country gets bombarded with snow in the winter unlike most of Europe. These past two weeks, my state got around 15 inches or so of snow. Even in March, a handful of MLS cities are still covered in snow. This would kill attendance. Plus, we don't want to compete against the NFL, NBA, and NHL (credit to /u/hatetom for this point).

*Isn't MLS a retirement league?*

* Not at all. Some teams rely on signing big named and old players. However, others are quietly bringing in young players. For example, my team (Philadelphia) signed a 23 year old Venezuelan striker on loan from France. Other teams like New England build their team around youth. Very few teams in MLS build around aging has-beens.

*The players are going to strike?*

* Players are seeking a raise in minimum wage ($36,500 a year) and free agency. Under MLS, players do not have the option to freely sign with any team they wish when without a contract. Plus, they can be traded against their will. These are the two major demands from players.

*Who plays possession football?*

* No team necessarily plays the heavy possession found in top European teams. However, Real Salt Lake, Portland, and New England focus on positive soccer that often relies heavily on possession. Off the top of my head, Vancouver, Seattle, and Dallas also play free-flowing soccer that is fun to watch.

*Who has the best youth systems?*

* I would give that to LA, Philadelphia, and Dallas. LA and Dallas have brought along a lot of good talent into their team through their academy. Gyasi Zardes, one of LA's top players, came through the academy and the team. Since Philly is only 6 years old, there has not been enough time to see the academy bear any fruit. However, the team has created proactive steps such as building a high school for their players to allow them to play more often. Plus, Rene Meulensteen was brought on in the short-term to, among other duties, assess the effectiveness of our academy.

*Who has the best fan support?*

* The obvious answer is Seattle with an average attendance of 43,734. However, they do benefit from playing in a football stadium with a capacity of 67,000 and being one of only two major sports teams in Seattle worth watching. Outside of Seattle, Portland, Kansas City, Toronto, and Philadelphia have absolutely fantastic support.

*How can I watch MLS?*

* MLS has a list of channels that broadcast games abroad [here.](http://www.mlssoccer.com/international-tv-listings) Otherwise, there are always streams.",soccer,3253
Agnostix,2015-02-09 18:05:10+00:00,I am quitting my corporate job to play guitar on the streets in cities across America. This is going to be intense.,"I am a 35 year old male who, for the past 15 years, has worked a steady, salaried job for some company or another. Playing guitar has been more of a hobby than anything else - until now. 

You might remember a post I put up last year about being pulled onstage with Robert Randolph after he heard me playing in an alley in Denver, Colorado ( [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/206b29/im_a_street_guitarist_who_recently_got_pulled/) ). Since then, I have had this gnawing urge to pursue public performance as a profession. I have made incredible strides during the past 5 years of doing street performance, but I never really had the balls to forego the stability of my corporate gig in favor of pursuing my dream. 

There just seemed to be way too much risk. 

Well, now the time has come, and I want to share this with the /r/guitar community because you folks have been nothing but supportive and encouraging throughout my journey. 

Make no mistake: this shit is scary. To boldly follow the dream of being a musician - a street musician no less - takes serious courage. Especially when I've been so financially comfortable making good money working in corporate America. But I've made the decision and it feels fucking great. 

I play purely improvised downtempo blues/jazz music using a handful of effects pedals feeding a Flashback X4 looper. This is all run into a Roland BA-220 portable PA that can push upwards of 120 db - plenty for a public park, city street or back alley. 

It's taken me this long to find the perfect gear setup with the perfect portability and now it's time to take this show on the road and see what happens. 

My plan is to leave Denver en route to San Francisco at the end of this month after putting in my 2 weeks notice with my current employer. I have a brother there who will put me up in SF, and I have already located some great spots to start playing (Fisherman's Wharf, etc.). After a spell in SF, I'll head down (or up) the west coast: Seattle, Portland, Eugene, San Diego, LA, wherever. 

Then I'll just start picking cities between California and Florida and go there. Just...go there. Wherever. Whenever. However. 

There is a lot of scary stuff that could happen along the way. Then again, there's a lot more opportunity to share my music with people than I'll ever have here in Denver. I plan on keeping a web journal about my travels at www.bret-dallas.com (not up yet, but I own the domain and I'm working with another redditor to get the pages done). So feel free to follow along as I endeavor to do what I've always dreamed to do. 

I may sink and I may swim. I may fall flat on my face and end up broke and dejected, but one thing is for damn sure: when I'm old and worn out, I'll be able to look back on my life and say, ""I did it. I leaped into the abyss and played guitar for strangers like it was what I was born to do.""

If you live in a city that you think would welcome this sort of thing, let me know. I would love to stop by your locale and make music. I'm on Facebook (Bret Dallas) and Twitter (@Cinnabret) - and you can always PM me here on Reddit. 

This is going to be a remarkable experience, regardless of what the outcome is. 

Thanks again for all your support guys.

Here goes nothing! :)

After reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2kgh4e/the_mothership_is_following_me_via_gps/) tale by /u/jayykidd, it brought back memories of a client of my own that was Paranoid and Rightly So (as an aside, /u/jayykidd, we are totally making PARS a thing around here). 

As a bit of backstory, I spent five years doing IT consulting in a rural town about an hour from Portland, OR. I worked for a small company with a few other consultants and a couple of bench techs. My job was primarily server/network engineering-centric, but having done my time as a front-line tech I'd periodically involve myself in the more interesting/complex cases we'd see from our walk-in customers. 

One day we had a woman come in. She caught my eye because she was in her late thirties or early forties, and actually quite attractive. She had short, platinum blonde hair and bright red lips, and was dressed and styled like she was transplanted right out of a 1950's era magazine ad. One of our bench techs greets her and starts talking to her. Right out the gate I can tell she is panicked and, by the sound of it, tin-foil hat levels of crazy. Shit, there goes any desire I had to flirt with her and maybe see if I could buy her a drink. I listen in on the conversation anyways, because it's at least a change of pace from the monotony of my day-to-day.

After a few minutes of her going on about how her husband is spying on her through all manner of devices, my bench tech looks back at me with a *can-you-please-come-help-me-and-make-her-go-away* look on his face. I oblige, as I appreciated that the front-line guys respected me enough to ask for my help on these things. I walked up front, introduced myself as the supervisor, and told her that since her issue was so unique and serious it'd probably be best if our more senior staff handled it. Now that I was seeing her up close, I could tell that under her classy outfit and Marilyn Monroe-esque makeup was a deeply distraught woman. Her eyes looked baggy, and tired. Like she had been up too late crying.  

Obviously, at this point I'm just playing along. This isn't my first rodeo, and generally what happens is the client claims some individual or three letter agency is monitoring their computer, we tell them our hourly rate for forensics ($150 an hour), and suddenly the men-in-black-suits watching them aren't that big of a deal anymore. Now, to be fair, we actually *did* specialize in computer forensics and data recovery, working extensively with the local police department and a handful of legal firms on a number of cases where they needed expert help, we even had a guy on staff full-time who wore that hat most days. The local police were pretty small-time and farmed out at least some of their computer crime related work to us on contract. In the cases where people *did* want to pay, we would do our due diligence, and prepare a professional report of our findings accordingly.  We would meet with attorneys and testify in court, as necessary. Generally it was fairly benign stuff like gathering chat logs and browser history for a divorce proceeding where one spouse accused the other of cheating or something similar, and wanted evidence to back that up.  

Back to the client at hand. She insists her husband is monitoring her every move, tracking her vehicle, monitoring her computer, and recording her in her own home. Here's where it gets interesting: She claims that she *knows* all of this, because he has told her about it. In fact, he has gone so far as to threaten her life if she tries to tamper with any of it. She says she has tried to apply for a protective order against him, but ostensibly without some sort of evidence of his behavior, nobody would take her seriously. 

I give her the crazy litmus test and I tell her that in order to gather evidence discreetly we would need two of our senior consultants to investigate. $300 an hour, four hour minimum. 

She pulls out her wallet. 

Fuck, she's serious. 

We agree to start with her vehicle to check for signs of the GPS tracker. She says she is parked several blocks away so her husband won't know she came to a computer store (we were in a downtown area surrounded by retail stores). So I grab my toolbag and holler at one of my colleagues (who has been tuned in himself from his back office desk) to join me. 

So the lady, myself, my colleague, and BOTH of our now intensely curious bench techs (all of us in matching company polos) follow this lady down the street to her car. What a motley crew we must have been. We get to her minivan begin our process of looking for this GPS device. Now, GPS trackers (at least the commercially available ones) require two things, generally: dedicated 12v power and an unobstructed (at least by metal) view of the sky. They basically use GPS to grab the coordinates and then a GSM/CDMA (cellular) signal to relay the positional data to a web interface or something. So there really aren't that many places they can really be mounted that are both effective and discreet. We spend some time looking around the undercarriage, rocker panels, and even bits of the interior. Battery doesn't have any additional leads running off of it, fuse box isn't tapped anywhere for power. Nothing. Just as I'm starting to lose faith that this may not be quite as exciting as I had perhaps hoped, I find the fucking thing.

It was tiny, not much bigger than a flash drive, and mounted behind the front grille. It looked pretty much exactly like [this](http://www.amazon.com/LandAirSea-LAS-1505-Tracking-Vehicle-System/dp/B000H9E9UG). 

The reason it didn't need auxiliary power is that it wasn't an active device. This device did not provide real-time tracking, rather it used some internal memory and a couple AAA batteries to log GPS data for days at a time. At some point, when the van was not in use, the guy would grab the GPS device, upload the data to his laptop, maybe swap batteries, then remount it to the car. 

Fucking hell, this lady was very much indeed Paranoid And Rightfully So. 

Now that we've established that she isn't batshit insane but that she actually *is* being tracked by her husband, the tone amongst our team became drastically more serious. Obviously, something sinister is going on, and we aren't sure what, but by the sound of things this lady really is fearful of her life. She has entrusted *us* to gather evidence and help her get a protective order against him, which is something I think all of us took quite seriously.

We show her the tracker and she breaks down into tears because it's the first evidence she has physically seen. We take photos of it, and carefully install it back where it belongs. I sort of assumed that a GPS tracker on your fucking car would be proof enough for a judge to issue at least a temporary protective order, but she seemed insistent that she would need more evidence to make it stick.

Our next moves have to be conducted very deliberately. She claims that her home is bugged, and so is her computer. We will need to go onsite to investigate accordingly, but it will have to be at a time when both her husband isn't home and when we will be able to quickly create a report for her, leaving her enough time to get a protective order before the day's end. We couldn't chance him coming home later, reviewing whatever it was he was recording, and finding out that she had taken action to have him investigated. 

It wasn't going to be for at least a week before there was a time that was just right. We made arrangements with her back at the office and I offered to walk her back to her car. She accepted, and on the way she confided in me many of the personal details of her life and her obviously abusive relationship with her husband. In the interest of protecting her privacy I'll simply say that it sounded like she finally figured out how manipulative he was, and when she said she wanted out he wasn't about to let that happen. I asked her again if she really was afraid for her life, and the sincerity of her ""yes"" was both scary and heartbreaking for me. I asked her if she had thought about getting a gun, and she said she had, but that he would notice the large sum of money needed to purchase one missing from their joint account. 

As the gravity of the situation weighed on me, I offered to let her borrow one of mine. She was awestruck, but I assured her that it was completely okay. At the time, I had several handguns and rifles, and I couldn't think of a more appropriate situation for someone to have one. My car was parked close by, and we walked over to it. I tried to gather some idea of her familiarity with guns, as the thought of giving one to more or less a complete stranger, especially one that might not know what to do with it, was unsettling to me. It sounded like she had at least a basic understanding of their function, had gone shooting before, etc. In my mind the pros of her having at least some means to protect herself outweighed the cons, so I moved forward. In the trunk, I had a [Ruger LCP](http://www.ruger.com/products/lcp/models.html), which is a very small .380 caliber handgun that I kept in my Get Home Bag/emergency survival kit. It was fitted with the factory installed Crimson Trace laser grips, which I had dialed in to about 10 meters. We went over the basics of how to use it safely, I showed her how the laser worked, and told her that, for her situation, all she had to know was that the bullet would go more or less where the red dot of the laser was. She was crying, and frankly at this point I pretty much was, too. I gave her my cell phone number and told her to call me if she needed someone to talk to. We hugged for a while before parting ways. It wasn't a romantic hug or anything, it was that kind of hug that's exchanged when someone *needs to be held*. Like, when your best mate tells you his mom passed away or something. She needed the comfort of knowing that she wasn't alone, that at least one person took her seriously, and I'd like to think that I gave her some hope that things would be *okay*. 

The next week was tense, as we prepared for our investigation. My coworkers and I spent considerable time discussing and researching ways to triage her computer to look for evidence, as well as how to approach the search of the house. When the day finally came, we arrived onsite at the specified time armed with our forensics tools, flashlights, laptops...anything we might need. 

I set to work immediately on her computers (a home desktop and a personal laptop) while two of my colleagues began their search of the house. I removed the drives from her PCs, and using a USB write-blocker, (which physically prevented me from writing/modifying any information on her drives) I made a clone of both drives. For the sake of speed, both drives were cloned to SSDs. Once cloned, I put the PCs back they way they were and began mounting the cloned volumes and investigating. The drives were mounted into a quarantine VM, with no WLAN access. Scanning the drives with a number of antimalware programs didn't turn anything up. Looking through the file system however (paying special attention to hidden files and protected system files), turned up some things that didn't look quite right (filenames and directories that looked obfuscated). I made the call to boot up both PCs off of the cloned SSDs and look that them live to see if maybe I could catch an obfuscated process running, or something. 

Nothing.

With nothing else open, I ran a *netstat -an* out of CMD. There were a handful of TCP connections active. One by one, I started performing DNS lookups on the IPs. Everything was normal active connections for background processes like Skype. Then, I found it. An active connection to a clearly obfuscated domain name. It looked like a license key with a *.com* at the end of it. Something like 24W25-188EGFF-98001QRD.com. 

It was hiding in plain sight, and it was registered to SpectorSoft Corporation. Guess what they sell? Yup. Surveillance software.

The PC was running something called [Spector Pro](http://www.spectorsoft.com/products/SpectorPro_Windows/), which was capable of monitoring all of the users activities, browsing history, keylogging, even sending remote screen captures to a mobile phone or email based on target keywords. It was the full nine yards for monitoring. 

I screen capped everything for my logs, shut the system down, and swapped the forensic SSDs for the original disks to put everything back the way it was. 

Not too long after, our other two guys found some evidence of their own. Two separate (and frankly, rather rudimentary) CMOS cameras hidden in the master bedroom. One in the closet in a shoebox, one in the smoke detector in the ceiling. Both, if I recall correctly, were simply wired to 9V batteries and recorded to SD cards. All things considered, they were pretty low tech. The contents of the memory cards would have had to be moved off at least once a day, and the battery probably changed at least as often. 

We didn't touch anything. Lots of photographs were taken. We went back to the office and compiled all of the evidence into a document for her, and I passed the disk images onto our forensics guy for further evaluation. I met with the client later that day to present her the report so she could furnish it to the court. 

The gratitude she had for us was absolutely immeasurable. We didn't charge her for our services. Getting to play a role in stopping her sick fuck of a husband from engaging in whatever it is he was doing was payment enough.

I'd like to tell you that I know how this story ends. I'd like to say that the guy was put away in jail forever, and my supreme IT prowess and white-knightery wooed her into my arms and we lived happily ever after. But frankly, I don't really know what happened. What I *can* tell you that about a week after we gave her our report, I met her for coffee at a place across the street. She looked visibly better. Her puffy, tired eyes were gone, replaced instead by ones that seemed to glisten with warmth. Her skin was radiant and beautiful. She was smiling, for the first time I'd seen. An immense weight had been lifted off of her, and it showed. She told me that she was temporarily living with her mom and dad, that a restraining order was in place on her estranged husband, and that she was finally filing for divorce. She told me that for the first time in a very long time she felt safe, and that she felt happy. 

In the parking lot, she gave me back the little handgun, profusely thanking me again for the work we did. She hugged me, both of us teary-eyed, and we parted ways. For me, it proved to be one of the most emotionally rewarding experiences of my career.

agentsirus,2012-06-04 17:14:38+00:00,"Reddit, have you ever broken a serious social stigma?","Personally, I've beaten the shit out of a few women. Hear me out.

Back in 2007 I was in Portland, Oregon with my wife (who is a VERY docile, gentle woman) and we went to a heavy metal concert at the Roseland Theater. 

After the show, as we were walking back to my car some drunk bitches started trying to pick a fight with my wife. My wife and I are tall, broad shouldered people (6'1 and 5'11, respectively) but we're not the 'violent' type and we don't try to intimidate anyone.

These 3 drunk bitches essentially attack my wife because A) they are drunk B) they are probably stupid and C) they think because my wife is tall and German she is probably mean.

When they think I'll just stand around and watch my gentle giant of a wife get beaten up because I'm a dude and they are chicks... I unload on them and beat the shit out of all 3 of these dumb whores quite easily. I think I might have even broken one of their noses. Anyway, after a quick, bloody fistfight I got back to my car and drove back to my aunt's house, where we were staying for the weekend.

So... I'm just curious, has anyone else here done something that most Americans assume is 'off limits' because of an intense situation?

EDIT: Hey, I was busy most of the day yesterday but when I came home late last night I saw you guys were *really* busy on this post. Thanks. Heh.

0450AZ001,2012-06-03 00:20:06+00:00,Don't Turn off the Webcam,"Linh and I met in 2008. She was from a very small town in Washington with a population of less than five hundred. I was working my way through college as an event bartender in Portland. Linh’s cousin was getting married in Portland, and as fate would have it, the wedding reception was held at an upscale hotel on the Columbia River where I frequently tended to small wine and beer bars. I noticed her immediately, as I often notice women that I quickly convince myself are too beautiful to ever date someone like me. Eventually as the night went on, she made her way over to my bar and ordered a white wine. We talked for a while about Portland. I sweated profusely as I tend to do around girls like her. She would be spending the next two days in the city, and I took a few moments telling her about the most interesting sights to see and things to do in town. 

“Wow, you should just be my personal tour guide” she said, grabbing my arm and smiling. This happened to me so infrequently that I really had no idea how to react, so I just mumbled “Sure, what time?” and laughed nervously to hedge in the event that she was joking. “How about 10:30 tomorrow morning” she replied.

And so started my relationship with Linh. She was infectious, with a personality that was so innocent and warm. I immediately fell in love with her. There were a few issues that we would have to work through. She was still in Washington and I was finishing school in Oregon. Linh was Vietnamese with a very traditional father who would never approve of her having a white boyfriend. She lived alone in a house with her father as her mother had passed away several years earlier, so going to Yarrow Point to visit her was out of the question. She would come to see me every three weeks under the guise of a prestigious internship program. 

Being in a long distance relationship, we spoke on the phone and texted constantly. When high speed internet finally came to her small town in Washington, I surprised her with a webcam for her computer so we could have an even better means of long distance communication. In the back of my mind, I was always looking for ways to be with her as even after two years of dating I was paranoid a girl as beautiful as her would eventually find somebody better to share her life with. 

In 2010, Linh’s father passed away suddenly in his sleep from a heart attack. He was everything to her, and she was heartbroken. When she returned from Florida where the funeral was held and her father buried, she was all alone in the house where she had lost both of her parents. With Linh’s father deceased, she was open to finally allowing me to come to Washington to see her, which we planned on doing in a few weeks after my college finals.

One night during our usual bedtime conversation, Linh mentioned to me that her father had been acting strangely in the days leading up to his death. She explained that he had taken to checking up on her multiple times throughout the day and night, and scattering religious artifacts throughout the house. This behavior, she said, was highly uncharacteristic of him. Vietnamese culture and religion was something foreign to me, and at various points Linh had mentioned things like this that I normally wrote off as just being a little silly. She explained to me that being in the house alone without her Dad was emotional and may be playing tricks on her. She hated the feeling of being so alone. She told me that being able to see me on her webcam was the closest thing she had to family, and asked that I promise to never turn off the webcam. She meant the world to me, so I was happy to oblige.

A few days passed and it was now the Tuesday before the weekend when I would finally come to see her in Washington. We spent our bedtime webcam session excitedly talking about our plans and I dozed off with my head on the kitchen table in mid conversation. It had been a long day. When I woke up, I saw Linh sleeping on my screen and stumbled off to bed. 

At 3:00am, my cell phone begin to ring. Disoriented, I rolled over, took a look at the clock and knew it could only be her. She took great pleasure in waking me up in the middle of the night to let me know that she had just gotten a drink of water, or had an amusing dream. Anyone else would have gotten an earful from me, but her flirtatious giggle made me feel lucky to have my much needed sleep interrupted.

""I had a nightmare"" Linh gasped. ""...You danced in front of my friends"". She burst into laughter. 

""What are you doing up so late honey? You've got to work in the morning?"" I said.

""I was thirsty, and went downstairs to get a drink of water.""

""Great, well we really should go back to sleep, tomorrow is a big day"".

""Allllright"" she conceded, ""Hey by the way, don't forg----""

After a few crackles and a brief burst of static, the call disconnected. I hated Linh's phone, she had an old flip phone that dropped calls with no rhyme or reason at least three times a day. I held down the #1 on my own phone, my speed dial for Linh. No ring, straight to voicemail. 

I tried to call several more times, and each time it again went straight to voicemail. 

I was exhausted, and though I loved Linh to death, to be honest I just wanted to go back to sleep. My eyelids hung heavy.

A little annoyed, I decided to walk out to my kitchen for a quick drink of water. The two glasses of wine that I drank before bed had left me with a little bit of dry mouth. As I rinsed the glass and went to place it in the dishwasher, out of the corner of my eye I saw movement on the glow of the laptop perched on my dining room table. 

It was the webcam. Two fluffy brown paws were making a swimming motion directly in front of her camera. As I got closer I saw a close up of two grinning faces. One of that silly dog of hers, and the other of my giggling girlfriend, who knew that eventually after being unable to make phone contact I would wander out to the webcam to say goodnight. I wouldn't put it past her to turn the phone off on purpose to elaborately stage this scene. Me, standing in my underwear at 3am on a work night, half asleep staring at a girl and a puppy on a webcam. 

I waved goodnight, and she kissed the lens of the webcam and pulled away.

I froze.

I wiped my eyes and looked again.

There.

It's... standing in the corner of the room. It’s...

Staring at her. 

Wrinkled. Angry, twisted mouth. 

Hateful eyes. 

What the fuck. 

HATEFUL eyes. 

It’s watching her.

-------------------


Two hours later, I woke on the dining room floor. I had a ringing in my ears and a knot on the back of my head. I immediately knew what had happened. It wasn't the first time. Sudden, extreme stress has given me panic attacks and black outs a few times before. I had never felt such fear when what had happened came rushing back and I nearly had a second panic attack when my thoughts turned to Linh. I loved her more than anything in the world. It took me several moments to summon the courage the look in the direction of my laptop. When I finally did, the screensaver had long since turned on. I looked away from the screen as I flicked the touchpad with my shaking finger. It took me another two minutes to open my eyes. 

Linh laid sleeping in her bed. She looked so peaceful. Sleeping on her side, facing towards the webcam. As frightened and confused as I was, relief at her safety gave me a sense of comfort as I desperately tried to process what had happened. Maybe the wine had hit me harder than I thought. Maybe I slipped and fell on the slick tile floor, and it all had been a nightmare.

I stared at her. I loved her. Maybe more than even I realized. So peaceful and beautiful as she slept.

The light of her television danced across her room and illuminated the bed.
As I watched on, her hand began to move. 

Slowly. 

Unnaturally. 

She was sleeping but her fingers crawled across the bed slowly until they reached something. It was her cell phone. 

Her hand moved like a spider, fingers popping in several directions across the keys.

What the hell?

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

My phone was vibrating.

""New Message: DON'T...""

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

""New Message: TURN...""

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

""New Message: OFF""

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

""New Message: THE""

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

""New Message: WEB""

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

""New Message: CAM""

Complete terror set in as the messages came across the screen of my cell phone.

""New Message: DON'T...""

""New Message: TURN...""

""New Message: OFF""

""New Message: THE""

""New Message: WEB""

""New Message: CAM""

As I glanced back to my laptop, horror overcame me as slowly a shadow crept across the floor. Something was crossing in front of the television. Moving closer to Linh.

I told myself it was just her dog, right? The color drained out of my face when I noticed the puppy sleeping in the far corner of the room.

I picked up my phone and dialed Linh. I didn’t know what I would tell her, but I knew she needed to get out of there immediately and never go back. Dammit straight to voicemail! THAT STUPID OLD PHONE OF HERS.

The full shadow now hung completely over Linh.

Her hand jerked, flipping open her cell phone.

My phone was ringing.

I answered, “LINH! LINH CAN YOU HEAR ME YOU NEED TO…""

A burst of loud static forced my phone reflexively away from my ear.

On the webcam I saw Linh’s lips begin to move. Her eyes were shut, but she was speaking.

I heard her voice come across the phone, but something wasn’t right. She was speaking, but a second, deeper voice echoed hers in perfect unison.

“DON’T TURN OFF THE WEBCAM…. AGRAMON WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU. DON’T TURN OFF THE WEBCAM. AGRAMON IS READY FOR YOU NOW”

“Who? What? What does he want?” I yelled in desperation.

“HE WANTS TO EAT YOUR SKIN”. 

The line disconnected.

The shadow across Linh’s bed changed directions.

It started moving away from the bed… and towards her laptop… towards the webcam.

As the shadow moved closer small streams of gray liquid rolled towards the lens.

The images coming across my monitor began to shake violently.

It was almost here. I could now see the top of it’s head. It was CRAWLING towards me. Wet strings of silver and black hair hanging over it’s face. I remembered those hateful eyes and I lost control of my bladder as it slowly begin to tilt it’s head up. 

And then I did it. 

In panic I slammed my laptop shut and threw it against the hard tile floor before collapsing to the ground.

I wished for a panic attack to take my consciousness and end this nightmare, but it didn’t come.

I crawled to the panel of switches a few feet up on the wall and turned on every light that I could. I noticed the bottle of wine still open on the kitchen counter and drank most of it down in a single swallow. I reached up and pulled open my apartment door, and stumbled across the threshold, extending half of my body into the common hallway so I wouldn’t feel so alone. A pathetic coward sprawled out on the concrete. 

My phone began to ring.

I crawled to it. Linh’s name was flashing on the caller ID. I held it in my hand, paralyzed by fear.

And then the ringing stopped.

I took another mouthful of wine and mustered the courage to call back. It went straight to voicemail. And then again and again as I tried to call.

Eventually the shock and drowsiness from the wine got the better of me, and I passed out on the floor after making a few more attempts.

When I awoke several hours later, despite the broken laptop and empty bottle, I wanted to believe that it was all some sort of horrible nightmare.

Out of the corner of my eye I saw blue flashing light on my cell phone.

“You Have One New Voicemail”

My hand trembled as I dialed my voicemail and entered my passcode.

The message was time stamped, and was from the missed call I had from Linh before passing out.

Her voice. She was in tears and frightened as though I had never heard her before.

“You promised. Why…….why did you….turn off the web …webcam… “

“His… his tongue … burns “

With a crackle the message ended. 

-----

Two years have passed since that night. I never tried to contact Linh again. I never called her work to see if she came in the following morning. I never made it to Yarrow Point in Washington where she lived. She was my soul mate, and I let this happen. I was probably right on the night we met when I told myself I wasn’t man enough for her.

The only reason I am telling this story today, under the cowardly vale of anonymity, is because my drug and alcohol counselor thinks it would be good for me. So here it is. I made the decision to let the love of my life face an unimaginable nightmare to spare myself, and the worst part is that I may not even regret it.  

Now if you will excuse me, I think I need another drink.

Wen did not get your name but this was in portland oregon today around 4ish in Blue Bills dinner. Some back story for reddit my bf  and I were eating and minding our own business. We are gay and it is noticeable. Suddenly this really religious man comes to our table and starts talking about how we are an abomination and should change our ways before we go to hell. He started saying that we ""should show respect and not force ourselves in public because there are good families and children around"". He then asked us to leave because we were making everyone uncomfortable. When we told him to leave us alone he grabbed me and tried to shove me out the door. Before he got to far a tall man in a black rose print fedora and baggy jacket grabbed him gave him a well placed headbutt and a few punches and pushed him out the door. He put some cash on our table and left without saying a word (i think he might have broken his pinky).

[deleted],2012-02-21 23:40:05+00:00,"Reddit, my former employer just called my second job and had them fire me too. What the hell should I do?","I'm a teacher. I finished my degree this past June in Early Childhood Education. I broke a policy and procedure to protect a child who was being attacked by another child. However, the P&amp;P does not say what to do if a child is attacking someone or destroying property. It does not say how to handle the situation. I pulled the attacker off the victim and told them in a raised stern voice that it was not ok to hit their friend.

Someone reported me to my supervisor stating that I yanked a child and yelled at them and that it was child abuse, my supervisor did not see it and refused to listen to me when I tried to tell her they were attacking another child (repeatedly punching them in the back, neck, and head). They reported it to DHS and suspended me. The next day I got a call from my supervisor and they terminated my contract. I called DHS today and they had no record and said they would look into it for me. I told them what happened from my side and they wrote it down. My father spoke with a Police officer who said that I did the right thing and this sounds like a Policy issue so it shouldn't hurt me and my future employment.

However, my former employer contacted my supervisor at my second job, in which I provide childcare for a couple hours once a week for parents taking a parenting class. The people who run the class do so through my former employer and they were told that I was no longer working for them and they did not want me providing care for the children whose parents are in the class.

So I got a call today saying that it was nothing personal against me and they thought I was doing a great job, but I could no longer work from them because my former employer told them I couldn't.

Not only did I lose my job, they are dragging me through the dirt and making sure I will never work with children again. This isn't right, it's not fair, and I'm at a loss as to what I'm supposed to do. I called a lawyer last week when this all started and they said they couldn't take my case. Does anyone know of any lawyers in the Portland, OR area who could help? General advice is more than welcome. I'm 23 and did not imagine this is what I would be dealing with straight out of school. These people are rendering my degree as useless and I still have over $20,000 in school loans to pay off.

TL;DR I got fired from a job for doing, what I felt to be, the right thing and then they called my second job and had them fire me too. What should I do, reddit? How can I fight back?

EDIT: This is obviously a throw-away account.
EDIT 2: Wording.

EDIT 3: I would like to thank everyone for the comments, questions, advice, and opinions. I've taken it all into consideration and feel a little better about my situation. This is going to be rough but I'll get through it one way or another. I'm taking a break from the internet for the rest of the night, I welcome more advice and whatnot. I'll look back again in the morning. Thank you redditors, I appreciate your help.

rattus77,2012-01-12 03:26:52+00:00,Hello.  This is Fred Armisen.  Testing one two.,"Hi!  I am going to try to answer questions.  I'll try.  Here are some I saw already:

-What was your main inspiration for Portlandia?
Working on projects with Carrie.  That turned into making videos which then turned into the show.  Our surroundings in Portland became the setting.
-How much of your material do you write for your SNL skits?
I write with other writers there.  It's the most fun, getting to collaborate with smart and funny people.
-Is it amazing playing the most well-known parody of the President?
I love doing it.  
-Are most Portlandia characters based on people you've met?
For some reason, it's the other way around.  We make people up, then somehow we see them walking around.  Or biking around.
-Who have been the best hosts on SNL while you've been on the show?
So many and for different reasons.  I like ex-SNL cast members.  Like, Molly Shannon for example.  I get star struck.  I watched them on this show.

spoolio,2011-10-10 03:41:30+00:00,"Hey 99%, there's an election soon and Obama and Ron Paul aren't running in it. Are you registered?","It would make a huge difference if everyone who's angry about politics across the country actually turned out at their local elections in 2011. 

Your local government makes decisions about jobs, the police, taxes, education, and generally a whole lot of the issues that are on people's minds right now. If you say you care about these, and you skip this election, politicians can tell that you don't really care enough.

But if (for example) lots of Redditors were to vote in 2011, not only would that make a huge change in the set of people who get their start in politics, it would also make the 2012 candidates take notice of this demographic that's suddenly voting.

Make sure you're registered to vote. Preferably where you actually live; nobody cares about absentee ballots unless they actually change the outcome.

EDIT: [Here](http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/images/thumb/US_Map_I&amp;R.png/800px-US_Map_I&amp;R.png) is a map of states that have [initiatives and referendums](http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/2011_ballot_measures) this year, courtesy of [Ballotpedia](http://ballotpedia.org/). In particular, **Mississippi** (are there Redditors from Mississippi? So there are!) is voting on making abortion illegal, requiring ID to vote, Governor, and other things. **Colorado** is voting on taxes, **Washington** is voting on gas taxes, a number of local taxes, and legalizing private liquor stores, **Arkansas** is voting on a jobs bill, **Texas** is voting on education loans and a bunch of things I don't understand, and **California** is voting on absolutely everything like they usually do. EXTREMELY LATE EDIT: **Louisiana** is voting for governor and **Minnesota** is voting on same sex marriage.

**Ohio** is voting on really important things, including (on the one hand) repealing their horrible collective bargaining ban, or (on the other hand) repealing mandatory health insurance.

There are (I think) contested mayoral elections in **Houston, Indianapolis, Phoenix, Portland ME, Raleigh,** and **Tucson**. For MIT and Harvard Redditors there's the always interesting **Cambridge MA** city council election (with preferential voting!). A bunch of other cities and towns have mayoral elections as well.

I just got back. AMA","Well the title is a bit misleading because I actually quit my CAREER, broke up with the girl I was going to MARRY (eventually), and then moved to a new city where I knew nobody except my roommate before I actually left.

On May 3rd I left Denver Union Station at around 7pm and returned July 4th around 2pm after traveling the entire US (north,south,east,west) via train and using couchsurfing.com for places to stay.  

I bought two Amtrak US Rail passes (45 day and 15 day) and planned each stop on my trip only a day or so in advance - and sometimes even from the station.  I traveled to Chicago, Milwaukee, Wausau, St. Paul, Seattle, Portland, San Fran, Los Angeles, Sante Fe, Kansas City, St. Louis, New Orleans, Atlanta, Washington D.C., and Boston.  I returned to Denver from Boston.

The whole trip I used a website called couchsurfing.com and never once had to pay for a hotel or hostel.  I stayed with a US diplomat on leave from Saudi Arabia, CEO of an insturance company, a forager, a Los Alamos nuclear physicist, a lobbyist, a retired bass player, a spiritual guru, a group of hippies... to name a few of the hosts I had the pleasure of staying with.  (It was fun talking about Wikileaks with the diplomat for sure)

Everyday I lived out of my suitcase and backpack.  Everyday I was somewhere new and meeting new people; people I had to stay with for long periods of time in some cases.  

During my trip I was almost mugged, had a knife pulled on me (separate incident), got tonsillitis, went sailing, fell in 'love', drank way too much in new orleans, drank just enough everywhere else (go local brewed), got lost in a swamp, got attacked by a cougar with loads of tequilla (not the animal hah) and more.

I've been back for a bit now and it is still VERY weird.  Nothing seems familiar and all the 'things' I once held dear to me now mean almost nothing.  In fact in the 7 days I've been back - this is my first time on the computer and the only thing I can think of is how weird this all feels.  In fact, in the two months I was gone it seemed like almost eight months - time slowed down in an extreme way.  My roommate said to me when I got back how quickly time had flown, and all I could think of was how I completely forgot what he looked like. 

If you have any questions about train travel in the US, couch surfing, or my trip AMA

EDIT - As requested - http://i.imgur.com/O2AXL.jpg can I get a green circle of approval from a mod now? :D

EDIT - I'm sorry for all the good questions that I am missing :(  It's hard to get to all of them.  I click on the orangered and try to respond - sometimes I click away and then reddit is like ""good job you read all those now they are thrown into your dead pile"" and I have a new page.  If you really want me to answer something you can pm me or just delete your question and post it again.

Lastly - To everyone who's pm'd me saying all these really nice and genuine things - I sincerely appreciate it.  I'd like to give back to the community in anyway I can so if there is something you think I may be able to help you with - feel free to let me know in a PM and I'll get back to you in the morning.  To everyone else - I had fun answering your questions and I'll finish up some more in the morning before I'm shuffled into the archives ;D  GNight!

EDIT - This got crazy didn't it.  Never expected this much discussion and I'm really grateful to have been able to help you guys in any way that I could with your desire to travel - or questions about cs and amtrak.  For everyone that is calling me their hero and an inspiration - I sincerely thank you for the flattery - But I have to say it wasn't that you saw me as these things, it was that you saw a part of yourself in the decisions I made.  If you're not happy with your life and your situation, you have the power to change all of that by just making the choice to do so.  If you have any other questions just send me a pm - I'm so exhausted from sitting in front of my computer... it's been hard to sit on here for a long period of time after not being on in so long. 

I made a promise in some of my pm's and replies that I'd write out a book of my travels for you all and so that's what I am going to do... I just don't know quite how to do it. Expect it to be in the vein of an adventure tale, since that's what I enjoy writing in my spare time. Till then...

Thanks again everyone.

I created this subreddit [Onward](http://www.reddit.com/r/Onward)

This subreddit is merely a place where people can post their future travel plans and their reasoning behind it. It's a place for support for those who feel too timid about going out into the unknown, a place for congrats on those who managed to make the decision to do so, and a place where we can all be brought together in what is a combined human experience. Onward!

[deleted],2009-09-07 22:14:52+00:00,"I have crohn's disease. I shat my pants outside of ""Plaid Pantry"" because they wouldn't let me use the employee bathroom. ","here's the email I sent to customer service:

To Whom It May Concern:

 I am writing to tell you about an incident that occurred today that troubled me deeply about your company and the practices of its managers. I am a regular shopper at the Plaid Pantry in Portland, Oregon off of 1st Ave. Today, September 07, Labor Day, I was driving home from my job and had a bit of a problem. You see, I have Crohn's disease. If you are unfamiliar with the condition, you may read up on it here https://www.google.com/health/ref/Crohn%27s+disease. It is an inflammatory bowel disease, that along with many other things, can cause you to have to use the bathroom rather immediately.

Such an incident occurred on my way home from work unfortunately. Usually in this situation, I would have gone to one of several restaurants along the way offering public bathrooms, however it was labor day and most things were closed. The Plaid Pantry was the only thing in immediate site that was open, and trust me when I say the situation was immediate. Wrongly assuming they would be understaning, I drove into the lot, parked, and ran as fast as I could inside. I quickly asked the manager where the bathroom was. He rudely told me they had none. I asked him if the employees had a bathroom they used. He stated that they did, but he would get fired if they let me use it. Having no time to delay, I gave him as descriptive and immediate of an explanation as I could, stressing the fact that I had a disease, this was an emergency, and I doubted very highly he would get fired for letting me use his bathroom. I explained that I would call his owner, explain the situation personally and see that he was not fired.  I also specifically told him that I would, without a doubt, have an accident in my pants if he did not let me use his bathroom. He laughed at me.

Horrified, I left the store, attempted to walk to my car, and had an accident in my pants, right there in front of your store, in broad daylight, on a crowded street.

The rest of this story requires no detail. Said accident occurred and I drove home in that condition. I walked to my apartment past neighbors in that condition. Never have a been so degraded and embarrassed. Thirty years of my life I have lived with this disease; never once has a public place of business refused to allow me to use their restrooms in such an emergency, rare as they are. Needless to say, myself or my family will not be shopping in your stores again. I will also be posting this story on the consumerist.com and reddit.com, a social networking site, in hope that your change your policies so this event never again occurs in the future.
