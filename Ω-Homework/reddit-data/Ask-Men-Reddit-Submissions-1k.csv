Nobody's forcing me to buy them. But if anyone asked me: Would you want to wear that or a T shirt and jeans, I'd say T shirt and jeans 10 out of 10 times. However, I do enjoy the feeling of looking good even if I'm not totally comfortable

Then, of course, the issue of finding a partner comes in. In general, women like a guy who dresses well (people in general like someone who dresses well), so that's also something to consider

In your day to day life and in your own mind, how do you balance what you really want to look like vs what is considered to be the most appropriate way to look like?

EDIT: HOLY COW. Thank you everyone for taking the time to read this post. Okay, I‚Äôve read a lot of comments, and I‚Äôm going to answer some questions that I seem to be getting a lot of. 
First off, this wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúspa‚Äù per say, but more of a typical manicure and pedicure place that you can just walk into and get your nails and feet done. 
Second: I had gotten a ‚Äúhot stone pedicure‚Äù I chose to not get the nail polish done and all of that. Just wanted my feet and calves to be massaged. It‚Äôs very relaxing and it cost me $35. This was also at a very cleanly and highly rated place near me. 
Third: I‚Äôve played sports all my life, and my new obsession is indoor volleyball along with sand volleyball in the summer. My job also requires me to be on my feet 8-10 hours a day (depending on my shift) and that‚Äôs typically 6 days a week. My feet typically ache. Also, I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4‚Äù and a pretty built guy. Needless to say, my feet can take a beating. 

Lastly, thank you to everyone who is respecting those of us who choose to do this, even if it‚Äôs something you personally wouldn‚Äôt do. I‚Äôm overjoyed to see the kindness of people in this group. To those who don‚Äôt have anything nice to say, I‚Äôm sorry you feel that way. I still wish everyone here the best in life. We all deserve to be happy!",AskMen,5198

It got me thinking and I realized it's been so long since I had any real intimacy, and it broke me.

It's not like I didn't have sex since my ex and I broke up, it's been two years already and I've been with plenty women since, but after thinking about it I don't remember the last time I've had intimate intercourse with a women who was as attracted to me as I was to her, with which I've had a real love connection.

Heck, it's been so long I don't even remember if I had that connection and intimacy with my ex when we slept together.

My therapist recommend I join a group session, which I did, and out of the nine people there I am the ONLY guy. That in itself is kind of upsetting because, in my experience, eating disorders was always kind of presented as a female thing. I felt even more alone for having a ""female problem"" and going to that group only seemed to confirm it. Now I know that isn't actually true and there are plenty of males with similar problems, but still. You can't deny that not only does the problem SEEM more prevalent in women, but it also SEEMS far more accepted and supported with women than it does with men.

To make matters worse, I have a tendency to tear up when talking about something that makes me really uncomfortable. Not like cry, but glassy eyed with an occasional tear I guess. Most times I don't even feel upset, it feels like an involuntary self defense thing more than anything else. For some that may seem like a totally normal thing, but growing up in a household where you were constantly told that it makes you appear weak really changes your perception on stuff like that lol.

So my session consisted of me, a 23 year old man, in a room surrounded by women talking about a very uncomfortable part of my life that the public perceives as a more ""feminine"" issue, and then tearing up as I'm talking. I had never felt that small and exposed in my entire life.

I live abroad (although not very far) and obviously there's a possibility I won't get to see him in person again.

Tbh I'm just rambling here, I don't feel anything yet nor did I when he told me. I just know either way I've got to be strong enough to look after mum. And obviously I don't want to ask him anything too harsh or upsetting to make things harder for him than they already are.


TL;DR:
So anyway my questions so far are:

- what would you have asked your father if you could have before he died?
- would you be willing to walk &lt;my gf&gt; down the aisle?
- is there anything you would have done differently?
- what can I do to best look after mum?
- what do you consider your best qualities?
- what do you consider your worst qualities?
- what would you say to your grandchildren when they're older?
- what could I have done to have been a better son?",AskMen,4506

I am petite and skinny, with my weight carried in my ass and small B cups up top. 

Throughout my life men and women have both made countless comments to make me very insecure about my breasts, including some guys I have dated or had sex with. 

I felt completely secure for once with my boyfriend now and wanted to explore my fantasy of a threesome with another girl. Looking for one on tinder I asked for his preferences and they matched mine and then he added ‚Äúbig boobs over small ones.‚Äù 

I told him I wasn‚Äôt upset at him for his preference but I was genuinely curious if he was actually attracted to my body since I don‚Äôt have big boobs, I have small ones. Also, he used to follow silicone enhanced women (breast and butt) on both Snapchat and Instagram and only stopped when we got serious. 

He simply said yeah, I am. 

However, he has what he says is performance anxiety. It does seem like performance anxiety...if he‚Äôs very stressed he will get hard then go soft. If I have said something like ‚Äúyou have to seduce me‚Äù jokingly, or anything like that, he loses his erection. 

A part of me feels like if I was one of those girls with big boobs he probably would stay hard even if he felt some pressure. Or it wouldn‚Äôt feel like pressure to perform because he was so excited to.

And now, jeez, I feel so great, literally everything is amazing - life together, food, spending our free time together, financial stuff, careers, life-work balance, not being co-dependant, bedroom life is on fire and is improving all the time... I could go on for years.

The part of our relationship that makes me really happy is our values and views. We support each other all the time, we want the same things in life (like having children in a few years, keeping a close relationship with our family, and, you know, being kinda boring - not the partying young adults, not having a direction in life, as many around us are). I feel so loved, safe and supported - I haven't EVER felt this way in my life. We both had our crazy years, we both experienced a lot before meeting each other, we both did stupid and painful mistakes in our lives and it seems like we individually got everything figured out, we got a grip on everything. I remember myself feeling anxious about relationships in early 20s since every girl I met was, imho, immature and didn't know what they wanted from their lives. And she does, she knows it very well. Thanks to my encouragement and support she managed to make a huge turn in her career, dropping out of law school to seek her dream of becoming a teacher... I wish I've had a teacher like her!

It's really funny how things went fast... I remember the first months of our relationship when she said she doesn't want to rush anything at all, but life happened and she had to find a new place to live so we moved in together. She told me before that she doesn't want to be engaged or married soon. Now she sometimes asks me when I'm going to propose lol.

Everyone around us see us as one of the most serious and most loving couples. My mates already tell me ""You are next"" after one of them proposed to their long-time gf. My parents and siblings ADORE her, I am pretty sure hers like me as well.

So here comes the question - how did you feel it that it was time to ""bend the knee to your queen""? What were the things you considered? What made you sure?

I am seriously considering doing this in the upcoming year. But I am the type of person that is really careful about actions and decisions. I measure 99 times and only after that - I cut (that's a folk saying in my country, although it says measure 9 times before cutting). I know how important it is to her, it's crucial to me as well, but I'm still having thoughts about rushing things too much.

I am sure she is The One but I don't want to make a mistake of rushing in too fast. 

Please, feel free to be blunt. I value truth the most. I'd be really happy if you shared your success (or failure) stories!",AskMen,2649

While we understand that you all have terrible self-esteem and don't think you'll ever get laid/will never find a partner/insert any other delusional self-hating fantasy here, but honestly this sub is not the place for your pity party.  Posting that crap is obviously attention-seeking behavior and we're not here to encourage it any more.  So we've decided to start handing out temp bans for anyone who wants to turn this sub into their own pity party.  This is applicable for both posts and comments.  

For example, these comments in response to the post ""What does your ideal SO look like"":

&gt; She exists

LMAO WE GET IT BECAUSE YOU'RE SO LONELY AN EXISTENT GIRLFRIEND IS SUFFICIENT ROFLMAO

&gt; my hand

HOLY SHIT WHAT A FUCKING COMEDIAN HERE PROEJCTING YOUR OWN INSECURITIES ONTO THIS POST SO ORIGINAL

&gt; literally anybody

OMFG WAOW SO TORTURED AND LONELY TAKE ME NOW RANDOM COMMENTER

Look everyone has their own insecurities and joking about them is fine but if the only thing you are going to offer to a post is non-answers specifically designed to make people feel bad because you are lacking in some way, then not only are you not contributing to the conversation, you're trying to push your own agenda of seeking validation.  Which is against the rules.

First offense: 3 day ban

Second offense: 7 day ban

Third offense: perma ban

And for those of you who were wondering ""why couldn't the mods have just implemented this and not told anyone about it"", it's because we need attention and want you all to notice us.

**tl;dr bans for self-pitying attention-seeking comments**

dapperdon003,2019-05-15 21:36:38+00:00,Men who chose to advance their careers at a young age at the expense of their social lives. How did it turn out?,"I am 26 years old. About a year and a half ago, I took a promotion about an hour and a half away from all my family and friends where I knew nobody. My first full year in the job (at age 25) I made $90k and this year I am on pace to make about $105k. I've been able to pay off all my debt, shovel money into my retirement savings and still have excess to be able to afford basically whatever I want within reason and have an emergency fund while saving for a house.

Financial security is important to me as I saw my parents struggle with money when I was growing up. I want to advance my career while I can and make sure that when the time comes to start a family I can support them comfortably and I also want to be able to retire comfortably which is why I think starting young was important with compounding interest and shoveling money into my 401k.

I also travel a bit in my job and I think now is the good time to do it because I'm not tied down.

With that being said, I feel like I am missing out on a lot of things that people my age should be doing. I am able to get home on weekends fairly often to hang with friends, but I'm missing out on things like random Tuesday quizzos or going to watch the game with my boys. Dating has also been hard because I'm very busy and I work remotely so I dont meet local people at work.

I'm in better financial position than my friends are and I'm hoping that long term this grants me the ability to have some more fun.

But sometimes, I wonder, is it worth it? Should I focus more on my social life while I'm young and not worry about saving for retirement and money in general as much? For all I know I could die tomorrow or when I'm 40 and its all for nothing?

I thought it was selfish of her at the time, being the adult in the situation, not to comfort me rather than it having to be the other way around. It's like my choice of how I wanted to react was taken away from me.  

Maybe six years earlier, our house got burgled and they took my dad's car. When we found out in the morning, my mum and sister started crying, not just cause of the car but because of the thought other people had been our house while we were asleep. I was about to start crying too, but I remember that my dad put his hand on my shoulder and told me to keep it together for the others, even though I was the youngest one in the family by far.

I‚Äôm just wondering about the reasons behind boys and men choosing/being coerced to adopt troubling habits.

Also, I am not implying that each boy/man adopts these traits. 

Here are some of my ideas:
1) the feminization of lower and middle school grades has created a learning environment unfriendly to boys which causes them to be jaded toward school - the higher the number of boys who are jaded, the more likely it is that it will be acceptable or even cool to not care about school 
2) having a lack of guidance means there is a lack of control of a person‚Äôs life, and using video games to control the outcomes in that virtual reality world gives boys/men a sense of power.

Been dating this guy who is recently out of a serious relationship. At first he played it off like he was over it but then after a month or so he admitted he was feeling bad about the breakup again.... Apparently it was a bad breakup and it's obvious there's unresolved feels and we had a short falling out until recently.

We were on a date the other day and guess who walked into the restaurant - his ex. He immediately got super awkward, tried to not be seen, didn't really talk to me for a good 10-20minutes (focusing on the game on tv instead), I felt awkward... We got the check rather quickly and decided to go elsewhere. But even when leaving, he was walking like 20 ft in front of me! I felt like he didn't want to be seen with me and I was trailing him like a fucking puppy dog.

After the awkward settled, I ask about their relationship and he immediately got defensive and like I should've known better than to ask. (i think that's a bit insensitive to me, especially when the date was basically ruined) turned into a huge fight and he told me he didn't want to talk to me.  naturally, i pester more and air out the feelings i've held back about the situation, like he treats me like shit basically and has 0 respect for me. His response: nothing.  Cool, thanks for the confirmation.

When I was in college,  I drove 3 hours back home to see my old man. We ate dinner and hung out. When he went to bed I went to see some old high school friends. I called on my way over to see who's house they were at. They told me where and said they were back in my buddy's room at his folks place,  just come on in. So,  I grabbed an 18 pack and headed over. His old man was a hardass and was on call all the time so, being polite, I slipped off my shoes on my way in the front door and snuck down the hall quietly so as not to wake him or his mom up. The house was very quiet. When I got to his room, I opened the door, flipped on the light and stared at it... empty. I didn't keep up with him real well and had been away 3 years and it was at that exact moment,  at 12:30 am that I remembered it. His mom and dad moved after high school. My heart started beating out my fucking chest. My nostrils cleared and all my senses were on end with the adrenaline rush. Whose fucking house was I in?  Is there a dog? Do they know someone is in here. Do I call out, apologize, try to explain, and hope they don't come out with a gun? Or, do I sneak back out the front door and hope I haven't been noticed?  It's a rural town. Everyone has guns. I say fuck it. Flipped the light off and started tippy toeing my bitch ass back out the front door.

wortiz13,2019-03-11 02:49:15+00:00,How is/was dating after college?,"
I‚Äôm a senior in college and will be graduating in May. 

I recently got out of a 1.5 year relationship with a girl who I saw a future with, but unfortunately she fell out of love with me. I have been told that I am amazing and an incredible boyfriend/person, but I am worried that finding a great girl after graduation will be difficult due to working a lot and not being around tons of single girls. 

I‚Äôm not one to go to bars/parties - mostly the gym and church. I still have 2 months left in college, but instead of looking for someone, I‚Äôm still trying to learn from my past relationship, become an even better man, and work on friendships. 

Has anyone dated after college? How‚Äôd it go? I‚Äôm not looking for hookups, I‚Äôm into long term relationships. 

Thank you so much for reading ",AskMen,4360
M0shka,2019-03-09 17:26:59+00:00,"Men of Reddit, how do you deal with the waiter flirting with your date?","I clicked with this girl on Tinder and we decided to get drinks at Bahama Breeze (not the fanciest place but good enough for college kids) the other night. We met and everything was going great. We were sitting at the bar because she wanted to, and getting to know each other when the waiter comes over to ask for our drinks. 

She orders a Margarita and he goes, ""Really? I thought you'd be more of a pina colada kind of girl."" She goes, ""Oh, what makes you say that?"" And he says something I don't remember, but they start CONVERSING back and forth and I'm sitting behind there awkwardly like uhh. I mean, I'm usually pretty loud, but I didn't want to come off as being jealous or whatever so I just kept my mouth shut until I found an opportunity to jump into the conversation and chimed in with my opinion. He then *FINALLY* noticed me and asked if I wanted anything and I order a Mai Tai and he's like alright man let me get that for ya. 

Easy mistake I thought, he probably thought she was single considering she was sitting at the bar? Whatever. I'm not letting him get to me. Anyway, we start talking until he comes back with our drinks and he looks at her and goes, ""I got you 2 pineapples in your drink because you're special, but don't tell my boss or I'd get into trouble."" At this point I'm starting to get slightly annoyed but he walks away immediately after that instead of staying to talk so it wasn't that bad. 

We're now ordering food and I order just the salad because I actually like their salad. She orders fish tacos and he uncreatively (same fucking line as before) goes, ""haha, I pictured you more to be a Steak kind of girl."" And she replies with I LOVE steak, I was just ordering these because he *points at me* ordered the salad. I just shrugged like haha.. they then start talking about restaurants around Gainesville that serve good food and I just pull out my phone because I'm done at this point. 

After he leaves, I excuse myself to use the restroom and when returning, I see him at our table AGAIN talking to her. By the time I walk to my chair, he's making her laugh and he walks away after seeing me. I am completely thrown of any game. He was also kind of good-looking so it threw me off even more since I'm not nearly as physically attractive. 

At the end of the night, I ask her if she'd like to go for a walk outside but she says no because she's meeting her roommate here later. She gave me a hug goodbye.

There is always so much talk about penis size, and yes women do discuss it amongst themselves (bigger doesn't always mean better) but where's the open discussion about vaginas?

I want to know the ins and outs (pun intended) of vagina size / wetness / tightness / shape and so on. 

Do women really feel that different inside? What makes sex more or less enjoyable?
What does it feel like in there?

I know not all sex is heterosexual (duh) but I am curious specifically about the whole penis in vagina thing.

hawaiianthunder,2018-08-28 11:45:26+00:00,Ive been seeing this girl for 2 weeks now and I don‚Äôt really know her name. How do I casually learn her name at this point?,"I met this girl when I was completely smashed. We had a good time and we‚Äôve seen each other multiple times since. However, I don‚Äôt quite remember this girls name and I feel terrible. I suck at learning names and I‚Äôve gotten to the point where if you tell me your name I don‚Äôt even try to remember it. But since me and her hit it off, this way of thinking has backfired completely. 

Whenever I see her I say stuff like ‚Äúhey, girl!‚Äù or things that dance along the lines of greeting you but not acknowledging your name. I fear that sooner or later this charade will come to an end and I‚Äôd really like to not lose her because I‚Äôm super into her. 

I‚Äôve contemplated on asking her how to spell her name, or maybe even asking what her last name is. So far searching her number into Facebook and Google has not yielded anything conclusive. All I know is that she‚Äôs Columbian and I think she has a Spanish name. Possible Felicia, but I‚Äôd hate to guess it and be wrong.

Should I come out and ask her what her name is and risk the back lash or can I play ignorance that I don‚Äôt speak Spanish and it didn‚Äôt really stick? ",AskMen,4784

The 20 somethings Ive tried talking to still wont work and live with their parents and want to be treated like princesses that get everything handed to them (boys and girls). And Ive tried the tinder thing and its been pretty horrible. Even without tinder people just want to keep being one upped with everything. Well you need a funnier pick up line than that, you need to take me on a better date than last week, you need to buy the more expensive alcohol this time, or whatever it is.

She based this on guys she know, which also led her to think that women have higher sex drives then men because the guys she know have a lower drive than their significant others. I should mentioned though that she's adverse to people being called ""weird"" or not ""normal"" due to her childhood experiences of being a social outcast from being thought of as the weird girl. 

Given that I'm a guy, my experiences have told me otherwise that male friendships are more activity based(with psychological studies even stating this). We may call it each other, but most of the time it's to set up or plan something. Sometimes we do talk over the phone, but it's only when something serious happens.

Alternately, is there anything you'd personally want to see more of that you rarely or never do? Can go for pics, bios, etc.

My girlfriend and I's favorite food is any kind of breakfast item. We fucking love breakfast food, on an almost Ron Swanson/Leslie Knope-esque level. Anyway, we were searching for a breakfast spot one saturday morning around town, and everything had a long wait, or sounded really unappealing - like IHOP. So we decided to swing into some hole in the wall cafe we'd seen a million times. Best. Food. Ever. We go every single Saturday morning without fail now. We always get the same waitress, who knows our names and brings us our coffee and water right as we're taking our seats. It's our own personal heaven, and it's the perfect reset switch for both of us after long weeks of work and other life stresses. We sit and tell stories, sip our coffee, eat our omelettes and pancakes. Looking at her across the table every saturday morning always makes me think of how much I love her and the things we do together. It's the one ultimately meaningless activity we have that helps us connect, and I love it. ",AskMen,2769

Dating though, that's only slightly easier. You still have to deal with ghosts, flakes, girls (or guys) who think you're cute but don't like your personality/lifestyle enough to pursue you, being led on, situations where there's mutual attraction but one of you is too shy to express/reciprocate interest, awkward/shitty first dates, missed connections, unhealthy relationships, being used, etc. The only difference between that and being average/unattractive is the frequency at which all those things happen. Being attractive doesn't automatically give you a fulfilling dating life or a dating life in the first place, it isn't the ""get out of singlehood free"" card some guys think it is.",AskMen,1676

What are your thoughts?","Okay so I began seeing a guy about three months ago. He was very sweet and kind and we hit things off very quickly. I first noticed that when I went over to his place , it stunk very badly. It smelt like old dirty clothes that hadn‚Äôt been washed in weeks, I was very upfront in telling him that it was an unpleasant smell and he should probably take care of it. I seemed to only notice the smell when I was at his place so I assumed it was that he just did not do a great job at cleaning. One night we were kissing and I was very very in the mood. I was about to go down on him when I reached just about at his belly button I got a horrible whiff of something. I didn‚Äôt want to be rude and didn‚Äôt know how to address the situation. I continued kissing him for another 10 minutes and then just suggested that we cuddled. My thoughts were maybe that he hadn‚Äôt showered before I came over and because he goes to the gym regularly he was probably just very sweaty. Again , I completely over looked it. Another time we were about to hook up when I pulled his pants down it smelt like straight ass and sweat. I have him a handjob and said that I had a mouth sore and didn‚Äôt want anything to happen. At this point I began to get irritated and tried to figure out how I would address the situation. The last straw was when I suggested that we shower together (so I could make sure he was showering before we had sex, as up to this point I assumed the stench was coming from him not showering after the gym) We kisses and hugged and I hopped in the shower first. As he took off his clothes his back was to me and that‚Äôs when I saw what appeared to be dried poop residue?? I don‚Äôt even know what to call it. I figured he did not wipe correctly and I said ‚Äúwe aren‚Äôt gonna have sex until you make sure you‚Äôre spotless‚Äù and he said ‚Äú what do you mean?‚Äù I said ‚Äú make sure you clean your ass because it doesn‚Äôt look like you finished wiping earlier‚Äù he then said he did wipe but he‚Äôs not gonna get ‚Äúall the way in there because that‚Äôs not right‚Äù I was very confused and he continued explaining ‚Äú no man is putting anything that deep in their crack unless their gay, it‚Äôs emasculating‚Äù I got out the shower and he acted like he had not clue as to why I was upset.

jeremypimping,2018-05-01 20:51:02+00:00,How can I stop crying when being reprimanded?,"So I don't really know what to call it. I've had it happen at work twice and I just feel awful about it. The first time I experienced it I was sat down and the boss just went through a list of ~20 things that I basically suck at. By the time we got to the end of the list, I was full pledge crying. You know, like a baby. 

Today I experienced something similar at work. I work for a new company, and a bunch of information didn't get passed around correctly. We had a huge job to replace a few projector screens and a bunch of equipment to control it. Someone up the food chain made a mistake and we got the wrong screens. We finished all the work we could do and went back to the office. Upon getting back to the office I went to talk to the design person and asked them what was going on. Upon entering my bosses office to talk to him about the day, he just exploded and started cursing. He yelled at me for me not telling him anything (which I came to do) and I just couldn't help but cry. 

I feel that it's because i'm already upset about the day, and I start to be blamed for things not going right. I understand that i'm an adult (26) and people get yelled at...but I just don't want to cry when shit like this happens. Is there something I can do on my own to help stop that reaction, or is it something I need professional help with?

I felt guilty after getting that. Like I said, I don't have any dating experience. We're both in college at the same school. Obviously we both have stuff going on. I try to see her as much as I can to get food, do homework, or occasionally hang out doing something else.

One particular friend comes with a smoking hot lady, and we briefly wonder if it's his new gf. He says she's not. Says he literally met her less than an hour ago at a bar, and she wanted to tag along for this party. He knows next to nothing beyond her name.

Everyone sits around, chilling, playing games, drinking etc. I make small talk with this pretty lady, and after chit-chatting for some twenty minutes or so, she suddenly asks me who are the two toughest, baddest men in the party.

""Ummm.... Mike?"" I pointed to a bodybuilder relaxing on the sofa. ""And Billy."" I pointed to a soldier having drinks with several others.

She cups her mouth and yells, ""YO BILLY! Mike thinks you are weak shit!""

She causes a commotion. Mike and Billy comes rushing over, looking bewildered. She points at Mike(whom she has never even met before), ""Hey Mike! Tell Billy what you just said about him!""

Mike glances at her. ""Who the hell are you?""

She giggles. ""Stop pretending, Mikey! You said you could hand Billy his ass.""

I waved my arms. ""Whoa! Whoa! Mike didn't say any of this. She's making it up!""

""Stop protecting Mike!"" She punches my shoulder. ""Billy, come on! You aren't gonna let this stand, are you?""

Thankfully, Billy and Mike quickly work out she's just sprouting random crap, so they let it pass. I stood up, and left her too, unwilling to be a part of her next drama.

Whenever I bring in food that I cooked to work, people tell me I need to get a wife so I don‚Äôt have to cook my own meals or people will make jealous comments about how my meals look (even if it something simple like chicken and rice) .

Also people, especially young people in their early twenties, that I work with will make fun of how I talk or sometimes they will give me shit about keeping to myself. There is one kid that always talks shit about me when I‚Äôm sitting across the room  where I can barely hear him and people will look over at me and start laughing but when I ask the kid what exactly he said he just laughs or walks away. When dealing with other people I ask a legit question and get a sarcastic response it really hurts my feelings. I have never been able to handle sarcasm without getting upset because I never know how best to respond to it.

RampagingKoala,2018-01-21 01:51:01+00:00,"Mod Post: ""Journalists"" are taking your content","Sup shitlords,

So despite what you may believe, there are sites outside of reddit.  Most of them are bad sites, but moderately worse than this one.  At any rate, writers for garbage dumps like Buzzfeed, Elite Daily, Medium, and others have often posted questions with the intent of using your answers in shitty ""articles"" that are mostly comprised of a creatively stunted desperate ""blogger"" in need of money copy-pasting your answers directly into an article.  

While we can't get these articles taken down or ban the perpetrators (unless they're stupid enough to use their real name in their username or something), we will find it best to remind you that despite the echo chamber that our sub has become, we still have almost 500k users coming to this sub.  The likelihood that your answers will make their way into the hands of creatively bankrupt flunkeys like this is high enough to remind you that if you are worried about someone you care about seeing your answers on this sub and thinking ""wow that person is a shithead"" even if they don't know it's you, maybe don't be such a fucking shithead.  

I am by no means giving license to those deplorably idiotic scavengers who can't string two words together so they must copy the words of others, I'm just saying that we can't control what they do.  So yeah, you might get published on some website if you give a stupid answer.  If you don't care, more power to you.  If you care, sucks to be you.  Maybe get over it.  Or don't get over it but watch what you post.  So clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose would be my advice to you here.

Love,

Also, if you could invent a better app, what would be different about it?","In the last couple of months, OkCupid has basically been in a downward spiral, as I am sure many of you know. Here are some issues I find with the current app:

- It is incredibly clunky to use and is not a fluid experience (tons of pop ups, inconsistencies). I feel like I am being forced to behave in a way I do not wish to behave
- You have to like someone to message them
- They seem to be Tinderfying themselves...I tried going with their flow, and just liking a lot of people, and now I am blocked from liking and see the message ""We're glad you like so many people but...Try messaging someone you liked and set up a date"". I did message people and I am still blocked

In real life relationships, there is something called [Stonewalling](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/anger-in-the-age-entitlement/201212/how-ruin-perfectly-good-relationship-0). Stonewalling is a refusal to communicate or cooperate, and is a behavior that typically leads to divorce or otherwise broken relationships. 

Now if you look at the world of Interaction Design (app design) much of our assumptions are based on psychology research. Believe it or not we have relationships with apps. With this in mind it feels like I am being stonewalled by the app, I do not feel like I can express myself within the app any longer. 

One obvious thought is ""Hey! I could do way better if I made an app!""
I work in the field, and I would very much like to make a competing app. But I am not sure what the value proposition would be ‚Äì and I'd love to hear your thoughts on what you would do different than the options we have today (all trash as far as I am concerned). 

____

Edit: My main man /u/fasterfind has a really good point - less images and more words - which I agree with. I have had much more success with women who actually have stuff written down in their profile (I actually have the most success with those who write a healthy amount, not just a few sentences).

Some other suggestions in this thread:

- Move to Coffee Meets Bagel (never heard of this before now, but they also limit use, and as far as I am concerned it is another app with a broken experience).

- Quizes/questions (OKC used to stress this more, with a relevant Match percentage, but the Match percentage is now diluted and you can't tell what is a good Match)

- Match people according to the number of images they have, if they have no images, limit their use (some kinks need working out here but I generally like this)

- Enable message filters to filter out messages with a certain length, so that if someone is interested in long messages they will see those. I would also add that we have technology that can gauge relevance (ie if someone messages me about Breaking Bad, because it is on my profile).",AskMen,1032

She walked over to say hi to a couple of people at the table next to me and my attention was drawn to her in pretty profound way. She had an energy around her, a sense of excitement and confidence that made it feel like she had lived a rich, compelling life and it had rendered her inexorably an *interesting* person.

It made recall that not too long, I could radiate the same kind of people-drawing sense of promise and unguarded ambition. Now, on the wrong end of my 20s and having settled into a routine that robs me of imagination on a daily basis, I'm wondering how to get back. I've squandered opportunities and sometimes walked away from potential forks in the road out of fear or disinterest. By and large, I played it safe and it has made me into a pleasant, well-spoken, knowledgeable person with very little significant life experience.

I suppose what it all comes to down is a question - do you ever feel like me? Or if you used to, what did you do to remedy the situation? And does it ever seem that truly compelling people seem to exist in a universe entirely independent of your own?

So recently it has come to our attention that a user has been getting PMs and a ton of harassment even resulting in posts on this sub or others.  I just wanted to take the opportunity to remind all of you that doing this will get you banned sitewide. Personal attacks in the sub are not permitted in this sub, and if we find out they got taken to PM, they'll result in a site wide ban. 

Furthermore, I'd like to remind all of you salty little turd nuggets that if you have a problem with the way any moderator of acting, please message the mod mail. Making passive aggressive posts about ""muh free speech"" will just be removed and then we'll have a short internal discussion about your future on the sub (I say short because spending any amount of time on the losers who do this is honestly more cycles than are required). 

Oh yeah and if any of you salty peanuts decide that you want to go whine in other subs to try and earn sympathy for acting like idiots, just be aware that we know you're doing it and we'll find out.

Lastly, I wanted to point out the cognitive dissonance in users who simultaneously complain about a bad love life while harassing women on the internet with dick pics and other things. If you can't realize that the reason you don't have a partner is due to your hideous personality and behavior then I'm personally glad you don't have the chance to reproduce.

Wolfey1618,2017-09-30 13:59:16+00:00,How do I get rid of my girlfriends expectation to Skype with me literally every night when I go to sleep?,"She's gotten into this habit over the last year where she Skypes me when she's trying to fall asleep and it has become an *every single night* thing. I don't wanna be a dick and tell her to go fall asleep on her own, because she'll just cry for 3 hours straight and take even longer to sleep.

I like to play video games and unwind at night, especially with friends. Literally the only time I can play games and talk to friends is at night. I'm growing more and more distant to my friends now because she takes up this time that I'd normally be spending with them.

I've already tried talking to her about this several times, and she'll say she's sorry, and then proceed to start asking me if I want to skype, rather than assuming it, and if I say no, I get the cold shoulder the next day, so I end up saying yes every once and awhile and boom we're back into the cycle where it's expected again.

Update: Alrighty, it's pretty concretely decided that I should end this relationship, I totally agree. Now the logistics of *how* I should do that, are my main concern. She gets out of work in about 2 hours (I think?) and I am supposed to be picking her up and we're going to dinner because she has coupons for it. 

Should I break it to her when I pick her up? Simply tell her when I pick her up and leave, or should I offer to take her out for some closure?

Should I wait till the night is over to do it? If I do that, she's gonna expect sex, and I am not about to do that with her with this on my mind, that's just wrong. She will wonder what is up, and probably immediately resort to crying. 

I could also be a dick and do it over the phone.

Any suggestions?

Update 2: Go figure, she had a co-worker walk out and quit mid-shift, so they asked her to stay until close. 

As a result, I ended up not seeing her, but I straight up told her I was gonna play games with friends and I might go to bed early. She whined for a few minutes but I stood my ground and she said ""alright"" and we proceded to not talk for the rest of the night besides saying good night.

Now I don't know what to do, because she actually respected my space for once. Is there a light at the end of the tunnel, or is this just another false positive?

I will be seeing her at 2 today regardless because we have an event at college we're both required to be at.",AskMen,1651

RampagingKoala,2017-07-12 18:10:34+00:00,Net Neutrality Bullshit and Why It Matters,"Sup shitlords,

So you may have noticed that the admins are spouting off about this ‚Äúnet neutrality‚Äù stuff and they even have this fun popup that makes everything slower in an attempt to prove why net neutrality is so good and why we need it.  So let me assume that none of you know what the internet is and how it works and explain why net neutrality is important in the derogatory fashion you have all come to expect from this sub.

Imagine that the internet is your mother.  You and your shutin siblings have split up your parents basement and have your own corner of the room.  Now your mother is a kind mother, and caters to you all equally.  Whenever you ask for something, she gives you as much time as she has and does everything as quickly as possible because for some reason, she loves your greasy ass.  This is the internet as it should be: everybody makes requests and gets as much time (bandwidth) as they need and everything is done as fast as possible (latency).  Even if your sister is a needy bitch and always asks for stuff, as long as you make your requests, they will be processed in the order they are received.  That way, nobody is more important than anyone else.

Now imagine that your needy bitch of a sister is a daddy‚Äôs girl, and your dad wants your mom to do more stuff for your sister than she does for you.  Your dad thinks that her problems are more important than yours and therefore deserve priority.  Your dad keeps going on about how you‚Äôre lazy, you can‚Äôt get a job, and you don‚Äôt have a girlfriend because you‚Äôre a weeb piece of shit who lives in your parent‚Äôs basement.  Therefore, in his mind, her requests should come first.  Even if you ask your mom for something before she does, your sister and your dad think that her request should take priority for your mom because she‚Äôs the baby of the family and asks for more stuff.  Not only that, your dad thinks that if you want more stuff from your mom, then you should do chores to get it.  That‚Äôs not fair to you, right?  You use your mom just like everybody else in your neighborhood: everybody should have equal access to her (like they already don‚Äôt).  Your requests should mean just as much as your sister‚Äôs, regardless of who she is.  Because that‚Äôs the beauty of the your mom: in her eyes, you‚Äôre all her disgusting little spawn.  

In this case, the ISPs are your dad.  Since they get more attention (and money) from bigger, needier companies (your sister), it‚Äôs in their best interest to give better service to them because it will net them more money (or more attention because your dad is weird like that).  Which makes sense, but it shouldn‚Äôt affect how you browse the internet.  Because if you could clone your mom (aka provide more resources for consumption), then this wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal.  But ISPs are cheap, dirty little bastards, and they don‚Äôt want to provide us more resources, they want to redistribute the resources they already have and give more of them to the bigger companies.  Not only that, they want to charge you more for using the current service you have because they‚Äôre going to downgrade you.  ISPs are against net neutrality because they say it allows them to ‚Äúinnovate‚Äù, but really it just allows them to fuck over laymen like you and me to create more pay-for-basic-service options that will hurt our wallets, because at their core, they recognize the same thing we do: that the internet is a utility and everyone needs it.

So how can you stop your dad from denying you of your delicious tendies?  Easy, do the same thing you do in the real world: complain to the government.  Go **[here](https://www.battleforthenet.com/)** and send a letter to the FCC (it‚Äôs super easy, I did it myself) and you can even call if they don‚Äôt answer in a couple hours (those roastie government stooges how dare they ignore my messages ree and such).  This is super important.  These companies have blocked services they don‚Äôt like in the past and they‚Äôll do it again.  All you losers who make tons of alt accounts to get around bans can surely make a couple of alt emails to use on battleforthenet.  Put your shitposting and trolling skills to work and save the internet!

Have a nice day,

leStarryNights,2017-07-09 10:01:42+00:00,"Caught my girlfriend going through my PC and phone, how to handle this?","We've been dating for 6 months now. We don't live together. I'm 32(m), she's 24(f). This PC is a desktop/gaming rig in my bedroom.
So last night, she came over. We went to watch a movie (Into the wild) around 9. I fell asleep, and woke up close to midnight to her on my computer. As soon as she noticed me awake she quickly closed what she was doing and gets back in bed with me. Didn't really think anything of it at the time, but it's about half an hour after the movie ended.

A little later, I start to pass out again. I feel her get up and open my eyes to her starting to open either Chrome or going into files on the computer (Something with a white background), and again closes is it as soon as she noticed I was up. Didn't say anything, but seriously it looked shady as hell.

Now, this follows her saying earlier in the night that I was supposedly stalking one of her friends on Facebook. I knew who she was talking about because I had typed her friends name in FB before to find her when we initially started dating. Piqued my interest because I'd never met her, but talked about her often. The problem here is no one would know this unless she went into my phone or PC, went onto Facebook and looked at the saved browser history in the search bar.

I feel like both of these are huge breaches of trust, and were triggered for no reason. I've never asked to see her phone or laptop, we've never discussed this kind of thing but she knows I'm not the type of guy to hand this stuff over to someone. I don't think anyone has a right to any of this kind of personal information, either

Accardi_Don,2017-07-07 00:29:59+00:00,"I scored a date. I know shouldn't have but on a whim I found her twitter account, and its the most obnoxious thing I've ever seen. I don't want the date anymore. How to proceed?","Am I overreacting?!? On some level I feel as though this is grossly unfair to her. But then I reread the tweets she puts out....

Edit: this blew up like a basic bitch on twitter....

For those of you curious we met on OkCupid and talked on kik. Bonded over our mutual love of trance music and working in art.

Anyways I've given it a lot of thought and while I *do* understand why the overwhelming majority of you think I should run/ghost her, I have also been the recipient of ghosting, and being on the receiving end isn't fun.

I'm going on the date tonight. We'll see how much her overbearing single lady attitude on Twitter spills over to real life. Hopefully as some of you say, she is much more grounded and humble in person.

Finally to those of you advocating *hit it and quit it*. FUCK NO. This is potential crazy we're dealing with, proceed with intense caution until crazy levels have been assessed.

Edit #2: Guys I'm back from the date. It was shit, so so *SO* shit. I'm tired and pissed. Will elaborate tomorrow morning.

Edit #3: Here's the story: I show up at the coffee house/bar waiting for her and she turns up 30 minutes late. When she finally arrives, the first thing she says is that she pregamed before meeting me. Not the best way to start the date but here goes:

* Ask her if she wants something else to drink (makes sense to ask right?) *Are you implying that I'm an alcoholic?!?!*
* After that awkward exchange, we get to talking as our coffee gets ready. Immediately brings up that she got kicked out of her ex's apartment and that he is seeing an older woman who works as a teacher
* Called her mom trash at one point
* She talked about how her ex spread lies about her and I responded with a joke about ""fake news"" She immediately asked if I was a Trump supporting pig (her exact words)
* Have awkward talk/argument about the ""fake news"" meme
* After I convince her I am *definately* not a fascist, she talks about how she has never orgasmed. I don't know HOW we got to that subject.
* Try to change the subject to something chill like music and had the *GALL* to ask her if she knew about music outside EDM (which we had talked about alot through text) She promptly took my question the wrong way as me being sexist and presuming she didn't know shit about music.
* Any question I asked was mostly taken in bad faith.
* After 2 cups of coffee and some pastries she decides that she wants alcohol NOW even though she refused my offer before claiming that she wasn't an alcoholic.
* Give her credit, she finished 4 glasses of Sweetwater IPA. I only had 2. Also I had to pay for everything because I'm stupid.
* As she got tipsy, she decided to let me know that Linda Sarsour is a bad bitch. Demanded that I agree with her. I have Jewish friends so I said no.
* I fucked up by saying that
* She asked if I was privy to the whole social justice thingy. That conversation got really loud on her end.
* I'm pretty sure she tried to say ""don't be a tio Juan"" but she was too drunk to say the words correctly.
* At the end of the date, I offered to drive her drunk ass home and she got mad and told the poor server that I was acting predatory. 
* I made sure all tabs were closed and left.

bipbopi,2017-07-02 15:52:04+00:00,How unapproachable is the hijab?,"I wear the hijab, but I'm not very religious. It's really more of a vestigial feature of my religious past. I don't wear all the time (read: social outings, concerts, running errands, the occasional walk), but I wear it enough such that it is a part of my social and formal identity. When I do wear it, it's more along the lines of [this](http://i.imgur.com/l7d4f3w.jpg) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/9x7VgkV.jpg), with more hair showing.

I can't completely take it off because I'm still partially dependent on my family (even though I no longer live with them) and they would be severely disappointed if I took it off. I recognize that this is a problem, but it's an incredibly delicate, difficult and overall shitty situation to be in.

I don't really expect most people to be okay with it, but I'm wondering how it will affect my social life in graduate school. Part of me is looking forward to dating/new friendships as I start this next phase of my life, but the other part acknowledges that anything of the sort will be difficult at best.

**EDIT: Crazy how much this post blew up**.

Thank you all for the honesty. I think this whole thing pretty much just verified my suspicions, and I in no way blame or feel disdain for those who vehemently rejected the idea of me (contrary to what many of you lovely folk commented here). Still, this was informative, and I'll keep a lot of this in mind when I start grad school this fall. 

Just to clarify a few things:

- Yes, I am still financially dependent on my parents. I think it would be kinda dumb of me to cut ties with them when I have no way of supporting myself. Obviously, the hijab is something I will reconsider altogether once I can completely depend on myself in a couple years.

- I'm not actively looking to date someone. I'm also not just open to dating exclusively in one race/ethnicity/religion. I just wanted to gauge my chances at finding someone/anyone (friendship or relationship-wise) if I put myself out there, regardless of religion. 

- Because many of you were asking: Most people, in my experience, are very friendly toward me. I'm friendly back. I'm able to have interesting conversations with strangers (male, female, atheist, muslim, middle-aged etc.) that were not initiated by me. I have yet to have a hateful interaction with a stranger. I have actually been pleasantly surprised by how tolerant and accepting most of the people I encounter on a daily basis are. 

- I have been in a relationship before. But that was one that grew more from a friendship with someone with a similar background as mine. I have also been asked out before, by both Muslim and non-religious guys. Again, this happens more from becoming friends with someone over a long period of time than just straight-up being asked out. 

- Also most parents and families don't really give a shit what their kids do. It's all about maintaining an image, which is what the hijab all really is nowadays. I don't have a hoard of family members out to get whoever I date. In fact, my parents are pretty divided on the matter: one would love to see me get a boyfriend and often encourages me to date, and the other doesn't seem to care as long as I don't involve them. This is generally the case with most Muslim girls - pls don't assume we all come from traditionalist asshole families.

greenleaf187,2017-06-30 13:43:17+00:00,I cheated and I feel like crap. Not sure how to tell my girlfriend.,"Background story: I've been dating my current girlfriend for almost a year. In fact, we are celebrating our anniversary next month. She's a wonderful person who has been nothing but fully supportive of whatever I do. I've started a low carb diet and lost around 40 pounds in 6 months. While everyone was criticizing it (oh you need carbs, this is unhealthy, blah blah blah), she was there for me through and through. In fact, she got on the same diet and lost 5 pounds just so we both have the same routine and plan. Throughout my weight loss journey, she'd always compliment me and make me feel better about myself (I kind of had some self-esteem issues). I've reached my weight goal a few weeks ago and I'm over the moon. I've been hitting the gym to gain muscle, joined and completed marathons, but the most surprising out of all was the attention I've been getting from women. Something that never happened before. 

So last night, I was out with a few friends without the gf. She claimed to have a headache, but I'm pretty sure she's planning our anniversary (she loves planning stuff). I get to the bar, and there were a bunch of people that I haven't seen since highschool 10 years ago. One of which was a cute girl I remember from back then. I was chatting with her throughout the whole night. She was so amused by my weight loss and she told me how she wants to become a nutritionist and help people out. We had so much in common that made me lose track of how much I drank. Since I'm on low carb, alcohol gets me drunk so much faster. Everyone gets drunk also and decides to head back to the girls place. I, on the other hand, was completely wasted so I can't remember most of what happened. I woke up in the morning with one hell of a hangover, and my friend filled me up with all the events from last night. I was mortified. Apparently, they all got pizza and I ate a whole meat cravers pan crust with extra cheese pizza all by myself. I can already see the disappointment in my gfs face.

Actual dog food is pretty gross, but I've tried his treats and they're pretty alright. I won't go into details, but basically I have a lifetime supply of dog treats. So 1 or 2 treats once in a while turned into 1 or 2 treats a day. Whenever I get the munchies after a toke, I practically eat them anytime my dog eats them. I've chowed down entire boxes of we're being honest. But I want to stop because first off, I don't think it's healthy. They make my stomach feel really... let's just say I put on practically no weight. Secondly, my friends humiliate me. They treat me just like a dog. They'll boss me around, and tell me to go run errands with my dog. I've tried standing up for myself, but they offer me some dog treats to get their way, and you know, I'm not gonna say no, so I usually end up doing whatever they want me to. The thing is, I'm becoming pretty dependent on the dog treats, to the point that anytime I come across any other food, I scarf an insane amount down. I took a long look at my life, and I realize all I do is hang out in the back of my friends van. I dropped out of high school. I don't have a real job, I've been wearing the same clothes for what seems like forever, I look like a druggy, and most of my social experiences include being chased by lunatics all because I couldn't say no to some dog treats.

Send help pls.

Update 1: I got ready for the day, and came back to Gonzalo sitting on the bed. He seems tired, I think his *spinning* class wore him out this morning.

Update 2: I put him in a Clif bar box I found. He seems cozy in there. I'll add some grass and what not when I get back from lunch. Turns out he enjoys Elton John so I've been playing that for him.

Update 3: Put some grass and flies in there for little Gonzalo. Will try to get pics later. Changed the tunes to the likes of Led Zeppelin. We'll keep going with this classic rock selection and see how much he enjoys it. Gonzalo said earlier: ""It *bugs* me that they don't make them like they used to,"" when asked what he thought of classic rock. I think we'll be good friends.

Update 4: Played Led Zeppelin IV for him, he really liked that one. He complimented me on my music choices. Started playing something completely different, Fleet Foxes, and I think it's slowly growing on him. Going to buy some edibles for us to eat after work, he seems the type to enjoy getting high.

Update 5: Came home from work. Gonzalo was still chillin like a villain. He hadn't eaten any of the flies yet, but I think he did drink up the soaked cotton ball. He still seems pretty hung up on the ex though, so I'm taking him with me to my coworker's to get really drunk and help take his mind off things. More updates to come! (and hopefully pics, but I never use imgur or anything)

Update 6/Final: So, went to coworker's, smoked a ton and watched Archer and Rick and Morty. I fell asleep with Gonzalo in his room on the table. I woke up around 4 am and went to check on Gonzo, and he was gone. $20 was missing out of my wallet, but a note saying ""appreciate everything. so long and thanks for the flies"" was tucked inside. I'm at a loss for words because I never got to say goodbye. He talked about leaving again but I thought that was just the THC talking... I guess I was wrong. He was too good for this town, and maybe one day our paths will cross again. *cue Don't You Forget About Me*

Edit: still don't know what kind of spider it was, all I know is that it's small and dark brown. It likes classic rock, and has a good tolerance for THC. Also enjoys watching 90s sitcoms, so if you know any species of spider that matches that description, let me know.",AskMen,1673

RampagingKoala,2017-04-08 16:28:26+00:00,MOD POST: YOU ARE BEING USED...FOR CLICKBAIT,"Sup shitlords,

So recently, it has come to our attention that posts in askmen are being [used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLInFcV0vjk) as material for a sex+dating blog, which is ironic because you're all virgins who can't even talk to women so all this information seems tainted.  Now you might ask, ""RK, how do you know these articles are stolen from Askmen?"" which is a very valid question.  Well, the writer in question references a thread directly and [doesn't even bother quoting](http://i.imgur.com/hVdYRRA.png), as seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/Cg2fhn1.png).  That ""weird reddit thread"" is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/5xmn9f/at_what_age_did_you_decide_you_needed_to_settle/) thread.  That was our first clue.

Our second clue was them referencing quotes that one of our mods wrote, as seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/IZQR5wW.png).  We also recognized users from [this](http://i.imgur.com/EvmXrXH.jpg) post.  Now you might say ""RK, those posts could be from anywhere on the site"", but we know you guys are friendless parasites who only post here to validate yourselves, so these comments really couldn't have come from anywhere else.  Also, since I don't have a place to put this other screenshot, please go take a look at [this one too](http://i.imgur.com/hDQ6wmY.jpg).

Now you might be saying ""Wow this bitch needs to go down in a big way, I'm gonna go flood her inbox with pictures of my dick"" or whatever [juvenile response](http://imgur.com/fs8Eg85) you come up with when someone on the internet disrespects you.  But I am specifically telling you NOT to do that, and if we get a single PM of people complaining of harassment related to this, we will go straight to the admins, because doxxing can result in a site-wide ban, so [don't fucking do it.](http://imgur.com/a/0Yuzm)  No matter how [mad](https://i.imgur.com/LEmKh.png) you are, just remember that if you respond, a writer like this will take the responses and surely make an article about it no matter how much we want her to [stop](https://i.imgur.com/GDydgmJ.png).  Living well is the best revenge, so just take comfort in the fact that your responses are [insightful](http://imgur.com/mXyupD1.gif) enough for someone to take them and make a living off of them. 

So in summary: Writer stealing content, don't do anything.

Thanks and [have a blessed day](https://i.imgur.com/ji3rn9k.mp4)!

We've been seeing a lot of posts seeking validation for doing the most mundane things possible including but not limited to:

* Asking if wearing sports bras at the gym is okay

* Asking if guys are attracted to larger bellies

* Asking if guys are attracted to women wearing heels

* Asking if guys are attracted to women wearing glasses

* Asking if guys like women who lift

* Asking if guys like women who DON'T lift

* Asking if guys like women who play sports

* Asking if guys like women who like video games

* Asking if guys like women who read and don't watch TV

* Asking if guys like women who don't use social media

* Asking if guys like women who use social media a lot

* Asking if guys like women who use social media occasionally

* Asking if guys like women who watch porn

Jesus christ, are you so insecure that every single thing you do must trigger some primal fear inside you that you are unlovable?  If that is the case, then you are probably beyond help from the whiny virgin teenagers that comprise Askmen.  Asking us if you're attractive is like asking coal miners if your kitchen is clean; the opinion you want holds little value because you don't want them in your kitchen to begin with.

The answer to all of these questions is yes, some guy is attracted to that, and you need to chill out.  But also, all of these questions are just trying to seek validation from a group of whiny virgins all too eager to give it to lonely manic pixie dream girls.  So from here on out, we're banning thinly veiled validation questions.  The answer to all of them is ""some guy will find you attractive, get off the internet and find him"", and they're only contributing to the AskMen pity party.

Two days later my phone rings from our neighbour asking why there is a fire truck and ambulance at my house. My 5 year old and 13 year old boys were there playing video games while she laid down in bed not feeling well and had a heart attack apparently. Doctors said she went 45 minutes plus without oxygen to her brain. My 13 year old said that the little one came and said that Mum won't wake up. Her parents are acting like i murdered her and swept my children to their house. Her family is huge and I have none. They were my Family. They are telling me that we were separated and it doesn't matter how long. I was a stay at home dad and also worked nights in the family business. I have a Legal Aid lawyer but they have said i need a private bar lawyer to pursue property issues. I have no money for that. They went into my house and took all the legal documents and jewelry. They took her phone and read all of our intimate text messages. I have had a complete mental breakdown and have so far left my children with them as not to upset them any further and have been dealing with this solely by Myself. How can people be like this regardless of their opinion of our life. We were happy and did it on our own. Just trying to type this out and maybe see what anyone else has to say. I am so confused and broken. Why do these people think my children should lose both parents because we were in a deep argument. 16 years, 10 months and 30 days we were together. House paid off. We must have been doing something right but not according to these people. I am no perfect angel but my heart has always been in the right place. They are very wealthy. All of a sudden my Daughter wont take the phone to speak to me which was a complete surprise yesterday. We did family hugs and said i love you daily. I have always been there and been over the top protective. If they had a problem with my parenting why have they never said it before and now tell me they are ""protecting"" them? I was always a good loving Dad. I am so worried about my children these people are not what my kids need. they need to be with me. They have been with me their entire lives and now this? How can they do this? I miss her so much. I want to comfort my children. They told me to get my ""stuff"" together and in the future I can be the Dad again and they will be the Grandparents. Wth? Who made them the powers of the universe. I need help.

I don't know if this is the right sub.
There is so much more to the story.
Is there anybody out there? I am reaching out to the internet for this as i am stumped legally and so much more.
I am in Canada if that matters

My girlfriend hit me with this question last night.
""Hypothetically if we completely stopped having sex until marriage would you stay with me?""

Mind you we're 20 years old. I don't know when marriage is even on the table. She claims she doesn't want to be married anytime soon. And we've already been fucking like rabbits for 10 months. She literally changed her birth control so we could do it more.

I said ""Yeah, I would be very unhappy being sexless for 3+ years.""

This upset her to the point of tears. Saying I only want her for sex etc etc. I just want sex. It's not the only thing I want. I like plenty of other stuff about her she just won't listen. I don't see how completely removing a part of our relationship would help anyone. A part of our relationship that we both enjoy. Sometimes she just shows up and asks to get fucked. She's a very sexual person.

I just don't see why she'd want me to say ""Yes I'd be okay with being in a sexless relationship for 3+ years."" I'd just be upset and frustrated I don't get it.

EDIT: For those saying this was a shit test I intentionally answered honestly. Cause I don't see the point in lying.

EDIT: She called me wanting to talk about the situation. I wanted to wait until she wasn't at work cause she's going to cry the whole day now and fuck her job situation up. I want her to be employed.

SunnyRaja2,2016-10-11 03:28:09+00:00,"For those who felt ""empty"" as teenagers, how did you feel?","My 17 year old son took his life a week ago. All of his family and friends were shocked. I had been worried about him, though. I didn't think he was depressed, but he seemed much more indifferent to life. He never was a kid who seemed to have much emotion - not unhappy or happy. (He wasn't on the autism spectrum.) He was well-liked, he was ranked #1 in his class of almost 500, he was athletic, and he was attractive (per his peers; I always thought so, too, but I'm biased). He had such a high ACT score that he was able to complete abbreviated college applications, and he already was received early acceptance to some colleges to study engineering. Paying for college was not a concern.

I'm not trying to brag. I'm trying to show that, on paper, he should feel good about himself, and confident about the future. But, he didn't/wasn't. He thought about the world and himself in black and white terms, and I truly think he thought he wasn't good enough. Even though everyone said he was the nicest, happiest kid they knew, I never thought he was comfortable in his own skin. He played a lot of video games in his free time, after school and sports. Video games seemed to be the only thing he truly cared about, and he did share with me that he wasn't looking forward to being an adult. He had his first job this summer, and he said he hated working.

Also: I did put him in therapy in middle school, because he wasn't eating. He said he thought he was fat; he has never been fat - he had a muscular build. He kept telling the therapist what he thought she wanted to hear, and she didn't see through it, so he stopped. His father was in his daily life, but they weren't close. He was closer to me than anyone, because I did see that he wasn't who everyone else thought. He has a younger sister and brother, and while he wasn't close to them, there were no issues. Friends liked him a lot, but they told me since he died that he never opened up to them. He really kept everything inside.

I am trying to understand better how he might have been feeling inside, which led to him ending his life. Has anyone experienced something similar?

So my fianc√© and I are getting married next year. Her family is very well off, whereas mine is lower middle class.

This week, her parents told her that they would be prepared to buy our first home (budget of 500k). As a result, we would need to sign a prenup. 

Now i know that this is a great opportunity to live mortgage/rent free, but the broader implications are not so comforting to me. We've already discussed the fact that this potential house will never be 'ours'. Rather, I'd  be living in 'her' home. In the event that her parents or siblings or family ever come to visit, I would feel powerless in this house and would not have any authority over it. Any construction considerations or other modifications would likely, I feel, have to go through her. 

Again, my fianc√© and I spoke about how I feel and my discomfort to this potential scenario. She has assured me that we wouldn't go through such situations. Although I trust and love her, I also feel that she has grown up a little more naive and relaxed with her lifestyle. To be fair though, having myself grown up on the lower end of the income scale, I can't help but harbor these feelings of paranoia and emasculation from the idea of being taken care of by my fianc√©'s family. 

My current stance on this situation is that we should take the offered money and buy a home. This would take away a lot of the financial burden, especially after getting married. Moreover, we wouldn't need to pay for rent or mortgage and instead invest the money into saving up to eventually buy our own home together. The current home could then be used to rent out, removing myself to a degree from any sort of awkwardness that I would have felt by living in it. I should also mention that we both still live at home with our parents (both traditional family upbringings). We do however intend on moving out within the next few months before the wedding. 

I was hoping to know if anyone here has gone through a similar situation and how you handled it.

I spoke up about it and even used the analogy to calling a girl fat. Apparently it's not the same according to them. I just told them they were all being incredibly shallow and they just laughed it off and told me to go make the guy feel better. Then they made a comment about his penis size being small.

RampagingKoala,2016-06-29 00:26:29+00:00,MOD POST: WE ARE CENSORING ASKMEN,"Attention cuckolds and cuckqueans of /r/AskMen,

Recently it has come to our attention that you people are getting pissy because you can't make rape jokes and say things about how horrible groups of people are without getting hissed down by the masses, and you're mad that people are telling you that you shouldn't make those jokes.

So let me take this opportunity to tell you to [calm the fuck down](http://i.imgur.com/EyGOZ7R.gif) and let me tell you how an internet board works. 

When you comment on any board, you implicitly agree to abide by any rules or regulations set by the board. This may include, but is not limited to, refraining from harmful, threatening, or insensitive comments against groups of people or individuals. If you don't like those rules and you want to go to a place where you can make those jokes without hindrance, /r/the_donald is thataway. 

Just because you assclowns are hiding behind the fa√ßade of anonymity doesn't mean common decency isn't expected. Let me put this in bold and all caps so that you can see this loud and clear: **THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FREE SPEECH ON REDDIT, 4CHAN, TUMBLR, OR ANY OTHER STUPID BOARD YOU CLAIM IS THE ""LAST BASTION OF FREEDOM ON THE INTERNET"". THEY ARE ALL MODERATED SITES, AND MODS CAN REMOVE COMMENTS AS THEY SEE FIT, THEREFORE SPEECH ISN'T FREE.**

If you're going to be an asshole and say offensive or obnoxious things like ""I really wish I could kill all men"" or ""all women deserve to be raped"" or any game of thrones spoilers, then we will remove your comment. 

Similarly, if we don't remove your comment by some fluke and you get dog piled on, don't come crying to us saying ""I said a mean thing but those mean men are attacking me"". If you say a stupid thing, expect responses in kind. Because (and I'll put this in bold and all caps too), **THIS IS NOT A SAFE SPACE. THIS IS NOT AN ECHO CHAMBER OR HUG BOX. MOST ARE FREE TO EXPRESS THEIR OPINION IN A CIVILIZED MANNER, AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO ABIDE BY THOSE RULES THEN YOU CAN FUCK OFF TO TUMBLR OR WHATEVER THE CRAZY WOMAN HATING EQUIVALENT IS FOR MEN.**

So if people get mad at you for saying something, just remember this (and I can't stress this enough): [your opinion is shit, the opinion of your opponent is shit, and everyone's opinions are FUCKING SHITTY ASS FUCKING OPINIONS THAT NO ONE GIVES A GOD DAMN SHIT ABOUT](http://media.giphy.com/media/5xtDarCHcNNbZRIpsyY/giphy.gif).

TL;dr: you all suck, but play nice or I'll ban you all.  And just remember, [this is what we think about you don't douchecanoes who complain about mod abuse](http://m.imgur.com/GfAgEfl)

Miz_zou,2016-06-23 13:17:57+00:00,"I just turned 27, and I feel like I want run away and start over anew; a quarter-life crisis, I suppose. Has this happened to any of you guys? What have you done?","Last week, I turned 27. And it hit me kind of hard. 

To sum it up, I guess I feel like I'm living the last gasps of my youth and I'm staring down the barrel of eternity and a life of ennui. I know I'm not old yet, but it's coming. 

To start, I've been dating a girl (21) for about a year now. What began as a fling (with her being much younger than I and feelings of it couldn't work) turned into a very strong relationship.  I love her very much.  But at the same time, I'm bitter and jealous of where she is in her life, in that everything is still ""in front of her.""  I feel like that potential and ""what if"" wonder has passed me. 

On the career front, I'm relatively satisfied. I work full-time as a copywriter and run a small freelance copywriting business on the side. I love that I can make a career of writing, but I did/do always want to be something more than ""just"" a copywriter. Basically, my writing helps sell a product, whereas my goal is to have my writing be the product. My dream job would to be a columnist or author or what-have-you. 

My personal, non-romantic life is boring. A good chunk of my friends are married and are preoccupied with that.  The ones that are not are incredibly ""comfortable,"" and would rather spend their free times playing the same board games every weekend. My girlfriend dislikes these friends. She always says that they just spend their time ""sitting around and talking about the fun things you guys did four years ago."" 

And I'm not much better. I have no ideas to have fun. And I'm so risk-averse. I think this is partly because I had $80,000 in student loans (I've paid down $40,000) and I try to be as cheap as possible so as to throw money at the debt.  I feel like I can't do anything substantial because of it.  

Then there's Helen.

Helen and I met while I was spending some time in Barcelona a few years ago. I guess you could say we fell for each other, and had that sort of abroad affair people dream about when they are traveling. Honestly, the night I met her was probably one of the two or three best nights of my life. Summer Night. Foreign City. Beautiful Girl. It was like a beer commercial. 

We've remained in touch (via Skype and text) over the years. Nothing underhanded, mind you. My girlfriend was well aware of her, and didn't seem to mind, saying ""ehh, she's in Spain."" And Helen was aware of my girlfriend.  But recently, Helen has made some remarks about ""loving me"" and wanting to ""see me again"" and invited me to come stay with her in Barcelona. 

And this is where it all hits me. I'm so dissatisfied with my life that the appeal of leaving dreary Boston, my girlfriend, and my friends and family for a life in Barcelona seems so very appealing. But the pragmatist in my says that's impossible. What about a job? What about my debt?

But at the same time, I feel like if I don't do something to shake up my boring existence I'll spend the rest of my life getting more bitter and more disenchanted with everything. And the longer I wait, the more impossible it'll become. As it is, I just know I'll grow to resent my girlfriend and my friends. 

Has anyone ever experienced something like this in their latter 20s? What have you done? Can anything even be done?

TL;DR: Dissatisfied with almost every aspect of my life (romantic, platonic, career, where I live) that I just want to start over. But I don't know what to do. 

Edit: To all the pedantic losers: Yes, I'm probably at the 1/3 point of my life rather than the 1/4.  However, quarter-life crisis is a more widely used term for this type of existential crisis in your 20s. 

Edit 2: I want to thank everyone for their thoughtful responses. I simply can't respond to everyone, but I have read every single comment on this thread, and it has given me a lot to think about.  

Edit 3:  I seem to have misrepresented my feelings towards my current girlfriend. I'm jealous, but not of her, so much as her stage in life. I want her to succeed, and I encourage her in everything she does. I just look at her at 21, and see myself at that age and get a little jealous/nostalgic/sad/etc. For instance, she wants to go back to school and I'm actively helping her in doing that. I want her to have the best possible life. But when I walk through college campuses with her, I can't help but feel I wish it was me going back. Make sense?

UPDATE: Wow. This post took off way more than I expected, and the majority of you had very insightful comments. I read almost every single one. Last night I sat down (alone) and tried to pinpoint exactly what was bothering me. 

Generally, it came down to the expected:

One: I was unhappy about the direction of my relationship, and I need to have a serious talk with my girlfriend about our future. She's coming over tonight.  Wish me luck. If we can't get on the same page, it'll probably be the end of us. But at least its better than me ""emotional cheating"" on her.  She deserves better. 

Two: I'm unhappy with my physical self. I was always very fit and active, and since dating my girlfriend, I've gotten out of shape. Tons of eating out and skipping of exercise.  I didn't realize how unhappy I was about this ""new"" me until I took the time to actually sort through the things that are bothering me. 

Three: I'm unhappy that I haven't taken the time to work on my longterm career goals. Coming home and drinking or going out to drink with her instead of working on my pet projects outside of work is no longer acceptable. That needs to change. I need to be a little more focused on the longterm. 

Four: And this was the most surprising for me, and I never even mentioned it in my post, but I kind of had a revelation. When I lived in Missouri, I felt a great sense of adventure and independence.  When I moved home to Boston that stopped.  The only difference I can think is the presence of my parents. I love them dearly. But they are dropping in/calling/texting/checking-in so much that it feels like I'm still under their thumb despite being 27. I've realized almost every decision I've made I've checked in with them first. Everything. And maybe thats what Barcelona represented, a chance to put an ocean between us.  And Helen was an excuse. 

TL;DR 2: It seems that I haven't been moving forward in any aspect of my life (financial, health, relationship, career) and that is why I'm so upset. Barcelona was an easy escape. I still want to visit, but I don't think its the answer to my problems. Thank you to everyone who helped!",AskMen,1264

Strangely (or luckily) enough I didn‚Äôt see this woman for over a week after I posted the original question so I had lots of time to go over the responses. When I finally did see her she immediately yelled out one of her zoo names and I said, ‚ÄúJust call me by (my name)‚Äù and she said, standoffishly, ‚ÄúSince when has it bothered you?‚Äù I told her I had asked her months earlier and she refused and that I think it‚Äôs unprofessional. She got visibly angry and stormed off. Later that day she came up to me in the cafeteria and said my request was ‚Äústupid‚Äù and that there is nothing wrong with her giving people nicknames and that she couldn‚Äôt see how it would bother me. At this point I was certain she isn‚Äôt na√Øve, but actually emotionally unstable. I told her I had now asked her twice to stop and if she didn‚Äôt, I would go to HR, which made her storm off again. I agree with everyone who said so that I don‚Äôt want to go to HR but I am hoping the threat will be enough. I told some people who I don‚Äôt work directly with about the whole problem and they agreed that it was weird and I was right to tell her to stop.

To the people who said I shouldn‚Äôt worry about it. It‚Äôs not that the names upset me or hurt my feelings but rather that I am concerned it may give my coworkers the idea that I am hiding something about a relationship with her which just isn‚Äôt the case. The last thing I need is rumors going around the office that I am with this annoying woman, like I hooked up with the ‚Äúsomebodies got a case of the Mondays‚Äù lady from Office Space.

thumper5,2016-03-04 15:04:56+00:00,How the hell do y'all pee? Apparently everything I've ever believed is wrong.,"This is a question of critical (not really) importance. For context, last night I (sort of) jokingly told my boyfriend that I want to hold his penis while he pees someday because I'm curious, which he laughed about and agreed to before saying that it'd be weird because he almost never holds his dick when he pees. I was, of course, confused.  

Me: ""Wait, so you just pull it out of your boxers and let it dangle by itself while you're peeing without touching it?""  
Him: ""You mean that hole in the front of my boxers? People don't really actually do that. I pull my boxers down past my dick and then I can just sort of use the waistband to balance/hold it.""  

He demonstrated this maneuver for me and it seems so weird! Like, his whole crotch was out. And I get the part where not actually holding his dick might be his own peculiarity, but I asked both his male roommates if they do the same flopping-their-dick-over-their-waistband thing and they said yes!  

I don't know why, but this revelation is both shocking and hilarious to me. Do y'all seriously do this? Just expose your entire crotchal region to pee? Do you ever use the hole in your underwear? ISN'T THAT WHAT IT'S THERE FOR?

EDIT: holy shit I did not expect this to blow up. I feel like I need to clarify some stuff. Yes I know women share stuff. I know women talk to their friends and that's perfectly fine. I'm glad she's excited to talk about me. The issue here is that the amount of detail that is coming back to me is unnerving. And the fact that the person she's telling everything to is a person I don't really like at all and will use this information to make fun of me to make herself feel better. Many of you have helped me realize that my friends gf is a huge part of the problem and I agree but unfortunately it all ties in together. I can't call her cute names because I will hear about it for weeks. If we end up having sex, the whole time I'll be thinking what she's gonna tell her friend and what her friend is gonna tell my friends.

What are my options?,"( *edit* - **I'd like to share this** https://www.stalkingriskprofile.com/victim-support/impact-of-stalking-on-victims )

Bullet points, I am tired of overexplaining myself and it falling on deaf ears.

I'm a 25 yo man who lives with 4 people in a group home.

A 40 something yo woman believes we have a relationship together - we don't. 

She has been making indirect violent threats, and also threatening to go to the police to make false accusations, lying pathologically, playing bizzarre mind games, starting a smear campaign with her friend (also my roommate), passive aggresively emotionally abusing me (i just got out of a psych hospital), she doesn't seem willing to speak in a direct way, recruiting others in the house  to harass me, following me (I have tried my best to leave the house all day and avoid her when I come home), listening to me in my room (thin doors/walls) as I make calls to the crisis line and other calls, generally not leaving me alone and making me feel unsafe. She is hostile and paranoid, and combined with all these others things that makes me very worried.

I have gone to the police, you can't record conversations in the state of CA without consent and the police have not taken me seriously.  My housing manager and program manager haven't taken me seriously. 

**FUCKING NO ONE IS TAKING ME SERIOUSLY**

I have gone back and forth, because of the gaslighting and lack of support....am I in danger or not. Lots of self-doubt. I mean, I'm a man and she's just ""sick"" or whatever you want to say. She's ""just"" a woman. I also have a mental health diagnosis and have recently gotten out of the hospital after a nervous breakdown (this place is hell)

My parents won't believe me! Only my therapist does.

I am scared to call a domestic violence hotline or use those resources.

I am straight up leaving tomorrow. I will just show up on my father's doorstep or something. I will come up with something.

This person is unpredictable and dangerous. I don't need anyone to validate that for me. I'm gone.

What are some things I should know or keep in mind? Are there any good resources to use?",AskMen,2110

Or have I just been watching too much Seinfeld?","At 24, I have literally no clue whatsoever how to meet people. I feel like there's this huge gulf between my idea of the dating scene and reality.

First of all, even that term ""dating scene"" almost seems like an anachronism. Again, that's something I hear in the media and on reddit and everything. But I don't actually know anybody who meets random people and then goes out to dinner with them. Especially not frequently enough to talk about a ""scene"" that they participate in on a regular basis.

Maybe I'm in the wrong city. Maybe I go to the wrong places. But this idea that there are other 24-year-olds with their shit together who would be interested in meeting up just seems very far removed from reality from my perspective. Even when it comes to media and discussions that try to approach this issue from a more realistic standpoint‚ÄîI'm thinking of something like Master of None or even this subreddit‚ÄîI don't really see that reflected in my everyday life.

I of course know a lot of people who have met through work and school. And I know people who have met on dating sites/apps. And I know people who have hooked up at clubs. But I honestly don't know if I've ever met someone who went on a TV show-style date, where they meet and go to a restaurant for the first time and talk about what each other do for a living.

Snowflake: But my question isn't a DAE question because I don't ask ""does anybody else"".

Snowflake: Why can't I ask ""Is this normal"" questions?

**RK:  Because those questions a) can be answered with one word, and b) are usually taken completely out of context and c) are usually cross-posted in relationships anyways so just go there.  Besides, they violate this rule:**

putridbabybutt,2015-08-14 20:31:12+00:00,(UPDATE) Meeting my girlfriends five year old daughter. Any advice?,"*edited for nasty smelly typos 

TL;DR- I took the advice a lot of you gave me, and my girlfriend's daughter ended up having a really fun time, and she even held my hand and gave me a hug. So thank you, everyone, for helping me out. 

(Typed on my phone, please excuse any typos. I tried to screen for the egregious ones but may have missed a few. Alas, I am but a man.)

This is an update to an askmen post I made a little over a week ago. I had a date with my girlfriend where I met her five year old daughter. Didn't know what to do, and I was generally just a tightly wound bundle of nerves. Needless to say (but I'll go ahead and say it anyway), I wanted to make a good impression on the little girl. 

Tons of you chimed in with excellent advice. Some of you had mediocre advice, and some of you urged physical violence, which, I'm happy to say I followed to the letter. My girlfriend's daughter will no longer hear my name without inadvertently twitching. 

Real talk now. Here's how it went. 

They arrived at my place mid afternoon. I let them in and got on both knees, hands in my lap, and I introduced myself to the five year old. She was shy, and took a step behind her mother. Not a big deal, I thought. 

So I gave them the grand tour of my apartment and almost immediately she started chiming in. I'd occasionally say something silly or blatantly incorrect to get a response from her, and it worked. She jumped right in with a comment for everything I said, to my delight. 

Before we left, I asked her if she wouldn't mind sitting with Blube and keeping him company. 

Blube was a joke gift my sister gave me for Christmas one year. Think of a round rubber mouse-gerbil-thing, the color blue and the size of a softball. It's got big cute eyes and a tiny button nose and satellite ears. When you squeeze it, it's tongue pops out. Of course I kept it, and the five year old was absolutely thrilled to keep Blube company in the back seat. He gets a little lonely when I leave the house, you see. 

We grabbed some bottled water and a few granola bars and we headed to the zoo. About an hour trip from my place. She was a little quiet in the backseat at first, but soon enough she warmed up and held conversation. She talked about everything she wanted to see, everything she wanted to pet, her favorite animals, her favorite foods, etc. The whole time her mom is watching us interact with the biggest grin on her face. Good signs, I imagine.

We get there and immediately she gets her face painted. Zebra. Not her favorite animal, apparently, but, and I'm paraphrasing, ""one of the prettiest."" Of course the face paint comes off on her hands, her food, the water bottle, and everything else the little girl looks at, but she loves it and is having fun so it's not even a thing. 

We spend a good two and a half hours at the zoo in the sweltering summer sun. Side note- no matter how good you think you look in a button down with the sleeves rolled up, it isn't worth it if you're at the zoo in the hammer- hot sun. Jesus. 

The whole while there, she and I are enjoying each other's company and having fun. I really didn't have anything to worry about, I don't think. I'm naturally silly and have always gotten along with kids. Still. I needed to hear what some of you had to say. I really psyched myself out until a few of your comments calmed me a bit.

After the zoo we're all hungry so we head to a sushi place. I pull out my chop sticks and my girlfriend teases me about my grip. I make a joke about just skewering the food and, to my surprise, the little girl giggles an mimics my actions. I notice that she has begun doing that over the past hour. What do they say about mimicry and flattery? Consider me flattered.

So. Being the pre-dad-not-dad-but-is-totally-a-dad, I stick the chopsticks under my upper lip like a walrus. I know. I know. You don't have to tell me.

But she cackles and does it back! Now we're both urging her mom to do so, and after an embarrassed moment (and her thanking sweet Amaterasu we're in a secluded booth) she puts them in and we look ridiculous but of course the mom takes pics. 

And literally three employees walk by our booth, all three hitting us with looks of varying degrees of amusement/disgust. 

But anyway. We enjoy our meal, and on the way back to the car it begins to rain. The little one grabs her moms hand and sort of instinctually reaches for mine, too. She stops as our fingers brush and gives me an embarrassed ""whoops"" look. I tell her it's okay, she can hold my hand too. So she grabs it again and holy shit you guys the warmth is absolutely blooming inside my chest like a golden sunrise. It was so goddamn nice to see that she trusted and liked me enough to automatically reach for my hand like that. It's a good thing it had begun raining. Nobody saw the streams of tears and mucus running down my face.

Just kidding. Like I cry. Or have mucus. I'm a fucking cyborg.

Just kidding again. I'm a man, who does in fact cry and secrete mucus.

I didn't cry then but I did certainly feel a lot of happiness and relief that the meeting of the daughter went so well.

When we got to my place, the little one gave me a hug and thanked me for a fun day, all without any prompting from her mom. I asked her to hold onto Blube for me, as I think he'd taken a liking to her. She smiled really wide and agreed.

As I opened the car door for her mom, she gave me a quick peck on the lips. Nothing too much in front of the little one. But she mouthed ""thank you"" and her eyes answered everything I had a question about. 

I applied a bunch of the advice you guys gave me, some of it that I didn't type here because, again, I'm on my phone and I can't be arsed to give you every little detail. Suffice to say you all helped me so much; getting me over my nerves and giving me sound help.

After quite some time discussing the past two months and confessing stuff I should have told her a while back (needing space, not inviting her out with my friends, other smaller issues I was coping with) I suggest we just go to sleep so we do...backs turned to each other.

I go home for a quick lunch today and all her stuff is gone.  Food and clothes. Just got a text saying and that she's made plans ""with someone""? tonight and didn't expect to see me any time soon. 

Not playing those ""with someone"" games...

Felt kind of mutual...it was hard...but all in all I think for the best.

But I'd really like to take this time to stress the importance of communication during EVERY POINT OF THE RELATIONSHIP. Men, when you're in the lovey dovey stages and something is bothering you please let your significant other know. Nothing is worse than an issue going unchecked for so long until it snowballs.  Don't be afraid to lose him/her. If they are understanding and are truly interested in you they will compromise. Don't be unhappy.

None of you deserve to live that way.

Will any guy ever want to date me?,"Before I continue, I know that a lot of people will say that it is a horrible idea for my to wait until marriage etc. I have thought out the pros and cons and I realized this is what I want to do. Although I don't consider myself an extremely religious person nowadays, I did grow up in a religious environment and this one idea of virginity has kinda stuck with me. I don't feel oppressed in any way, in reality I all for sexual expression and freedom. But I find my virginity important to me. However, I'm not going to lie, reddit has had me a little scared because it seems like most people here believe being a virgin until marriage is a horrible idea that just sets everyone up for failure because the couple does not understand their sexual compatibility (I can understand this but I don't know if its always true).

Anyways, my main question is, do you guys think any guy will ever want to get involved with me? I see so many guys I am interested in, and my friends tell me to go and talk to them but I am always hesitant because I don't want to get interested in a guy and then have him maybe like me back, only to know that the relationship may not be as physical as they hoped. Don't get me wrong, I am a very very sexual person in my head but sex (including oral) is just something I am not comfortable with yet and I don't want to trick people and string them along, that would make me a horrible person. I think, maybe one day I'll find a guy who will want to be with me just cause I'm awesome but then again, I don't know how great of a person I am. People say I'm funny/cool but is that enough to make a sexless relationship work? I'm lonely and I would love the type of companionship you get in a relationship. But I never move forward with these crushes just cause I know nothing will come of it. Maybe something will but then again, how do I bring this up with a guy? Obviously it would be weird to do so on a first date, right? I keep telling myself to go with the flow and chill out and then things will work out. But I can't help but feel a little bit sad/lonely/pressured since everyone around me is in relationships.

sorry this is so long!
tl;dr: I want to wait till marriage to have sex. I would be ok, possibly, with doing other things until then (oral) but even then I dont know because this is all so new to me and I'm trying to understand my boundaries. I feel like a shit person because I want to be in a relationship with people and I have the opportunity to but I don't want to burden them with all this and string them along.

Love_and_Beer,2014-10-23 13:38:19+00:00,*UPDATE* So I've got an abnormally attractive woman acting clingy after one date. How would you proceed?,"[Here is the previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/2k0p1l/so_ive_got_an_abnormally_attractive_woman_acting/)

OK, so I'll go and ahead and start this post by saying after an OVERWHELMING amount of comments depicting the behavior of this woman to be nothing short of crazy, I will go ahead and offer up the conclusion that she was in fact --- fucking insane, but I at least understand why she's the way she is. 

**If you want to skip her backstory, read past the dotted line.**
I also will go into a pretty detailed breakdown of the date for those who have time to burn, the TL;DR should be good enough of a summary though.

So in my last post I talked about how I detected all kinds of red flags and asked if I was treading close to a nightmare. Virtually everyone agree'd that this lady was nothing but trouble but in all fairness, I should have included a little bit more back story to make this less biased against her (although after everything was said and done, I'm still dodging her shit like fucking Neo and Smith). 

So firstly: She's had one serious relationship. From high school. 4 years ago. Her emotional view of relationships was stunted and shallow. She is incredibly naive to social repercussions, as she never really learned to deal with them herself but rather, she always had people flocking for her attention and her affection; I.E. her miss congeniality high school type mentality. She's a daddy's girl and as such, has never actually held down a 'real' job of her own. Her dad actually owned a company that she herself got fired at because she was so terrible at getting along with other people because of her extreme social awkwardness. Her dad is basically responsible for paying all of her bills too, which is why I guess when she skipped out on work today, instead of calling her soon to be boss that she wasn't coming in today, she sent him a fucking email....That I had to type out for her because her grammar was so terrible. Oh, and to add salt to the wound, she also texted her company, which is a landline phone. When I asked why she didn't just call, she said ""I'm afraid of what they'll say and don't want to hear them get mad at me"". 

Coupled with the fact that she was raped as a teenager and to my understanding always had a pretty difficult time coping to a circumstance that was extremely traumatic and I began to understand why she said some of the things she said and why she acted the way she acted, or at least I tried to. She also had some really fucked rare deficiency in her body that caused her to lose parts of her hair, resulting in her having to wear a wig. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So the actual story starts off harmless enough. After she suffocates me with pictures of her modeling career and her smothering affection for her pussy (cat), I left from her apartment to mine to change clothes, contemplating whether this was going to be a glorious disaster. So I set up a meeting at Star Bucks and we embark on our journey from there. After some engaging coffee talk, we head over to a pumpkin patch where we win a free pumpkin by catching an escaped rabbit which she dived for like a boss. Pretty impressive rabbit catching skills that she'll undoubtedly add to her resume. We then head over to the mall. Now at this point everything is actually going really well. I am enjoying her arm locking, and calling me ""baby"" and her genuine excitement for trying to be good at her job (even though she totally lied and called in) by buying merchandise for customers she would be selling to. Her job by the way for those who are curious is a Promotions Manager for a 3rd party company that sells event tickets to big games and the like. On our ""date"" she pitched her sale at least 20 times to random stores I was dragged into, so I was slightly annoyed but cheered her on because I was glad she was excited. Her random bursts of social energy would soon start to make me uncomfortable though when we got to a mattress store and after having a sales pitch done on their mechandise, proceeded to ask if they were hiring? And then gave the mattress guy a longer than appropriate sensual hug, this was after she tried selling him a pair of her event tickets. 

So we're still walking around the mall and she asks if I've ever taken Adderall, which I did when I was in college, and then asks if I would like some. I take it because why not, I'll be super focused the rest of our date. **This is important later in the story.** 

Throughout our ""date"" she's very touchy. Holding my hand, locking arms, even modeling out new underwear and scrubs she wants to buy. Throughout our conversations I would make subtle references to Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad or It's Always Sunny, and she never understood any of them even though she's my age. Game of fucking Thrones and YOU AIN'T HEARD OF IT??? She didn't even know what The Hobbit was or what it was about. She talked about how she hated reading and was pretty uninformed about current events like Ebola. And she would confidently announce certainties that she had no idea what she was talking about. But her bubbly personality was quirky and somewhat redeeming, so I persisted on getting to know her more. I'm constantly going from ""I like her. She is making me uncomfortable. Wow she is interesting. Man this is uncomfortable. God, what a nice ass. Geez, her stomach is so tight. She has the intelligence of a potato"" -- All sorts of emotional highs and lows packed in a small time frame. 

After treading along the mall for a few hours and her sharing her excitement for events coming up in our area that she wants to visit with me, we finally make our way over to the movies. We agree to watch Annabell, which is a fantastic horror flick by the way, and that's when the tone of our ""date"" starts to change. So right before the movie starts, I see she's texting some guy and seems pretty distraught about it. I try to ignore it but she's huffing and rolling her eyes and making crazy hand gestures that frighten me. So that's when she says out of the blue:

""I really think we should just be friends. I don't want to move too fast"".

""K""

I'm pretty annoyed at that statement because just the other night I'm pretty sure you were choking down my barrel of unborn children, but who am I to judge. Oh, and her many references to us ""dating"" while speaking to various retail representatives that gave off the impression that we were dating. I really felt indifferent either way because she already had me on the fence anyway, so I didn't plan on escalating.

OK so now I guess we're sitting as ""friends"" now in the movie theater. But she has her legs crossed over mine and is latched on to my chest. Yup, this is totally what friends do. Anyways, remember the adderall I took a few paragraphs before? Well now it's starting to wear off and it doesn't take much for me to start getting sick. I'm feeling really hot and need water, and although I'm not showing it, I can tell I want to puke anytime. I'm feeling like shit and throughout the movie she keeps asking if I'm OK, referencing what she said earlier about us being ""friends"" and if I was bothered by it. I told her no which I think really bothered her because she isn't used to rejecting guys or whatever and having them basically worshiping her to my zero reaction, so she starts to get anxious. 

Que the movie ending and we're now back at her place and she's going on and on about not wanting to move so fast. I keep telling her that I completely understand and it isn't a big deal. She states that friendships NEED to be made because that's the only way ""true love blossoms"". I excuse myself and end up puking (because at that time I really do feel like shit, but it literally couldn't have came at a more coincidental time) and now I'm starting to feel pretty awful and not so much as my usual self, so I start talking less. So she then babbles on even more that what she said is clearly bothering me and that I should respect her decision to just be friends. Right. I got that the other 3 times you've made the point to stress. I tell her that if she just wanted to be friends, then sucking my dick and begging me to eat her vagina was probably not the best approach to earn friendship and that the expectation of last night basically threw out any chance of a normal ""friendship"" out the door with me. I told her that after she started texting that guy from the movies, that her tone completely changed. I said if she was still getting over the guy I understood, but I wasn't really going to pursue any friendships she had in mind.

So she starts to get pissed. Like real pissed. She begins on going on this 15 minute tangent, yelling about how men always do this to her and how she is always fucked over and how I'm exactly the same as all the others. I'm like:

""Whoa now! You're the one who started calling me baby, and holding my hand, and latching onto me the entire day we've been together, and inviting me over to sleep in your bed to keep you safe. This isn't how a friendship is created with someone you barely know. And if you weren't in the right mindset to date, then escalating our sexual encounter equally is unfair to me.""

She then goes on to say how she treats all of her friends like that and that just because she strips down to her bra and panties, that it doesn't mean anything sexual, or sleeping in the same bed as her because she does it with her girlfriends all the time. I told her that the way she treats her girlfriends and the way men perceive her actions, will be received differently, and that her actions are misleading. Men do not look at boobies and NOT think something sexual. You especially don't lay half naked beside somebody and HONESTLY expect them to ASSUME you only want to be friends. [Honestly.](http://i.imgur.com/ZE2ooxN.png)

So we sit there, 2 days into knowing each other, already arguing, and me having to break down why her view on friendship will not work with me and that the expectations that have been set will make it unlikely for any friendships to happen with me. She goes on the defensive and blurts out how awkward and uncomfortable she is, so I announce I'm leaving and for her to have a good night.

So then she starts to break down. With her face in her hands she starts crying... Sobbing away. How she doesn't understand relationships and why men don't want to be friends with her. That friendships are the only way for a couple to be happy, referencing her sister and her sister's 3 year boyfriend. At this point I'm convinced her emotional maturity is worse than a baked turd. I briefly explain, again, that although I agree how important it is to be friends, I also believe that natural escalation is also a very healthy part of a relationship. I told her that I'm not interested in pursuing anything that would make her uncomfortable but at this stage and from her reaction, I would not be interested in staying with contact with her and begin to head out the door.

So she grabs at my shirt and says that she's sorry, and if I'll call her tomorrow. I tell her that I'm deleting her contact information and she should do the same. Although she is a sweet girl with a lot of good qualities, we are on two different paths of life and would not be compatible on any spectrum. So she takes a snow globe that's beside her and tosses it at the wall right past my head, smashing it to pieces. I straight jet the fuck out of there. Trick also left that sweetass pumpkin we won earlier in my truck. So at least that's going for me. Oh, and I didn't pay for the movie, so I'm really happy about having an extra $60 in my pocket. 

So the moral of this story? Don't ever ignore your gut. And if the majority of Reddit says a chic is crazy, she's crazy sauce.

***TL;DR: On fence of going on date with abnormally hot clingy chic which gave me a cannon of red flags yesterday. Decide to go on date because first impressions aren't always accurate and I wanted to give her a fair shot after pushing my load in her mouth yesterday. Have decent date throughout. Is buck retarded on almost all social and political issues. BITCH DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE HELL GAME OF FUCKING THRONES WAS!!! Can you believe that?? Models panties with that sweet crazy ass. Personality is somewhat redeemable, although worldview is very shallow and naive. Calls me ""baby"" and very affectionate throughout date, did enjoy. Tells me mid movie while legs and head attached to me that she only wants to be friends, did not enjoy. I act indifferent. End up puking. She takes my puking out of context and assumes I'm upset that we're not going to fuck. I'm not upset that we're not going to fuck. Claims that we only can be friends and that she only sleeps with people who she is dating and that she admits to moving too fast. I say that shoving my load down her throat is confusing and not realistic if she wants to stay platonic as she can't be straddled half naked around me in her bed, how that isn't appropriate for a friendship especially when I find her sexually attractive. She doesn't understand. I agree that we should move slower but do not agree to just being friends. She doesn't understand. She bursts out in crying. Throws snow globe at my head and misses. Bitch left her pumpkin in my truck we won at the pumpkin patch after catching a rabbit. Didn't pay for shit, now have acquired sweet ass pumpkin. Grateful that I don't have a snow globe on my head.***

[deleted],2014-09-30 22:11:17+00:00,My wife has attempted suicide several times over the years. I am thinking it is time to leave her and try to start my life over. I know she will kill herself if I divorce her. What do I do?,"She has borderline personality disorder and I am no longer able to cope with it. I need out. I feel that I am trapped though. She WILL attempt suicide once I tell her. I mean she cuts herself with a razor when she has had a bad day at work for Christ sake.

Additionally her daughter (my step-daughter) from her first marriage  would obviously be completely destroyed if her mother died. I care about my step-daughter very much and the idea of her suffering emotional harm is unacceptable to me.

Borderline personality disorder is not considered easy to treat and we had trouble finding a therapist that would accept her due to how acute her symptoms are. 

She is a good person and cares about her family. I do love her very much, but I am not sure that I will survive her next stay at the mental hospital. Emotionally it will eventually destroy me. I can already tell that the fabric of my own mental state is starting to fray.

So what now? I don't want any harm to come to anyone. I have considered just ""toughing it out"" for the next 40 - 50 years but that is rather absurd idea isn't it.

Does anyone else have experience with this sort of situation? What did you do?

-- Update --

We spoke last night and I explained I would probably not survive her suicide any more than she would. Also any attempt at suicide would result in me leaving, not because I don't love her, but because I would need to save myself at that point.

I was very careful during our conversation to be understanding and not accusatory towards her. I want to validate her emotions and not dismiss them or be an insensitive jerk. After that I discussed doing DBT therapy with her. I told her I will stand by her side so long as we both continue to work on our relationship and pursue good mental health. I don't think I have mentioned this but I struggle with some mild OCD myself and I totally acknowledge that is a point of stress for her.

The conversation ended with both of us feeling a lot better.",AskMen,1012

Notagoodweek,2014-08-30 00:14:19+00:00,My girlfriend was raped. Are there any guys out there who can advise how to get through this? (NSFW),"I should make a few things clear first: this is a disposable account. I'm not going to use it for anything other than this thread. Hopefully the reasons for me making this thread will become clear as you read this post.

Secondly - I looked at a lot of subreddits to see where best this post would go. Something about /r/relationships put me off, as the following isn't really a communication/relationship problem. It's something that has effected me right down to my masculinity, and I've been looking for stories from the male perspective and found very little - so /r/AskMen seemed like the right place to ask. I'd really like to hear some experiences of this from the boyfriend point of view. I think that'd help. I apologise if the content is way off for this subreddit. 

I'm not really one for trigger warnings, but yeah, some of this content is disturbing and includes sexual violence.


Okay. So, two nights ago I get 9 missed phone calls at about 5am. I'd been watching Band of Brothers with my housemates that night, and because I get a lot of emails through from work in the evening, I'd set my phone to silent so there wasn't a constant sequence of vibrations while we were basking in the glory. I went to bed, forgetting to put my phone back on vibrate.

The number wasn't from a number I recognised, and I wake up to a text message : 'Call this number as soon as you can please'. So I do. It's 8am in the morning (I'm from the UK), and the phone is answered straight away and it's a girl speaking. I ask who it is. We'll call her Sarah (names have been changed, obviously). We'll call my girlfriend Alice. This year, we all finished our final year at uni.

Sarah and Alice work at a pub together, and I knew they had been planning a night out together for a while, so they could celebrate before their housing contracts ran out and had to go back home. They were set on it, and Alice had had a rough few months with a close relative dying, she has depression (which had been okay, but not great lately) and her mother had a crisis at home, which of course worried her. They were both really looking forward to this night, just a girl's thing. Rather than go out in London (where we're based), they decided to go to a city an hour or so away. 

I'll fast forward to the details and why I'm struggling a lot now. In the early morning, the girls got split up outside a club, and Alice ended up at the entrance of an alleyway. She was then attacked by four guys. Three of them held her down while the other guy raped her. They left her unconscious in the alley and from what I understand Sarah found her and rang for an ambulance. 

I've been with Alice almost two years. We're both very headstrong and a bit stubborn, and yeah we've been on and off a lot for those two years. But we've always been mutually exclusive, and our relationship was never one where we needed drama to function. We really care about each other, I guess we're just a bit argumentative.

Alice has been spending most of the time since it happened sleeping - the police didn't let her sleep for ages while they asked questions (fair enough). Then they gave her a lift to one of those clinics where they do all the DNA swabbing and more invasive medicals. After that I think she'd had enough. Her exact words were 'I feel human again' when she woke up yesterday.

I'm a naturally dominant guy. I'm 6'4, muscular, and I teach people martial arts. Our sex has always been with me as a dominant, her as a submissive, to quite a developed kinky level. Now I feel completely stripped of everything. I feel entirely useless, and Alice doesn't want to tell me everything that happened yet (I get that, I know it takes time). But not knowing is killing me. I keep on imagining the ways it could have happened and what they did, and then I get so angry - then I start playing out these ridiculous revenge fantasies. I can't sleep. The other thing is that this guy could have given her an STD - we won't find out for a week I think. Imagining how her life could be ruined if she has HIV because of this makes me feel ill. Also, the fact that three guys helped one guy rape someone, makes me really suspect whether this was a gang initiation thing. Nearly all gangs in Britain are related to drug use/smuggling, and hard drugs promote bad decisions and a lack of maintenance in health. I'd be surprised if this guy didn't carry something. 

I know this is a long-haul process, one that's going to take time. My issue is that I feel stuck between two walls - one, blind rage, the other, blind grief. Bouncing between them is making me feel hollow. Alice is being an absolute trooper and seems to be as okay as she can be while we wait for the results. She hasn't told me yet how damaged things are internally, but her ankles and knees are quite badly hurt and she can't properly walk. 

Alice knows this has effected me, but I've kept this level of emotion to myself.

I didn't think something could happen which could make me feel so vulnerable. Have any guys here had an experience like this? What, if anything, made it easier?

**EDIT:** I finally managed to get some sleep last night - this post had maybe 80 upvotes and some really supportive and informative comments. I wake up and there's almost 300 upvotes, loads more comments, and messages in my inbox from survivors and partners of survivors offering their experiences. Thanks so much. For those people arriving on this thread, look out for /u/vikingkarl 's comments - they're patient and excellent and helped me a lot. I feel a lot better this morning, thanks /r/AskMen. 

**EDIT 2:** This is also an update. I spent the weekend with Alice - shes going to go home for this week we think. Since I was away this has had almost 1000 upvotes and I have too many PM to respond to straight away - also a load of new comments, nearly all of which are genuine and aren't troll. 

**Great News** - the police got the report from the clinic and sent the results to Alice. A broad range of tests have been done and she doesn't have the bulk of STIs/STDs that can be checked for at this point in time.. The relief was amazing. We found out about this at the end of the weekend (props to the police and emergency services for working all the time - Sundays don't count for these people). A few final blood tests in a few weeks will give us the final data we need.

I don't think I'll update this thread beyond that. I made this post because I felt there was an enormous lack of 'I am the SO of someone who was raped' material online, and personally, it really helped me to read experience from others in the same position. A few times people have said I've been making this more about me, than about Alice, but I can only reiterate that in my case, **hearing some of the day-to-day experiences that follow such an event has really helped me.** Over the weekend Alice and I did a lot of talking. I made it clear that this weekend was not about me knowing what happened - and the same can be said for a weekend six months away. To be honest, this weekend shaped up to have some really funny moments where we were hanging out, and our senses of humour were on top form. However, she did share a lot of info with me about how it all happened. Although it made me feel sick, and furious, a lot of things that happened in my imagination did not happen to her. Knowing what happened means I can bury the things that didn't. 

One detail that did get me - there were bruise marks on her arm, the imprints of fingers that gripped her too hard. That was a low point - right there, I was looking at the grip the attacker had left. At one point, when I held her, I realised I had my hand on that space, and there was a kind of physical bridge between her, the attacker, and myself, all linked by that fucking bruise. But that bruise had largely faded by this morning and it's not important.

The evidence the police have doesn't look that great - I think it's no CCTV, confusion about where the assault happened, and only a little DNA. But that's a different can of worms, and again, something that is part of a larger ongoing process, to be tackled as it needs to be.

Many thanks /r/AskMen, this has been a long weekend, and between you all, you've helped out a total stranger. ",AskMen,1043

The taut plane bridging shoulders. The hollow at your throat accented by a crew cut shirt. Or your forearms? Can I just take a few moments to make literary love to your forearms? Not a forearm exists that I do not like. Hairy ones. Short ones. Long ones. This is an expert line, from which I follow all the way to your eyes. I will look at you creepily across the bar, sometimes coveting the lashes against your cheek, and other times wishing you‚Äôd make me look at you while we fucked in the dark. Men, the power in your bodies is exhilarating. I like waiting at the copier knowing the temp behind me could slay me down. Or take me out to coffee. Hell, I‚Äôll buy you a cup if you tell me why your eyelashes are always longer than mine. I did get paid the other day. Men, you are beautiful creatures.

engraced,2014-02-26 17:49:43+00:00,How do men not just give up?,"Had a mini-conversation with a fellow on this subreddit regarding my suggestion of grocery stores being a good place to meet women. Apparently, a large enough percentage of women hate being approached in the grocery store that this is seen as a bad idea (I'm still trying to figure out why because this doesn't bother me personally, I actually get some really good dates from meeting fellows at the grocery store). 

Now, I'm not trying to bash the ladies nor am I saying that they don't have a right to avoid men for whatever reason (~~CK Lewis~~ Louis CK once said that there was no greater threat to women than men, though I haven't seen any legitimate statistics to back this up, so I don't quite buy it....I'd be willing to bet it's traffic accidents or heart disease, not men). 

However, if women are going to pretty much shut down every avenue for approaching them (bars [""I just want to hang out with my friends""], clubs [""I just want to dance!""], bookstores [""Don't interrupt my reading!""], grocery stores [""I HAVE to go here, don't bother me.""], classes/workshops [""I'm here to learn, only!""], etc), what avenues ARE available for meeting women organically (eg. not via dating website/match-makers)?

As a woman, this is really weird to me and I have no idea what to do with it. If faced with this kind of backlash, honestly, I'd probably just give up. Go buy a black Maserati Quattroporte, fill my house with shiny tech toys and an extensive scotch collection, and go full-on bachelorette mode with hairy legs, a stock-pile of batteries, and a fridge full of take-away. 

So therein lies the question: **How/Why do you not just give up on the whole dating scene? Why do you continue to try to date in the face of all these blocks?**

I'm honestly floored by the variety and depth of the responses. A lot of you shared what I felt was incredibly personal insight into your POV, and I really appreciate that, even if it's from behind the relative safety of anonymity. Thank you. 

I didn't really have a purpose for this thread other than, ""why do these guys keep putting themselves through this crap?"" But y'all have shared so much more than that. Like I said, I'm truly floored and appreciative.

**Edit 3 (2/27/14 8:00 PM EST):** This post has gotten me a surprising number of really nasty messages and incredibly appreciative messages, and it came to my attention that it has also gotten big enough that the r/AskWomen subreddit has taken notice and devoted a thread to it. Regardless of the hatemail and disparaging remarks on the other subreddit, it's the number of thank you messages I've gotten that make me glad I posted this in the first place.

As of the 2,032 comments currently on this thread, I've read them all and tried to reply where I felt I could or where I must. Some of your stories are absolutely heart-wrenching, and I can't even begin to fathom what you've gone through. I am sorry you have had to deal with that kind of pain and discouragement in your life.

Like I said before, I'm grateful for all the stories and comments you all have posted here and messaged me with privately. Empathy can be difficult for someone who's not in your shoes, but sharing your stories does help those who might not otherwise understand. 

I hope, and maybe it's too arrogant of me to hope this, but I hope that maybe this thread has normalized some of the things you might be feeling.

Maybe some will take comfort in knowing they're not alone in giving up and others the strength to continue.",AskMen,1766
Witwer,2014-02-22 18:29:31+00:00,My girlfriend died. How did you deal with this?,"Throwaway for this one. I don't want to see this everytime I look at my account.

A week ago my girlfriend was trying to cross the street. As far as I know she stopped in the middle of the street (in between the lanes) because of traffic. A 62-year old guy hit her with his car and she got thrown into an oncoming vehicle. The second crash inured her head and torso so bad she died in the hospital. 

She was 18 and going to finish high school in may. We were together for 2 years, 6 months and 12 days. She loved going to the lake in the summer, watching good movies and being tickled.

I'm completely devastated. I'm currently mostly sitting at home, but nearly constantly have friends around (I think they made a schedule so somebody is here every day). Nevertheless, I feel incredibly empty and depressed. Did anyone of you have to deal with a similar situation? How did you cope with it?

wea8675309,2014-02-02 12:31:37+00:00,Does anyone else think getting married before 25 is just kind of... insane?,"Now before you reply, I genuinely don't mean to offend. I (23M) have several friends my age who are (for now) happily married. Some of them even have children, and some of those children were even intentional! So if you have found the person you want to spend the rest of your life with already I wish you both nothing but the best of luck and feel about as happy as I can for you given that you are an internet stranger.

Having said that... whyyy??? Why not just move in together? Why not live together in exclusivity for, oh I don't know, SEVERAL YEARS? It's like people think if they don't at least buy someone a ring they will lose the love of their life. If you guys really love each other, wouldn't it not matter at all? Why the rush? I genuinely don't believe it's possible to understand exactly how *long* life is when you're only 20 or 21. People change, circumstances change, lots of things change. Why would you want to get a bunch of paperwork and lawyers and family and a hard-to-dissolve contract involved in something that is already going just fine?

In my mind, children and family should be the reasons for marriage, not love. Marriage shouldn't be some big romantic gesture, it should be a commitment between two *straight, heterosexual people* (or two gays, that's cool) to create and be responsible for a real, living, breathing, shitting child. The marriage itself should last at *least* 18 years, if not forever. If you're younger than 25 (ok, that's arbitrary; let's just say young), how likely is it that you're in a position to truly support a child? Can you send him/her to a good school? Will you be able to put him/her through college? Will you be able to support your family if someone gets sick with cancer? Or AIDS? What if they grow up to date a black man? WHAT THEN?

We ended up just laying on his bed talking about random stuff, making out and basically dry humping. At some point my panties were drenched, so I put my big girl panties on and told him what I wanted to tell him, which was basically ""I really like you, I like this, but I'm a virgin and I've never done anything like this before but still, I want to suck your dick"" (not literally, but this was the tl;dr). I was REALLY nervous, but he was reaaally nice, he told me that he didn't want me to feel pressured to do something just to please him, that we can take things slowly if I felt uncomfortable, obviously all the nice talk just made me want to do it even more! 

So I DID IT. It was weird taking his pants off and holding his dick in my hands for the first time, but it felt natural to just...put it in my mouth. I'm not going to go into detail, but I just tried to follow some of the tips I read online (the basic stuff) and I think it didn't went terribly. At some point I felt his hands on my head and I thought ""omg, he's going to push my head and this will not end well"", but he was just playing with my hair and giving me head scratches (soooo nice). He came after a while (something like 10/15 minutes, thankfully because I was getting tired), I hadn't really thought about what I was going to do when he came, but there in the moment I had his dick in my mouth, he said he was going to come and I felt it would ruin the moment if I took it out. I ended up swallowing because it was easier and faster than figuring out wtf I was going to do with it.
He seemed happy at the end and I got a lot of kisses and cuddles so I'm gonna put it in the mind folder of positive experiences. 

TL;DR: Nice guys don't finish last, nice guys get blowjobs.

**Edit:** Guys, GUYS. Thank you for all the nice messages, now I just hope he's not a redditor. And so much karma...on a throwaway ):.

**Edit**: Wow, did not expect this thread to blow up so much. AskMen/AskWomen has sort of turned into, ""How do I get this girl/guy to like me...?"" sort of thread.


Thank you guys so much for your stories. In case you didn't notice (many have not), I am a girl. Recently I've had close male friends of mine confide to me, even though I know they have closer friends than me and it just really made me think that something with our gender roles must be screwed up. Even if they do talk about it, it's always very straight, to the point, and sometimes a bit awkward with them expressing themselves.


I am very glad I made this thread if for no other reason for men to be able to express themselves and what they are going through and to open people's eyes to this phenomena. I have a decent handful female friends who think it's a turn off if a *male* shares his emotions and I think that that gender expectation has got to change.


Thank you guys for opening my eyes even more to a this hidden problem. If anyone would like to PM me, I would be more than happy to talk or let you rant or anything. Thank you.",AskMen,1412
