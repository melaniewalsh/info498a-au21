Sorted in order of year awarded.

Many people asked for extended reviews - I’ve included a link to full reviews on each of these snippets.

***Starship Troopers*** **by Robert A. Heinlein**

* **Plot:** Welcome to the Mobile Infantry, the military of the future!
* **Page Count:** 263
* **Award:** 1960 Hugo
* **Worth a read:** Yes
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, World, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test:** Fail
* **Technobabble:** Minimal
* **Review:** Status as classic well earned. A fun space romp even if it heavily glorifies the military. No worrisome grey morality. Compelling protagonist and excellent details keep book moving at remarkable speed.

***A Canticle for Leibowitz*** **by Walter M. Miller Jr.**

* **Plot:** The Order of Leibowitz does its best to make sure that next time will be different.

* **Award:** 1961 Hugo
* **Worth a read**: Yes
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or Character)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** Minimal
* **Review:** I love the first section of this book, greatly enjoy the second, and found the third decent. That said, if it was only the first third, the point of the book would still be clear. Characters are very well written and distinct.

***Stranger in a Strange Land*** **by Robert A. Heinlein**

* **Plot:** Michael Smith, the Man From Mars, struggles to understand Earth culture.
* **Page Count:** 408
* **Award:** 1962 Hugo
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, World, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** Minimal
* **Review:** Started out enjoying it, probably to about the halfway mark. Interesting fish-out-of-water tale. And then we went for a BA in religion with a concentration in polyamory, pedophilia, and just a whole bunch of sex - and not a lot more. Grok Count: 487 (1.2/page)

***The Man in the High Castle*** **by Philip K. Dick**

* **Plot:** Turns out it'd be bad if the Axis had won.
* **Page Count:** 249
* **Award:** 1963 Hugo
* **Worth a read**: No, but it hurts to say it
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or Character)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** Minimal
* **Review:** I wanted to like this more. Some details are excellent, like people constantly consulting the Tao Te Ching. But the MacGuffin of an in-universe alternate history book seems self-serving, and the actual alt history is not that interesting. The big twist is also a surprise to characters in-universe, but not to us as readers, which has it fall a bit flat.

***Way Station*** **by Clifford D. Simak**

* **Plot:** Since the Civil War, Enoch Wallace has manned the alien transport hub on Earth.
* **Page Count:** 210
* **Award:** 1964 Hugo
* **Worth a read**: Yes! As soon as possible.
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass
* **Technobabble:** Some
* **Review:** An exceptional book. Enoch's journals give us peeks at a vast galaxy of different aliens, all distinct. At the center of this vast cosmos is a superb depiction of isolation and loneliness. The writing is poetic yet unpretentious. Read this book.

***The Wanderer*** **by Fritz Leiber**

* **Plot:** A mysterious planet appears out of hyperspace, high jinks ensue.
* **Page Count:** 320
* **Award:** 1965 Hugo
* **Worth a read**: For the love of all you hold dear, No.
* **Primary Driver:** (No)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** Plenty
* **Review:** How do you take a book about a planet of freedom fighting sexy space cats appearing out of hyperspace to devour the moon and make it so boring? So many characters, none of them have personalities except for racial stereotypes. Silly to include multiple comic relief characters when the book itself is a joke. I think I understand book burning now.

***Dune*** **by Frank Herbert**

* **Plot:** The desert planet of Arrakis holds many secrets, possibly enough to shift the outcomes of interplanetary war and political intrigue.
* **Page Count:** 610
* **Award:** 1966 Hugo and 1966 Nebula
* **Worth a read**: Yes, of course.
* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, **World**, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass
* **Technobabble:** Moderate
* **Review:** Excellent and epic. Intrigue, cool characters, action. A slow burn at times, and the spice ex machina is a bit overdone. Switching perspectives and characters ramps up tension to superb effect.

***This Immortal*** **by Roger Zelazny**

* **Plot:** A (somewhat) immortal man guides a group (including an alien) on a tour of post-nuclear-war Earth.
* **Page Count:** 174
* **Award:** 1966 Hugo
* **Worth a read**: Yes
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, World, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** Minimal
* **Review:** This was originally serialized and you can feel it while reading; it does not have a plot so much as a series of events. Narrator is hilarious without being unbearable - worth reading for his excellent commentary.

***Flowers for Algernon*** **by Daniel Keyes**

* **Plot:** An experimental procedure takes Charlie Gordon from mentally handicapped to genius.
* **Page Count:** 270
* **Award:** 1967 Nebula
* **Worth a read**: Yes
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, World, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** Minimal
* **Review:** Superb writing, absolutely heartrending plot. Story told exclusively through Charlie's progress reports; shifts in tone and style throughout the book convey as much as the text itself. Takes a difficult subject and addresses it with tact and grace. All the tears.

***Babel-17*** **by Samuel R. Delaney**

* **Plot:** A series of attacks by the invaders have only one thing in common: the mysterious language Babel-17
* **Page Count:** 173
* **Award:** 1967 Nebula. You read that right. This tied with *Flowers for Algernon.*
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or Character)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabel-17:** Go big or go home.
* **Review:** Boring. Very boring. Just so boring. Is the idea that language dictates thought interesting? Sure. Is it enough to carry a story? Nope. Dull story, tepid characters, belabored central concept. Handful of neat ideas that don't make up for the rest. Nap time in book form.

***The Moon is a Harsh Mistress*** **by Robert A. Heinlein**

* **Plot:** The Moon is ready for a revolution, and only a supercomputer with a sense of humor is smart enough to lead it.

* **Award:** 1967 Hugo
* **Worth a read**: Yes
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, World, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass

***Lord of Light*** **by Roger Zelazny**

* **Plot:** The Hindu gods have kept the world in the Dark Ages: it is time for them to die.
* **Page Count:** 319
* **Award:** 1968 Hugo
* **Worth a read**: Yes
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or Character)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** Minimal
* **Review:** A fascinating depiction of religion and reincarnation supported by technology. Multiple stories (7) of varying quality come together well, though pacing can be a bit all over. Superb world-building and novel use of Hindu myths.

***The Einstein Intersection*** **by Samuel R. Delany**

* **Plot:** Kid Death has taken Friza and it's up to Lo Lobey to stop him.
* **Page Count:** 142
* **Award:** 1968 Nebula
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or Character)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** Moderate
* **Review:** A distant post-apocalyptic world (30,000 years in the future) with wildly inconsistent rules is for some reason still referring to the Beatles and Greek myths. Starring an uninteresting first person narrator who stumbles from one event to another.
* [**Full Review Blog Post**](https://dontforgettoreadabook.blogspot.com/2020/07/the-einstein-intersection-by-samuel-r.html)

***Rite of Passage*** **by Alexei Panshin**

* **Plot:** Upon turning 14, everyone aboard the ship must survive 30 days unassisted on one of the colony planets.
* **Page Count:** 254
* **Award:** 1969 Nebula
* **Worth a read**: Yes, but it's YA.
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass
* **Technobabble:** Minimal
* **Review:** A coming-of-age story, a clearly YA entry. Good approach to perspective and prejudice by showing what those living on ships think of on planets and vice versa. A number of themes are told a bit on the nose; this makes sense given the younger target audience.

***Stand on Zanzibar*** **by John Brunner**

* **Plot:** 2010 is bleak; overpopulation, eugenics, corporate colonialism, racism, and violence abound.
* **Page Count:** 650
* **Award:** 1969 Hugo
* **Worth a read**: Yes? It's New Wave SF - love it or hate it.
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or Character)
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass
* **Technobabble:** Minimal
* **Review:** Highly experimental in form, this book is a tough read. Detailed world-building depicted in interesting ways. Hated some of it, but felt like it was worth the challenge. Pretty much everything that comes up has a payoff - even if you don't like the book, you have to acknowledge that it's impressive.

I'll continue to post each decade of books when they're done, and do a final master list when through everything, but it's around 200 books, so it'll be a hot minute. I'm also only doing the Novel category for now, though I may do one of the others as well in the future.

If there are other subjects or comments that would be useful to see in future posts, please tell me! I'm trying to keep it concise but informative. I’ve done my best to add things that people requested the first time around.

Any questions or comments? Fire away!

At the request of a number of you, I’ve written up extended reviews of everything and made a blog for them. I’ve included the links with the posts for individual books. I try to put up new reviews as fast as I read them. Here’s the link if you’re curious: [http://dontforgettoreadabook.blogspot.com/](http://dontforgettoreadabook.blogspot.com/)

A few folks suggested doing some kind of youtube series or podcast - I can look into that as well, if there’s interest.

Other Notes:

* I erroneously included *Starship Troopers* and *Cancticle* in the previous post. They were both published in ‘59 but only won in ‘60 and ‘61.
* I’ve been using this spreadsheet, as well as a couple others that kind Redditors have sent. [https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/8z1oog/i\_made\_a\_listspreadsheet\_of\_all\_the\_winners\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/8z1oog/i_made_a_listspreadsheet_of_all_the_winners_of/) so a huge thanks to [u/velzerat](https://www.reddit.com/u/velzerat/) and [u/BaltSHOWPLACE](https://www.reddit.com/u/BaltSHOWPLACE/)
* Thanks to [u/Kamala\_Metamorph](https://www.reddit.com/u/Kamala_Metamorph/) for the Technobabble category name.

The Bechdel Test is a simple question: do two named female characters converse about something other than a man. Whether or not a book passes is not a condemnation so much as an observation; it was the best binary determination I could find. Seems like a good way to see how writing has evolved over the years. At the suggestion of some folks, I’m loosening it to non-male identified characters to better capture some of the ways that science fiction tackles sex and gender.

Here’s a further explanation from [u/Gemmabeta](https://www.reddit.com/u/Gemmabeta/) (in a discussion on the previous post)

&gt;To everyone below bitching about the Bechdel Test. The test is used as a simple gauge of the aggregate levels of sexism across an entire medium, genre, or time period. It is **NOT** a judgement on individual books or movies. The test is intentionally designed to be trivially easy to pass with even the most minimum of effort (there are basically no book or film that fails a male version of the Bechdel test; heck, most chick lit and women-centric fiction manages to pass the male Bechdel test--with the possible exception of *Pride and Prejudice*).  
&gt;  
&gt;The the fact that such a large percentage of books and movies fail the test is a sign of the general lack of good female characters in literature/film (especially in previous eras) and the females character that did exist tends to only exist to prop up a man--even in many stories where the woman is technically the main character.  
&gt;  
&gt;PS. The test is also not a measure of the artistic merit of a work or even the feminist credentials of a work (for example, the world's vilest and most misogynistic porno could pass the test simply by having two women talk about pizza for 5 minutes at the beginning), it purely looks at plotting elements and story structure.

Technobabble example!

&gt;""There must be intercommunication between all the Bossies. It was not difficult to found the principles on which this would operate. Bossy functioned already by a harmonic vibration needed to be broadcast on the same principle as the radio wave. No new principle was needed. Any cookbook engineer could do it—even those who believe what they read in the textbooks and consider pure assumption to be proved fact. It was not difficult to design the sending and receiving apparatus, nor was extra time consumed since this small alteration was being made contiguous with the production set up time of the rest. The production of countless copies of the brain floss itself was likewise no real problem, no more difficult than using a key-punched master card to duplicate others by the thousands or millions on the old-fashioned hole punch computer system."" - They'd Rather Be Right

Cheers, Everyone!

freakyattractions,2020-06-10 18:43:05+00:00,The Human Zoo,"What if I told you that right now, there is an enterprise built entirely on unimaginable human suffering? Its core facility keeps captives just like you and I in cells forcing them to move in repetitive loops over and over again for years on end, with no escape possible. Even the relief of eventual death won’t save them. Their captors have designed methods to keep them alive, indefinitely even. Considering thier great value to the company, they will stop at nothing to maintain them as long as possible.  

This Hellhole is known as The Human Zoo. It is not talked about in the mainstream of course. It is a place designed for only very special members of the highest of elite classes. Individuals with incredible power and all the resources in the universe, allowing them to enjoy this cruel display. 

I say universe because the patrons of this place do not come from just Earth. At the facility’s entrance there is a gateway, where various beings from across the galaxy and perhaps even further may enter from. 

I am sure you are wondering how I know all this. Well believe it or not I was born there. I did not even know I was “human” at first. It took me a while to figure that one out. My youth was essentially spent staring out my enclosure’s window watching as the entities gawked in at me. I began to notice that some of them looked like me and others radically different. However, without understanding anything else about the world around me, it meant very little.

Once I matured, my display was arranged to appear as if it was a traditional American suburban household. The primary focus being the Kitchen portion. 

They trained my preselected mate and I through the use of shock devices, to operate the kitchen in the most visibly appealing manner possible. The meals we created were all just for the show. 

That was the unit I spent the most of my existence in. It is hard to say now but it was probably twenty years. I was given several mates throughout that time but there was only one that meant anything to me, Emily. She was very beautiful but also sad. I don’t think she had the mental fortitude it takes to live in The Human Zoo as long as she did. We didn’t speak all that much, considering at the time I didn’t really know how, but I could somehow understand the sadness from deep within her eyes. 

She was not born in the facility; she was brought in from the outside and eventually seemed to lose touch with reality. She would murmur the words “I’m sorry little bear…” to herself over and over again. Until one day she just collapsed. 

I didn’t see her again for a long time, until I was moved to a traditional living room set up. Across from my unit I could see an office setting with rows of cubicles and computers. Emily was in the second row rigidly staring into a computer screen. Her mouth somehow stitched into a strange fake smile. At that point, I began to truly understand the wickedness of our captors and I wondered if they put me there on purpose for some sick experiment. 

About a year later, I was transferred into an area where I could see a kiosk at the entrance of the facility, through my viewing window. I saw every type of individual from bizarre looking extraterrestrials to elegant well-dressed humans. 

Most of the nonhumans paid for their entrance with these vials of blue liquid, although there were many forms of payment accepted there. I remember human money seemed the strangest to me though. It was just this silver coin that touched a device but didn’t seem to give anything tangible to the establishment, which was a difficult concept for someone with my limited knowledge.

A few years later was when I first saw Bran. He was a little human with two larger ones by his side which I now understand are his parents. His father was an especially big man with an army jacket full of shiny insignias and his mother was a tall stern looking woman. 

After paying, I was the first exhibit they came to. Bran stared in my window and gazed at me with a fascination I have yet to see in any other human. He then tugged on his dad’s coat and pointed at me. I knew from that moment this was not just a normal child. The emptiness and desire behind his eyes knew no bounds. His father then nodded and took a photo of me, walking over to one of the facilities personnel to speak with them.

Later that day I awoke confused in a jumpsuit, connecting my arms together from behind me, so I couldn’t move. I was stuck inside this dark space with the sound of an engine whirling somewhere nearby. I laid like that for hours until a giant door opened, and a light shined into my eyes. I was then grabbed by two men and injected with a needle putting me to sleep once again. 

The next time I woke up I was inside of another containment unit not too unlike the one I had been in the majority of my life. There was a large viewing window and I was surrounded by this table and chairs with these plastic versions of humans sitting in them, which I now know are called manikins. Through the window I could see a large kids bedroom with a glass door at the other end looking out onto the ocean, which was something I had never seen before but learned about later in books. 

The little boy Bran crept up to the tank with a large smile and began to tap on the glass. His grin seeming to grow larger and larger as he stared in at his new toy. His father then came into my unit through a door on the side and put a book on the table in front of me called “The Mount”. 

He was then followed by a kind looking old woman named Alice, who over the next few years taught me how to, not only read the book, but about many other things. She worked in servitude of the family and seemed to appreciate them greatly for it. She’d tell me day in and out about how good my life was, showing me countless examples of other humans living without caretakers and suffering in pain. Often she stated that if I could just follow certain principles laid out in the book and be trusted, then I would have a good life and for a while I believed it. Aside from being locked in my cell for hours at a time once Bran grew bored of me, things were fine.

However, the thought of Emily, would return to me every now and then in my dreams. Her body frozen in that office cubicle, staring into a computer screen until the end of time. It was just too much for me to bare. 

So, I decided I would play my owner’s game for a while until they unintentionally divulged enough information to me to plan her escape. This actually worked out very well. Over time, I learned how to get the family’s facility access coin, the location of the zoo and most importantly where their family firearm was. 

Then one day while Bran’s parents were away at a party, I made my move. After subduing Bran, I gained access to the gun. Holding her at gun point, I had Alice drive me to the family’s plane and forced their pilot to take me to the Zoo. 

However, when we arrived the facility it wasn’t there anymore. It was just this wide-open dune surrounded by mountains, except for one thing lying on the sand. It was a small glass vile containing some of the blue liquid I had seen exchanged so many times before. As I looked closer, I realized there was also something buried underneath the sand. 

I started digging and soon came to the horrifying realization of what it was. Emily’s body.

How they knew I was coming, and exactly who I was coming for I’ll never know. Either way, I believe she was left as an offering to me. If I just give up, then we are even, and I can go on living my life any way I see fit. Possibly even making a large amount of money off of the blue vial they left. 

Emily was the only thing in my life that felt real at all and what the facility neglects to see is that you can only push lifeforms so far before they have nothing left to lose and there isn’t a thing in the world more dangerous than that.

BeoMiilf,2020-04-16 12:41:26+00:00,My BIGGEST problem with Dune (2020) that no one has mentioned,"First, let me start off by saying that I am the biggest Dune fan, no one is as big a Dune fan as I am. I read Dune the first day it came out in 1965, and also the following novels the first day they came out.

My biggest problem with the newest film coming out came when I read that Denis Villeneuve shot most of the Arrakis scenes in the deserts of Jordan. Are you kidding me? The fact that it's not even shot on location in Arrakis is going to ruin the film for me. How are we supposed to believe that this is an alien world when it's filmed on Earth? This most likely means there probably won't even be real sandworms in the film. What a joke.",dune,1735

&gt;Replacement DM for the week as regular DM is bogged with college work.

&gt;So doing a quick homebrew one-off, only one of the players actually showed up.

&gt;Run the session anyway as I have nothing else to do.

&gt;He plays as a Paladin.

&gt;His Paladin is being sent to a desert wasteland because there's been a spike of necromantic activity.

&gt;First fight ensues.

&gt;He gets a bit hurt, but nothing too crazy.

&gt;Decides to return to the city and look for help.

&gt;Stops by a potion shop and gets a couple necrotic resistance potions.

&gt;Can't get the High General of the nation's military to help as he's too occupied talking to the Queen about an eastern warfront.

&gt;Finds an old rugged general in the barracks and recruits him to help.

&gt;Back to the desert.

&gt;The Necromancer Lord is in a massive citadel.

&gt;This citadel is behind a gatehouse.

&gt;The gatehouse is guarded by a Skeletal Colossus construct.

&gt;Paladin decides to try and find a way to dispatch of him without initiating actual combat, investigates the area.

&gt;Finds, on top of a dune, a giant Olmec-style statue head laying in the sand.

&gt;Paladin decides to roll a strength check to see if he can get the head out and roll it into the Skeletal Colossus like a bowling pin.

&gt;Natural 1.

&gt;Paladin activates an ancient temple's trap mechanism, opening a giant pit beneath his ally, who promptly falls in and gets killed by a ruined pillar that fell in as well.

&gt;Decides to find another way inside the gatehouse.

&gt;Climbs in through a window.

&gt;Finds a rune-engraved skull in a chest and crushes it.

&gt;This frees six regular skeletons guarding the gatehouse.

&gt;Paladin rolls for diplomacy

&gt;17

&gt;Manages to get the skeletons to help him while they still have time before the reanimation wears off.

&gt;Basically create a skeleton ladder over the gatehouse.


**** 


&gt;On the other side the Paladin is greeted with a massive horde of skeletal minions in the distance, guarding the citadel.

&gt;The Necromancer Lord was preparing an army and had most of them watch over the citadel walls.

&gt;Paladin finds the doorway to a hidden laboratory in the wall of a steep dune.

&gt;Tries to open it, rolls a strength check.

&gt;Another Natural 1.

&gt;In his attempts to open it, he accidentally causes a landslide. Two of his skeleton allies are crushed by rocks and a third is crushed by a rock that was going to crush the Paladin (the skeleton got successful Dexterity and Strength rolls to push the Paladin out of the way).

&gt;Inside the hidden laboratory there's a boss fight against one of the more fiendish necromantic creations, a magic-casting, axe-wielding, four-headed Bonewraith.

&gt;Two more skeleton allies die to the Bonewraith.

&gt;Bonewraith is defeated through coordination between the Paladin and his last skeleton friend.


****


&gt;Finally some time passes and they're on the ramparts of the citadel. Sneaking by a couple guards they manage to enter the spire where the lord was at the top of.

&gt;They find bodies packed into crates and the last skeleton friend leaves, telling him to go forward.

&gt;Paladin reaches the top of the spire.

&gt;Asks the Lord why he's doing it.

&gt;evilmonologue.mp4

&gt;Initiate fight with the Lord.

&gt;Screeching is heard in the distance.

&gt;Does some good Con saves and blocks a good portion of damage dealt to him through the Lord's necrotic bolts.

&gt;As the fight goes on, the screeching gets louder, followed by the spire shaking.

&gt;At about the halfway mark the Lord's pet makes an appearance, a massive Dracolich.

&gt;Paladin preemptively pops a necrotic resistance potion to resist the Dracolich's breath weapon.

&gt;Despite the Dracolich being present, the shaking persists.

&gt;Not even the Lord is sure of what's going on.

&gt;Eventually, the Paladin looks down from the spire.

&gt;Original skeleton friend has returned with the Skeletal Colossus from the gatehouse.

&gt;The fight is now more even and the Colossus, under the Paladin's command, focuses on the Dracolich.

&gt;Dracolich gets down to single digit HP, and in a last ditch effort, tries to grapple onto the Colossus and knock him off the spire. Rolling a Strength check.

&gt;Natural 20.

&gt;The Colossus is knocked off the spire, falling to pieces upon impact on the ground.

&gt;With the Colossus dead and the Paladin at about 5 HP, not sure what to do, the Paladin looks towards his skeleton friend.

&gt;Skeleton friend looks around.

&gt;Points towards the Lord, who was near death at this point.

&gt;In one final attack, the Paladin strikes down the Lord, killing him.

&gt;As he dies the Dracolich quickly weakens, the remaining life from it draining into nothing.

&gt;The skeleton puts a hand on the Paladin's shoulder and nods before dissolving into ash.


****

&gt;Now, with the Lord dead and the necromantic effort halted, the Paladin returns home.

&gt;For the first time, the player interrupts the scene, for he had made a realization.

&gt;""This entire session, I almost died three times.""

&gt;""Yeah?""

&gt;""I completely forgot I had Lay on Hands.""

&gt;Me and Paladin have a good laugh before he continues on home, ending the session.


****

&gt;TL;DR: Doing a one-off with a Paladin that not only manages to kill 4 NPC allies, and defeat a Necromancer Lord (killing a fifth by doing so), but he did it all forgetting he was even able to use Lay on Hands to save himself, despite being near death three times.",DnDGreentext,1109

JohanKaramazov,2019-08-14 21:54:25+00:00,"Exactly one year ago I took up reading, today I finished my 250th book. These have been my favorites.","Before I'm asked, I read for 4-5 hours a day and don't have a conventional 9-5 job so I have plenty of time to read throughout the day. That's how I've been able to devour book after book. 

[Here's a link to every book I've read, feel free to ask me about any book in this list if you're on the fence about it.](https://imgur.com/a/sOwySVE)

**Science Fiction**: 

*The Three Body Problem trilogy, Cixin Liu* -- This trilogy is always getting thrown out whenever asks for a good ""alien"" or ""first contact"" book, for good reason. I dont think any other book(s) goes such in depth when it comes to character development and global politics than these. The books span from the cultural revolution in China, to many centuries in the future. 

*Dune, Frank Herbert* -- I dont think I've ever read a sci-fi book so beautifully written. From the dialogue between the characters to everything else. This book was one of those books you enjoy to actually read more for the writing style than the story itself (not that the story was bad, it wasn't) similar to the book Lolita. I loved this book and wish it was longer. 

*Extracted Trilogy, RR Haywood* -- This is a time travel trilogy where everything is very easy to follow. Its not one of those mindfuck reads where you have to do extensive mental gymnastics to keep up with the plot. You will immediately fall in love with the characters and their collective humor.

**Fiction**:

*The Goldfinch, Donna Tartt* -- I enjoyed this book more for the characters than the story itself. Boris to this day is still one of my all-time favorite book characters of all time. I dont think this book is as good as Tartt's other novel ""Secret History"", but I enjoyed this one more. The movie is set to come out next month as well!

*The Great Alone, Kristin Hannah* -- This book takes place in the late 70s and is about an abusive Vietnam vet and his family and their quest to ""start fresh"" in Alaska. This is a relatively new book, having been published last year but out of all of the novels I've read, this was one of my favorites. Good character depth and a long timeline of events that dont feel rushed or glossed over. 

*The Wind-Up Bird Chronicles, Haruki Murakami* -- This is by far my favorite Murakami book. There's a part in the book where a general is telling a war-time story, those that have already read the book know what I'm talking about. Its one of the best parts of the book and a story within a story that has stuck with me since reading it. If you haven't read Murakami yet, this is a good place to start. 

**Non-Fiction**:

*Missoula, Jon Krakauer* -- You probably know Krakauer from Into Thin Air (worth the hype), but in this book he tackles rape, rape allegations and the legal process of rape within Universities, specifically Missoula. This book was very eye opening to me because it delves deeper into victims and their experiences. Before this book, all I knew was what was said on television about rape trials, basically he said she said, and the trials' verdicts. Reading this made me much more sympathetic to victims/accusers. Given the current #MeToo movement and the empowerment of victims to come forward, I think if there's one book you take away from this post, it's this one. 

*Tribe, Sebastian Junger* -- This author is the mastermind behind the famous documentary ""Restrepo"" that followed Army soldiers in the dangerous Afghan Korengal valley. In this book he focuses a lot more on returning soldiers, PTSD and how to better understand combat and non-combat veterans. This is a very short read (45mins - 1hr) but you come away with such a better understanding of veterans and their difficulty of readjusting to civilian life.

*Fall and Rise: The Story of 9/11, Mitchell Zuckoff* -- This book on 9/11 focuses less on the actual terrorist actions, and what led to those actions, and more on actual people impacted by 9/11. I have to warn you though, this book is extremely heart-breaking. You learn a lot about victims and their final days, their final actions and final moments of life. It's a gut-wrenching read that gives you a whole new intimate understanding of the suffering that went on that day and the days, weeks and years that followed. I've never cried while reading a book but this book was as close as I ever got to doing so. 

*No Place To Hide, Glenn Greenwald* -- Greenwald is the journalist who broke the Snowden/NSA mass surveillance story in 2013. This book covers the events of before, during and after his Snowden meeting in Hong Kong. He also goes into depth of some of the NSA spying tools, how they work and who they target. Its a very digestable book and you dont need to be a computer whiz to understand the programs he lays out. Greenwald is one of my favorite journalists and this book further cemented that for me. 

*The Anatomy of Terror, Ali Soufan* -- Soufan is a former counter-terrorism FBI agent who in this book details exactly how radical Islamists think, operate and specifically on the rise of the islamic state in the Middle East after the US invaded Iraq. He also goes deep into the sectarian wars between terror groups themselves (Sunnis vs Shias etc). This book gave me a better understanding of how from nothing in 2009, IS rose to power.

**Science**:

*A Crack In Creation, Jennifer Doudna* -- If you've heard of the gene editing method ""CRISPR"" and the many many medical benefits it can have for humanity, it is because of Jennifer Doudna, the scientist who in 2013 discovered that CRISPR Cas-9 has the ability to edit DNA. This book was really fascinating and very easy to read. You dont need to have an interest in biology or genetic engineering to enjoy the book. This book led me down the DNA subject rabbit hole and I wound up reading books on Paleontology, ancient human DNA from Neanderthals and Denisovans, to evolution and ancient life. If you want to learn more about the benefits of gene editing, this is the book to read. 

*The Hidden Reality, Brian Greene* -- Greene is a world-renowned physicist most notably known for String Theory. This book is a layman's introduction into String Theory and the multi-universe theory. Again, you dont need to have an interest in physics to enjoy the book. I have never even taken a physics class before reading this book and deeply enjoyed it. If you like watching youtube videos by PBS Space Time, you'll enjoy this book. Greene does a good job in laying out all the information in a way anyone can understand it. 

*Homo Deus, Yuval Noah Harari* -- If you've read Sapiens by this author where he focuses on who we are and how we got here and enjoyed it, then you'll enoy this book that focuses on who we're becoming and where we're going. A bunch of broad subjects are discussed in this book and you'll walk away having digested a bunch of information. He's a historian so we wont dive too deeply into a subject but you'll instead get a broad picture of it. 

**History**:

*The Road To Jonestown, Jeff Guinn* -- Before I read this book, I always thought of the Jonestown event as a mass suicide by a bunch of religious cultists following a crazy ass religious/socialist zealot. I remember watching YouTube videos on the event as well and forming my opinion on it from them. But there's just so much more to it. It gives you perspectives from former members, how they were either brainwashed or coerced to remain in the 'Peoples Temple'. How the vast majority of the residents of Jonestown were actually lied to and fooled to going to Guyana to how those that did not commit suicide were either shot or forcibly injected cyanide. A very powerful book with insight on how cults operate.

*The Billion Dollar Spy, David E. Hoffman* -- This book follows Adolf Tolkachev, a soviet engineer turned CIA spy during the cold war. For years he fed military secrets to his handler, secrets that saved the US over a billion dollars earning him his nickname and the title of this book. I had never heard of this man until reading this book but I'm glad I did. The man had massive balls and risked everything to do anything he could to topple the soviet union. 

*House To House, SSG. David Bellavia* -- Of all the war related books I've read, this is the most gripping and exhilarating one yet. Its a memoir written by Staff Sergeant David Bellavia that takes place during the height of the Iraqi insurgency in Fallujah. If you read this book, you immediately think ""bullshit, this doesnt even happen in movies, this is obviously fake"" because of how crazy the events in the book are. But they're not only 100% true, but were all captured on film thanks to journalist Michael Ware. It was just a few weeks ago too that the author was awarded the Medal of Honor, the highest military honor in the US, for the actions he took which he laid out in this memoir of his. Great read. 

*Man's Search For Meaning, Viktor Frankl* -- Frankl is a psychiatrist who was sent to a concentration camp by the nazis during WW2. He observed and noted the behavior of his fellow prisoners and saw how despite the horrid conditions they lived in, they continued to find meaning in their lives. This book is very powerful and it is also a short read given the book is 2 parts. You can make do with only reading the first part, the second part he does a deeper dive into psychology and logo-therapy. Many people on this sub have recommended this book and its with good merit. This is a powerful book. 


**Books that live up to the hype**:

*Harry Potter Series, JK Rowling* -- Dont ask me why I like these books. Im a 24 year old dude who could not turn away for one second after picking up these books. I owe an apology to all those kids I mentally judged as a kid because they were really into HP. I thought the allure of these books would be lost on me because of my age but that wasnt the case. If you havent read them yet, you should at least give them a chance. 

*A Song Of Ice And Fire, George RR Martin* -- I am very glad that I decided to read these books before starting to watch the HBO series. I loved these books and although it was challenging, for me at least, to get into Martin's writing style where he goes back and forth between characters, it became easier as I read on and started to catch on to the plot and I grew to like the style. I've expressed to my family how much I like this series so I'm looking forward to getting Winds of Winter for my 40th birthday. 

*Anything by Kurt Vonnegut* -- I've read about half a dozen of Vonnegut's books and havent been let down by any of them. They're a treasure trove of quotes and analogies. There are those who are contrarians and say he's overrated because of how much hype he gets but dont be turned away by them. He's a good author who deserves 100% of the admiration he gets.

*The Kite Runner &amp; A Thousand Splendid Suns, Khaled Hosseini* -- I read both of these books my senior year in high school and decided to re-read them because I thoroughly enjoyed them back then. They were just as good as I remembered them. Hosseini gets recommended a lot on this sub for tear-jerking books and rightfully so. His books take place or have root in Afghanistan given hes an Afghan native himself and he gives good insight on what it is like coming up as an Afghan youth. Great author.

*Dark Matter, Blake Crouch* -- You probably already read this book for the off chance you havent, you should. Its recommended here religiously for good reason. You get sucked in from page one and the story is very easy to follow. His new book ""Recursion"" is also worth a look if you read Dark Matter and enjoyed it.

**Overall favorite book**:

*East of Eden, John Steinbeck* -- Out of the 250 books I read, I have not enjoyed one more than I have East of Eden. This was a very easy choice to make, about one third into the book I knew I was reading something special. The characters, Steinbeck's way of writing, the story-line, everything. There's a very good chance that no book will ever dethrone this one as my favorite and that makes me a little sad. Nonetheless, I am very glad that I read it. Its a beautiful book that I look forward to re-reading. 


I should clarify that the above list is just my very humble opinion. I have a certain taste in writing and information that the previous authors knew how to struck. I've included a screenshot to all 250 books I've read at the top of this post, [and here as well](https://imgur.com/a/sOwySVE). Feel free to ask me about any single one of them, I remember them perfectly and will to respond to everyone :)

If you also enjoyed some of the books I've read and have a recommendation for me that you'll think I'll like that you don't see in the screenshot, feel free to post it! I'm always looking to reading new authors. Happy reading!",books,18246

&amp;nbsp;

#’Twas the night before Boom crashed down in Uldum

##and not a creature was stirring in their crypt or their tomb,

&amp;nbsp;

But high above the clouds, 

the E.V.I.L. League bickered,

“Me HATE flying,” complained Tog

As his head candle flickered.

&amp;nbsp;

Lazul looked in her crystal 

“I’ve pre-solved de meta!”

“De people like poems-""

But dey like Limericks betta!""

&amp;nbsp;

“So? It’s my turn to steer” snarled Rafaam,

While Lazul held her trance and stayed calm.

“You can’t steer my Rocket,

You bandaged pick-pocket!”

Said Dr. Boom holding a bomb.

&amp;nbsp;

Then the city jets started to sputter,

“We’re screwed,” old Hagatha muttered,

“Me hate FALLING more,”

Tog curled on the floor,

And Doctor Boom laughed and then stuttered,

&amp;nbsp;

“G-Guess I shoulda brought fuel,

but in my defense i'm not a fool,

Most things I try,

aren’t built to fly,

I’m into things that explode as a rule.""

&amp;nbsp;

Then as Dalaran passed by the moon,

it started to shake and to swoon,

“Me gonna vomit!”

As it fell like a comet,

And crash landed into a dune.

&amp;nbsp;

The villains were shaken AND stirred,

“Gather round,” said Rafaam, “for a word.

This desert’s got loot,

new lackeys to recruit,

So our E.V.I.L. plans won’t be deterred!""

&amp;nbsp;

Thus the desert folk all tried to flee,

From the taunt mechs of old Dr. B,

The state of new warriors?

Still endless Destroyers,

And Doctor Boom’s clearly O.P.

&amp;nbsp;

Then Lazul, who represents priest,

said, “You thought me class were deceased.”

Dis expansion be wild!

5 star cards by de mile!

Now in both formats you’ll hate versing me!""

&amp;nbsp;

Togwaggle though was dazed and confused,

“Me not too sure what rogue want to do?”

“Me combo? Me ‘rattle?

Me face tank in battle?

Oh yeah!  Me copy Leeroy the old tried and true!”

&amp;nbsp;

Rafaam threw himself in the mix,

With Warlock’s new bag of tricks,

""And by ‘new' I mean ‘zoo',

“5/5 lackeys will do,

Cause 8/8 on turn three is just sick.”

&amp;nbsp;

Hag emerged from the dirt and the sand,

Corrupting the waters with a wave of her hand.

“You want tier 1 deck?

Forget big shaman dreck,

Watch double battlecry murlocs quickly get banned!”

&amp;nbsp;

All hope seemed lost with the Witch.

But then came a shout - “We’re gonna be rich!”

Then out rode the four,

Who love to explore,

And save expansions when Blizzard’s in a pinch.

&amp;nbsp;

The crowd cheered for that full-health restorer,

Reno and his league of Explorers!

The man put on his cap,

and he started to rap

Like the Brode did in legends of yore.

&amp;nbsp;

*“Yo- Elise, Fin and Brann, Here is the plan:”*

Said that mustachioed man, With his hat and his tan,

*“Highlander was fun, There can be only one*

*But we each need a trick for when the condition is done.*

&amp;nbsp;

**Elise** *check it out, for your third iteration,*

*You’ll copy some cards - ignore the frustration -*

*Of having a good hand with a deck limitation.*

&amp;nbsp;

*And if that doesn’t work you don’t have to freeze,*

*just chuck down a Linecracker and throw out some BEES!,*

*No seriously that card is totally OP.*

&amp;nbsp;

*Now* **Brann**, *little man, you know and I know,*

*That you’ve always had a bit of a chub for the dinos,*

*So you get the rush of summoning King Krush,*

*Is that good enough? Probably…. no.*

&amp;nbsp;

*But your new quest is a sleeper,*

*No need for new tech,*

*It's a real power creeper,*

*Just keep playing your mechs*

*(hey you look like innkeeper)*

*cause SMORCing is what you do best.*

&amp;nbsp;

*Now* **Finley**, *my dear fish,*

*Excuse the obscenity*

*But we’re gonna fuck with Paladin’s identity,*

&amp;nbsp;

*So why not raise mummies?*

*And summon one health?*

*Or how about… murlocs?*

*(look i’m not proud of myself)*

&amp;nbsp;

*And for your power?*  

*It’ll be a blow-out on 2,*

*Cause if you get super lucky,*

*There’s no stopping you.*

&amp;nbsp;

*And finally for* **me!**  *Why, I’ll be a mage!*

*And I’ll go ‘pew pew’ (but never hit face),*

*And secrets I’ll try*

*Cause they’ve been pushed since the beta,*

*Who cares if they banished*

*the best one from the meta,*

*But forget all those tricks,*

*Mage’s stock is not falling,*

*My greatest trick is still conjurer’s calling!""*

&amp;nbsp; 

And as Reno rambled, the people where cheery

But then in the back a kid had a query: 

“Sorry, I don’t mean to pour salt on your hype...

But, doesn’t bomb warrior invalidate your entire archetype?""

&amp;nbsp;

The heroes were speechless…

Could it really be true?

The E.V.I.L. team laughed

It all seemed so cruel.

&amp;nbsp;

*“Damn you Boom,*

 *you bomb lobbing wizard.”*

“Hey don’t blame me

The REAL Villains are Blizzard.""

&amp;nbsp;

And far far away

From up in their tower

Team 5 just sneered

Drunk off their power.

&amp;nbsp;

Then Dave Kosek turned and looked into the lens,

“Here is a special message for all of my friends,

""Don’t worry Hearthstone fans, don’t lose your trust,

The theme of Uldum is to help you collect dust!”

&amp;nbsp;

“On meme cards, on drawbacks, on broken arena,

On combos and priest quest and OP hyena.”

&amp;nbsp;

Will our heroes survive such a relentless onslaught?

Does it matter since all the packs are pre-bought?

No matter - it's time to join in the fight. 

Merry Uldum to all

And to all a Good Night!",hearthstone,1120

leftwinder,2019-07-26 04:52:04+00:00,“The Left Hand of Darkness” by Ursula K. Le Guin should be the gold standard of science fiction,"I see a lot of posts on this sub related to science fiction, and I don’t think this book gets enough credit. The intricacy of the plot, the depth of the characters, and the all-encompassing portrait of the foreign planet “Gethen”, complete with its own societal constructs, religion, and different nations, make this work a true MASTERPIECE of science fiction. I don’t want to take anything away from other great science fiction works like Dune or Ender’s Game or The Lord of the Rings, etc, etc, but TLHOD is not has a great plot, but it has great allegory; it really makes you think about how your life is shaped by things like societal norms, weather, “truth”, relationships, religion, and most importantly gender. The writing is so intentional with every sentence, and it only gets more complex with every re-read. Le Guin deserves every word of the praise that she gets, but the praise that she gets isn’t even half of what she deserves.",books,3934

frog-song,2019-07-05 14:32:48+00:00,Just Finished Dune. Meh?,"Just a preface, I thought this was a good book, but honestly as a sci-fi fan I was a little underwhelmed. 

I've been reading through the classics of 60s - 80s scifi - Larry Niven, Ursula Le Guin, Isaac Asimov etc - but I've always kind of skirted around Dune because of its intense legacy. Everything I'd ever heard about it was that a) it was the best sci-fi novel ever and b) it was insanely long.

But someone recommended it to me the other day and I decided to give it a go. Finished it last night, and my big reaction is... shrug. And I'm bummed! I was so hoping for an amazing experience and it was just... fine.

Let me just say, I did like a lot about it. The world is well constructed, the culture and politics are great, and (exceptionally for a 60's sci-fi novel) the female characters are actually good and well-rounded. It's a well-*built* novel.

My problem with it is Paul. Paul cuts through this plot like a hot knife through butter. Once he acquires his future sight, he has no good reason to lose, and doesn't. Everything he sets out to do, he does, basically effortlessly. The only bad thing that happens to him - the only thing that isn't immediately resolved in his favour - is the death of his son Leto II. His son is born, lives and dies almost entirely off-screen, and Paul appears to get over it almost immediately, so it's hard to feel any kind of a way about it. 

I found myself reminiscing about the Paul of the first third of this book - the noble's son navigating his birthright as a future Duke and the political landscape that is his inheritance - but as soon as he gets his superpowers everything just falls at his feet. He never stumbles, never makes a mistake, and everyone goes out of their way to make sure he gets what he wants, and it's honestly not very interesting to read. Jessica's perspective - with her conflicting loyalties and indecision - is much more interesting and suffers from this overpowered problem much less.

So I didn't hate this book, but I guess I'm just disappointed. I had such high expectations, and in fairness, some of those expectations were met or conceded. But the plot seemed almost incidental to the intended catharsis of Paul just... ripping through everything.",books,3209

""Si, Luis, eet sure smells like bacon. ""

The whole reason for jailbreaking is freedom from Apple's strict policies on modding/tweaking iOS on Apple devices. Why are we so attracted to drama, as a community (ME INCLUDED) that we are now starting to whine if tweaks don't adhere to the rules of this subreddit? Why not just let jailbreaking die as Saurik and others have said it was going to do? 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm not in support of piracy of tweaks/apps that the devs in our community work so hard to bring us. This isn't about that at all. This is about the community crying about rules, enough so that perfectly good tweaks/apps are pulled from their repos. 

&amp;#x200B;

I, for one, don't GAF about Coolstar/PWN drama and while I was waiting patiently for Electra to drop with full A12 support, Chimera dropped first. I have happily been using Chimera with Sileo, Zebra, and Cydia on my XS Max and to me, jailbreaking seems far from dead. But, if we're going to pick at every fucking tweak over every fucking piracy rule of this subreddit, then I see a bleak future for jailbreaking. There, I said my piece. Downvote if you want, IDGAF about Karma. I have always valued the strong community here at r/jailbreak and I'm just upset that we've become a bunch of children looking for brownie points from the mods. No disrespect to the mods either, y'all have tough jobs. But, something has to give. Today, it starts with Cercube. Tomorrow, it's pointing out that Dune, Eclipse, and Noctis are a built-in part of iOS 13, and they get pulled from their repos. Seem far-fetched? I don't think so. Let's see how many other tweaks, ones that we've been using since iOS 3, get pulled simply because the big corporations include it in their premium services. YouTube has billions of dollars - which they probably don't pay taxes on - and we're worried about being able to download videos with a tweak. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR - Why are we attacking tweaks we've been using for years on a piracy witch hunt? We need to stop or jailbreaking will be dead before too long. All the unnecessary drama is just that - UNNECESSARY.",jailbreak,1902
Timmeh1020,2019-05-17 20:47:16+00:00,"I am a mobile Game addict, at one stage I've sent over $30,000 on a single game. This is my Story.","So please accept my apology for the wall of text I feel like context is rather important,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been an avid gamer all my life, my first exposure to gaming was the first Dune game that came out from Westwood studios (the one in 1995, not dune 2000). Back then, you had to load the individual floppy disks and learning the commands in Dos. From there I was hooked on the RTS genre, I was there for the first Command and Conquer and Warcraft, I even played the old mech commander series and dabbled in the first dungeon keeper. I lived through the disappointment of the first few consoles and was there when EA started closing down my old favorite studios.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was young life was chaotic and my family were abusive. The times I get to bury myself in a game gave me a degree of peace as I simply did not need to worry about what people were arguing about around me. I took these habits into my dorm rooms in high school and university as the first chance I get to leave the home I took it and never looked back.

&amp;#x200B;

So fast forward my working life, I managed to land a relatively well paying job and somehow managed to get married along the way. My wife is not that much of a gamer but she was there during the final fantasy days and was also an avid pokemon fan. During this time she was in academia while I was working full time. we had amassed quite a bit of wealth together in rental apartments and were living comfortably. 

&amp;#x200B;

One day, she came home and said her colleague introduced this game called ""Summoner's war"" to her. She showed me the game a little, it had a very anime look to it that I wasn't entirely a fan of but I figured that well it seemed a bit like pokemon so why not give it a try. It was a free to play game to begin with, and it seems like a good time waster that you can have on your phone.

&amp;#x200B;

Little did I know this cute little game would eventually develop into a full blown obsession that in the end almost costed me my marriage. see, I've never heard of a gotcha game before this and Summoner's wars at it's peak was one of the most successful game of it's kind and this game in particular has surpassed 1 Billion USD in it's lifetime revenue. (just goes to show how far it actually went)

&amp;#x200B;

This kind of game is set up in such a way that it tugs at every irrational psychological advantage it can to make a player spend money, let me list the various mechanics it uses:

&amp;#x200B;

* It has over 750 monsters for players to collect - however these monster are replicated into 5 elements (fire, water, wind, light and dark) this potentially makes the collection 5x 750+ monsters
* Monsters are graded from 1-2 star being the lower common monsters and 3-5 star being more rare and powerful, with monsters that start as five star being perceived as being the most powerful.
* All base element monsters (fire, water and wind) are obtainable via special dungeons or via mystical scrolls, which is this games lootbox system. With light and dark monsters only obtainable through special Light and Dark Scrolls which is much rarer and has a complete different drop table.
* You also need to awaken your monsters so that they can unlock interesting skills, this is gated behind a dungeon that you will need to repeatedly run to collect essences of a certain element. These dungeons are only available through out a certain day (for example, a dark essence dungeon will only be available on a monday)
* The game also have a Gearing system called runes. Each monster has six slots that you can equip runes on with each rune giving individual bonuses and each rune ""set"" gives a different kind of overall stat bonus. These runes are also rated from 1-6 stars.
* These runes are obtainable only by farming certain dungeons, each dungeon has a chance to drop these runes.
* To make things further complicated. each runes can come with boosts to certain stats (speed, atk, crit rate etc) and the higher the grades of the runes, the more ""starting stats"" these runes comes with. These starting stats gets randomly augmented when you level up the runes, with each rune being able to be upgraded 15 times and every third upgrade of the rune picking a random sub-stat to strengthen or giving the rune a new sub stat.
* These upgrades are not a guarantee and costs in game currency and there's no way to control these upgrades as they are gated heavily behind RNG
* Speaking of currency, there's two types of currency. Mana (which you need to do any action in game such as upgrading equipment and monsters) and Crystals (the currency that you can spend money on, or farm as a glacier pace)
* This game also limits your playtime by giving you an energy system, this is a set amount of energy that gets deducted when ever you run a dungeon, or try and do other content. This meter slowly refills, you can also recharge this by spending real world money (crystals)
* The game is mainly a PVP game, where player set's up arena defenses consisting of their best defensive monster team of 4. While other players try to beat these defenses and climb up the ladder. This is also gated behind another slowly refilling meter of tickets.
* The ladder resets every week with a ranking system, with various rewards dished out to players of certain rank.

&amp;#x200B;

I am just merely scratching the surface here, but as you can imagine. The system is heavily gated behind RNG and artificial rarity, I also get the feeling that certain monsters are left unbalanced to make them the ""chase"" and the game heavily playing on the brag factor for players and whenever somebody got something rare, a channel wide announcement would be made.

&amp;#x200B;

So it wasn't long before I started spending a little money on the game, at first it was a crystal pack here and there. So that I can run a little more dungeons. Then I started to justify my behavior by saying I need to buy this pack in order to compete and keep up with the competition (at one stage I was part of the top 100 players in the global server) Then after a while I was finding myself shopping on the more expensive packs because there was a chance to get the rarer monsters/runes.

&amp;#x200B;

The game soon became an obsession that I was foregoing sleep for, I was waking up in certain hours so that I can do a raid with guild mates and sadly it was controlling my life. I find myself opening the game on my phone at work, in meetings and with some hind sight horror, even when I was driving, albeit usually when I'm in traffic. 

See the thing about mobile gaming is that the developers know that mobile gaming is more readily accessible and they design their games as such. They don't want you to put the game down and they will put in mechanics that will demand this from you such as daily missions to make you come back to earn those free currency. Or weekend events that on the surface may seem like they are trying to give you free things but in the end is just more ways for them to keep you playing the game to increase the chance that you will spend more money.

&amp;#x200B;

Money was never an issue. I was lucky enough that my hard work earlier in my life and some luck allowed me to not have to worry about supporting my habit. The problem was the excuses that I was telling myself soon became lies that i was telling my wife and the inevitable build up of these little white lies soon became bigger and bigger and when finally when the truth came out it almost broke our marriage because she could not trust me anymore. I had without much ill intent broken one of the basic fundamentals of our relationship. We were only able to slowly repair this damage and find each other again through some counseling and lots of honest self reflection.

&amp;#x200B;

So now, almost 4 years after I quit that game.  I stay away from any games that have Lootbox rng type systems and I count my blessings everyday that I was able to wake up next to my wife. I still play games, but more on PC and with much more restraint of course and I am now trying to develop other outlets and finally trying to speak to some trained professionals about my childhood to maybe see if perhaps speaking with someone can help me.  (sad thing is, like a cigarette I still feel the itch every now and then) 

&amp;#x200B;

So that's it, off my chest. I hope this is a nice cautionary tale for some but mainly I just want to share my story.",TrueOffMyChest,1270

I work as an NSA Contractor -- we have a protocol called “Packet Catch” -- and without going into the technicalities, it isolates outgoing internet traffic from some locations and prevents it from reaching its server. To ensure the user is unaware, the system sends a false receive signal, posing as the accepting server.

Basically, you make a Facebook or Reddit post, the OP gets a ""posted successfully"" message, even seeing the post themselves, but the thing never goes anywhere.

This gives us the ability to not only intercept communications but to sandbox them entirely. It's disturbing tech, but not as disturbing as what I saw caught.

This communication came through, it got filed under a huge program called ""Project Winter"".

Below I have the debrief, I don't have to time to decrypt some portions--I barely had time to translate this.

I hope this posts okay -- I've disabled packet catch in my office for now, but I don't know how long I have.

&gt;My brothers, I cannot send this through the normal channels. I will address the world, for they must know of the horrors the crusaders are unleashing.  
&gt;  
&gt;My name is Abu Adnani, I have fled my camp and my brothers, they are all dead. Slaughtered by the Crusaders’ beast.  
&gt;  
&gt;We were camped out, a fire going and talking about our strategies. How much land we have lost. How the Crusaders are pushing us back so suddenly despite a lack of drone strikes. It was then the proximity alarms went off.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mullah takes his rifle with Mishin and Ali.  
&gt;  
&gt;“What is out there Mishin?” Mullah asks.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mishin looks out through his thermal goggles, “It’s at least three of them… very close together…” he looks at his goggles in frustration, “This must be broken.”  
&gt;  
&gt;A loud howl is heard from the darkness.  
&gt;  
&gt;All of us ready our weapons, Mullah even picks up his rocket.  
&gt;  
&gt;We alert the camp, everyone getting their weapons and rousing our sleeping brethren. Myself, Mullah, Mishin and Ali head out over a dune, weapons at the ready while the camp turns on floodlights and starts generators.  
&gt;  
&gt;On the far side of the camp, one of the lights suddenly goes down. We hear shots being fired, and screaming. We run as quickly as we can to the other side of the camp but stop as another light post falls, sparks flying. Only the light of guns and sounds of conflict and screaming coming from the fallen lights.  
&gt;  
&gt;A sudden explosion occurs, a truck carrying fuel flies into the air in a fiery blaze. Someone launched a rocket inside the camp! What fool would do such a thing?  
&gt;  
&gt;Soon the next closest light is knocked down, and the same sounds are heard, gunfire, screaming, and then silence.  
&gt;  
&gt;We are standing at the next light post. We run, heading into the desert darkness, hoping to outrun whatever is attacking us.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mishin turns and looks at the camp with his thermal goggles, “Something is coming!” he shouts.  
&gt;  
&gt;Before any of us can react, Ali shouts, “A beast!”  
&gt;  
&gt;Before our eyes a hulking mass of white fur and muscle attacks Ali, ripping his head off in an instant and flinging the rest of his body at Mullah.  
&gt;  
&gt;I start shooting the beast.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mishin tries to ready his rifle, but the creature rips his arm off.  
&gt;  
&gt;As it draws closer to me, I can see it illuminated by my gunfire.  Its head is that of a wolf, massive jaws and rows of teeth surrounded by black jowls and white fur.   
&gt;  
&gt;Two pointed ears on its head twist and twitch searching for noise. Its yellow eyes fix on me, its nearly ten-foot-tall mass barreling toward me.  
&gt;  
&gt;Each moment of gun fire shows my bullets pitting into its white fur, staining it red.  
&gt;  
&gt;I continue to fire, trying to strike the creature’s head. A hail of bullets collides with the mighty beast’s skull, and it falls to the ground with a yipe and a whimper, sliding dead in front of my feet.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mullah staggers toward me, his leg is injured from having Alil’s corpse hurled at him.  
&gt;  
&gt;Before our eyes, the beast begins to shrink, seemingly dead.  
&gt;  
&gt;Before long the beast turns into nothing more than a man. He is a powerful looking man, with very dark skin and no hair. The only thing he wears is a set of dog tags. They read:  
&gt;  
&gt;ENCRYPTED: QSit1ulKzMMhssdsvVNInJQ+H/a7d9qfFXPQoEYatQtoubskOOTN0RBn7WjWJsjlkcWTX7DW9pNaeSqoh2oG+g==   
&gt;  
&gt;We drag his corpse back to camp and begin to build the fire taller, ready to dispose of the body. Whatever unholy creature this is, it must be burned, that was what we thought. Other fighters join our efforts as we try to ready it hotter,  It has to burn this unclean thing to ash.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mullah groans in pain, “What was that, Abu? Is it a man? That thing…. It was huge… a monster.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“The crusaders grow desperate. They make pacts with demons from Hell to destroy us! But we will not let them win. By Allah, we will triumph over the Crusaders as always--” Before I finish, I hear screaming from behind me.  
&gt;  
&gt;I turn only to see one man being dragged off behind a tent, the body of the creature now gone, nothing but a trail of blood in the sand leading to the rest of the camp.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mullah is limping but has his rifle, ready to die in battle a martyr.  
&gt;  
&gt;Other fighters join me, who is where I am unsure of at the time. All of us surround the fire, our backs to it, hoping it will stave off the beast.  
&gt;  
&gt;Of the ten tents, there seems to be three already ravaged. We spot the beast running from one tent, moving to a fourth. More gunfire now, blood splatters against tents and limbs can be seen hurled into the air before the light is snuffed out.  
&gt;  
&gt;More men run from the camp towards our fire, joining us in our last stand.  
&gt;  
&gt;We open fire, trying to cover their escape, our shots barely distracting the creature's attention.  
&gt;  
&gt;After a few moments, all is quiet in the camp. We hear the sounds of generators being powered down. An occasional burst of gunfire. The lights are all out. The only light from the bonfire behind us.  
&gt;  
&gt;Our shadows obscure the now darkened camp, and I hear the sounds of shuffling men behind me, some reloading their rifles, some kneeling and praying to Allah.  
&gt;  
&gt;From the darkness, the creature leaps into the air, howling, and pounces on Mullah, killing him as I hear his spine snap, his rib-cage collapsing beneath the weight of the mighty beast. The creature swiftly rips his head from his body, despite Mullah’s body being crushed.  
&gt;  
&gt;One of the fighters points his rocket at the beast. Before I can stop him, the creature pounces on him next.  The fighter falls into the fire, the creature pushing him in with massive hands. It does so knowingly, it grins a sick smile at me, it's yellow eyes locking on my own as it does.  
&gt;  
&gt;My eyes grow wide as I watch my brother-in-arms burnt to a cinder.  
&gt;  
&gt;I drop my weapon and run as fast as I can. In the distance, I hear the screaming panic of my fellow fighters. But I must live to tell others, I know I must! I hear more screaming, bursts of gunfire, and then the sound of ripping and tearing flesh mixed with the beast's cries of pain. Finally, I turn only to see an explosion, the bonfire blasting into the air. Someone must have fired their rocket at the fire, or a grenade went off inside of it.  
&gt;  
&gt;To my abject horror, someone’s head sails through the air and lands before me in the sand. I turn away, hearing more sounds of death and horror. In desperation, I stop near the decapitated head and begin to dig into the sand frantically.  
&gt;  
&gt;I dig as my life depends on it, and then bury myself, taking my shirt and holding it over my head to leave air enough for me to breath.  
&gt;  
&gt;I lay there and wait. The waiting seems to take hours, the sounds of the beast ravaging the camp muted by the sand over my shirt.  
&gt;  
&gt;My body freezes as I feel footsteps near me. The sand vibrates with the mass of the creature. I can hear its breath, sniffing and snorting in the air. It sniffs near me and I pray to Allah that it is sniffing the decapitated head. I feel something on top of me, something rolling. The creature is rolling the head over me! I hold my breath, trying to remain perfectly still.  
&gt;  
&gt;I hear the beast sneeze, it shakes itself and the footsteps vanish slowly. After a few more minutes, I peak my head out. I see nothing, no fire from the camp, no light. I hear nothing. No sounds of my fellow fighters, no sounds from anything living. Even the head is missing, likely taken by the unholy monstrosity of the crusaders.   
&gt;  
&gt;I jump to my feet and run. I run and I do not look back. For hours I run until I see the next camp.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fighters there help me, get me to my feet and give me water. If it had been the day, I never could have crossed such a distance in the sun.  
&gt;  
&gt;That is why I write this now, and I will send it to the world.  
&gt;  
&gt;My God, I hear the howling! I must send this before the Crusader’s beast devours me! Be warned! The Crusaders have sold their souls for victory!

afx0134,2019-02-27 08:55:10+00:00,I got into an argument with a driver and threw a lit cigarette into their 125k car,"Yesterday I was walking to get a coffee on my lunch break, half-zoned out listening to Dune on audiobook for the *n*th time, smoking my second Marlboro since I got off work, when I hear a constant car horn from my left. I jump and look in the direction of the sound. A Mercedes G-class that I saw pull up simultaneous to my arrival at the intersection is inching toward me, its driver, a balding man in his forties screaming what I assume are profanities at me, though they remain incomprehensible to me with the Dune narration still blaring full volume in my headphones. I know this street well, mind you, and I am positive that I don't have a stop sign to halt my walk, while the perpendicular street does. I double check. Indeed. I take out one headphone and hear a, ""move you fucking faggot."" Now, of my many lesser qualities, none get me into more trouble than uncontrollable urge to meet direct confrontation head on. So I stare at the man, standing dead still in the street and begin to walk up to the driver's side door. ""You see that you have a stop sign,"" I say, pointing across the street, ""and see how I don't,"" pointing to the other side of the intersection. More shouting from the man, insults and curses, which culminates with, ""I'll beat your fucking ass."" Remember my urge? Well, ""LET'S FUCKING GO THEN...GET THE FUCK OUT...FUCK YOU."" He somewhat backs down, obviously not prepared for my reaction to his taunts, but the look of hate in his face is indisputable. ""Go back to Mexico, you fucking spic,"" he says. I'm not Mexican, or Latino in any amount, so the insult doesn't cut deep, but I still hate racists, because, well, I'm not a totally irredeemable person, so with my left hand I tap his windshield, calling him any insult I can think of, while with my right I drop my cigarette through his back window onto the white leather seats. I laugh, give him the double-fisted bird, and walk backward across the street. He drives off, only to, I assume, start to notice the burning smell inside his car a few blocks later. In retrospect, I wish I hadn't had thrown the cigarette into his car. I don't feel particularly bad about the act itself, but I have been trying to make a conscious effort of not diving head first into confrontation every time it presents itself to me. But I thought the story was somewhat funny, so there you go.",confession,4253

This morning, I just sat down and decided to give it a really earnest go, and I'm hooked already. I'm about 100 pages in and I love the completeness of this other reality - the politics, the terms, the history - and I love that it's not all explained like I'm a 5-year-old.

Scarlet-Ajani,2019-02-24 20:58:07+00:00,"Stop Asking, Kid.","Okay, the backstory is pretty simple. I work at a ""Sears Hometown Store"" over each summer while i'm in college. The difference between this and a normal Sears is that it has a focus on riding lawn mowers and doesn't suffer from the big Sears dept thing going on right now. (I'm not really sure what Sears is going through, but it has nothing to do with the store I'm at.) 

Anyways, we only have one item in stock that is technically ""for kids"". It's this weird golf cart/dune buggy will a cage that lets it roll over. However, the company responsible is not very good at sending the cart. It never has the right pieces and we even get sent cart without steering wheels of all things. 

Onto the story. 

Almost every day, this middle-schooler  around the age of 15 kept coming in asking if he could buy the cart. Keep in mind, this is still a gasoline-powered vehicle. Every time he asked, I had to tell him that he needed a parent to buy it. He always had the same response.

""Come on, be cool dude! Don't be mad that I get straight A's and you're stuck in here for the rest of your life!"" Let me just say I wore the same college jacket, drank out of the same college cup, and even had a giant backpack with a gigantic college logo on it everyday. I always tried a different response. It became a game after a while.

""Straight A's? Who's the president right now?""

""Obama!""

""What's his first name?""

""That is his first name, dumb\*\*\*!""

It was 2017.

It went on like this for a while, I even managed to get his name because he kept wearing the school lanyard into Sears. Wrong move, kid.

A guy came in one day to buy oil mix for his lawn mower, and his name appeared on the register. I just had to ask.

""Is your son's name (Insert kid here)?""

""Yessir. Why?""

""Can you stay for a bit and hide behind that refrigerator? I think you need to hear this."" He seemed to understand and pretended to be browsing. 3:12 pm. Here we go.

""Hey dude, can you sell me that go-cart?""

""Kid, I've told you for the last two months. You are 15 and have confessed to not even having enough money. The cart is incomplete and has had a sign on it for the entire time you've been showing up. If you want it, you have to put it up with your parents.""

He went on as normal. ""Shut up you dumb\*\*\*! Your redneck cracker a\*\* can go suck a d\*\*\*! I have straight A's AND a full-ride scholarship to Harvard! You're just a-"" His father just came up behind him and escorted him out the store. That kid went as pale as a sheet of paper. That's impressive, since he was Asian. His father came back because he forgot his bag.

""So does he really have straight A's?""

""No, but I think I'm gonna make him live up to his word if he's gonna brag about it.""",pettyrevenge,1442

beculet,2019-02-19 05:24:51+00:00,Fantastic Beasts 3 gets pushed to 2021,"In January, word leaked that the start of production on Fantastic Beasts 3 was pushed to late fall 2019 after originally being scheduled for summer. Presumably, this delay had to do with making sure that they get this movie just right. The franchise might not be able to survive another large wave of critical attacks.

The production delay wasn’t good news for Fantastic Beast 3’s release date, and last Friday our fears came true: WB announced that their Dune movie would be released on November 20, 2020.

WB will not be releasing two major films on the same day, and since there’s been a delay in the start of filming on Fantastic Beasts 3, it’s very likely that the release date will now be some time in 2021.

Hippo_Singularity,2018-08-12 02:03:46+00:00,"You want me to drive a 34-ton mixer over a sand dune? Sign here, please.","Concrete mixers are unwieldy, top-heavy and spend a lot of time driving off-road with a shifting load.  Consequently, we tend try to pay a lot of attention to what we are driving on and where the customer wants us to go.  What the customer wants and what we are physically able to do don't always meet.  
  
The jobsite I am working is down near the Salton Sea.  For those unfamiliar with Southern California history and geography, the Salton Sea is what happens when a man from Flint, Michigan hires a Canadian shipwright to dig a 60-mile irrigation canal, then digs a couple illegal bypass channels right before one of the worse flood in the recorded history of the Colorado River.  It has no outlet, and it currently a fetid lake of salt, stink and tilapia.  
  
The customer, who we will call Pauly, is building three greenhouses on sandy ground.  The job mainly consists of chute pouring post holes for the steel supports.  It's slow work that isn't helped by being next to the Bog of Eternal Stench, in one of the hottest and most humid parts of the state.  The lot is clearly blow sand, the really fine stuff that gets carried by the wind.  It's been graded smooth, but not compacted at all; basically, the lot is a sand dune with pretensions of civilization, and even the balloon tires on the tractors are digging in.  I'm not taking my pig of a truck anywhere near that sand...at least not unless I wind up in a really foul mood.  
  
Luckily, the subcontractor is not stupid.  He looks at the situation and decides to have me pour into the [skip loader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loader_\(equipment\)#/media/File:Liugong_ZL50A_in_Guilin_East_Railway_Station_20100713_02.jpg) from the road.  He knows we can't move my truck across that sand, so he's been having the loader ferry the concrete from my truck to the holes.  It means that his crew has to shovel the concrete out by hand, and after the first couple loads, they are going to look like the chain gang from *Cool Hand Luke* (without the benefit of Joy Harmon), but since the owner didn't want to spring for a pump, it is the best option available. 
  
Pauly doesn't show up until a couple days into the job.  When I pull up with my load, he tells me that what we've been doing is taking too long.  He's got a different plan, a better plan.  He wants me to back out over the dirt to pour the holes directly, because clearly that thought never occurred to us.  When I try to explain that the ground is too soft, he point at the tire tracks through the sand and say, ""The last truck made it just fine.""  This is a lie.  Not only that, it is an obvious lie.
  
""The last truck made it,"" is one of the more common lies people tell drivers, right up there with, ""we can refill your tank with the water truck.""  They are practically memes, similar to the jokes about inspectors being the enemy, just without the humor or benign intent...it's the difference between Al Bundy and Ted Bundy.  
  
I know I am being lied to, and what's worse, I'm being lied to incompetently.  For starters, the tire tracks Pauly's pointing at were clearly made by the loader, not a truck.  Also, I was the last truck.  The way the job has been going, they've had one truck come out, pour the load, then go back for the next one while the crew sets and aligns the posts in the holes.  Pauly doesn't know this because he got there while I was off getting the next load.  In fact, since this is his first time out here since we started, he has no clue that I am the only driver that has been on this job since it started.  This is one of those areas that doesn't bother with foppish fripperies, like street signs or addresses.  On top of that, this job is on a [flag lot](http://sanjoserealestatelosgatoshomes.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/flaglotjpg.jpg), so it has a very narrow street facing.  I was on the job the first day, and since, after that, I knew where it was (and he knew I wouldn't say no), my manager, Bob, asked me to do it on subsequent days, so he wouldn't have to deal with lost drivers.  So Pauly is a bad liar and  I am now in a really foul mood.  
  
With my most obsequious smile, I say, ""Oh, well in that case, of course.  I just need you to sign the ticket before I can pull onto the property.""  On my way back to the cab, I call Bob to see what else we have going that day.  There isn't much other work, so Bob asks what's going on.  I explain the situation, and Bob just asks one question, ""Did he sign the ticket?""  When I say yes, he tells me to be careful and call him if we need a wrecker.  
  
If you ever order concrete, yourself, and the driver refuses to pour without you signing the ticket first, think long and hard about what you just asked him to do.  The ticket includes a damage waiver and acknowledges receipt of the concrete.  Some drivers may have you sign it as a matter of course (though I've never met one, and most of the guys I know don't even get signatures after the job).  For the most part, however, it should be viewed as a giant red flag that the driver think there is some kind of liability in play.  It could be something as simple as backing up a curb (which could crack) or front yard (with ever so crushable irrigation pipes and septic tanks).  It could also mean that you've really torqued off the driver, and he's about to nail you on standby time (you have a limited amount of time to unload before the accounting trolls start charging you a buck or two every minute).  Your best bet is to ask them if there is something to be concerned about.  Technically you could refuse to sign, but by that point its a Hobson's choice, and if there is nothing wrong with the load, you are paying for it either way.  
  
If we were busy, I would have slowly backed up until my truck started to bog down, then pulled forward and refused to go any further.  We aren't busy; when I bog down, I just pull forward and try again.  Each time I get a little further back, but it is very slow going.  Pauly is getting upset.  After half a dozen attempts, Pauly starts waving me back furiously and shouts, ""Step on it.  Just get on top of it!""  Apparently Pauly thinks I'm on a boat.  But, in the world of Malicious Compliance, the customer is always right.  I pull forward as far as I can, floor it in reverse, and right before I hit the sand, I flip the selector up and stick it into high range.  
  
A manual truck transmission is laid out in a standard H pattern, but each position covers two or three gears.  There are selector switches to choose which sets of gears you are using.  For instance, on an 8 speed, low range is 1-4, high range is 5-8.  While high-range reverse is a usable gear, you will almost never see a driver using it.  Even the manufacturers recommend against attempting it (it's a fiddly gear that is easy to break if you hit it with too much power), and you rarely need to go anywhere near that fast in reverse.  
  
My truck leaps onto that sand like a corpulent gazelle, huffing and wheezing across the veldt.  It doesn't last long.  I've barely made it a truck length before I have to go back down to low range.  Not long after that, my wheels start slinging dirt, the tires sink in, and the truck starts bouncing from the effort.  That's the signal to stop and check my work.  Pauly is, of course, not happy with this.  My truck is nowhere near close enough.  He looks at me, and to my complete and utter lack of surprise asks, ""What happened?""  I tell him that I appear to be stuck.  He asks if I can pull forward and try again.  I look at my tires.  The truck is buried to the axles, and it weighs as much as 13 pickup trucks (or 40 Smart Cars); nothing short of divine intervention is moving that truck while it is still full.  
  
So I smile and say, I'll give it a shot.  On the side of my stick is a little knob for something called deep reduction.  You set that knob and put it into low, and that engine turns into the God of Torque (for you gear heads out there, the ratio is somewhere around 27:1).  It's practically impossible to stall the engine in that gear without running into an immovable object.  Even then, you are just as likely to snap your axle or tear out the drive train, while the engine hums merrily along.  And, of course, if you are on soft, loose sand, it will just kick a gloriously wicked rooster tail all over anything (or anyone) behind you.  Pauly is still spitting dirt when I get out to give him the bad news.  Looks like we are going to have to keep using the loader, like we were.  Then once we've finished with that, he can use the it to help pull my truck out of the dirt (in the end, we had the loader pulling on my tow hook, and an excavator pushing on the Mansfield bar).  Not only did it waste half an hour of the precious time he was trying to save, but he had to pay around $50 worth of standby (of course it could have been worse; if I'd been truly stuck, he would have been on the hook for the wrecker).  
  
TL/DR:  Impatient customer lies about previous trucks making across impassible terrain.  I try crossing it, getting my truck magnificently stuck, delaying his job even further, showering him with sand and charging him for the privilege.",MaliciousCompliance,3467

My grandfather has been dealing with health issues these past few years, and this past year I decided to quit my job, move several hours away and live with him full time to help take care of him.  This man is the entire reason I ever got into gaming and hands down more of a father than my own ever was. My earliest memories of gaming are literally him playing Legend of Zelda on NES or Dune on Sega. He bought me my first NES and SNES growing up and kept it at his house because my dad hated gaming for religious reasons, which to this day I cannot figure out what said religious reasons were.

 He's been confined to limited mobility recently due to multiple surgeries and complications, and for a while there I thought I was going to lose him.  So after this past bout of surgeries, to try and cheer him up I move my PC into the living room every couple of days (Where he stays because of medical equipment, and so I can get to him quickly at night) and got him gaming again.

Watching his face light up when I showed him all of his favorite Old School games emulated on my PC literally caused me to tear up. He didn't look like the frail sick man he had been.  I showed him WoW, and he loved it.  His favorite two games I showed him though (New Wise) were Overwatch, CS:GO and Minecraft.  

All he keeps saying is he wants to play the games with me, so he can in his own words ""Whoop my butt"".

So here is where we get to the building aspect.  My gaming PC was built for me by a friend 2 or 3 years ago. I've tried to figure out how to properly piece and part, but I just can't grasp it.  

I'm currently unemployed, caring for him fulltime (wound dressing, medications, appointments) and making money by doing oddjobs here and there as I can, but with bills, medical costs, and gas money to drive him 2 hours to the city where his doctor is, money is tight.   

I'm in a budget range of no more than like $350, with peripherals (I have a spare mouse though, and we may be able to use the living room TV as a monitor to cut back on costs). I'm trying to make sure it can play WoW Classic, run NES/SNES/GENESIS emulators easily and also potentially run CS:GO. I know there is probably no way I can get a PC to run Overwatch at that price point.

I'm not asking anyone to throw me down a full parts list, maybe just some suggestions and point me in the right direction.  It will probably take me a couple of months to save up the money, so if you have slightly out of range suggestions I'll do my best to take them into consideration.

Thank you, any and all who have suggestions or nuggets of knowledge.  You have no idea how much any help means to me.",buildapc,1005

So first things first, you're probably wondering what a ""Sidewinder"" is. Officially, we're members of a rather elite group of Search and Rescue officers who specialize in Desert Searches.  Note that I said searches, and not rescue.  Each and every one of us, collectively called Sidewinders from our ability to survive in the most hostile desert conditions, are trained in everything from tracking and first aid, to survival and recovery.  Typically, they only call us in on the worst cases.  Someone goes missing in one of the many desert areas in the west; and after the massive search fails...we go in to recover the body, or bodies.  Truth be known, we don't usually find bodies, just bones or a few identifying items.  We're also rather unique among S&amp;R, since we tend to work alone. There's always a lot of desert to cover, and it's just more cost effective to send in one, maybe two Sidewinders in to track missing persons.

In my time, I've recovered something around fifty people, and only rescued one.  The desert is a rather harsh place, but that kinda goes without saying.  In training, they teach us that after three days in the desert, the chances of a person surviving drops exponentially. After five days, there's no hope and it becomes a recovery. Granted, that's when you're not talking about a missing sidewinder. I remember during training, our training officer related a story about one Sidewinder who had gone missing during a recovery.  Almost a month later, that guy wandered into a parks service office.  He was skin and bones, but alive. The service had long given up on him, and his family had largely moved on; yet here this guy was, a walking bag of bones, coming out of a hell that you can't imagine.  All told, the guy had walked almost three hundred miles from where he started out, to where he ended.  Dude's still with the service too, in case you wondered.


I won't go into detail about the training, but suffice it to say that it's the hardest training you'll ever experience.  Two hundred S&amp;R guys sign up for the training every year, and typically only two or three actually survive the process.  Most simply decide that they can't do it, though there are other reasons they drop out.  The doors always seem to claim one, every training rotation.


Doors.  If you had told me three years ago that a simple door would be the object of terror, I would have laughed in your face.  They're probably the strangest thing you'll in the high desert.  Middle of no where, no roads or trails for miles, and there will be this door standing there upright. It's never the same kind of door either, I've seen house doors, a couple metal ones, and at least one cheap trailer door.  

These doors, they're creepy to say the least, but it's the fact that they move that really gets to you.  I remember one recovery in particular that I was followed by one of these doors.  

That one started with a simple hiking incident.  A couple had decided to hike out into the desert, camp over night, and then hike back. When they didn't show at their works the next Monday, family called the parks service.  The S&amp;R guys searched a good fifty mile square area of desert for them, but didn't turn anything up.  So, rather reluctantly they called me in. Calling in the sidewinders was seen as admitting defeat.  Even the police give us a wide berth. 

I packed up, took enough food for a two week trip (MREs are handy in that regard) and enough water to pack in and out.  Wit that, I hiked into the desert to follow their steps and try to retrace where they may have gone, and hopefully find this pair.  

Their trail was pretty easy to follow for the first few hours, before it turned off the established path and cut out across the sand pan. Their tracks showed that they were walking side by side then, and continued on for upwards of five miles like that before I found something that sent chills up my spine.

The tracks suddenly turned to the left and seemed to circle around a point up on one of the dunes. There was no reason for them to do that though, at least nothing visible. From then on, the path continued back down and headed almost directly away from that spot.  The tracks continued on, before coming to a stop in the lee of a dune. They had simply evaporated. However I knew that they couldn't have gone too far, if they made the same time I  had, then they likely would have reached that point about the same time I did.  Thinking like the hikers, I decided that I'd be looking for shelter.  A short distance away, as I picked my way through scrub and around some rocks, I came to a good camping site.  Located in the shade of a large rock wall, with a nice overhang, I spread out my bed roll and then set to getting something to eat.  I think it was then that I first noticed the door.  Now, you need to keep in mind, by that point I'd stumbled over several of those before.  This one seemed different though.  It was located a short distance away, just down from where I sat. I knew well enough to steer clear of them, as they were bad news, but I have to admit I was curious.  I suppose that's what prompted me to become a sidewinder in the first place, looking at things in retrospect. Curiosity.  Going where no living man or woman has gone, and exploring what lay out there.

The door was this large house front door, painted a bright red.  So bright that it seemed to shine in the waning light.  It stood there like the house it once occupied had long since fallen down, and this chunk of wood had somehow managed to stay standing. Lifting my glass of water to it, I gave a light nod, as if saying to it ""Yes, I know you're there."" I then ate, and went to sleep. I rose with the dawn, packed up and kicked out my fire before heading on further. The door was gone. No surprise there, they tended to do that. I picked up the trail shortly after, and found the remnants of a camp.  From the looks of things, the couple had camped there for a day before leaving...suddenly.  Everything was torn, there were signs of a struggle, or more likely a fight.  Two sets of tracks headed off into the desert from there, each going a different direction.  I surmised that they must have had an argument over something, and had wandered off to cool their heads.  Problem was, I couldn't see any indication that they had returned. So that meant that they'd split up, which is bad to do in the first place, and then something had happened.  Most common killing cause out here is someone slipping into a crack in the ground, and just never getting out.  Kinda like the guy down in Moab, but with no survival.

I decided that I'd check the left most path first, as that one seemed to head down into the sand.  The other went up over some rocks and headed down into a valley area, but tracking that would be a royal pain in the ass; and honestly I was here to tag and recover bodies. Whatever makes that job easier, is what wins.

I followed that sandy trail a good three hundred feet before it simply stopped.  Not petered out, as often happens, not turned back on itself, no, it just stopped.  Mid step no less.  Turning around and checking my maps, I made note of this for an aerial search before turning around to walk back.  Behind me, not three feet from the trail, and maybe twenty from where I stood, was that same red door. I stopped in my tracks there, pausing for a long time. Chills ran up my spine, and I broke out in a cold sweat. I probably stood there a good ten minutes before I mustered up the courage to walk back the way I had came. I didn't even shoot a glance at the door then, opting to ignore it from that point forward. Leaving it in my wake, I continued on to follow the second track. That one continued deeper in the desert, and seemed to be heading in a particular direction.  As if the person leaving it had known where they were going.  Sadly nothing lay in that direction, at least not for a good hundred miles of hard scrub. Well, let me rephrase that.  Nothing worth finding. There was that damn door.  I'd see it every now and then, usually off the trail a short distance, sometimes even hidden up at the top of a bluff thatt there was no way for it to be put up there in the first place.  Always following me, always beckoning me closer. 

In the end, after a good week out on the search, I called it quits.  I hiked back out, providing the S&amp;R guys with the evidence I had found, and suggesting that they just write it off. The desert had claimed two more, or maybe the doors had. It would be a good year and a half further on before there would be some closure to that story. While on a fire patrol outside Vegas, a Park Ranger saw smoke rising off in the distance. Driving that way, he eventually came to the source of the smoke.  It was the remnants of a small brush fire that was quickly burning itself out. He was, reportedly, about ready to chalk it up to lightning, when he tripped over the bodies. The strange thing, he would later tell the authorities, is that the two looked like they'd just appeared from no where. Trails leading to where they lay were quickly found, but those trails just appeared out of thin air. An autopsy was performed, and it was discovered that they had died from exposure. They were identified by family as being the pair who I had been sent in after; though mysteries remained.  

For example, how had they, with no food or water, crossed a full five hundred miles of open desert?  Why were their clothes untouched by the weather, and strangest of all, how had they managed to keep their cellular phones at a full charge...with nothing to charge them with?

I have many other stories to tell, such as a town you won't find on any map, or the many ghosts that wander the sands, or the sheer number of planes that simply vanish in this area.  When I have some time, I'll post those.",nosleep,1664
TheLostUtterance,2018-06-14 00:27:11+00:00,Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind: A literary fiction manga/comic that will change your mind about the medium,"Nausicaa is an examination of the nature of Nature, the place and value of man within the larger context of existence, the ethics of violence on both man and nature, and the horror of war. 1 part Dune, 1 part Lord of the Rings, 1/2 part Dostoevsky, 1/2 part Steinbeck, and 2 parts Earthsea with a particular note of A Wizard of Earthsea (and just general Le Guinn), this series is composed of philosophy, traditional themes explored in non-traditional ways, world-building, feminist elements that go beyond shallow ""girl body but like a man"" in early 80's Japan, and an epic quest. However, this is not a series for everyone. It seems to be love it or hate it, but for those who find something meaningful, it becomes something they will never forget. The mangaka (author and artist) also undergoes a noticeable change in worldview and outlook that significantly impacts the story and characters creating a real sense of genuine and significant growth. You could read the whole thing in six hours but you won't want too. You will likely find yourself contemplating things the series merely suggest or briefly touches on. 
This 1000 page epic took 12 years to create and stands as one of the pinnacles of the medium. It is worth the $40 bucks to buy the large hardbacks if you have the disposable funds to experience this series in a high-quality format.

Many consider the first half to be a little slow in the same way many people consider Lord of the Rings to be a little slow. I didn't find either slow so I guess I am not able to comment on this, but I would like to say that I had a very unique and meaningful experience with this series. When I think about what I consider to be the best of the best or a ""masterpiece"" in it's medium I fall back on one thing. A certain indescribable something more that presents itself more as an emotional sense of deeper satisfaction or a state of mind that leads to serious introspection and intellectual musing. As pretentious as this sounds, I believe that most of you will understand what I mean. When you experience something truly great you understand it by the impact it has on you and your mental life. By its ability to transcribe its ""feeling"", or ""atmosphere"", and its themes into your mind in such a way that you can't help but ponder and remember them at the oddest of times. This manga is one of those things for me and many others. 

If you are skeptical about the merit of comics, read it. If you read comics but are skeptical about the merits of manga, read it. If you are a fan of literary fiction, read it. If you are a fan of fantasy fiction, read it. If you are a fan of sci-fi fiction, read it. If you want to read ecological fiction, read it. If you are a fan of Miyazaki's movies, read it because this is by far his magnum opus. In short, I think many people will find something to appreciate in this manga that will deeper than they expected.  

If nothing else, you will get a very Japanese influenced perspective on war (very visible post-atomic bomb thoughts) and the idea of empire (yes, that bit is ironic) that is very rare in modern western stories. It also has a very interesting analysis of pacifism that goes beyond the usual naivety found in stories with the theme. All in all, you should do yourself a favor and buy the box set. If you absolutely hate it you can donate it to your local library and assure yourself that you are at least doing God's work, and then ask for a donation receipt and claim it on your taxes as a charitable deduction.",books,1891
TOV-LOV,2018-06-10 04:30:56+00:00,[Spoilers]Haven't read a book in years. Just finished Dune and it was a journey.,"I'm not much of a reader. I used to read often in elementary school but my interest in reading waned through highschool and into adulthood. The last book I actually finished prior to this one was Foundation and Empire back in 2013. I've started a few books since, but none of them has kept my interest long enough for me to actually finish them. My attention span is really limited for these kinds of things now since I find it hard to sit down and read when normally I'd rather be watching a movie/show or playing a game. Reading always seemed like a sort of ""active"" sitting activity, in that it required me to pay closer attention to what I was doing whereas movies/shows/games felt a lot more ""passive"" for me. I'm also a fairly slow reader since I tend to read at a pace that I'd expect a narrator to narrate what I'm reading, as I find it more enjoyable to read and easier to retain information like that than just blowing through it all.

But I started Dune a few months ago and man that was a hell of a journey. It was so damn engrossing and kept my attention all the way through. The pacing in the first arc was just slow enough for me to feel the passage of time and the events unfold naturally but not too slow to feel like a drag. It had this slow burn through the first arc, introducing all the characters and the setting and letting you live through the day to day motions of these characters as they made plans within plans within plans to try to protect themselves from the antagonists, which evolved into this incredible tale of the main character's journey through this desolate desert planet and his rise to become a legendary, religious figure. The only issue I have is that it felt like it went a bit too quickly through the events in the second half of the book, I'd rather have had the pace of the first book be maintained throughout, but it's not really a big deal and the book was still fantastic in my eyes. I haven't felt this enamored by a book since elementary school. I think this book might have reinvigorated my desire to read that I lost in elementary school. I can't wait to read the next entry in the series, although I am really tempted to just reread Dune again before I move on.",books,1283

17th_Username_Tried,2018-04-30 13:12:30+00:00,Just spent four months in jail. I read over thirty books and I feel like I’ve been born again.,"I recently ended up doing a short stint in jail. It was a stupid crime so it was a level one facility with a good library. I feel like I’ve read more books than I did in my entire life put together. I was reading about a book a day or two. Aside from the long ones I remember, like Dune, Napoleon A life, Styxx and the Complete Collection of Sherlock Holmes. I read everything from a couple of romance novels, Million Dollar Spy, Mike Tyson’s autobiography, Ann Kendrick’s biography, Douglas Mc Arthur’s biography, a book called The Cryptonomicon that was really cool, Stephen Kings Four Seasons and one other book about the world ending, to the Millenium Trilogy and a spy trilogy call The Tourist. I also read a text book on physics called Conceptual Physics Tenth edition and two math books called All the math you need and Painless Algebra. I read a loooot of classics as well like Lord of Flies, Animal Farm and 1984 which I’ve heard so much about. Without a doubt Catch 22 was my favorite and most memorable. I’ve never read such hilarious stuff.

Overall, I lost count of how many books I read. But it was amazing. I was one of those who always talked about sitting down and reading, but then just wasted life away on my phone. I’m kind of leery saying that I enjoyed my time in jail, but just being on bed all day reading books day in and day out with no distractions, I felt like Edmond Dante’s when he was at the Chateu or Napoleon when he was going hungry at artillary school so he could buy more books. I don’t know where I’m going with life now, I’m at a friends house trying to find a job, but without a doubt I know I’ve changed a lot.

  I guess I just wanted to tell someone about it, but I definitely understand people’s passion for books now in a whole new way. It’s gonna be hard to keep reading now that I’m out, but I have a list of a lot of books I saw at the library that I didn’t get to read and I’m dying to get some money to buy them. There’s so much I want to know now. Anyway, I hope you guys are having a good day and have some good books!",books,31971

rootzmac,2018-03-24 18:45:37+00:00,I asked Reddit for a list of essential classics to read. . . This is how long it would take to read them all. . .,"Bellow is the full list, in no particular order, along with the approximate time, in hours, that it would take to read each of them, based mostly on the lengths of the audiobooks. Where only the author/poet is listed, then the time refers to the minimum amount of time I'd spend reading their writings.

Keep in mind, this is not some sort of *law*, just an approximation, a place to start. I also tried not to include many books by the same authors. The idea is I can continue reading their stuff if I liked what I'd read so far. . . When I get some extra time, I'll try to put the entire list in order of when the books were published, oldest to most recent.

The total approximate number of hours it would take to read these writings is about 900. If I read one hour every day, it would take 2.5 years to go through this entire list. Not bad at all! I was expecting that educating myself in the classics of literate and poetry would take me much, much longer.

Please note that this list reflects what only a few of us Reddit Readers could think of including. **So feel free to add what you think is missing from this list and why it should be included!**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**UPDATE:**

Here I've added some of your recommendations. I feel like the list is a *lot* better now! But it brings the total number of hours up to about 1300, with the approximate time to read through the list, with about an hour a day of reading, to 3.5 years. . . But of course an hour a day is very little, so this would be assuming I remain super busy, as I'm sure most of us are.

Things seemed to calm down in the desert for a few months. We’ll skip over a few uneventful field ops and go forward to March. It was still miserably cold and the wind still chilled us to the bone, but the sun stayed in the sky just a bit longer with each passing day. I'd just spent the rest of my Sunday packing and getting ready for an excruciating week long field op. I’d become quite knowledgeable of all the ranges by now, each of them having their own story. Usually, they brief us on what we will be doing, but this field op was extremely tactical and our objectives depended on many different things so I didn’t really have a clue on what we were doing.

The first day, we drove out to some random compound with four walls. We dropped our packs and we waited there to get picked up by tracked vehicles (AAVs) all day and mostly slept. When the night hit, a terrible sandstorm engulfed us. You couldn’t open your eyes for more than a few seconds. If you did, you could only see for a few feet in front of you. It was equally amazing as it was terrifying. Around midnight, the tracked vehicles showed up and we piled inside gratefully. Here’s a picture of [them](https://i.imgur.com/QjBsigV.jpg). We expected that we would go somewhere, but we ended up just sitting there for a few hours before we abruptly started driving in an unknown direction for about two hours. Then we stopped.

We waited for what felt like an eternity. We weren’t allowed out because the justification was that we could be notionally shot and put out of their little wargame. Awesome. Finally, after about 10 hours we were allowed out to relieve ourselves and grab food out of our packs. We had only got a few minutes and it was dark outside, so that means I'd just spent an entire day inside a vehicle, but at least the sandstorm died down.

A few hours pass by, I can’t sleep sitting down on a tiny bench with 16 Marines crammed into a vehicle meant for 12. Everyone else is asleep except for one of the crewmen on radio watch. Suddenly, I hear a knock on the back hatch. It was clear as day. I nudge a few guys close by to get them to open the hatch, but most of them tell me to fuck off and go back to sleep. I play the clueless card and put my head down, hoping that whoever knocked would go away. The knocking continues for about 30 more seconds and then stops. Who the hell would be knocking anyway? We have radios for a reason.

I spend the next few hours falling in and out of sleep before someone wakes us up and tells us we have 5 minutes to stretch and piss. I have no idea what time it is or where I am. We all pour out of our tin can prison and spread out. There are other vehicles around us but none of the other Marines are out. I head over a dune to take a leak and take a few seconds to admire the stars. A sight for sore eyes. Somewhere in front of me, I see a dark figure off in the distance. There were no AAVs over there and we were arguably in the middle of nowhere.

As they get closer, I see that it’s a Marine but I can’t make out who it is exactly. They aren’t wearing a flak jacket or a kevlar, just some ragged desert cammies and a boonie. That’s not allowed during this field op... He gets closer and I recognize a familiar dead gaze that doesn’t reflect any light. He looks very different this time, a different body I guess.

Don’t talk to him. Don’t even look at him. I already broke one of those rules, so I started sprinting for the AAV. I tell everyone to get the fuck inside with enough fear in my voice to get them going. I grab my radio and get in contact with that same lieutenant, surely he would understand. He was the platoon commander for the platoon I was attached to, so I called him up on the radio.

“PBR Streetgang, this is Vehicle 6, there’s a Sgt Wright in our perimeter.”

“Roger, Solid Copy Vehicle 6. PBR Streetgang out.

I overhear a bunch of radio chatter coming from the crew compartment. 20 seconds later, the vehicles start up and we’re driving away into the desert for safer lands. Suddenly, we come to a grinding halt. People and gear go flying about.

I can feel the vehicle turn around and drive the way we came. WTF.

One of the crewman ducks down from his turret and informs us that one of the vehicles flipped where we just at. And it was on fire. We were going back to help. Luckily, the Marines had gotten out just as it flipped. We were already packed to the brim, but we managed to make room for 4 more Marines. All of them were pretty banged up.

We drove off and I’m assuming someone was called to deal with the burning AAV. There wasn’t much we could do with the single fire extinguisher we had in the passenger compartment.

Someone asked one of the guys what the hell happened to the AAV, and his response was that they heard a knocking on the hatch. They were told not to open it and a few second later, the engine turned on and the whole thing flipped without even moving. Suddenly, a fire broke out and they all managed to scramble out before things got worse.This is not the first time this has happened. If you Google, 29 Palms AAV accident, you’ll see a ton of articles. It’s an extremely common thing and most of them don’t make the news unless someone gets hurt.

We spent the next few hours driving somewhere unknown. I had no clue where we were but I could tell the terrain had a lot more hills and ditches by the number of times I’d banged my head. We’d gotten word that we were preparing for some big attack on a small town. So we spent the next 18 hours locked up in the tin can, occasionally moving short distances. The bad thing was that there was a fuel leak somewhere inside. All I could smell and taste was fuel. It was pretty terrible. We slept a lot, which made sense because we were being poisoned.

Eventually, we’d stopped just outside a town we were tasked with clearing. The ramp dropped and we stumbled out. The sun was bright and I felt blind. A few guys tripped because they were so lightheaded from the fumes, but I managed to keep my balance and started to run for cover behind a tank. A few other assaultmen followed me and it was a terrible decision. Standing behind a tank is like standing behind a jet engine because of the heat coming from the exhaust. They quite literally burn jet fuel (JP8). I was only in the huge cone of heat for maybe a second before I ran around the tank and sprinted towards the town. Tripping over rocks and coughing up fuel from my lungs, we made it to the town.

Pretty soon we discovered it was completely empty. It turns out that our enemy had been completely taken out by artillery and aerial assets (notionally of course). We spent most of the day airing out our lungs and appreciating the sunlight before we got back into the AmTracs and drove to a seemingly empty spot in the desert. As soon as we stepped out, we noticed that things started to randomly catch on fire.

No, this wasn’t hell or anything crazy - we stumbled upon an area where white phosphorus shells had been dropped. Being Marines, we were amused by the glorious fire rocks and began to kick them at people before we got yelled at. We were told the trucks would come before the sun went down, but we didn’t make it back to base until around midnight.

[Cool picture of the fire rocks in action.](https://i.imgur.com/UYtTGaX.jpg)

[Bonus Story]

We spent all of Friday cleaning our weapons, and we didn't get off until 6pm. A friend and I decided that we were going to go to Las Vegas and celebrate modern civilization. To get there, we took the notorious Amboy Road. I’ve driven it many times before. To those who don’t know about Amboy, it’s a two-lane highway that cuts across the middle of the desert. You get the feeling that you are quite literally in the middle of nowhere. There’s no cell phone signal for most of the drive. If you crashed, it would likely be an hour or two before an ambulance could get to you.

There are plenty of stories about Satanic cult members laying down in the road or staging accidents to stop drivers. They ambush the unsuspecting good samaritans and they’re never seen again. The golden rule of this road is pretty much that you should never stop. If you see someone on the road, just keep driving. Now that I think about, there’s probably a good reason that I never see any truckers or cops on this road.

Anyway, the ride to Vegas from base takes about 3 hours. We hit the road pretty late and it was particularly windy. Visibility was shit due to the sand blowing all about. I had the great idea of drinking Tequila in the passenger seat to make time go by faster. We were about halfway there when my bladder decided that it didn’t care about satanic cults and that we absolutely had to stop. We pulled off onto the soft sand and I opened the door to get out.

It was a pretty cloudy night so there absolutely zero ambient light. I could see a few feet in front of me because of the car’s headlights, but even those were dimmed by the blowing sand. With my eyes half open, I saw something dark dash in the corner of my eye followed by a yelp and a torrent of curses from my friend. I quickly stumbled back towards the car and saw my friend on the ground face first with something biting his leg violently. All I could see was an extremely dark, lumpy shape. It was like someone had sewed a bunch of different parts of mangy animals together. I froze in fear, unable to make a decision. Before I could move, the thing looked at me with eyes that glowed faintly red and took off down the road. All of this happened in maybe 15 seconds.

I got my friend in the backseat and inspected him wound. The only way I could describe the bite mark is that it was the size of a human’s bite, but with pointed teeth that were spaced apart. It was bleeding pretty badly so I did what any Marine is taught. I took off my belt and placed it a few inches above the wound and made a makeshift tourniquet. Then I wrapped it in my t-shirt, elevated it, and hoped for the best. He obviously couldn’t drive and I figured I was sober enough to drive the straightest highway in the world. I’m usually extremely against drunk driving, but I wasn’t staying around to play with whatever was out there.

I helped him hop his way over to the passenger seat and ran back to driver’s seat. Maybe it was the adrenaline or the tequila, but I was scared as hell. I could barely hold onto the steering wheel because my hands were shaking so badly. I tried to throw in some shitty jokes to lighten the mood but they were more for myself than him.

At first, I cruised along at a mere 70mph (112 km/h) to play it safe. But pretty soon, my friend started to quite literally scream in pain. The way he described it was “a million daggers flowing through my fucking bloodstream”. I sped up after that and watched the ETA drop slowly on the GPS. My friend was in complete agony the entire time but I honestly couldn’t do a thing for him. I told him to bite the seat belt but I knew he was beyond that kind of pain. For about 5 minutes, he began muttering and slurring his words. It then progressed so something completely incomprehensible. Then he was quiet but still had his eyes open. I sped up to about 90mph (144km/h) because I was so worried was going to die.

I was trying to get signal on my cell phone when I noticed a bunch of blue and red lights scatter about the inside of the car. Shit. I’m drunk, my license is expired, and I’m speeding. Keep in mind, I have never seen a cop the entire time I’ve been on this road. I begin to slow down gradually and look for a good place to pull over. As I’m looking in the mirror, I notice that my friend’s radar detector is not going off. Weird.

I’m picturing a billion situations in my head and all of them end badly. First, I’ll get destroyed on the civilian side wide a DUI and a tons of fines. Then, I’ll get absolutely destroyed by my command. Loss of pay, restriction to my room, and a demotion. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

I keep looking for a good spot to pull over. I round a slight bend in the road and take my eyes off the rearview mirror. The road straightens out and I immediately look back at the rearview mirror. Nothing yet. I keep driving and glance a few more times. Nothing at all. What the hell? My eyes are locked on the mirror and I’m waiting for these lights to come around the bend. Absolutely nothing.

Suddenly, my gaze is averted by a flashing orange light in front of me. I slow down even more and there’s a sign in the middle of the road saying “Road Closed - Detour” with an arrow pointing to the left. Granted, this is a straight road and I’m not going off on some dirt road detour in a Honda Civic, even if it means I can evade the cops. I stop right in front of the sign and grab the GPS off the dash. As I’m looking at the different routes, the cop car suddenly comes up LITERALLY out of nowhere and it’s behind me now, flashing its lights. Straight up materialized. I look in the mirror and I don’t see anyone in the front seats. I don’t see any cops walking towards me but I am beyond creeped the fuck out at this point because a mysterious cop car just comes appeared out of nowhere. My friend is still unconscious and was bit by something crazy.

Suddenly, all of its lights turn off. I step on the gas and run over the stupid sign in my way. The cop car doesn’t follow me. I spend about 5 minutes going dangerously fast before I start to slow down. Visibility is still shit but after driving this road enough, you know where all of the bends and curves are thankfully.

Up ahead, my headlights reflect off of something and my I start to slow down thinking there is another sign to tell me the road is closed. Nope. Off on the side of the road were a bunch of cars, extremely similar in shape to the cop car that was behind me, except it was just a burnt out shell. One car was flipped completely and another was on its side, both burnt to a blackened metal as well. I wondered if that would have my car if I stopped for this mysterious car that appears out of nowhere.

I never saw another road closed sign and eventually got on a bigger, more frequented highway just outside Primm. At this point, I got service and called 911 who told us that the closest hospital was in Vegas.

When we arrived, I went in first and told the situation to the receptionist. They came out with a wheelchair and whisked him away while I sat in the waiting room while I filled out some dumb form. All I know was that they couldn’t stitch his leg up due to the nature of the bite, but cleaned and bandaged the wound. He did eventually wake up a few hours later with some sweet drugs. It was almost 5 is by the time we finally checked into our hotel. He spent the weekend in the hotel while I lonewolfed the city in his honor.

We were both extremely sure to drive back during the middle of the day. The only weird thing that I could say happen was that the sun was trying to kill us when it was setting. Even with sunglasses on and sun visors down, we couldn’t see a damn thing. We had to slam on the brakes after seeing a car driving extremely slow in front of us. Eventually, the sun went down and we were treated with hundreds of different colors, constantly changing in complexity and warmth.

We did not see the burnt out cars, the signs, or any more cops. However, we did see two cars that had obviously collided head-on pushed to the side. Both front ends were horribly mangled. I didn’t see anyone inside, so we kept driving.

I honestly don't believe that whatever had bit my friend was a coyote. They are usually extremely skittish and scared of humans. Their bite marks don't match what my friend had either. Nor the excruciating pain. It had to be in connection with whatever or whoever was trying to run us off that road.

So much for a relaxing weekend after the field.

A fleeing criminal, desperate to escape the police, runs into the desert with hardly any water. Very soon, he runs out of drinking water, and hours later, he is already plodding under the merciless desert sun.

He is close to desperation when suddenly, he sees something far off in the distance. Hoping against hope that it is water, he starts running towards what he thinks is an oasis, only to find a little old man with a little stand, full of ties.  

'Hey you, do you have water?' Pants the criminal.

 
The old man replied, 'I have already finished my water, but would you like to buy a tie? They are only $5.'


The criminal, frustrated shouted, 'you moron! Do I look like I need a tie? I should kill you right here, but I have to find some water first!"" 


'There's no call for threats,' said the old tie seller indignantly, 'but even though you don't want to buy one of my ties and you treat me like this, I'll help you. If you continue over that hill for about 3 miles, you'll find a restaurant with great food and all the ice cold water you can drink. Good luck!""


Muttering in disgust, the criminal staggered away over the hill. Several hours later the other man sees him crawling on the dune back towards him. When he finally arrives, he lays on his back, panting. 

""Everything ok?"" Asked the tie salesman as he bends over to hear the raspy whisper of the other man.

""They won't let me in without a tie...""

Games with title link as [**bold**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bold) are the ones that stood out the most to me.

### 1980
- [**Rogue**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game\)) Ever wondered where the term ""roguelike"" comes from? Well, here's the answer.
- [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork) If you enjoy reading, this was an amazing text-adventure game. Both sequels **Zork II** (1981) and **Zork III** (1982) also highly recommended.

### 1981
- [Galaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga) Technically the 2nd game in the series, after **Galaxian** (1979), but **Galaga** was so great it made everyone forget about the first.
- [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger) Basic but unique game, countless remakes were made.
- [Wizardry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizardry:_Proving_Grounds_of_the_Mad_Overlord) The birth of one of the best RPG series ever.
- [**Ultima**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_I:_The_First_Age_of_Darkness) The birth of one of the best RPG series ever.
- [Donkey Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_(video_game\)) No need to introduce him.

- [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) Great puzzle game, many remakes available.
- [Pitfall!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitfall!) A classic platformer, didn't age that well though.
- [Ms. Pac-man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms._Pac-Man) Fixed everything that the original **Pac-man** (1980) had wrong.
- [Centipede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centipede_(video_game\)) Atari 2600 version.
- [Tron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron_(video_game\)) Totally trippy game.

***

### 1983
- [**Alley Cat**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alley_Cat_(video_game\)) Reaaaally hard game, with very questionable colour palette, but I spent many hours on that one.
- [**Digger**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digger_(video_game\)) A classic and amazing game, also had a ton of more recent remakes.
- [Bomberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman_(1983_video_game\)) Another game with countless remakes, many of them are worth a shot.
- [Dragon's Lair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon%27s_Lair_(1983_video_game\)) A game that made people have a glimpse of what gaming could become, graphically amazing, makes Dark Souls feel like a walk in the park.
- [Pole position II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_Position_II) Looked really good at that time, with great gameplay too.

***

### 1984
- [Boulder dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder_Dash) Another one that spawned countless remakes.
- [Drugwars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drugwars) Later remade as Dope Wars end of 90s, simple trading game.
- [Marble Madness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_Madness) Interesting physics / puzzle / racing game.
- [King's Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Quest_I) Forget about the 1990 remake, the original (and its many sequels) are the way to go, will probably feel slow today though.
- [1942](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1942_(video_game\)) One of the first Capcom hits. Really good WWII vertical scroll shooter.

***

### 1985
- [Rush'n Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush'n_Attack) Aka **Green Beret**, shoot'em up. Was never really acclaimed as a great game, but I loved it.
- [**Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_in_the_World_Is_Carmen_Sandiego%3F_(1985\)) Gets harder every year considering this game kind of teaches you geography and countries, and those things changes (hello Soviet Union?).
- [**Ultima IV**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_IV:_Quest_of_the_Avatar) For me the best **Ultima**, loved it so much I created an entire map of the world myself using squared A4 paper (my copy, despite being official, didn't include the map) to help me get around.
- [Dragon Buster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Buster) Overall an average game, but it was one of the first to introduce a few things that are now common in video games (double jump and health bar). Still had lots of fun with it.

***

### 1986
- [Yie Ar Kung-Fu II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yie_Ar_Kung-Fu_II) Lots of time spent on that one, simple fighting game, but with 2 players you could control a woman, in a fighting game, that was never seen before.
- [**Enduro Racer**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enduro_Racer) Quite a hard dirt bike game, in which you could modify your bike with points gained depending on your result in each race. This mod system made the game really interesting IMO, finding the optimal bonuses depending on how many points you got was nice.
- [**Bubble Bobble**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_Bobble) Oh god, just play this if you haven't played it yet. Like, now, stop reading, go and have fun.
- [**Slap Fight**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slap_Fight) Played on Thomson version, really good scrolling shooter, full power-up was crazily overpowered.
- [Les cavernes de Thenebe](http://www.uvlist.net/fr/game-206149-Les+Cavernes+de+Thenebe) A game you probably never heard about, looked [like this](http://dcmoto.free.fr/programmes/les-cavernes-de-thenebe/04.png), basically lots of challenging puzzles.
- [Vampire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by02CLAFLp0) Another unknown title I absolutely loved, very challenging game where you play a random guy whose car break down in front of a castle, at midnight, and set off to save a damsel in distress, kidnapped by vampires, and witches, and dragons, and...

***

### 1987
- [Maniac Mansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniac_Mansion) While the game is amazing, I wouldn't recommend playing it unless you loved its sequel: **Day of the Tentacle** (1993). This one was not remastered and didn't really age well, it already felt old when the sequel was released.
- [Fantasy Zone II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_Zone_II:_The_Tears_of_Opa-Opa) Really fun side-scrolling shooter game. Trippy colourful world.
- [**Golvellius**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golvellius) An amazing underrated Action/RPG on Master System, aged quite well too.
- [**Rainbow Islands**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Islands:_The_Story_of_Bubble_Bobble_2) Technically the sequel to **Bubble Bobble**, but a totally different game. Very addictive platformer with some neat ideas. Players ""shoot"" rainbows that serves both as weapon and platforms on which they can walk. Really recommending this one, even now.
- [**Wizball**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizball) Such a unique game, I spent hours just trying to fully understand it. Very challenging and absolutely amazing once you start mastering the controls and power ups.
- [**R-Type**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-Type) There should be no need to introduce this one. If you feel there's a need, you haven't played it, so stop reading and do it, now.
- [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game\)) Basic but fun and somewhat challenging game (Atari 7800).
- [Renegade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renegade_(video_game\)) While this game was from 1986 originally, it was released in 1987 for DOS. Basic beat'em up, but the best at that time.

***

### 1988
- [**Captain Blood**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Blood_(video_game\)) Amazing concept, hard and sometimes extremely confusing. A sequel, **Commander Blood**, was made in 1994 too, while praised, I really preferred the original.
- [**Ghouls'n Ghosts**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghouls_%27n_Ghosts) Remained one of the best platformer to me for years.
- [Psychic World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychic_World) An underrated game for me. Not very well known action platformer. I absolutely loved the power-ups in that one. Some levels had really great and challenging design.
- [Scramble Spirits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramble_Spirits) I'd say this was one of the best vertical scrolling shooter from that time. 2 players mode was amazing.
- [**Super Mario Bros 3**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._3) Best **Mario** game for me, wasted many, many hours on this game. Still enjoyable nowadays.
- [Battle Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Chess) While it would now look basic, this game probably made some people start chess just to watch all those crazy capture animations. Lots of fun references too. But in the end, it's just a chess game.
- [Arcade Volleyball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_Volleyball) An extremely basic game, but soooo addictive. Really good with friends. Physics were also quite good for that time, many remakes and ""inspired"" games came out mostly in the 90s.

***

### 1989
- [Prince of Persia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia) Incredible animation and graphics for the year.
- [Sim City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_(1989_video_game\)) The game that would make city building a popular genre, and start a long series of games, spin-offs and rip-offs.
- [**Darius II**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_II_(video_game\)) (aka **Sagaia**) I'd say this game was, along with **R-Type** (1987) the best shoot'em up from that time. Sadly, this one if much less known.
- [**Wonderboy III**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Boy_III:_The_Dragon%27s_Trap) Completed this one countless times, great action-adventure game that aged well, still playing it from time to time. Each chapter ends in yourself being transformed into a different animal with different weaknesses and strengths. A remake is planned for 2017, I really hope it manages to keep the spirit of this game.
- [**Xenon 2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenon_2_Megablast) You can only have a megablast playing this. Sorry. Amazing shooter with shop to buy/sell power ups, very challenging, and once over you can start again in very-very challenging mode.
- [**Ys I &amp; II**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ys_I_%26_II) An improves version of the first 2 games (from 1987 and 1998), really great Action RPG for that time, might seem a bit dated today, **Ys I &amp; II Chronicles+** (2013) is more recommended.
- [Populous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populous_(video_game\)) If you haven't heard of Peter Molyneux, this is the game that absolutely launched his career in video gaming industry. He's basically seen as one of the geniuses of video games history, that guy worked on so many amazing games (**Theme Park** (1994), **Magic Carpet** (1994), **Dungeon Keeper** (1997), **Black &amp; White** (2001), **Fable** (2004), etc.). Populous might be the very first ""god simulator"", a management/strategy game where you play the role of a god. You had to trade your life to end this game (500 levels to beat).

***

### 1990
- [**The Secret of Monkey Island**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_of_Monkey_Island) Still the best point &amp; click for me. Nothing beats the original Guybrush Threepwood.
- [Parodius!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parodius!_From_Myth_to_Laughter) Lots of nonsense, then more nonsense. And then, nonsense.
- [Red Baron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Baron_(1990_video_game\)) Might be a bit vomit-inducing today, but an amazing 3D plane simulator for the year.
- [Rick Dangerous 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Dangerous_2) Great platformer with puzzle elements, that fixed everything that was wrong in the first game. Some say the wait for Half-Life 3 is too long, but many still wait for the sequel of that one.
- [Ski or Die!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_or_Die) Follow up of **Skate or Die** (1988), fun game with 5 different mini-games, snowball blast was, well, a blast.

***

### 1991
- [**Another world**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_World_(video_game\)) The intro alone made me launch this game many, many times, recent remake seem good, haven't tried it yet.
- [Scorched Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_Earth_(video_game\)) A very simple, yet entertaining game, basically trying to hit each other with artillery. Single player was uninteresting, but 2 players games were amazing.
- [Lemmings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings_(video_game\)) A really interesting concept, great game that had many sequels.
- [The Blues Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blues_Brothers_(video_game\)) Loved the gameplay, and music, also a great 2 players game.
- [Sonic the Hedgehog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(8-bit_video_game\)) There's no such thing as 'too fast'. Every platformer felt slow after this one.
- [**Civilization**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(video_game\)) One of the first game that made me lose the concept of time, still playing it despite the outdated graphics.
- [**Moktar**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_the_Fox) Challenging platformer, later released as **Titus the Fox**, but I think the music and sound changed, and the original were awesome.
- [Micro Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Machines_(video_game\)) Perfect time waster, especially in multiplayer mode.
- [Populous II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populous_II:_Trials_of_the_Olympian_Gods) Sequel to, and as hard to describe as **Populous** (1989). As the first one, the game was gigantic, with this time 1000 levels.

***

### 1992
- [**Dune**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(video_game\)) Amazing adventure game, followed by some amazing first glimpse at what would become RTS in the last stage of the game, definitely worth playing.
- [**Dune II**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_II) Didn't age as well as the first one, RTS went a long way since then, while this game was not technically the first RTS, it's one that set the entire basis of the genre and inspired countless titles since then. Played through the entire game many times, and can still get into it nowadays (despite the very annoying limits, such as single unit selection, and the need to select action before doing anything). I'm still amazed Westwood Studios managed to get these 2 games out in the same year.
- [Desert Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Strike) Isometric shoot'em up with very smooth gameplay.
- [Zool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zool) Beautiful, smooth, very fast and hard platformer.
- [**Flashback**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(1992_video_game\)) Incredible animation and graphics for the year (yeah, I said that 3 years ago). Forget about the 2103 remake.

***

### 1993
- [Prehistorik 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistorik_2) Sequel to **Prehistorik** (1991), this platformer was simply amazing. Really beautiful game, with lots of details and hidden content, had a really high replayability.
- [**Day of the Tentacle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Tentacle) One of the best point and click ever made. Really great graphics for the year, funny and witty game. Full of characters you'll remember 25 years after playing. A remake is available, go get it.
- [Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game\)) Do I need to say anything about that one? This game was simply a revolution in the land of FPS, so much the genre was basically called Doom-like for years after this release.
- [**Kyrandia 2 - The Hand of Fate**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Kyrandia#Book_Two_-_The_Hand_of_Fate) An underrated point and click, sometimes twisted (you'll get the reference if you've played it enough). Definitely worth at least a playthrough, while this is the 2nd game in the series (of 3), there's no need to play the first game to understand it.
- [**Princess Maker 2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Maker_2) Sequel to **Princess Maker** (1991), while the first game was already great, this is the game that would make the series popular. Your role in this game is to raise a princess from age 10 to 18, choosing what she is going to study, or what jobs she'll be doing, each action influencing the character stats. A lot of specific events can also happen, in which the outcome can be decided by your choices or her statistics. Really high replayability, with lots of different outcomes (74 different endings), not always very SFW (like, she can end up working as a ""bondage queen"").
- [Shadow of the Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Comet) One of the games based on HP Lovecraft's Cthulhu. The game was really, really good, but messed up by having bad controls. A sequel was also made, **Prisoner of Ice** (1995), but was overall less interesting.

***

### 1994
- [The Lost Vikings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Vikings) While the game was released in 1993 on SNES, I listed it in 1994 because its best edition came out this year, adding some content to the original game. Good mix of platform and puzzle games. First big success of Blizzard Entertainment, which left many legendary games.
- [Warcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft:_Orcs_%26_Humans) While **The Lost Vikings** was a big success for Blizzard, it was nothing compared to the first **Warcraft** game, which started a long (and loved) series of games.
- [Asuka 120% Burning Fest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asuka_120%25_Burning_Fest) Not a very well known fighting game, but an amazing one. 100% female characters, with very varied fighting styles. Many versions were made, some feel less dated than the original.
- [**Descent**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_(video_game\)) The sense of freedom of movement you got in that game was amazing. One of the very few games for which I'd recommend getting a joystick, made it so immersive. Probably the best gameplay of any full 3D game available at that time. Level design was also really clever, especially in solo mode.
- [Raptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptor:_Call_of_the_Shadows) An exceptionally good looking shooter for that time. Enemies were a mix of flying and ground (and water) units and buildings, and you had to learn to switch between weapons adapter to each of them. This game seemed to have somewhat resurrected recently, showing up again on Steam/Gog and even had an updated release in 2015.
- [Theme Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_Park_(video_game\)) Very first games in the ""Theme"" series by Bullfrog and Peter Molyneux, which is mostly known for this game and **Theme Hospital** (1997). This remained the best amusement park management game for long, until **RollerCoaster Tycoon** (1999) set the bar much higher.
- [Wacky Wheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wacky_Wheels) A fun racing game, sadly didn't age well.
- [**Magic Carpet**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Carpet_(video_game\)) A mix of action, strategy and (kind of) god game, once more by Peter Molyneux. A hard to describe one, but one of those addictive games that would make hours disappear.

***

### 1995
- [Baku Baku Animal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku_Baku_Animal) Very simple puzzle game, yet really entertaining, especially in 2 players mode.
- [Caesar II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_II) An interesting game for city-builder fans, this was one of the first to mix city-building with strategy. While I really enjoyed the city building part, I felt the strategy part was underwhelming.
- [Fatal Racing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Racing) Aka **Whiplash**. Very arcade-oriented racing game. Fast, with crazy tracks making your car fly in every direction, in which destroying opponents cars was not just possible, but highly recommended.
- [**Fury 3**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fury3) This game, along with **Terminal Velocity** (1995), developed by the same people, with the same engine, and the same everything. I still preferred **Fury 3** since I played it first, but it got bad ratings overall (understandably). Both will probably look dated today, but were extremely enjoyable games at that time.
- [Hi-Octane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-Octane) A not very known racing game, in the same vein as **Wipeout** (1995). Despite being released a few months before it, **Hi-Octane** was totally eclipsed by its release.
- [Magic Carpet 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Carpet_2) Sequel to **Magic Carpet** (1994), as hard to describe as the first, but also as recommended. While I wasn't a big fan of underground levels, the game did add a lot of variety to the original gameplay.
- [Manx TT Super Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manx_TT_Super_Bike) Released in 1997 on PC and Saturn. One of my favourite motorbike arcade racing game.
- [Phantasmagoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantasmagoria_(video_game\)) A very original point and click game. Which tried to mix live action with the genre. While the game itself was relatively average, it was a huge hit. I quite liked Adrienne, but the entire thing really looked like a random B-movie.
- [**Warcraft II**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_II:_Tides_of_Darkness) An amazing RTS, while the first **Warcraft** was enjoyable, it still suffered from tedious controls. **Warcraft II** fixed most of those issues. It also looked fantastic for 1995, and still doesn't look ugly. The variety of units was amazing.
- [**Worms**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_(1995_video_game\)) First title in what would become a long (and still ongoing) series of games, with lots of spin-offs and a ton of rip-offs. For many reasons, this one remains my favourite in the series, mainly because I had ton of fun with friends, and because I liked the darker theme that was replaced by a very funny/party oriented theme in the following games.

***

### 1996
- [**Command &amp; Conquer - Red Alert**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer:_Red_Alert) To me, still the best title in the **Command &amp; Conquer** series, did everything perfectly and set very high standards for RTS, especially for controls.
- [Descent 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_II) Nothing particularly new in this one, but the first game was amazing, and the sequel remained on the same track.
- [Destruction Derby 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_Derby_2) Combat racing game, looked good and was tons of fun with many different game modes.
- [Diablo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_(video_game\)) No need to introduce this one. While its successor, **Diablo II** (2000) gets all the praise, I probably played the first one even more. Sadly, offline or closed game with friends was the way to go, online was full of cheaters. Still remember the very first time I connected to battle.net, before I even left the town someone had dropped a full set of one of the best endgame gear for me. Kind of broke the entire online experience.
- [Duke Nukem 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Nukem_3D) Some preferred **Quake** (also 1996), for me, it was Duke Nukem all the way, I mean, why just kill some monsters when you can kill some monsters and visit strip clubs and space, and strip clubs in space? First game that made me use a level editor, built a few entire levels for it (sadly, all lost).
- [**Megarace 2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaRace_2) Totally over the top game, crazy real actors cutscenes, crazy races with weapons, crazy level design, crazy everything. Totally recommended. **Megarace** (1993) was also great, but far from the fun of 2. **Megarace 3** (2002) doesn't exist (I wish).
- [Lords of the Realm II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_of_the_Realm_II) An interesting mix of turn-based management game and RTS. Currently still available for cheap, if you enjoy original ideas, strategy and don't fear dated graphics, I can only recommend giving it a try.
- [Screamer 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screamer_2) Rally racing game, not very realistic but very enjoyable game. Really good graphics, animation and soundtrack.
- [**The Settlers II**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Settlers_II) Along with **Civilization** (1991), one of the few games that would hook me for hours every time I launched it at that time (and both still do). One of the best management / RTS ever made. I'd spend hours just looking at all those units doing things on their own, or doing nothing, since they'd start doing funny things when having nothing to do. I'd also wait for some resources to be moved for a few minutes, just to see a pig carried by a donkey. Seriously, if you don't see what I'm talking about, go get the game (or the 10th anniversary edition from 2006), and get a pig on a donkey. You'll like it.
- [Tomb Raider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Raider_(1996_video_game\)) The birth of a long series. While the game was pretty much revolutionary at that time, if now looks really dated. **Tomb Raider: Anniversary** (2007) remade this one in a much more enjoyable way by today standards. People nowadays will never understand the idea of spending 5 minutes trying to get your character in a corner just to look at boobs made of 3 polygons.
- [Wipeout 2097](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wipeout_2097) (aka **Wipeout XL**) An amazingly well designed game. Futuristic racing game with weapons, very challenging to master.
- [F-22 Lightning II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-22_(series\)) One of the few combat flight simulator I really played. **F-22 Lightning 3** (1999), the 3rd game in the series (while II is the first, confusing, I know) is also worth taking a look at. The 2nd game, **F-22 Raptor** (1997) was more forgettable.
- [**Heroes of Might and Magic II**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_II) Many would disagree, but this is the best in the series for me. I still play it from time to time and I'm sure I'll spend hours on it every time I launch the game. An expansion was released in 1997 too, also recommended.

***

### 1997
- [**Total Annihilation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Annihilation) 1997 was the year of RTS. Total Annihilation is the one I spent the most time on, and I still enjoy it from time to time now that it's back on Steam. It took strategy to a new dimension, with so many units compared to anything before. And by so many units I mean both so many available, and so many controlled at once. Sound track was also some amazing classical music, that would change depending on what you were currently doing.
- [Grand Theft Auto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_(video_game\)) The birth of a very well-known series, for some reason, I never really enjoyed the game after it went 3D with the 3rd opus. This one remains my favourite by far. Spent weeks creating an entire custom city with a friend. Lost it. Am sad now.
- [**Myth**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth:_The_Fallen_Lords) A really impressive fantasy tactical game. It looked really good for that year, the story was interested, and the level design was very clever and challenging. 2 sequels were made, **Myth II: Soulblighter** (1998), also highly recommended, and **Myth III: The Wolf Age** (2001), somewhat less interesting.
- [Redneck Rampage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redneck_Rampage) The title actually says almost everything about this game, all you need more is to know it's a FPS.
- [**Quake II**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_II) For me, this was the most impressive game at launch in the **Quake** series. It felt like 3D FPS suddenly leaped into a new area. Gameplay and graphics were a huge step up from anything before.
- [Dark Reign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Reign:_The_Future_of_War) 1997 was really the golden age of RTS, this one had a really unique art style and some interesting mechanics. A sequel, **Dark Reign 2** (2000) also gets high praises, but I didn't feel the move to full 3D was that successful, and never finished it.
- [Claw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claw_(video_game\)) A somewhat forgotten but very enjoyable plarformer. You're both a cat and a pirate, how could you not enjoy it?
- [Moto Racer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moto_Racer) Possibly the motorcycle racing game I played the most. The feeling of speed was amazing.
- [Earth 2140](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_2140) Did I already say something about this year being one of the best for RTS? This one also brought lots of interesting ideas to the table, especially with a great AI and units.
- [**Final Fantasy VII**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII) Hard to talk about this game without starting a war on which Final Fantasy was the best. Well, it was this one. Now, I said it.
- [Nuclear Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Strike) Fifth game in the ""Strike"" series, started by **Desert Strike** (1992). For some reasons, all other entries in this series were mostly forgettable. While this one didn't get as much praise as the first one, it was still a very enjoyable shooter.
- [Ignition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignition_(video_game\)) Also knows as **Fun Tracks** or **Bleifuss Fun**. Another somewhat underrated game, really fast miniature cars racing game with clever and beautiful track design.
- [Interstate 76](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_%2776) A very unusual game, which looked like some fun weaponized car action game, but was actually closer to a strategy/simulation game, which actually makes sense since it was based on **MechWarrior 2** (1995) engine. I thought a long time about including **MechWarrior 2** in this list actually, the game felt really good, and I tried countless times to get into it, but never managed to do so. **Interstate 76**, on the other hand, sucked many hours out of my life.
- [**Pod**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_Death) Such a good racing game, looked particularly amazing on PC with MMX instructions. While the game was definitely a technical demonstration of these new capabilities, it was also really fun and easy to play.
- [**Sub Culture**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub_Culture) A kind of open world and very unique game. It might be short and non challenging, but I spent so much time on this one. You control a submarine, salvage/mine/trade things, and engage in missions with 2 nations at war with each other. With a kind of short main storyline.
- [The City of Lost Children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_of_Lost_Children#Video_game) While that adventure game received terrible reviews, I absolutely loved it, the atmosphere was really well made.
- [KKnD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KKnD_(video_game\)) Yeah, 1997, RTS, something something. Xtreme edition mostly recommended, not sure I ever played the basic edition, one more amazing RTS. Had a sequel the next year: **KKnD 2** (1998), but I preferred the first one by a long shot.

***

### 1998
- [Descent: FreeSpace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent:_FreeSpace_%E2%80%93_The_Great_War) Despite the name, and the same developers, this has little to do with **Descent** (1995). A great single player space simulation, multiplayer was apparently very flawed, but I never played online or LAN. Setting up your ship before a mission added a small strategy aspect.
- [**Need For Speed III**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed_III:_Hot_Pursuit) Visually, the most impressive game of 1998 to me, by far. First 2 games in the series (1994 and 1997) were good, but this one was amazing. It brought back police chases from the first and made it the central part of the game.
- [Shogo: MAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogo:_Mobile_Armor_Division) An unusual FPS, where you control either your character, or a mecha depending on the level, sadly eclipsed by **Half-Life**, released soon after.
- [**Anno 1602**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_1602) Really good and challenging RTS / city builder game. Played it so much that I can still hear Greensleaves while I write this.
- [Blood II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_II:_The_Chosen) Sequel from **Blood** (1997), both are actually pretty good FPS, with lots of violence and dark humour.
- [Baldur's Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur's_Gate) Kind of revived the AD&amp;D genre that had no big and popular titles since **Eye of the Beholder** (1990), and led to many sequels and similar games.
- [Dune 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_2000) An underrated **Dune** game, while it wasn't as revolutionary as the first two, it had very little flaws, and was very enjoyable.
- [**Carmageddon II**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmageddon_II:_Carpocalypse_Now) Sequel to **Carmageddon** (1997), this game sparked a quite big controversy at the time, and was censored in many countries. A totally crazy ""racing"" game, which actually ended up having very little to do with racing most of the time. Instead, you'd wreck every opponent and pedestrian, or throw them against a wall with huge springs, or hit them with giant flails attached to the back of your car, or...
- [**Future Cop: LAPD**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Cop:_LAPD) A mostly forgotten game, even at that time. I had amazing times playing it with a friend in coop mode. Basically a third person shooter where you control the police, and kill everything. Had a lot of great ideas, and apparently inspired modern MOBA games. 
- [**Half-Life**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game\)) Nah, I don't need to say anything. Just play it if you haven't.
- [Jazz Jackrabbit 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_Jackrabbit_2) Classic platformer, not really adding anything new, but doing everything right. Also had a great level editor, and once again, I lost everything I made with it. And am sad.
- [Commandos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commandos:_Behind_Enemy_Lines) The game that made real time tactics popular. Challenging and unforgiving game.
- [**Myth II**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_II:_Soulblighter) Same as the first, just better in every way.
- [**Railroad Tycoon II**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_Tycoon_II) Still the best train management game I ever played, looked and sounded amazing (that soundtrack).
- [DethKarz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DethKarz) An underrated combat racing game. Fast with great graphics and gameplay.
- [Swarm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_(1998_video_game\)) Simple arcade / shooter game, but extremely enjoyable, I sank a lot of time on this one.
- [Viper Racing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viper_Racing) Very enjoyable racing game that sadly lacked content. Could have been a huge hit IMO.
- [A.R.S.E.N.A.L - Taste the Power](http://www.tacticalsoft.com/arsenal1/arsenal.htm) A really interesting new take on RTS from a small studio. Tactically much more complex than most RTS, especially with addition of things like fuel management.
- [SiN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SiN) Underrated FPS. Interesting story and overall design.

***

### 1999
- [**Kana: Little Sister**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana:_Little_Sister) Adult visual novel. While there is very little graphic scenes, and all very soft, what made this game a very adult game were the themes. Do not play when depressed, seriously, this is the very first game that had me totally in tears in front of my computer, and yet I could not stop playing, I had to know what would happen, I had to.
- [**Dungeon Keeper 2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Keeper_2) You should be familiar with Peter Molyneux by now. He created the first **Dungeon Keeper** (1997), which was an amazing mix of RTS, god game and management, with unique themes and characters. While he wasn't involved in this one (as far as I know), this game took the first one to the next level, and turned it in a pure masterpiece.
- [**Homeworld**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeworld) I really, really hoped this game would start a new major branch of RTS, the idea of a RTS with 6 degrees of freedom hadn't even crossed my mind before I heard about this game. And my first thought was that it would be really hard to play. How wrong I was, the gameplay was simply perfect. Sadly, there hasn't been many similar games, except for **Homeworld 2** (2003). Both were remastered in 2015.
- [FreeSpace 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeSpace_2) Sequel to **FreeSpace** (1998), it was superior in every way, fixing most issues the first had, and improving everything it already did well. Amazing story and graphics.
- [System Shock 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Shock_2) One of the first ""modern"" FPS to successfully include RPG elements. Highly recommended along with **Deux Ex** (2000).
- [Battlezone II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlezone_II:_Combat_Commander) It took some time for the developers to fix the game that had game-breaking bugs on release, which kind of hindered its success. The game was an amazing mix of RTS and FPS, really enjoyable once its original issues were fixed.
- [Age of Empires II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires_II) Still the best title in **Age of Empires** series to me. Very enjoyable RTS, both in solo or multiplayer. **Age of Empires II HD** (2013) is more modern release of this game, but it feels horribly overpriced to me.
- [**Outcast**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcast_(video_game\)) Sadly, not many could play this game on launch, because of absolutely crazy hardware requirements for the time. One of the first game that would really classify as open-world 3D.
- [Aliens vs Predator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_versus_Predator_(1999_video_game\)) Probably the best AvP game ever made, I'd even say the best Alien game. Playing marine made it a complete horror game, it really managed to put you in the shoes of a single lost marine fighting those crazy monsters (and dying, and dying, and dying again). And playing as those crazy monsters was also really enjoyable, especially running on walls as an alien to stalk on those marines.
- [**Omikron: The Nomad Soul**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omikron:_The_Nomad_Soul) I don't know where to start for this one. This game was an amazing mix of genres, in a (kind of) open-world 3rd person game, that included some shooter parts, and some fighting (as in 3D fighting game, **Virtua Fighter** style). A world that felt huge, with interesting characters everywhere, and such a great story. And Bowie (both in game, and partly behind it).
- [Unreal Tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Tournament) No need to introduce that one. **Quake 3** (also 1999) and UT were the 2 big FPS of the end of 90s. My preference went to UT for multiplayer.
- [Re-Volt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-Volt) Radio controlled car racing game, with weapons, what's not to love about that?
- [Expendable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Soldier:_Expendable) Very basic shoot-em-up, looked absolutely fantastic when it came out, with crazy effects everywhere, kind of like **Incoming** (1998). Great game to play with a friend.
- [Darkstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkstone:_Evil_Reigns) While it wasn't the most beautiful game, this is one of the first Diablo-like that successfully went full-3D. Great gameplay and replayability, but probably too ugly for most by today's standards (it already kind of was by 99's standards).
- [**Rage of Mages 2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_of_Mages) This game was so incredibly addictive, spent a lot of days on this one. An original mix of RPG and RTS, and definitely much harder than most games from any of these genres.
- [Pharaoh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh_(video_game\)) One of the best city-building games ever made for me. Challenging and interesting campaign, also great music.",patientgamers,1461

My mom was a crazy person who did crazy shit that hurt some folks, but she also did good shit for a lot of people. One of the good things she would do was that she'd hold a rummage-sale fundraiser for [Rapha House International](https://raphahouse.org/), an anti-human-trafficking charity. She died on Friday. In honor of her memory, I'd like to try to convince as many people as possible to make donations.

Just like last time, a donation gets you an essay. $50 gets you 300 words on a topic of your choosing. The topic can be anything - traditionally it's gun-related because that's where I've spent most of my time reading and writing, but last time I wrote a love letter to a guy's wife, and there was some interest in My Little Pony erotic fanfiction.

I'll write *anything*, although if your ask is esoteric you'll get an esoteric answer, and I reserve the right to explain why your topic might be difficult and request an alternative.

**OKAY PRESIDENTENDER THAT SOUNDS GREAT HOW CAN I PARTICIPATE**

1. Go to [Rapha House](https://raphahouse.org/donate) and donate at least $50.

2. Take a screenshot of your emailed donation receipt, and host it somewhere (imgur, probably).

3. Make a comment on this thread, with a link to the receipt screenshot, and a topic for an essay.

**PRESIDENTENDER THIS IS NOT GUNS?**

You shut your mouth and you do what I say.

**PRESIDENTENDER I AM SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS BUT I DO NOT CARE ABOUT THIS CHARITY CAN I HAVE AN ESSAY ANYWAY**

Sure, send me a screenshot of some proof of purchase for a donation to a different charity. If it's gun-related I'm gonna tell you to get stuffed because you were gonna donate there anyway. 

**PRESIDENTENDER THE MODS DID NOT APPROVE THIS POST AND IT IS AGAINST THE RULES**

You are correct. 

**WHAT ABOUT FLAIR THERE WAS THAT COOL COW FLAIR I WANT FLAIR FOR THIS TOO**

/u/phteven_j has graciously agreed, again, to do the flair for this. I'm gonna hold off until I have a list of names to send him so he's not taking the time to do 'em one-by-one. Incidentally what the hell flair should we use? Like I could draw a little pixel 'house' I guess.

**O SURE YOU WANT US TO DONATE BUT WHAT HAVE YOU EVER DONE**

And I think it really shows where the expectations of this game came from.

Edit: The original thread (and its creator!) has been deleted several times on the No Man's Sky sub. Thanks to the mods of /r/Games for keeping this one alive.


**OP:**

So it's been a week, and it seems like people are realizing that there's a bunch of stuff we were told would be in the game, but isn't. There have been posts and comments here and there talking about it, and giving examples. A few days ago, I decided to dive into the information repository myself, collect as much as I could manage, and put it all in one place. This is mostly a response to the prevailing notion that we hyped ourselves into believing something that wasn't true from the get go. Some definitely have, and we all know the reputation this game's community has gotten. But really, many of us were just going on what we'd been told, and we'd been told a *lot* of things that didn't end up being true.


I broke everything down into categories. Beside each missing feature there's links to the YouTube video it's talked about/shown in, and all links are to the relevant time in the video. **Bolded links lead to information from just four months ago.** Besides that, I've pulled a relevant quote that sums up the subject, and when none was available (usually because it's from a trailer,) I've added a short comment. Beneath the categories is extra info, and a comment trying to put things into the context of the game we have. There is more than all of this, I know, but this is what I could find.
 **All information linked is either from the horse's mouth, or official marketing material.** 

**EDIT:::** Simplified version here, if you don't care about the lesser details or my rambling context-giving down below. From my comment reply to /u/Mr_Dr0ne :

 I got ya, luckily I still have the formatted post. I threw out everything I could find, that was my intention, but my lack of brevity will always be one of my shortcomings. The big momma issues simplified are:

- The loss of planetary physics, which were said to govern many different systems, seemingly in a cascading effect from the top down:
 | [1](https://youtu.be/ueBCC1PCf84?t=1m34s) [2](https://youtu.be/ueBCC1PCf84?t=7m58s) [**3**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=3m14s) [4](https://youtu.be/v5sBbjckyzU?t=1m40s)

- The retooling of ships to make them all functionally identical, rather than having different classes for different playstyles, essentially homogenizing ship play into a single playstyle: [1](https://youtu.be/h-kifCYToAU?t=24m2s) [**2**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=14m38s) [**3**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=17m45s)

- The reworking of factions from something with broader significance, into the very simplistic system we have now:  [**1**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=9m37s) [2](https://youtu.be/v5sBbjckyzU?t=34s)

- Resource distribution following none of the rules that were spoken of, instead resource variety is more shallow than we'd been lead to believe, so distribution was seemingly homogenized regardless of planet-based factors (likely an effect of the loss of planetary physics)[**1**](https://youtu.be/it_9pUYO2AY?t=4m33s) [**2**](https://youtu.be/BXUrOFVItgs?t=2m2s) [**3**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=2m48s) [**4**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=10m32s)
|| This also had a knock-on effect for trading, which was trivialized by the ease in which most resources could be found: [1](https://youtu.be/BXUrOFVItgs?t=56s) [**2**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=15m57s) [3](https://youtu.be/GjKTJblJpw0?t=35m20s), and also crafting, which went from something Sean hoped would be community drive a la Minecraft (likely because there were far more resources originally, a la Minecraft, there's more evidence of this than just the crafting,) to something that could only be done through recipes the game must teach you before you can actually use: [1](https://youtu.be/BXUrOFVItgs?t=2m8s)

Those are the big ones that effect large swaths of the game, and Sean was talking about them all only four months ago.  This is where all the real complexity Sean had spent years talking about was, and all of it was cut from the game, seemingly during the last delay.

**Edit 2::** I'm being told that the butterflies *do* in fact exist, though are rare. Also, that animals *do* attack one another. I'm going to edit in clarifications for both. Guys, I'm having a balls-hard time keeping track of things, and my computer is absolutely crawling. 

###Please, if you have a screenshot of something, or know I'm dead wrong about something, send me a private message with it! I can't keep up, and that would make it much easier for me to amend information in. I can't keep up with the comments, but I'd like to credit people with the corrections!

###Edit 3:: Instances of ""desert planet"" changed to ""sand planet"" to reflect the exact thing I'm referencing. I know there are rocky planets with cacti and the like, but so far nothing like the large sandy dune planets like the one show with the giant snake-worm thing. Again, if someone has a pic, please PM it to me! 

##Edit 4: I'm editing in the basic change to the ship scanner bit I was wrong about. Still hoping someone could send me a screenshot so I can add that too! PM me if you've got one!

**Comments:** 

There ended up being no landing on asteroids. There's no way to destroy freighters or space stations, and ""fleets"" in the game are compried of maybe three or so ships. Freighters also do not move at all, despite their engines always being on. All of these things make the game much more static and lifeless than we were shown. **Edit:: This is indeed in the game. Leaving it here for posterity.** Scanning from orbit isn't possible, and it's been something a lot of people have been talking about. The scan in the clip covers a much larger area than anything we have in the game, as ship scans currently only find one location on one planet for some reason.

**Extra NPC Interaction Bit -** 
&gt;“Having said that, being No Man’s Sky, there is a procedural element to your interactions. The AI you talk to will know the name of the planet you’re on and will reference it. They’ll reference wanting certain things based on the environment they’re in. They’ll know if it’s cold, or hot, or whatever. You’ll see a reasonable amount of variety — it’s not just pre-baked dialogue.” [Source](http://blog.us.playstation.com/2016/03/03/no-mans-sky-a-universe-filled-with-lore-and-language/)



**Comments:** 

**Faction affiliations have been completely trivialized from what we were shown, and seem to have been pared down to almost no significance within the last few months.** Sean talked a lot about how you could have a significant standing with factions that would meaningfully effect the game world. This is not the case, the serve nearly no purpose at all from what I can tell. They open up a few options for things like shield and health recharges, neither of which you would *ever* actually need them to do for multiple reasons. You can also farm words from their languages at a certain point, but it hardly seems like HG meant for this. You can max out faction rep in your first play session, and there are only three ranks for each. Losing rank seems very hard to do, even if you're trying to do it.

Maybe the worst of all is that there are no faction battles to join. Factions don't seem to have any interactions with each other at all, let alone have giant space battles. This is a huge bummer, it looked like so much fun. Factions you're friendly with won't even help you if you're being shot by pirates right next to them! It seems like the whole faction element was almost completely removed from the game, and it was something Sean was talking about just four months ago.

&gt;""The physics of every other game—it’s faked,” the chief architect Sean Murray explained. “When you’re on a planet, you’re surrounded by a skybox—a cube that someone has painted stars or clouds onto. If there is a day to night cycle, it happens because they are slowly transitioning between a series of different boxes.""

&gt;""With us,” Murray continued, “when you're on a planet, you can see as far as the curvature of that planet. If you walked for years, you could walk all the way around it, arriving back exactly where you started. Our day to night cycle is happening because the planet is rotating on its axis as it spins around the sun. There is real physics to that. We have people that will fly down from a space station onto a planet and when they fly back up, the station isn't there anymore; the planet has rotated. People have filed that as a bug.”* [Source](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/02/artifi cial-universe-no-mans-sky/463308/)

**Comments:**  **EDIT:: Desert planets edited to Sand planets to clarify**

No ringed planets, and no sand planets. Ringed planets were only talked about, but sand planets were on display multiple times. Considering planets look very samey in the game, who knows how much variety has been cut. There seems to only be typical out-of-bounds void outside of solar systems, so there's no way to travel out of them to other systems manually. If you go far enough out, things start bugging out, and your game will crash eventually.

**Planets do not rotate on their axis, moons do not orbit their planets, and planets do not orbit a sun. There isn't even a sun, it's just decoration on the sky box.** This may be the largest cut element, ""solar systems"" in the game are only static planets hanging in space. Whether or not you land on the dark or light side of a planet doesn't matter. This may have more wide-ranging effects than just aesthetics, as there were many things said to be governed by the planetary simulation. Planets closest to the ""sun"" are just as likely to be frozen as the ones furthest away, for instance, which may have messed with all the systems that relied on there being a meaningful distinction there, considering all of those things either seem completely borked, or removed outright (more on that further down.) In terms of player experience, the loss of the simulation meant the loss of dynamic solar systems, which meant everything became little more than a shiny diorama. This is another thing that Sean was talking about just four months ago.

**Comments:** 

You cannot scan or name ships, and despite there being footage of somewhat-complex flight, flight in the game is relegated to almost-autopilot in atmospheres, and sluggish flying-through-pudding in space.

**But the big one here is that ships are all functionally identical except for inventory slots, all other differences are cosmetic alone.** Your trader ship is as good at dogfighting as your fighter, your science ship makes for a fine trader, so on and so forth. Things like speed and handling can not be upgraded, and are the same for the first ship you fly and the 48-slot beast you late-game in. What upgrades do exist are linear progressions for your **two** guns, your shields, and your warp drive. Sean said this is a space game, and there's nearly zero complexity or depth in the most important tool for spacefaring. Just four months ago, this did not seem to be the case.

**Comments:**

Here's where things seem to have gone very wrong. **All the complexity and depth in trade, resources and crafting seems to have been cut from the game, and replaced with incredibly simplistic systems with almost no depth whatsoever in the last few months.** Let me go over it bit by bit, because there's a lot.

Positions of planets does not affect resources therein, neither does weather, or type of planet, or anything. If those things exist in some small way, they're so subtle as to not even be worth mentioning. All planets have mostly the same resources, with only rarer resources being *mostly* split up onto different planets. But there are only maybe 4 of that kind of element anyway. Maybe your planet with gold doesn't have emeril or aluminium (sometimes they have all 3 of those,) but it has everything else. You don't need to go to an icy planet as a sure-fire way to find plutonium like Sean says in one of those videos, plutonium is everywhere in abundance! The exotic elements have almost no uses outside of selling, and elements like gold and emeril only have a few more uses than those ones. 

I really don't know if it's even *possible* to play the game without landing, but even if you can get everything you need from a store (which doesn't sell much of anything in large enough quantities to be of much use) and from robbing freighters, the idea that you could play this game as a trader is a joke. Trading is a paper-thin mechanic, and there's next to nothing to do with money anyway even if you *are* landing on planets. Trading between systems also seems completely implausible, considering finding your way back and forth to systems you've been to is frustrating to say the least. 

Crafting is another thing that Sean has vastly overstated. If you can only craft the things the game has specifically taught you how to craft, how can there be some big community push to figure out how to craft them? Hell, much of the stuff you craft is only used to craft other things the game has to teach you how to craft before you can craft. And why is that? Why is it that you have to use Element 1 and Element 2 to craft A, use A to craft B, use B to craft C, and use C to craft warp fuel? Why does it take such a convoluted process?

There's evidence in the newer demo videos of more elements in the game. I think there were supposed to be a ton more elements, enough to warrant the complexity in all these systems, but they got cut. When the whole system was simplified, it became a matter of replacing them with what they had left, but had to be balanced for difficulty and that's why recharging your warp drive involves a four-step process. Everything about the complexity Sean talked about would require there to be more than just a handful of elements, and Sean was talking about **all** this stuff in April. This whole aspect seems like a complete mess, and I wonder if it has to do with the simulation being canned.

**Extra Animal AI Complexity Bit -**

&gt;“There is a list of objects that animals are aware of,” Artificial Intelligence programmer Charlie Tangora explained. “Certain animals have an affinity for some objects over others which is part of giving them personality and individual style. They have friends and best friends too. It's just a label on a bit of code—but another creature of the same type nearby is potentially their friend. They ask their friends telepathically where they’re going so they can coordinate.”

**Comments:** 

There was a lot of talk about all the things animals were capable of in this game, and it seems like none of it actually made it into the game we were sold. I've never seen  one of those plants attack an animal, and I've never seen animals attack, let alone *eat* eachother. They don't seem to be capable of much beyond squealing, running/walking, and pantomiming eating or something. Aggressive animals just rush you until you kill them, that whole ""shoot the ground and scare it away"" thing doesn't seem to work, in my experience. They just don't seem to do a damn thing, and you'll clip right through them if you try to walk into one. Their animations are also really clunky depending on how large they are. As far as creatures following some kind of ruleset for what kind of creature can be on what kind of planet, there doesn't seem to be any. You'll even get what sounds like the same distant-sounding animal calls on planets completely devoid of life. We probably all know that call, it's that whale-like vocalization, and it seems to be the same one used for every planet.

They also clip right through trees and foliage as though they don't even care they're walking straight through a tree, so they certainly don't cause the leaves and branches to shake like in that one vid. You don't just happen upon some large land creature having a drink whole in the water, maybe because rivers were scrapped...

**Comments:**

Rivers can be seen in at least one video, and they were talked about a lot. There are barely even any lakes in the game, and the ones I've found were pretty small. Overall, most planets have zero water on them, even though they have obvious precipitation. 

There are also no large structures like we were shown, nor any buildings with moving parts. The planets are populated with small, identical buildings with no dynamic features. There are also no crashed freighters to explore. 

The big one here is that the portals we have found are dead, and we don't know if they can be activated. **But ask yourself, if every planet has most of the elements you need, and finding the ones any planet doesn't have is as easy as searching the surrounding planets, what function would the portals even serve? This is another huge hint that there was once a larger table of elements to feed the more complex features the game once had. If maxing your ship, suit and multitool can be done on your starter planet, and planets closer to the center don't have resources any more rare than outer planets, why would you ever need a portal like the ones they talked about?** They would serve no purpose, that's why I believe they're just static objects now. Maybe HG thought no one would find them if they weren't marked by scans, and that's why they didn't bother removing them.

**Comments:**

Sentinels only ever seem to come 3-4 at a time at most, certainly not in large packs like seen in that clip. Walkers aren't just chilling out in the environment either, they spawn when you get a full wanted bar. But none of them pose any real risk anyway. Dog sentinels and walkers only come one at a time, and you really have to go out of your way to even get a walker to spawn most of the time because it's so easy to take out sentinels before they call for backup. You want to know how easy it is to kill sentinels? Hit a sentinel with your mining beam just once, then aim off into space 10-20 feet to the side of it. Watch as your beam flies off into space, but blows up the sentinels anyway. Seriously, try it, their hit box becomes the size of a starship. 

Even so, you can just melee jump a few times and escape a wanted level pretty easily, or pop into any structure, which deactivates them. This wasn't the case four months ago.

**Comments:**

Obviously, we all know about the multiplayer stuff. There's no confirmation that player-instances even exist.

Beacons in that video mark points of interest on a large swath of the planet. In the game, they zoom out, but don't mark anything. You also don't need them to upload discoveries. i think this is another tip that a lot of things were removed. Why would you need to mark all this stuff in such a large area when it's the exact same stuff that's in *every* area? Marking things with those binoculars in that other video looks to be a *ton* more useful than what we ended up with, which is a green glow that often matches the background, and a tiny white dot that sometimes mark things on the other side of the planet because it's buggy as hell.

Being able to hack reinforced doors is talked about, but in the game, the only way to get in is to blow them up.

Radio chatter and glass windscreens aren't much, but they'd add some much-needed liveliness to the game.

***

###For all Sean said about how complex these systems were, how did they actually end up? They all fell well short of what was advertised.


Pillar | Why Does It Fall Short of What Was Advertised?
---|---
Explore | Planets are less diverse than we'd been told, and with less features. They also don't seem to become appreciably more interesting as you move towards the center, if at all. The pool of resources is shallow, and they're spread more or less homogeneously among planets. There are no objects on planets that you will not have seen in an hour or two on your first planet, and no objects in space that can be found through exploration. Explore should be renamed Sightsee, as that's more or less what you're doing when exploring because you quickly run out of significant things to discover.
Fight | Ship combat was trivialized by the removal of classes and ship attributes. Large scale space battles were cut as well, and you cannot destroy space stations or freighters as we'd been told. You will fight sentinels and pirates alone, all of which fly ships which are functionally identical to your own. Ground combat occurs with only a few sentinels at a time, and poses no challenge. Fights are easily won, escaped from, or avoided entirely.
Trade | Trading offers few benefits outside of selling valuable items to upgrade to better equipment. There are few items you'd actually ever want to buy from a trader, and few things to sell that are worth using an inventory slot on instead of a gold/emeril stack. Grinding for elements/rare items to sell is as far as most will ever go, and money quickly becomes useless in the game. You probably can't play as a space trader exclusively, and trading between systems doesn't seem worth the hassle even if you can. Trading with factions is a non-consideration as you will max out in rep for everyone very quickly. There simply isn't enough elements in the game to support deep trade, as there's little to actually need, and little worth actually selling.
Survive | Everything you need for basic survival is bountiful on every planet. Sentinels pose no risk. The only thing that poses any particular risk is extreme planets, and there's zero incentive to even really visit those as they've got nothing you couldn't easily find elsewhere, not that the risk they pose isn't easily mitigated and/or dealt with.




**Considering how much is missing from the game, we have every reason to question whether or not any of the complex systems we were told would be in the game are actually there.** Do the planets get any more exotic as you move to the center *at all*? Are those ""significant"" player-made disruptions to the game world *actually* being saved globally? Is there *anything* besides names being saved globally at all if there are no fleets to destroy, and you can't destroy space stations? Do any of the things they talked about that govern things on a large scale exist? If they said nothing about the game-changing loss of planetary physics, are there less noticeable things that we haven't been told are gone?

As you can see, the game we were told we'd get is a far more feature-rich, complex and dynamic game than the one we actually got. What we got was a static, lifeless and paper thin experience by comparison. I encourage anyone interested in this to spend some time watching the old trailers and demos to more fully grasp just how different the game is from the one they'd been selling us on for all those years.

#There's more and it ain't pretty, in my opinion.
Clearly Sean was showing off a very different game four months ago. That footage is incredibly misleading, as it talks about many aspects of the game that no longer exist. Watching the IGN First from April bummed me the hell out, because that game looked amazing, and the game we got seems less like 1.03 and more like 0.5.03. It didn't make me mad, I didn't feel like I'd be straight-up lied to, only maybe unintentionally misled. **Then just as I was wrapping this post up, I found the real kicker that pissed me all the way off.** Maybe others have realized this, but I didn't until last night:
###The most recent promo material from July, the four pillars videos released just a month before launch, *are all using new footage from that same old build of the game that very clearly does not represent the one people can buy*. That footage is still being used to sell this game even now, and it's no better than what Sega did with Aliens: Colonial Marines. 

I feel utterly bamboozled now, possibly even hoodwinked. It's one thing for footage from four months ago to be unrepresentative -- development is a process, and things change. But a month old, when obviously the game had been significantly altered by then? To continue to use misleading footage in the commercials knowing the game had changed drastically? That's being intentionally misleading. It makes you wonder: if they're using footage they know to be misleading now, did they know it was misleading four months ago when they were making a big press push using that same build? As corny and melodramatic as it was last week,  I think it's fair to wonder if we've been legitimately lied to at this point. 

If nothing more, we deserve some answers. No more vague nonsense, but real answers.

stevenaugustus,2016-05-15 16:52:54+00:00,"Just What is Stellaris Missing, Exactly? -- A Full List of Concepts to be Added and Quality of Life Fixes to be Made","**UPDATE**: Very happy to see this thread on the top spot in both /r/Stellaris and /r/ParadoxPlaza. Going to crawl through each comment and add whatever I missed and clarify my position better on some ideas in here. I invite anyone to share this list on the Paradox forums. More over, if any Paradox employees would like to come in here and give a Q&amp;A that'd be simply fantastic.

Sank 55 hours of my life into Stellaris in the 6 days since release - all during finals week. Here's what I honestly think about the game, and it seems to fall in-line with many other opinions on this subreddit.

As of release, Stellaris is indeed a barebones game. It has a solid foundation with engaging mechanics and promising replayability, but it is an unfinished game nonetheless. Many promised or hyped features were delivered as basically and judiciously as possible with the clear intent to expand upon them with DLC. There is an even smaller amount of features that out-right need to be fixed. I have no doubt that Paradox will build upon it as they did with EUIV and CKII, but I'm still disappointed that I'll have to pay in increasingly more to the DLC Bank for a ""completed game.""

I've compiled a list of features which, I believe, should find their ways into this game by the end of the year, whether through DLC or non-paywall major patches. Among them are basal gameplay concepts suit the Stellaris inclusive sci-fi trope theme, having ground in many other sci-fi universes and generic fiction devices. Some are just common-sense, Quality of Life mechanics to fix release-day broken ones. Some would just be nice to have and would increase the ethos of total customization that Paradox distilled into this game.

**QUALITY OF LIFE FIXES/OPTIONS**

* **Better Campaign Start Screen UI.** When starting a new campaign, whether singleplayer or multiplayer, show a list of empires - including players and AI - with the name of their empire, species name and portrait, ethics and government type. If AI is not a premade empire and will be randomized in-game, show a ""question mark"" symbol in lieu of the species portrait which can be clicked on to choose a pre-made empire, so that you yourself can choose the empires you pre-make for the AI and would like to appear in the game.

* **We need more campaign options.** Most glaringly, we should be able to toggle whether or not all empires know of each other at start or are hidden to each other (with an option allowing to reveal only Player Empires in a multiplayer campaign.) Also, there should be options to toggle space pirates, cultists and organic entities (amoeba/crystalline entities/void clouds). Add options to lock empires by weapon types (missiles/lasers/projectiles) and genus of species (fungoid only universe, anyone?) for customizability's sake. (I would advocate for options to lock certain government types/ethics, but that would require another UI for a little-used option.)

* **Where's the automation?** EUIV added an auto-explore button for conquistadors and explorers. Why not Stellaris? Science ships should have auto-survey and auto-research anomalies buttons. Construction ships should be allowed to automate construction within borders. This allows players who don't appreciate the micromanaging of early/early mid game to toggle that and enjoy a smoother gameplay experience.

* **Mapmodes.** Seriously. Diplomatic Relations, Technology, Fleet Capacity, Fleet Strength, Alliances and Federations, etc.

* **Fleet Templates.** Credited to jabari74

* **Growth of Slums and Planet Tile Blockers.** Migrating Forest anomalies result in the spread of planet tile blockers. On a colonized planet with lots of empty resource tiles and hungry and unemployed pops living on them should result in the growth and spread of slums, tile blockers that have a negative resource drain per tile and increase unhappiness. This should keep empires on their toes to migrate unemployed pops between worlds and keep their pops unemployed. Lazy, corrupt or inept governors would fail to check slums, resulting in more political domestic tension.

* **Core Planets should be Core Systems instead.** It makes far more sense, makes for easier organisation, and gives a better metric for delegation of systems to sectors.

* **Ethos-specific Victory Conditions.** Credited to himmelstoss1914.

* **Ledgers. Please.** Make it a toggleable option for multiplayer as well.

* **Rally Points for Ships/Embarkable Armies and Patrols.** Set patrols or fleet orders for fleets that they can repeat so that their sensors can make a designated loop through your empire and engage enemies accordingly.

* **Better auto-best feature for Ship Designer.** Ship Designing takes far, far too long in multiplayer and necessitates frequent scheduled intermissions and pauses for competitive games. Make it so that auto-best can be toggled on a scale, allowing you designate which components you want auto-upgraded in tandem with better power generators.

* **Better intelligence for Evasive mode.** Credited to Namell.

* **Upgrading buildings takes too many clicks.**

* **Corvettes are drastically overpowered.** As it stands, there is no need to build other ships save battleships for auras. An entire fleet of corvettes can take on a mixed combined-arms fleet and win handily.

* **Carnage Reports.** Credited to Lowbacca1977. Why can't we see how many ships were lost per side in a fleet action? It'd also make it a lot easier for me to keep track of how many and which ships I lost after a battle so I can rebuild more easier to maintain my fleet composition, because right now I have to search through my unit stack and count which classes of ships I'm missing through a roll call. 

**RAW GAMEPLAY CONCEPTS**

* **More Utilities and Dimension to Combat.** Right now, war is a tedious slog of cat-and-mouse until a single, massive battle decides the war. There are no frontlines or strategic systems. There are no true struggles or back-and-forths in wars, comeback-worthy moments like you would find in EUIV. War in Stellaris should be far more tactical and involve choke-points, military installations and traps. Tractor Beams/Stasis Webifiers and Warp Dampeners should be added as utility components to ships so that you can trap individual ships or prevent an entire enemy fleet from leaving the system for a time. Microwarpdrives should be added so that interceptor fleets can warp across a system and engage a fleet preparing to leave the system. Sensor Scramblers, and other forms of electronic warfare utilities should leave enemy fleets blind and add a dimension to combat besides ""whoever does most damage wins."" Defense stations should prevent enemy fleets in a designated radius from leaving the system. Right now there's nothing you can really install in a ships' utility slot that uses power besides shields, which is a damned shame.

* **Superweapons and Megaprojects.** I made a thread about this a few weeks back. Paradox should absolutely introduce planet/star-annihilating superweapons ala the Death Star or Star Killer base to shake up late-game. Building and use of these weapons should result in tremendous diplomatic relations maluses, trigger Fallen Empire activity or even an extragalactic intervention crisis. Allow an option to disable it in game start for those who don't want it.

* **Temporary Coalitions and Badboy.** As of now, the AI empires populating my galaxies do nothing to impede my totally-unchecked expansion across the galaxy. I never feel as though I have to worry about my AI neighbors banding together to stop me. Alliances are slightly too permanent in nature and the AI in-game seems to be skittish of making long-term commitments to each other. Include a coalition feature targeting specific empires which neighbors can join in to cut players or rapidly expanding AI empires/Unbidden down to size.

* **Making Use of Surplus Food.** In one of my current campaigns, my capital world has a population of 16 and produces 12 food. All of it seemingly goes to waste while I intentionally starve out a neighboring planet to see if the food from my capital world goes to the needy planet. It doesn't. Surplus food should be added as ""global resource"" (like minerals and energy) and used as a pool to be distributed amongst planets with a food deficit. This way we can designate worthy planets to be used as breadbaskets that feed the massive cosmopolitan worlds, a trope seen in the Halo universe with the planet Harvest.

* **Boarding and Capturing Ships.** Credited to Gula25. Would allow armies to participate in space combat as well, increasing their usage. Would also be interesting if you could reverse engineer captured ships as well.

* **Trade Routes, Lines of Supply and Blockades.** Why don't our planets trade with each other? Why don't in-game empires carry on trade with each other? My empires seem to be collections of largely autonomous planets all drawing from the same pool of energy and minerals. As our empire grows, expands and comes into contact with new resources, we should see trade routes form with civilian ships zipping along those galactic highways to planets. This is where my above idea with surplus food would also come into play, as surplus food would steadily find itself distributed along these routes. Outer rim planets would take a while to supply and be supplied by planets closer to the galactic core. Blockading a planet would choke it off from galactic trade routes and should cut off the flow of minerals, energy and rare resources from that planet to its owner's resource pool.

* **More resources and resource options.** Spice is a common trope in sci-fi literature, commonly being used as a hallucinogen with various other applications depending on the strain. Why stop at spice? There should be a variety of illicit goods and contraband, each with their own benefits and maluses which could be legalized or banned on an individual basis. EVE Online has a list of [illicit goods with bases in sci-fi tropes.](http://eveinfo.net/wiki/ind~6570.htm) Banning a highly demanded resource should cause the feed the growth of a black market and increase the spawn rates of pirates and smugglers. Which brings me to my next idea:

* **Smugglers and the Black Market.** The black market in a campaign should be a galaxy-wide underground consisting of non-affiliated xenos from every corner of the galaxy. Smugglers should be independent, freebooting space captains that grow and feed the demand of the galactic black market, with important figures gaining notoriety and raising bounties across the galaxy. You could crackdown on them in your own jurisdiction, or recruit from their ranks for craftier, more experienced admirals - basically, Privateers from EUIV.. Smugglers should be the guys getting your governors the Substance Abuse trait and damaging your planets' productivity. Or if you decide to harness their capability, they should be running blockades and spying on enemy empires for you. They should be recognizable figures with their own names, backstories and legends.

* **Bounty Hunters and Mercenaries.** Just as CKII has hireable mercenary companies with their own chain of command and legendary figures, Stellaris should have the same across multiple entities. Individual Bounty Hunters should begin to look for work as galactic empires come into contact with each other and xenos begin migrating between worlds. Bounty Hunters would be able to hunt other individual figures across empires - for example, you could assassinate the leader of a slave faction in your own empire to curb its growth, or you could capture a notorious smuggler that's feeding your empire's drug habit. Mercenaries would be hireable contingents of ships or armies to help boost your navy in an emergency or to supplement your forces with higher tech/better experienced ships that you don't have access to.

* **Crime and Corruption.** As colonies turn into urbanized cosmopolitan worlds, crime should result in the form of drug-running cartels, corrupt corporate schemes and miscellaneous forms of scum and villainy. Governors should have a Corruption stat that can change throughout the course of their lifetimes as they fall privy to influences from domestic elements and outside empires. Crime should be represented as a metric on a planet and can be dynamically increased with corrupt governors and event chains. Crime should decrease resource efficiency on a planet and should become an issue worth tackling through edicts, policies and gubernatorial changes.

* **The Slave Trade.** I'm not quite sure if implementing a slave trading function in Stellaris breaks Paradox's rules on facilitating ""the evils of humanity"" in gameplay, but it would be a neat function to be able to trade and sell slaves with other empires. If I had enslaved the Weak and Decadent Horvat species but wanted to trade for the finest slaves in the Very Strong, Intelligent and Industrious Sirpski species, I should be able to do so.

* **Better dynastic mechanics.** Right now, rulers and heirs mean next-to-nothing in gameplay. They're just a face to the empire with a couple of nice traits. They rule, die and elect a new ruler without any sort of effects on the empire. When your ruler dies, there is a new heir generated with no backstory behind it or ""greater goal"": There is no dynasty to uphold, no stability or peace to keep. Playing an autocracy should be a struggle to maintain power against vying domestic factions, nobles and dynasties, with unpopular heirs being eschewed for claimants. Democracies should experience upheaval due to corruption, tyrannous behavior or voter disenfranchisement. Oligarchies should try to maintain the status quo at all costs and resist encroachment by radicals on either side of the political spectrum. Essentially, every time your ruler dies, you should have to worry about what happens directly after and work to ensure a stable transition of power.

* **More religious mechanics.** Spiritualist empires should be able to designate what type of religion they devote to - whether adherent to cosmologic in nature, a traditional folk religion, or simply a transcendent view in line with achieving ""enlightenment"", it'd be up to Paradox to delineate. Those spiritualist empires should be able to proselytize and spread their faith, designating Holy planets and issuing religious mandates to followers, whether or not they're in that empire. For example, Paul Atreides in Dune declaring a galactic jihad against the Padishah Empire, resulting in the uprising of the Muad'Dib's jihad by the Fremen race and the overthrow of the Corrino dynasty.

* **Galactic Congress.** There should exist a galactic political/diplomatic apparatus aimed at joining together interested empires. Upon researching a specific higher level tech, that empire would be able to establish the congress and host it on their capital planet.  Empires who join this congress would debate on a variety of issues in a democratic format, each being given one vote, with the host nation having two. For example - a galaxy-wide ban on superweapons, deciding what resources constitute illicit goods/contraband, a ban on slavery, a forced end to an aggressive war, etc. Depending on their ethics, empires would have different interests in the congress and conflict accordingly - Spiritualist empires would like to see 'holy planets' protected and kept as a sanctuary free from mining, Materialists would argue against those measures in order to obtain resources and research. Xenophobes wouldn't be privy to the congress and would likely abstain from joining it. There's a ton of potential here that can be detailed in a different format, but that's how I would imagine it to be.

* **Fleet/Army Veterancy** As your individual ships and armies see action and prevail in combat, they should gain experience and levels of their own. Each level would slightly increase evasion rate, fire rate or weapons damage for navies and army damage/health for armies.The loss of a highly experienced fleets and armies would be even more damaging to an empire as they have to rely on lower-experienced conscripts for the duration of the war. As years go by and the crew filters out and is replaced by new blood, the experience level will slowly degrade, requiring a consistent stream of action to keep ship/regiment veterancy at top form. Empire-wide policies and edicts such as ""space academy"" or ""mandatory conscription"" could increase unit starting veterancy level or increase experience level gain rate, and traits such as ""Warrior Tradition"" could do the same for individual species. Another interesting idea is where fleets as a whole could gain levels and increase their Fleet Tradition, so that a fleet as a whole grows in veterancy by fighting in formation and utilizing tactics through multiple wars. The leveled fleet would then produce a ""Banner"" or a ""Flagship"" which would hold the Fleet Tradition level, allowing the fleet to be split or combined without losing the Tradition level.

Of course, it's important to keep in mind that Stellaris is a 4X game at its core and must be treated as such. It would be fantastic to see these ideas take form in Stellaris and deepen the universe and storytelling capability.

This however, is the final product.) 

Many people ask the question, “What do you do in No Man’s Sky?” and quite honestly, are right to ask that. In the trailers for No Man’s Sky we see our character walking through a variety of lush science-fiction environments, flying through space, looking out over beautiful scenes. “So, it’s a walking simulator then!” people assert, however this couldn’t be further from the truth. 

I’m here to answer some of the most common questions regarding No Man’s Sky and give you all the details you need to know all in one place, without having to read through all the information repositories, articles, demo videos, magazine clippings, etc. say goodbye to all of that! 

... Until the next time new information is released and I have to re-write this. 

No Man’s Sky can be described as an Open-Universe Science Fiction Sandbox, with elements from the Action, Adventure, RPG genres and more. It’s much easier to say however that it’s like being in a classic science fiction movie, or book. No Man’s Sky aims to capture exactly that, the loneliness, the mystery, the wonderment of being a frontiersman, an explorer, an adventurer. They’ve pulled inspiration from Dune, Ender’s Game, Rendezvous with Rama and more – not so much the Science Fiction we’re used to seeing on the big screens today. This is why when you look at No Man’s Sky you’re not seeing dark space, bustling space-ports, huge planetary mining operations and dull cruisers drifting through the cosmos – they’re reviving the old. 

**Alright, so you’ve described the game as a Science Fiction game, I gathered that much from seeing it, can you tell me anything about the gameplay?**

*To break down the gameplay, I’ll be breaking things into three categories so this information is easier to keep track of. These categories are essentially “classes”, if you will; Fighter (Combat), Trader (Mining, Crafting &amp; Trading) and Explorer (Discovery). Though it should be noted, there are no skill trees, class skills, etc. you can do as little or as much as you want in any particular field – and it’s likely you’ll do everything in equal distribution.* 

**So tell me about the combat then. In the trailers I watched I’ve seen little more than a gun, is your spaceship even equipped with lasers?**

*The universe is dangerous, and you’ll be getting into combat situations a lot more than any trailer would let on. Any unknown quantity could be an ever present danger. How do you defend yourself?*

*Weapons. Your weapon, or weapons, are known as “Multitools” – this tool does everything from mining, to scanning life, to being your sidearm. You can fire off lasers, launch energy grenades and a multitude of other things which are being kept hush-hush.*

*Your spaceship is also equipped with weapons, and these will be different depending on your ship class. Traders specialise in heavy-weaponry for instance. Using lasers you can disperse enemy energy shields, or tear through enemy armour with heavy weapons.*

**So what will I be protecting myself from, or what will I be killing?**

*You’ll be defending yourself from all manner of hostile life - animals, aliens, enemy ships and Sentinels. Across any number of planets you may be being stalked by a vicious predator, you may walk uninvited into an alien’s residence or find yourself attacked by pirates out to steal your cargo.*

*However, No Man’s Sky is a game that lets you play how you want to play – you could be an aggressor, you could be peaceful, and this could lead you up different paths. You may choose to kill an animal to save your hide, or perhaps you’ll take pity and fire off a stray bullet in the hopes of scaring it whilst you run for cover. You may choose to instead interact with an alien you find and talk to it, rather than instigating a fight. You may choose to cloak your ship when presented with pirates, and warp from the star system leaving them in your dust, instead of unleashing your arsenal on them.*

*The choice is entirely up to you.*

**I can’t help but notice you didn’t mention “Sentinels”, whatever those are – care to expand?**

*Sentinels are the robotic protectors of the universe, their mission is to uphold the prime directive; don’t interfere. They’re self-replicating and ruthless, they’re very eager to do their job.*

*You’ll find these Sentinels across the universe, on some planets they may be scarce, others will have a large force of Sentinels and others will be empty. Responses from the Sentinels for your transgressions will vary planet to planet, so be careful how you tread.*

*Sentinels will be drawn to you when you break the delicate balance of life, as you destroy the environments of a planet, either through wanton destruction, mining for resources or killing the local fauna, Sentinels will be alerted. Your first “wanted star” will bring about a response from Sentinel Drones, these drones are the first line of attack, and they can gather in their swarms as your wanted level rises. Sentinel Walkers are up next, these giant two-legged robots are likely to quickly dispatch any unprepared troublemaker. Other known types of Sentinels walk on 4-legs, and appear to walk as organised units, we’re not fully aware of the capabilities, or even all the types of Sentinels.*

*They’re also in space – there’s no escaping from the long arm of the law. Sentinel Interceptors are there to punish your spatial transgressions, attacking harmless ships, or attacking the star systems Space Station will bring about a response from Sentinel Interceptors.*

*It’s worthwhile to note though that Sentinels distinguish between self-defence and a true act of violence, this can allow you to avoid run-ins with the Sentinels whilst still protecting yourself.*

**Something big about this game is “Procedural Generation” from what I hear, so why do we know so much about Sentinels?**

*Sentinels are a fixed factor, they’re the same throughout the universe. This is because they have a lore woven into the story behind No Man’s Sky – it’s up to us to find out what these Sentinels are all about. It also helps to have a familiar enemy, one you can strategise against and learn how to fight – a self-replicating army of robots is bad enough, a self-replicating army of robots which are always different is like something out of an apocalypse film!*

**So, as a player who wants to focus on combat, I would be upgrading my weapon components, gathering new weapons, upgrading my ship and upgrading its weapons, to instigate fights with, or defend myself from animals, aliens, ships and Sentinels. How do I upgrade my weapons, how do you make money by playing a gun-toting space cowboy?**

*You would be upgrading your weapons by finding blueprints, you can find these on planets, whether that be in ruins, caves, underwater, behind the refrigerator... Just keep an eye out!*

*You can purchase them at trade stations, space stations, alien races which you’ve aligned with may gift you blueprints, or ones which weren’t so lucky may have their blueprints taken from them by force.* 

*Blueprints are what you use to learn crafting recipes essentially, these can lead you to better upgrades for your weapon, ship, suit, etc. and it’s important to gather a lot.*

*As for making money, if you’re going the route of a combatant, there’s no money to be had in killing animals – they yield you with no reward, only punishment. Unless that punishment is what you’re aiming for. Sentinels drop rare resources, and selling these could net you a pretty penny... Should you escape with your life.*

*Aligning yourself with military races, or more combat focused races, can net you cash as you complete missions for them – and it could also net you the support of these races as combat back-up.*

*Being a Good Samaritan and taking out pirate ships is also an option, destroying ships will cause them to drop their cargo – this applies in reverse, you could be a pirate and attack traders, just beware, these ships aren’t always defenceless. Their backs may be being covered by a huge freight ship, or even fleets of these ships, always be prepared.*

*You could always sit back and watch the chaos unfold, swooping in to scavenge loot from the battles of other ships. Just beware the pirates don’t turn on you.*

*It’s important to keep on top of the upgrades that are important for your survival in combat, slacking on your stopping power, or your armour, could cost you your life.*

**Cool, so there’s plenty of ways to make money just by being a space pirate, but you keep mentioning death, what happens when I die?**

*In No Man’s Sky when you die on the ground you’ll lose all the resources you were carrying, you won’t lose your weapon, suit, etc. but your spoils of war will be lost and you’ll respawn beside your ship. It’s important not to carry too much on your person, make regular trips back to your ship so you can unload cargo, and be sure to sell or use your valuable resources.*

*This is because in space the consequences of death are far more severe. When you die in space you’ll lose your ship, so not only is your cargo lost – so is your pride and joy. However, don’t be too disheartened, you’ll respawn at the star systems space station with the most basic of ships to get you going again.*

*You can tell when you’re flying a seasoned spaceship, because you’ll start to see rust, scratches, paint chipping – symbols of former victory, or close calls.*

**So tell me about trading resources then, what are the motions?**

*As someone in the business of trading resources, you’ll be looking to scan your environment on planets for resources using your multitool and seeking out rare resources. Everything around you is a resource, rocks, trees, etc. though you’re only likely to pick up basic resources from the plants you harvest, or rocks you dig into. You’ll be exploring, perhaps up mountains or in caves, on the lookout for the rarest resources the planet can offer.*

*It’s worth noting that all planets do not have the same resources, and the resources you can find on a planet will be determined by a number of factors. It could be based on the type of star the system has, how close or how far to the star the planet it, the environment on that planet, etc. and so some rare resources you may only find once in a blue moon – luckily, there’s lots of blue moons to be found out there.*

*Resources could potentially show up as points of interest which your scanner picks up, or they can be marked as grid-boxes upon rocky outcroppings for instance. Once you’ve come across a resource, you can mine it with your multitool, using a mining laser, or you could blast through the rock with explosive weapons.*

*Some resources will require a more powerful tool to be mined though, and some resources might require a more powerful tool to be able to detect them. Just like a Fighter would seek to upgrade their weapons stopping power to take out more powerful animals, or Sentinels, a Trader will have to upgrade their multitool to mine tougher rock.* 

*Keep in mind though that rocks aren’t the only thing you’ll be mining, crystals and other natural growths could be resource-spots too.*

*Once you’ve grabbed your resources, it’s time to pack up and go, once you’ve fought off or evaded any encroaching Sentinels, and it’s off to the space station to sell your hard earned cache. Now it’s time to learn about the economy, the joy.*

**Pretty sure I’ve got this down-pat, you sell your items, you get money, you move on. Right?**

*Not quite, you trade your resources for money, that’s true, but there’s more to it than that. A resource that’s common in one system might be rare in another, a resource that’s rare in one system might be non-existent in another, and prices change to reflect that. That truckload of rare metal you’re hauling might be worth a few hundred units in the nearby space station, but it could be worth so much more in another system.*

*To make the most of your money and time, you’ll be planning trade routes, picking up resources in one system and selling them in another – this makes you more of a target for pirates, certainly, but you’ll have to weight risk against reward.*

*You’ll find that NPC ships also travel along trade routes, you could potentially be finding great mining spots and selling points by following alien traders.*

*There’s some ways you can tell whether an area is rich in a certain resource though, the star in the system you’re in could give you some hints as to the kind of resources you could find, or maybe a resource is more prevalent in a certain area of space, which you’ll notice is a more prominent colour than another area of space. This association of star-types, and areas of space will make it easier for you to guess where you’ll find the resources you’re looking for.*

**You keep mentioning NPCs and alien races, so I can assume I’ll be encountering alien races during my travels, what does this offer me?**

*NPCs, or alien races, are present both in space and on the ground, races have their own inclination if you will, be that military, scientific, etc. and depending on how you play the game, these races could be worthwhile allies, or enemies. A peaceful race may be predisposed to dislike you based on your heartless actions, or an aggressive military race might be keen on allying with you if you share similar goals.*

*Each type of race will offer something benefiting you, whether that be combat allies, new weapons, a trading alliance, etc. provided you build a strong relationship with them. You do this by interacting with the races through dialogue, how do you do this? You need to learn alien languages – though, you could always fumble your way through, guessing which tangle of letters is the right dialogue choice in the tree and hope you’ve not just called that alien’s mother a yellow-bellied space slug.*

*You can learn these languages through interactions with alien races, attempts at conversation could yield knowledge of new words which will then show up in English in your dialogue with the alien. You can also find alien monoliths, or other alien features throughout the universe which will teach you words, or snippets of alien language. Having knowledge of a few words before speaking to an alien race could mean the difference between being handed a shiny new gun, or having a shiny new gun pointed at your face.*

*You could always forgo pleasantries and just blow the doors to the alien’s homestead wide open and steal the blueprints or items they would’ve given you – just be prepared to make a fast escape after the Sentinels have been alerted. If you’ve got the resources and the blueprints, perhaps you’ll be able to craft a device you can use to hi-jack the alien’s ship – just to add insult to injury.*

**This is sounding a lot different to what I’ve seen in trailers, I thought this was just a game about exploration?**

*There’s plenty to be explored too, after all, that’s what they were hoping to capture. From familiar Earth-like scenery to mushroom forests, floating islands, crystalline canyons and more, there’s a variety of Science Fiction environments created through procedural generation to explore.*

**Procedural generation is something I’m worried about, how do you make every world interesting if it’s generated procedurally?**

*When people think of procedurally generation, the term “random” always comes to mind, however procedural generation follows procedures, or rules, hence the name.*

*An easy way to think about this is to imagine it like a game of football, you’ve got several players, you’ve got goals, you’ve got fans, the pitch, etc. and this is your stage. The players scoring goals, tackling other players, passing the ball, etc. are done so in line with the rules of the game, for instance, you can’t just pick the ball up with your hands, that’s against the rules. Each game of football however is not the same, you can score different numbers of goals, a certain number of passes will be made, certain players will not score, and the paths they take to the goal will be different each time.*

*Now, the football pitch is built in an area of the city where a lot of fans can reach, if it were outside the city however, you’d likely not see as many fans coming to the games. Relating this back to No Man’s Sky, in a star system the planets are placed procedurally – too close to the sun, it’s likely they’ll be hot, have certain resources, certain weather conditions, too far, they’ll be cold, have different resources, frozen water, etc. and in the habitable zone they’ll have life, rare resources, a nice temperature, etc.*

*The football pitch is your planet and in it you’ve got fans, each game you play, the fans will be sitting in different positions, there will be different people depending on the teams playing, etc. this is your terrain if you will, it could be mountainous, have large oceans, it could be craggy, flat, have large open plains, etc. they could be all different shapes, sizes, colours, have different resources, etc. just likes fans will be wearing different kits for different seasons.*

*The grass the players are playing on is the next layer, the biome of the planet, just like a pitch is dry when its sunny, wet when it’s rainy, etc. a planet can be of varying temperatures or conditions, and this influences the biome of the planet, is it lush, is it damp and swampy, are there rain forests, deserts, etc.* 

*The players are your animals, each player has different skills, but they’ve been brought in because they work well with the team. Animals have an ecosystem, just like players operate as a team, animals correlate with each other, a prey animal on a swamp planet will perhaps have evolved webbed feet for swiftly swimming away from a predator, but to compliment that, the predator will have dappled fur to sneak up on its prey through the shrubbery. They won’t have features that don’t make sense – seeing a bright red animal in a dull green environment is like turning up to a football game wearing the hand-knit sweater your grandma made you for Christmas – it doesn’t make sense, and it’s against the rules.*

*The rules of the game dictate how the world works, things make sense, ecosystems are cohesive, and environments are structured as if hand designed, because they make sense within the rules crafted. These rule-sets can be as finely tuned as you please, meaning you can make it so there’s no random scattering of trees for instance, you can have trees grouped together in a forest, you can have plants grouped around the base of the trees, you can have rocks edged with taller grass, bare ground where there’s too much shade, less plants where there is less water, etc. and as you add in these rules you create environments that look more and more handcrafted.*

**That sounds nice, at least I know I won’t be walking around seeing odd things, but isn’t that a bit limiting, and also, that doesn’t really allay my doubts that everything isn’t just a few variations on a few biomes, or something like that, care to tell me more?**

*Think of it like this, we’ve got football pitches all over the world, and some are stadiums, some are just lines drawn on the ground, some are on concrete, there’s one at your local school in the playground, there’s football pitches everywhere from Amsterdam to Zimbabwe and whilst you’re playing the same game at each one, the fans are different, the pitch is different, the environment are different, the language is different, etc. No Man’s Sky can be just as varied in environments through procedural generation, there’s not “three planet types, and our system moves the trees around, etc.”, it’s not like a roguelike where the dungeons are all the same, but the order of the rooms is different. Everything is mold-able.*

*The same applies to the creatures, ships, plants, etc. the base models are just vague slates blobs with legs, or just a stem, but they can be fed into this system, interacting with each rule before they end up as an animal or plant in an environment that suits them.*

*To use creatures as an example, let’s say we’ve got a 4-legged blob and we’re looking to make him a large herbivore which will graze on trees in a hot environment.*

*This blob could be anything from a foot long, to hundreds of feet long, it doesn’t just have to have four legs, and it doesn’t even need to have the same proportions. As height changes, weight can change, the proportions the animal has can change, as this changes the animations can change, the bones can get bigger, thicker, and the voice can get deeper, etc. What is the environment like? What kind of creature is it? Where is it in the food chain? What will it prey on, what will prey on it? How will it interact with other creatures? As this blob is fed through the system you’re creating an animal that will make sense in the end, which even has behaviours, a male and female of the species, and variation among the species, for instance one might be a bit taller, have longer horns, etc.*

*Suddenly, you’ve gone from this little 4-legged blob to a huge towering dinosaur, grazing on the tops of trees, it’s huge, it walks slowly, crushing trees as it walks, it lets out a dull roar, in its mouth are teeth designed to chew leaves, small animals run in fear as the creature pays them no heed, it sees another member of its species ahead and it lets out a territorial call, while you the player cautiously approach. The same 4-legged blob however could be a little gazelle, grazing on the grass, springing along on hooves, it sees this huge dinosaur and it scampers off over a hill alongside its herd.*

*You know what they say about rules though – rules are made to be broken. By breaking certain rules, No Man’s Sky will make things more alien, or create unusual occurrences. As you journey closer to the centre of the galaxy, the game gets more unfamiliar and more difficult.*

*It won’t be uncommon to be left wondering just what the hell you’re looking at – there’s a lot of things that No Man’s Sky can produce that even the developers can’t conceive of, they’ve stated that they’re surprised every day by unusual occurrences.*

*They’ve also stated that things have been both toned down, and limited for the trailers and demos, in order to provide a cohesive and sensible trailer and demo with no interrupting factors. For instance, in some trailers predators don’t attack the player, this was made so that nice shots could be got of all creatures – without it, the original trailer would just be the shark you see in the beginning eating the player’s face off.*

*This should give some hope as to the variety we can experience.*

**Alright, that sounds neat, I’m not so worried any more about bumping into variations on the same thing. Sorry for interrupting earlier, can you tell me about exploring?**

*An explorer will be the kind of player who makes discoveries, they’ll be looking to catalogue star systems, planets, creatures, plants, landmarks, and plaster their name throughout the universe as the first to discover something.*

**Alright, so how does that differ from just scanning creatures as I go on a mining expedition, or just naming planets as I go, what makes an explorer any better than me?**

*It all comes back to how you upgrade your ship and tools, as well as what class of ship you choose to fly. Explorers seek to have powerful scanners and ludicrous warp-drives.*

*Everything is a trade-off, specialising in one thing means you’re not focusing on another, and a trader with a powerful mining tool, or a fighter with a fearsome laser won’t have the latest in high-tech scanning equipment.*

*What makes a scanner so important? A more powerful scanner can give you the ability to scan better things, find that you can’t scan a creature? Perhaps it’s too big for your scanner to recognise, perhaps your scanner won’t work in the dark, or underwater, etc.*

*Upgrading your scanning capabilities also provides you with a greater range, and greater scope of your environment, you’ll pick up on resources that a weaker scanner, or the untrained eye cannot see, and also at a greater distance. This will speed up your personal treasuring hunting.*

*Scanners also reveal “Points of Interest” on a planet, these could be resources, buildings, landmarks, etc. and traveling towards points of interest instead of traveling aimlessly can net you nice rewards and be a better use of your time. Want to mark your own points of interest? You can do so with your binoculars, point and mark.*

*Your ship also has a scanner, a powerful scanner on your ship can reveal points of interest across a whole planet, or out in space.*

*Explorer ships will have a powerful warp driving, allowing you to jump from system to system faster than any other, and further too. This will allow you to find planets with life on them faster for instance, for not every planet has life – it’s relatively rare at a ratio of 1:10, and some of the more off-the-hook planets teeming with life could be 1:100.*

*Scanning creatures and uploading them to the Atlas at beacons found in space stations and on planets however will net you money, and rare animals will net you even more – but try not to get too side-tracked, dying also means you’ll lose information you’ve not uploaded. This means you’ll have to go out and find those animals again.* 

*Explorers will likely spend a whole lot of time getting lost, losing track of time, and what-not. You have a compass, but no map – after all, you’re exploring worlds unfamiliar to you. Points of interest, and points you’ve marked will show up on your compass, and you can use this to navigate. Remember the paths you take, otherwise you could be in trouble.*

**What makes being lost so dangerous?**

*Being caught out in a forest as the day turns to night, with no idea where your ship is and no idea which way you’ve came makes you a prime target to run into the jaws of a nocturnal predator – everything is more dangerous at night. Temperatures drop, you lose your ability to find your way, and you’re reliant on the light of your torch. Maybe it’s best to find a cave and settle in, wait out the night.*

*Then you realise, the planet is really hurtling through space, the space station, or other planets you saw in the sky are no longer visible from your side of the planet, you’ve lost your spatial bearings and you’re going to need to collect your things and plot a new course.*

**So, you’ve mentioned upgrades and what-not, is there a way to make things any easier for me, or will I always be out of my depth?**

*Crafting upgrades for your weapon is just the tip of the iceberg, your suit will have to be upgraded too. Searing heat, bitter cold, radioactive hellholes, all are survivable for a while, but you’ll need to upgrade your suit to protect yourself from not only enemies, but the elements.*

*You can sprint, jump, swim and fly about with your jetpack, but you’ll need to upgrade your suit to run faster, jump higher, dive deeper, fly further, etc. maybe these upgrades will make escaping enemies easier, or fighting enemies easier, give you access to new areas, or help you speed up your travels.*

*Crafting isn’t limited to upgrades however, there are tools you can create, we know of things like flashlights and hacking devices, but so far these tools have been unexplored. You can also combine resources, for use in crafting recipes or to sell them for greater amounts of money. Crafting the latest upgrades and tools you’ve found the blueprints for is how you stay ahead of the curve.*

**So how do I go about exploring space?**

*In space you’ve got three modes of transport, your normal drive, your jump-drive and your warp-drive. Your normal drive requires no fuel, and you and your ship will fly along at controllable speeds – fast, but not too fast.*

*Your jump drive is what you’ll use to cross large distances quickly, this requires fuel, but can take you from planet to planet within minutes if not seconds. You could always make these trips manually, but some distances within star systems could be dozens of minutes, if not hours potentially.*

*Finally, you’ve got warp-drive, this is what allows you to travel from solar system to solar system on the galactic map. Using your warp fuel you’ll warp to systems almost instantaneously, though, if you’re up for the challenge or want to be overly-frugal, you can point your ship in the direction of a star and engage your normal or jump drive – just be prepared to be slightly off course, and of course, take a ludicrously long time to reach the star.*

*Space is completely open, and you can fly between systems without warp-drive, this will allow you to come across things floating in the void of space, out with any star systems. We’ve not been told what is out there, only that there’s things there.*

**So all planets exist at the same time then? That must be an impossible to maintain server.**

*Not really, as it’s procedural, a planet or system only exists when you’re there, and the furthest things you can view are there only at the lowest level of detail. The stars you see are real stars, and the planets real planets, but they’re not taking up much space. If you can’t see anything at all, it’s not even generated.* 

*Think of it like generating the world in Minecraft, as you walk, you generate more of the world – and things get pretty taxing after a while, because Minecraft is saving a lot of this information.*

*No Man’s Sky however throws this information in the trash when it’s not needed – the planet is simply regenerated from the same seed, if you will, when you return.* 

*How does it handle your information? Anything you do is saved forever to your machine, that bird you killed, that terrain you destroyed, that blueprint you found, etc. but for everyone else, that planet is as untouched as the day you found it.*

**So how does the game handle two players being in the same area?**

*When you and another player are in the same area, unlikely as it is given the scale of a universe, with planets that can be the size of Earth or bigger, you’ll be placed in the same lobby – in this lobby data is shared. The terrain one player blows up is visible on the other players machine, and so on and so forth.*

**Sounds sweet, so my friend can see all the lewd things I’ve drawn in the sand? Nice.**

*Yes, but don’t expect much more than that. No Man’s Sky at its heart is a single player experience, it’s just set in a multiplayer universe. You can find your friends, but there’s no interaction to be had, no trading, no messaging system, etc. you can kill them if you’d like – but that wouldn’t accomplish much if you’re after a co-operative experience.*

*However, don’t give up hope – the developers at Hello Games have expressed interest in some basic multiplayer features, if enough people want it, and the game sells well enough to warrant continued development, we may see a co-operative multiplayer with a bit more depth. Another one of these wishes is ground vehicles, but currently, you’ll be scampering around on your own two legs.* 

*You can be sure that if this is a hit, the developers will be continuing to support it, they’ve expressed this several times in interviews.*

**What is my overarching goal? Does the game have a narrative?**

*There’s no real narrative to No Man’s Sky, there’s a lore behind the universe, but otherwise you’re creating your own story. Fixed factors such as the Atlas, the Sentinels, etc. are all woven into a cohesive lore – but it’s up to you to connect the dots.*

*As for a goal, aside from setting personal goals your main objective is to reach the centre of the galaxy. Each player starts on the edge of the same galaxy, and makes their way towards the centre, should they please – as you reach the centre, the game gets more difficult, and things get more alien, this should create a natural tendency for players to move toward the centre as it gets more rewarding. Better resources, items, more challenge, etc.*

*We don’t know what is at the centre, and all we know is that it will give you some closure to the game, so you can say – “I’ve beat No Man’s Sky”, but there’s even more for you to do, and a whole universe to explore once we’re free of that first galaxy.*

**So, what is this game coming to?**

*This game is coming to PS4 &amp; PC June 21st (US), and later in other regions, with the UK receiving the game last on June 24th. The PC minimum specifications are listed on the Steam store page, where you can also place pre-orders for the game.*

*There will be both digital and physical releases, and also collector’s editions, featuring things such as an art-book, a replica ship, and much more, depending on the version.* 

*The hope is that the game will run at 60FPS on PS4, providing a smooth experience. There’s also some confirmation that come the release of the Playstation VR, this game will be compatible – Hello Games have never confirmed nor denied, but stores which have run pre-orders for Playstation VR have given a list of compatible games – with No Man’s Sky appearing on that list.* 

*Take this with a grain of salt however, nothing about the PS4 version technical specifications or VR has been confirmed.*

**Where can I keep up to date with all the latest news?**

*The No Man’s Sky sub-reddit (r/NoMansSkyTheGame) is a good place to start, we’re all posting the latest articles, interviews and videos. We’ve also got a handy information repository in the side-bar.*

*Following gaming outlets such as Game Informer, or IGN is also a good way to keep up to date on No Man’s Sky, the big outlets always have a place for No Man’s Sky.* 

*Following the official No Man’s Sky twitter, maintained by Sean Murray is a way to keep up with some of the big news, interviews he’s done, or new demos, or just for his No Man’s Sky related tweets such as, “I’ve just been told from our artists that blue skies are now bluer”.*

*The official website is infrequently updated, however, provides news regarding all the biggest events, and even some things which don’t make it into articles, such as the inspiration behind No Man’s Sky.*

That’s all I have to say on “What you need to know”, but there’s more information that doesn’t really fit anywhere in this body of work. Which is why I’ve created “The No Man’s Sky B-Side”, for all the information, or questions, I can’t really tie into the above work.
_________________________________________________________

That brings me to the end of my No Man’s Sky memoirs, 7’000 words or so later (including the B-Side), I hope you enjoyed the read, and that it gave you a real understanding of the game. 

If someone has any suggested additions let me know. After all, I’m only human and there’s probably some No Man’s Sky information I’m missing floating about somewhere. However, keep in mind that this post is huge – I have no space. It would just be put in the B-Side comment that people could refer to.

I’m currently at work on a highly condensed version of this with images, but I have to focus on my university coursework first – this image-based version of “What do you do in No Man’s Sky?” will likely not be done until next month, though, it won’t have any different information than this – it’s purely for the sake of convenience. 

Until the next time, safe travels explorers.

15\. **Ancillary Justice** *by Ann Leckie*  
This Hugo Award winning novel tells the story of a soldier named Breq, who was was once the consciousness of a massive starship linked to hundreds and thousands of soldiers in the service of a vast interstellar empire. Now trapped into a single human body through, Breq is drawn into a vast conspiracy spanning the stars while she seeks revenge against those who destroyed her other selves.

14\. **Starship Troopers** *by Robert A. Heinlein*  
Probably legendary writer Robert A. Heinlein’s most well-known work, Starship Troopers is a military sci-fi novel that’s actually pretty light on the action (unlike the movie). Focusing on the life of Juan “Johnnie” Rico and his career in the Mobile Infantry, the novel discusses the philosophy of war and civic virtue with an galaxy-wide war between humanity and an arachnoid species as the backdrop.

13\. **Neuromancer** *by William Gibson*  
One of the earliest books in the cyberpunk genre of science fiction, Neuromancer is the story of Henry Case, a drug-addicted, down-on-his luck computer hacker hired to pull off the ultimate digital heist in a dystopian future.

12\. **John Dies at the End** *by David Wong*  
More of a sci-fi horror comedy, this novel stars John and Dave, two friends who end up getting drawn into the weird, wacky, and downright horrifying paranormal craziness of their unnamed midwestern town. You’ll never look at soy sauce the same way again after this one.

11\. **War of the Worlds** *by H. G. Wells*  
One of the oldest (and probably most well known) alien invasion stories of all time, War of the Worlds depicts the fall of London under the onslaught of Martian war machines, and the collapse of civilization as humanity struggles to repel the invaders.

10\. **Eisenhorn** *by Dan Abnett*  
Now you’re probably wondering, “Why is a book based off the Warhammer 40,000 board game on this list?” and I’ll tell you - because this trilogy by Dan Abnett is really, really good. Far from your typical 40k book (most of them seem to center on space marines shooting and stabbing stuff), Eisenhorn focuses on the secret espionage and political intrigue of the Imperium, and follows the rise and downfall of an imperial agent as he tries to root out treachery and evil within the Imperium’s ranks.

9\. **Blindsight** *by Peter Watts*  
One of my personal favorites, Blindsight is a unique take on how humanity would make first contact with an alien life form. In the post-singularity future, a team of transhuman specialists are sent to investigate an unknown radio signal in the outskirts of our solar system, and encounter an extraterrestrial life form of terrifying intelligence. This novel delves deep into what it means to have free will, game theory and evolution, and is a great read for anyone who appreciates science fiction that forgos laser pistols and warp drives for hard science.

8\. **Ender’s Game** *by Orson Scott Card*  
This classic sci-fi novel presents a grim future where humanity has been dragged into a war with an insectoid species apparently bent on our annihilation. A group of childen, including the story's protaganist Ender Wiggen, are drafted into the elite Battle School in the hopes of preparing them to defend against an invasion by a numerous, powerful foe.

7\. **Dune** *by Frank Herbert*  
No best science fiction list is ever complete without mention of Frank Herbet's grand epic. A huge cast of characters, intergalactic political intrigue, giant sandworms - there's a lot going on and it's all a great read.

6\. **Redshirts: A Novel With Three Codas** *by John Scalzi*  
A tounge-in-cheek look at the infamous ""redshirt"" trope of the original Star Trek series, Redshirts follows Ensign Andrew Dahl as he tries to stay alive while accompanying the starship Intrepid's bridge crew on increasingly more dangerous away missions to alien worlds.

5\. **The Hyperion Cantos** *by Dan Simmons*  
Hyperion (and its sequel The Fall of Hyperion) tells the stories of a strange group of travelers who have been sent on a pilgrimage to the planet Hyperion, home to the mysterious Shrike - a violent creature that appears to be unbound by time.

4\. **The Forever War** *by Joe Haldeman*  
This award-winning military sci-fi novel details the life of William Mandella, who is drafted to fight against an enemy known as the Taurans. Unfortunately, due to the relativistic effects of space travel, Mandella finds himself aging only a few scant years compared to the decades and centuries passing on Earth, and having to deal with the extreme cultural shifts and technological advances made by both humanity and its alien foes.

3\. **Seveneves** *by Neal Stephenson*  
An extensive examination of what humanity's future may be like among the stars, Seveneves begins with the destruction of Earth's moon, followed by humanity's attempt to evacuate into space and then flash forwards thousands of years later to the struggles of a genetically engineering humanity as it attempts to recolonize a newly terraformed Earth.

2\. **Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?** *by Philip K. Dick*  
Most famously known as the novel inspiring the classic film Blade Runner, this novel by Phillip K. Dick explores what it means to be human as it follows the story of a bounty hunter on a mission to eliminate a group of rogue androids in a post-apocalyptic future.

1\. **Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy** *by Douglas Adams*  
Seriously, if you haven't read Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, stop what you're doing right now and go pick it up. A fantastic, comedic read about a poor hapless human named Arthur Dent as he traverses the odd corners of the universe with alien explorer Ford Prefect, this novel is just a flat-out entertaining read and a must-have for any sci-fi fan.",books,3653

""Hey Pepe, do you smell what I smell. Ees bacon, I theenk.""

  

""Si, Luis, eet sure smells like bacon.""

&gt;I don't know man it's just... I did university and got a job and now... This is it? Right? It just happened very quickly...

At age 30 scrolling through facebook I see father after father sat on their sofas playing Call of Duty or some other videogame with their 4 year old Son with all the typical comment trains running underneath...

Where was their rite of passage? What trial or ordeal did they have to endure to begin to raise a family? Nothing. Nothing at all.

What are they going to tell their grandchildren when they are old?

&gt;I used to be good at cod and drinking beer.

Great story.

There is a oft quoted passage in Fight Club - you've all heard it.

&gt;“We’re the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War’s a spiritual war… our Great Depression is our lives. We’ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we’d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won’t. And we’re slowly learning that fact. And we’re very, very pissed off.”

It's true, there is no purpose for men in these days except the ones we make for ourselves and between the television telling us what to think and chasing women we have no space or time to address this most important of issues - generationally we're not very pissed off about having no cause, we're wholly apathetic instead.

Since swallowing the pill you've started to lift weights, dress better and approach women, you're concentrating on your career and have learned how to say no. The truth is:

* *You should have always been in shape*

* *You should always have been well dressed and care about your appearance*

* *You should have always been able to speak to the blonde in the coffee shop*

Our generation feel they should be rewarded for just for tidying their room or leaving the house, turning off the video games or going for a walk... Achievement unlocked - go back to sleep.

The discordance I saw inside my friend was ""Eating the bread of shame"", he was  just a taller, fatter version of himself at 9 years old with all the supposed luxury and privilege of a settled life. He had no rites of passage, no trial by ordeal, no cause greater than himself and professionally sat at a place earning a pension that looks increasingly like it won't matter by the time he comes to claim it.

We were warriors by birth, years of brutal exertion, bravery and commitment was the price of  feeling entitled to old age in front of the fire and getting fat. Now we are a generation of spiritually and physically fat and old men at age 20 wondering what this nagging feeling at the back of our collective heads is.

You haven't done anything. We haven't done anything. Short of military service or a committed effort to travelling what could you tell your grandchildren that they'd care for? What have you done to deserve being a family elder, someone to listen to, what have you seen or done that was in anyway remarkable?

I ask myself this as much as the community here and find myself lacking. I've never walked a great Dune in the Sahara, climbed a glacial ice wall, been in a bar fight in Dublin or done a line of cocaine off a Tokyo model, chased by a bear or been genuinely fearful for my life.

What will I tell my grandchildren? I lifted weights day to day and earned money, I partied and fucked girls? I was a wealthy ladies man? Is that it? By my own standards I don't deserve to raise children and settle down if that's my story to date.

What will you tell your grandchildren - what will you have done?",TheRedPill,1048

I saw the same books recommended over and over, and I was like: 'wow, they must be really good, and look at the number of people who have read them'.
As an Italian, 90% of those titles were obscure to me (To Kill A Mockingbird, ~~Dune~~, and so on. Never heard of them). 

Only later I saw that these books were assigned in schools, so naturally they are more popular.

Now, my question is: do you think that these books are really that great, or they end up overshadowing better and lesser known books? If so, can you tell me where to find a list of 'school books' so I can rule them out when I look for a book?

^1 I full disclosure these are mine.",books,1217
joseph4th,2014-07-25 21:27:39+00:00,I am Game Designer Joseph Hewitt. I've been in the industry since 1985 including 14 years at Westwood Studios. ASK ME ANYTHING!,"Not so short history (or as James from Auran Games would say, “Joseph story time”: 

I want to begin by saying that when I started there weren't a lot of dedicated game designers. There were programmers and artists and they were the ones who did the design. Even then the artist was still pretty new to the team; not long before there was just the programmer who did his own art as well.

My story starts in the mid-80’s when my mother enrolled me in an after school tutoring place called the Computer Learning Center for Children and later renamed Computer Tutors. They also made educational games as Unicorn Software. I started working for them in 1985 as both a Artist and Designer while also tutoring kids. The very first game I did was Animal Kingdom on the Commodore 64 for which I was paid with a C64 Koala Drawing Tablet worth about $60.  I still have it.

Brett Sperry, who founded Westwood Associates with Louis Castle and which later became Westwood Studios, had worked for Unicorn Software for a short while and hired me because he felt sorry for me. I was at Westwood for 14 years right up until EA started laying people off.  I pretty much had my fingers in the art or design of all but 2 or 3 games they produced by Westwood.  

I had originally been inspired very early on by a making-of bit about The Last Starfighter where they were showing how computers had rendered a lot of the space ship scenes. I thought that 3D stuff was cool and I wanted to do that for a living. As it turns out I was pretty much the only old school Westwood artist who never got to do 3D stuff.  I was really good at the technical stuff that other artist weren't good at. While everybody was learning 3D Studio and doing stuff that would eventually become Command &amp; Conquer, I was working on The Lion King taking pictures and crunching them down into 8x8 character graphics where lots of tiles were cleverly repeated when rebuilding the entire picture in as few characters as possible. When I came off of the Lion King I was supposed to take some time and just learn 3D Studio. However, I was looking at some art for Command &amp; Conquer on the network drive and I kept seeing things like the buildings and vehicles done once in GDI Tan and then again in Nod Red. I asked the lead programmer about it knowing they couldn’t use two sets of the same tank especially if we wanted to have other colors in multi-player. He said he had no idea, he kept bringing it up but nothing was being done. So I started in on the C&amp;C artwork, taking all the buildings and vehicles, cutting out the parts that were going to be remapped and forcing them into a palette where one row of colors could be swapped out so that each asset could be remapped to every side. Then I started messing with the terrain sets. As my artists were coming off Lion King I just started assigning them artwork. And that is how I started working on C&amp;C. This also lead to how the Dinosaur missions wound up being created, but that is another story.

After Westwood I went to Sony Online as a Customer Service Representative for Star Wars Galaxies at launch while trying to get on as an Everquest designer.  All the other CS teams were ending their CS chats with “May the force be with you,” I got my team to say, “May the might of the empire watch over you.” When it was clear that the Everquest thing wasn’t happening I left.

I've bounce around a bit since then spent 5 years in Australia working for Auran Games and Interzone Games as Creative Director. I came back to Vegas in 2009 and joined Brett’s new company Jet Set Games as a designer and then Creative Director.  

Two of favorite games that I've worked on were one: Highborn on the iOS or Android via the Amazon App Store.  It’s pretty light and easy as far as turn-based strategy games are concerned, but the real reason you’ll play it is for the story which is hilarious, chapter 2 and 3 much more so than the first because I really started just doing whatever I felt like. Even Ron Gilbert tweeted that he liked it. (I have a framed print out of his tweet around here somewhere)  I don’t have any connection to Jet Set anymore and I won’t make any money off it, I just think you’ll really enjoy it. I had nothing to do with the version on Steam and don’t know what was changed.

My second favorite would be Eye of the Behold where I did the Drow levels. I was also really proud of the portal opening animation which was only a few frames just played in a creative order so it looked like the charge builds up and then opens up.

The think I am least proud of (read as: get yelled out the most for) is the puzzle at the end of the BattleTech: The Crescent Hawk's Inception where you had to collect the colored keys to open the doors and then solve the map puzzle to get the white code and finish the game.  When given this task I was told to do something to extend the game a bit. I was very new at all this and even wanted to have security robots released somewhere in the maze when you entered a wrong code. The map puzzle was not fully my idea as it was something they wanted as copy protection. The correct planets you had to highlight were circled in a map in the manual though it was never made clear to the player that is where the answer lay. Being before the internet, a lot of people really got stuck and never finished the game. Sorry.

I am currently what is technically called an “out of work game designer” as I am in the midst of looking for a new position.

So ask me anything including questions about the project that shall not be named and the Westwood Lie.

JohnlillyEccoofficer,2014-04-16 23:55:56+00:00,I grew up a member of a religious cult (homeschooled/homechurched) with an extremely censored almost violent approach to science as a whole. I need help starting my real education any recommendations?,"This is hard for me to write as I have only in the last few months come to grips with the reality of the Universe.

I am at this time 27 years old, I was raised since birth in a Christian cult known as ATI/IBLP. Within this group my parents raised me in homeschool and homechurch (father was the pastor and we would hold church in our livingroom) with 100% conviction to know that the earth is only 8,000 years old and that light from distant stars is created light aged just like Adam was aged when he was created. 
Long story short I believed every word and looked at science through their filter they had placed in front of my eyes.
I never questioned my parents teachings nor the books and papers they gave me to support these beliefs. My first exposure to real science was a show I would sneak and watch called ""Connections"" and it was the single beacon of light in the darkness of ""God did it, so no need to look any further"" that I was immersed in. Although I soaked it all up I still saw through the filter of ""God"" and ""8,000 year old created light"".
I researched every vein of scientific theory that supported an 8,000 year old universe to the point of a theory consisting of God creating the universe as one solid mass of matter then turning on gravity causing massive collapse and fusion resulting in a White-hole spitting out all the matter in the universe. Since the Sol system was near the center grip of the White-hole the rest of the Universe would age billions of years while time passed over a 6 day period here on earth. It amazes me now how I could ever believe such a thing. But at the time it was the only plausible explanation…. because the Bible couldn't be wrong… could it?!
If you are interested in hearing the silly science behind such a fantastical theory trying to solve how we can see starlight in a young (6,000 year old) universe I reccomend checking out http://www.amazon.com/Starlight-Time-Russell-Humphreys-Ph-D/dp/0890512027.

I didn't question many of this and especially never even considered evolution to be true. Fossils, mountains, erosion and geographical evidence for an old earth are just results from how traumatic the flood was on the earth. 

I dont know if this is the case for others but my eyes were first opened while reading science fiction.

---------------------

Of course after reading all of that I came to the conclusion that God isn't dead... he never was alive. I am the happiest I have ever been in my life. I want to scream at the top of my lungs ""Free at last!! Free at last!! By science all mighty I am free at last!!!""

I have now hit an impasse. My limited knowledge of advanced physics and science is holding me back from exploring the cosmos for myself.
I was never educated further than advanced algebra and I have no physics or chemistry education.
Can anyone recommend a good place for me to pick up my education? I would rather not do the whole “Night School” thing as I find myself to be the best teacher of  myself there is and I loathe the idea of scientific authority within education. The whole reason I am in this mess in the first place is because someone told me what to think.
Can anyone recommend a few good books to further my education? I heard Hawking's books are good, anything else? You have to understand, I thought everything was only 8,000 years old, I have a TON of catching up to do.

Thank you in advance!

EDIT: Yes, I am looking into improving my grammar and writing skills as well. I find it extremely disrespectful to communicate with my cave-man like writing skills. Please know my poor grammar is because of child abuse through lack of education and you can write a well written letter to my father if you have any complaints.

EDIT2:  The single most illuminating thing in my life would have to be that BBC show called ""Connections"". A few years later my older (by 25 years) atheist brother snuck me the entire Cosmos series on VHS when I was 17. It blew my mind and got me started down my current path more than any single catalyst. I still hear Carl Sagan saying ""Billions upon billion"" in my head. That single word ""billions"" is the greatest word I have ever heard. It just screams ""I dare you to comprehend me!"" I am also reminded of the ""Total Perspective Vortex"" from ""The Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy"". I imagined the sobering experience of sitting in the machine and felt the pure narcissism of Christianity melt away when I did.

EDIT3: If you are interested in learning more about the cult that I was forced to be a member of. Please google ATI, IBLP, Bill Gothard. The cult leader Bill Gothard has just last month resigned due to sexual allegations. I have only in the last few years come to grips with the emotional, sexual and physical abuse that went on with me personally and still am having flashbacks of the nightmares I would have because of my immortal soul being in danger... or worse yet the immortal souls of 99% of everyone who has ever lived burning in a lake of fire for all of eternity because God is love. I am reminded of the White Stripes song ""It is always with love that the poison is fed with a spoon"". They used my love and trust to do those things and I loved them the more for it. I am slowly trying to un-poison my mind, at least now I know I don't have to worry about cleaning a soul or some wispy ghost inside of me thank Science for that!",AskScienceDiscussion,1336

passwoord_is_taco,2014-01-31 04:59:02+00:00,"Never read sci-fi until this morning, while stuck at the airport, I decided to give it a shot. Considered easing myself into the genre, then figured go big or go home. I'm now 250 pages into Dune.","I'm actually amazed at how easy of a read it is. I was intimidated by it at first because of its size - it looks like a Game of Thrones book and those things took me a month each to read. But Dune is written so concisely - where Martin would take an whole page to describe a room, Herbert can describe an entire building in two sentences and still make you feel like you're there - that I'm flying through it. More has happened in 250 pages of Dune than happened in pretty much all of A Clash of Kings.

I'm really impressed with his character development. I'm always that freak who is drawn to villains and tries to find the good in them (I always believed in you Severus, from day one) and Dune is one of the few examples of books I've read where I am completely drawn to the good guys. I love Duke Leto, even his faults, and although I'm dreading his obviously foreshadowed death (NO SPOILERS it still hasn't happened!), I'm so excited to see what it's going to do to Paul, who is going to become SO. MUCH. MORE.

The only thing I'm a little disappointed with is the dialogue, but I feel like there's something I'm missing there. I have so many questions, but I don't want to look anything up because I'm afraid of accidentally spoiling myself.

This got a little long - all I originally wanted to do was ask about physical appearance of the characters: I picture Leto and Paul as being somewhat Middle Eastern looking, with Jessica looking more European. Besides the physical descriptions, I think a lot of the words they use have Arabic and Hebrew roots.

Also thought it was interesting that the Baron Harkonnen's name is Vladimir...considering Dune was published in 1965, I assume there are going to be major allusions to the Cold War...which I don't want to look up for fear of spoilers.

Also, how do you actually pronounce Bene Gesserit and Muad'Dib?

So many questions! Also PLEASE use [spoiler tags] :) Thanks!

luciantv,2011-12-23 18:09:48+00:00,"Hey Reddit, my novel is currently no. 1 in the Amazon Kindle Top 100 free sci-fi list. It's available for free to anyone from Amazon until midnight Christmas Eve. Enjoy :)","**EDIT: Due to the fantastic response from Reddit, the book will stay free until after Christmas (at least two more days). Thanks again for your amazing comments and notes.**

Here's the link to the Amazon page where you can download the book for free. [The God in the Clear Rock](http://www.amazon.com/Clear-Rock-Ancients-Earth-ebook/dp/B004YF1D4E/ref=sr_1_132?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324651269&amp;sr=1-132)

It's more like a modern day Indiana Jones adventure than Dune. Here's the logline:

Mysterious artifact from lost ancient civilization of giants is somehow connected to series of deadly solar storms beginning to hit earth.

There's no strings attached. ~~Until tomorrow night at midnight~~ Until at least after Christmas, it is a completely free download from Amazon and you don't need a Kindle to read it. You can use any computer and anyone can download it. (Foreign countries might need to use the appropriate Amazon site instead of the above link - simply search for my name) This is my gift to Reddit. Merry Christmas :)

EDIT: Wow, what an amazing response from my fellow Redditors. I am grateful and humbled by the wonderful comments and replies. I'm going to try to get the publisher to keep the book for free until after Christmas (so you can tell all your friends to get a free copy). Thanks again Reddit. Have a great holiday :)

EDIT 2: This is just amazing. I wish I could keep typing, but it's getting late in Florida. For everyone who sent me an email address, I will get back to you I promise. It may take me a short while to sort through all of the PMs. Thanks again Reddit. Good Night :)

EDIT 3: Good Morning! Thanks to Reddit, my book is now number one in both the Amazon High-Tech and Adventure Top 100 lists and number 37 in the overall Kindle Top 100 free books. Have a great Christmas and I hope everyone who downloaded the book enjoys it. Reddit, you are the best :)

EDIT 4: I spoke to the publisher and it will remain free for next couple of days. Thanks for all of your great feedback. I am busy finishing the third book in the series now. It should be available in about 90 days. 

**Please feel free to share the link with anyone that wants a free book :)**",scifi,1104
