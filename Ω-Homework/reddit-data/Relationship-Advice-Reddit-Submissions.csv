ThrowRa_20A,2021-10-05 16:59:47+00:00,My boyfriend (26M) found out I'm (26F) rich and started using it against me.,"My boyfriend and I met through a dating app 8 months ago and we’ve had a good, steady relationship. I come from a well-off family, but my parents never spoiled me. They taught me to not indulge in excess and to keep my privilege in mind when interacting with people. I’m currently living in an apartment with only my salary. I haven’t told my boyfriend about my wealth – I wasn’t actively hiding it; it just didn’t come up. 

My birthday was a few weeks ago and my parents threw a party at our home. Our home is a medium sized villa. My boyfriend started scowling when I told him that that was the home I grew up in. When I asked him about it, he told me it was nothing and started smiling again. His mood got worse as more and more of my parents’ rich friends started coming in. When I asked him about it the next day, he just told me that he was feeling a little sick. 

After we got back, he asked me why I hid the fact I was rich. I told him that I wasn’t hiding it. But he started bringing it up in every conversation after that – like telling his me that I didn’t know how to cook properly because I was spoilt. He brought it up with his friends, telling them I was a spoilt princess who had everything handed to me. It started as jokes, but it got more hostile as the days went on. When I brought this up, he told me I didn’t know normal people problems because I was rich.

metaljunkie1990,2021-08-20 20:58:22+00:00,Girl (25F) I’m (30M) seeing freaked when we talked about our sexual pasts. Now wants to see me again. Im torn. NSFW.,"  

About 6 months ago I got out of a 5 year relationship with my ex-girlfriend. It was amicable. Ultimately she didn’t want kids, I did. It was drama free and we’re still friends. We even share a dog as if it’s a child (I have full custody, she gets 3 weekends a month). A few months after the split I’m having a drink at a bar where my sister works (she hooks it up) and notice one of her coworkers is insane hot and covered in ink. I ask my sister about her and find out she’s single and also just got out of a long term relationship. My sister also tells me she’s a good person and a metal head like myself! I tell her to put in the good word and she says she will.

Fast forward to later in the night and while my sister is shutting down the bar her hot coworker, we’ll call her Abbey, is getting off shift and asks if she can join me for a drink! I say of course and we spend about an hour bullshitting about music and camping and all kinds of stuff. We have a lot in common and I’m REALLY vibing with her. I can tell the feeling is mutual so I ask if she’d like to get dinner the next day. She says absolutely, we exchange numbers and go our separate ways for the night. 

The next night we go on our date. The conversation is great and nothing feels forced! We’re laughing and telling each other funny stories from our pasts and just overall having a good time. We end up back at my place. One thing leads to another and we’re making out on my couch. Things got hot and we ended up going down on one another (no sex) and I’ll just say it was fucking awesome. Probably the best blowjob I’ve ever received. We make plans to see each other again and she goes home. 

This continued for about 2 months and everything was going great. The last time we got together I cooked her dinner at my place. We’re a few drinks in (not drunk at all) and eventually the topic of kinks gets brought up. She tells me she enjoys d/s roleplay and enjoys both roles equally. I tell her that’s great because im literally the exact same. We start talking about our past experiences and what sort of play we like (whips, restraints, collars, plugs, tease/denial….we covered it all) and I’m thinking I just hit the fucking jackpot and found a fellow freak. I figured if she’s this sex positive she must be pretty open minded…..and I tell her that I’ve had a few experiences with men. She goes silent and asks me to explain. Her tone changed dramatically. I was somewhat taken aback by the sudden change and told her that I’ve been with 3 men. 2 dudes 1 on 1 a few times each. And one bi couple my ex and I would play with. I don’t date men and im not romantically attracted to men. Not that it should matter, but I told her this. 

She got pretty upset. She told me that I could have given her an STD and that bi sexual men are more prone to catch them because they’re promiscuous. She said she couldn’t be with a man where she has to worry about him cheating on her with his male friends as well as other women. She asked if when we were fooling around I was thinking about men. She asked if im secretly gay.   

I was stunned. I didn’t say anything. I know I don’t know here *that* well. But I was still really surprised given what I did know of her. Sadly, this is the 2nd time this has happen. The first time I was fucking pissed and got all upset and worked up over it. This time I didn’t have it in me to get fired up. I wasn’t sad, or upset or sorry for myself….I was just disappointed such a promising relationship was ending before it really began.  

I told her I didn’t think it was something that would be a big deal and I apologized for not telling her before we were intimate (maybe I should from now on?). She was about to say something but I stopped her and told her I think it’d be best if she just left. I didn’t wanna hear anything else she had to say because I was starting to feel the anger rise. She gathered up her shit and left. 

The next day my sister comes over early in the morning and says she and abbey talked. She gave me a hug and said she was sorry and that she’s as shocked as I am. I told her it’s okay, that im a big boy and life will go on. And….that was that! 

Fast forward a few weeks and I get a wall of texts…….lo and behold, it’s Abbey. She apologized a million times and said she didn’t know why she reacted the way she did. She said she’s never been with a man who’s been with other men before. She says she doesn’t have anything against it and that now after thinking about it that it “kinda turns me on”. She asked if I can forgive her and wants to meet up. It all sounded sincere. 

I’m torn….on one hand I do wanna forgive her and see where things go. I really liked the girl and we clicked. On the other hand im worried this will be a ongoing issue and she really will worry about what im thinking when we’re intimate and what im doing when im out with male friends (I literally would never sleep with a male friend). How she reacted really didn’t sit well either….it was a bit emasculating in a way. It definitely stung at the time but im over it now. I’d also like to make it clear I do not think she is a terrible person or some crazy bitch.     

Has anyone else ever been in a situation like this? What would you do moving forward?  

Also.....my sister said to add this in my post.....i own my own home, have a good paying stable job and ""have my shit together"". Apparently her ex's have been deadbeat stoners. (i smoke, nothing against it). I dont know if any of this matters. Thanks!

ThrowRA_loveoflife,2021-08-20 17:22:43+00:00,Year update( fiancé said ex was the love of her life),"Fiancé said her EX was the love of her life (Year update)

I’m gonna post my whole story for context.


(FINAL UPDATE] to Fiancé [31] said her EX is the “love of her life”

https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/i92jr7/update_2_to_fianc%C3%A9_f31_said_her_ex_is_the_love_of/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf

I posted here originally but also on relationship advice so thought I’d post a final update.(Posting the whole thing)


My fiancé[F31] and I [M33] got engaged in October last year and have been in a relationship for 5 years now. Everything has been great and I can honestly say that I’ve never met anyone who comes close to her, she’s been the love of my life for sure. I’ve known her most of my life, we grew up on the same street just round the corner from each other. Her Mum and Dad still stay in the same house and I still stay in the same house I grew up in which my Mum left to me when she passed away in 2014. We still don’t officially live together yet but for all intents and purposes she lives here. Her parents and her are really close though and she still has her bedroom there and will occasionally spend the night there but she’s never away from here.

Anyway this morning I decided to go take a walk down to the shops to buy some things and as I was about half way down(15 minute walk)I realised I had forgotten my face mask(masks are mandatory here in shops since 10th of July), so I had to walk back and get mine. When I walked in the door to grab the mask from the kitchen table I heard her speaking to someone loudly on the phone in the living room and she said “yeah but David will always be the love of my life”.  David is her ex boyfriend, I don’t know a great deal about him but I know they were in a relationship for 2 years and it ended a year before we started dating. He also dumped her. I just grabbed my mask and walked back out and just as I got to the shops i felt weird and I had to sit down as my mind was going in a thousand different directions. I eventually got back home and immediately told her I feel sick and sent her back round to her parents house as I didn’t want her about as I was Ill.

I’m now lying in my bed wondering what to do to be honest. I know she didn’t do anything wrong, it’s not like she cheated on me or intentionally went out of her way to hurt me but what’s heard can’t be unheard. She basically said that the person who she’s agreed to marry isn’t a patch on an ex she’s not been with for 6 years. The fact she said he will always be the love of her life also means that it’s a void game, her heart’s already been taken and there’s nothing I could ever do to change that. Also what would happen if he did come back in to her life? You can’t turn down the love of your life when they come calling and I’d be dumped quicker than yesterday’s leftovers.

So what do I do? Tell her I was earwigging on her and heard her say that shit? Just end the relationship for a completely vague reason like “oh it’s not you it’s me” etc...Swallow my pride and pretend I didn’t hear it? Everything has been wonderful but there’s no way on this Earth I want to be someone’s second choice, especially when her ex is the one on her mind that she obviously would be with if she could. I’m thinking about just saying it’s not working between us.

She’s now texting me about coming round tonight and mothering and spoiling me cos I’m “the sickie”...Fuck that.

————————————————

Update 1

I was gonna update sooner but I’ve spent the last 3 and a half days in a drunken stupor so my apologies but I’ll warn you, this is not a good update.

Right so after posting and receiving some advice on reddit on Thursday I was thinking of telling her to come back round on Thursday night so we could talk but settled on Friday morning instead as I wanted to get my head in a clearer state. She still thought I was ill so i needed a bit of time to think through what I was going to say.  So she comes round on Friday morning about 8am with rolls and tuna mayo crunch her Mum had made for me along with grapes, sweets and juice and stuff. I think she could see right away that something was wrong as I must’ve looked stony faced and you could cut the atmosphere with a knife. Anyways I said to her that I wasn’t really sick and that yesterday as I was going to the shops i forgot my mask, had to come back to retrieve it and when i got in to get it i heard her talking in the other room...about David. Her face went completely pale and she started welling up so I instinctively stopped talking and just stared at her. She then runs into the toilet, locks the door and starts hysterically crying and alarm bells are going off all over the place in my head.

Her reaction made me think she didn’t know what I heard so she must’ve said some other shit about him as well. I chapped on the door and told her if she has any aspirations of saving this relationship she had better tell me everything right now. 30 minutes or so go by and she finally comes out dabbing her face with a tissue and tells me David got back in touch with her 4 or 5 months ago and she had been sleeping with him once or twice a week since. I said on my previous post she will occasionally go and stay with her parents, it’s usually about once a week, sometimes twice, sometimes none. The thing is I’ve just popped round myself dozens of times over the years to speak to her Mum or Dad, watch tv or anything at all really without informing her and she’s always been there so it’s just become routine and I’ve never thought anymore of it. This has obviously been the times that she’s gone to meet David. All I can think of is that the snippet of conversation I heard her having was her friend or something helping her choose between David and I. 

When I heard this I hit the roof, I threw her out grabbed handfuls of her stuff, put it in bin bags and threw it out the door in to the front garden, she’s still standing there btw. I then grabbed my garden hose and drenched the shit out of the bags with it(I’m not proud of that, it was extremely petty and in hindsight I should never have done that). She at this point has ran round to her house and about a minute later her Dad comes rampaging round screaming. Her Dad and I end up rolling about the now quagmire-ish front garden fighting, at about 9 am in the morning no less. Police vans and everything ended up turning up and half the street was out because of the rammy.

Afterwords I blocked her on everything and went to my friends house where 3 of us spent the weekend and Monday(they took off work, I’m on furlough) drinking. When I got back in the house this morning I noticed she had been back in the house at some point...made the beds, done the washing and ironed. I have no idea why she done this.

As I’m writing this she’s tried to get in again, I haven’t been able to change the locks yet so I put the door chains on the front and back door and from upstairs heard the door opening and the chains clanging as she tried to get in. There’s also a note that she’s put through the door.  I don’t even want to read it right now, I’m too hurt, hungry and hungover to even think about what she has to say.

—————————————————-

Update 2

Sorry for the belated update but I’m in a bad way right now, I’m half drunk as I write this so bear with me.

Since everything that has happened things have took a turn for the worse...As many of you mentioned I should Do, I sent an email to her father, explaining my side of the story and apologising for taking things public and embarrassing his daughter but as I  said previously, I acted instinctively. I didn’t apologise for fighting him as I was reacting to him coming at me. He basically told me to fuck off, and accused me of biting his ear for some reason. So that’s what was stuck in my teeth. I joke ofcourse...if you don’t laugh, you’ll cry.

About a week ago I went outside to find my car key’d right down from the passenger side wing mirror round to the boot. Last Sunday I was walking down the road to meet a friend at the arches(a place where we occasionally hang out and walk from an arched bridge) and as I was turning the corner the local mouth(gossip) called me a disgrace. I said how am I disgrace and she told me that I’m a disgrace for beating up my ex-fiancé. Let’s just be clear here, I’ve never laid a finger on her in my life, either her, her father or someone else is perpetuating this lie and me throwing her shit out and hosing it has obviously given this an authenticity.

I haven’t spoken to my ex and she hasn’t tried to contact me anymore, I think they’re all on the same page now, that I’m the bad guy. I’ve got the ball rolling in putting my house up for sale, I can’t live here anymore. I wish I still had my Mum to lean on, she would make things better.

Sorry for the shit update

——————————————————

Final Update

Firstly, I want to thank everyone who has reached out...I’ve tried to reply to everyone and hopefully this update will help.

I am since still in my house but I will be renting it out rather than selling...I can’t in good conscience give up something that was my mums and has been in the family for generations.

I have since spoke to the father and i understand why the family circled the wagons but to throw me under the bus so brutally...was genuinely ridiculous...collateral damage to me and my name is alright apparently. Only known them my entire life.

All in all I feel like I was in the midst of a shit shower that changed course...still struggling but feeling a lot better now that I’ve got an umbrella and a fucking roadmap.

——Also would like to note that i posted on social media giving my side of the story. Whether or not that was right or not is up for debate I guess but it was after I had let those close to me discreetly spread it first so I felt the time was right. Her side are still singing off the same hymn sheet but hoping neutrals will see things from my side. My close pals have been incredible throughout all this, but that’s why they’re close pals I guess.


Anyways cheers,

Another update

Well it’s been over a year and I have since moved out my house and am now renting it to a nice older couple, so thought I would update.

What should I do?,"We broke up way before I (25M) learned about this and I’m still not sure what to think. Recently found out not only that she passed away but we have a 7month old son. Her family was telling her before that I needed to know but she kept putting it off. So now with what happened they felt I needed to be told and take part in his life. Just to be sure I asked for a paternity test and got the results now. He’s definitely mine so that’s freaked me out more. This has made it so much more real. I really don’t know what to do now.

Everytime I think about it it all gets overwhelming, I feel like I’m gonna get an anxiety attack. Then sometimes I get so angry that she never told me because I absolutely had a right to know about this from the beginning and be there for my son. Now all of a sudden I’m a single dad expecting to take care of a baby I didn’t know existed less than a few weeks ago. Her mom says she can help out but can’t take him full time. Her sister still in college. That’s why they really need me and say my son needs me. I don’t know what I’m going to do. I wanna do the right thing but I’m scared I’m gonna fuck this up so bad. I don’t want to mess this poor kid up and im gonna be the only parent he knows. Tomorrow is the first time I’m suppose to meet him. So nervous and freaked out about everything going on. 

My parents say I’m gonna be a great dad but I’m not sure about that or how I’m gonna manage with a baby suddenly with me. I’m really looking for any advice on this.

https://old.reddit.com/user/Throwrazrm/

Basically I guess since I had fo wait 48 hours to providing an update. This is what happened. I last mentioned that every morning I drive by her apartment complex (it’s actually how we met) and her car wasn’t there. I texted her to see if she was ok and the iMessage never was delivered. But I could see at like 1:30pm that she read the message. She just texted back “I’m fine.”

I asked her how “coffee” went and she said that she was still in the city hanging out with her friend. I said sarcastically (even over text) they must have had a lot of catching up to do. She never responded to that.

Wednesday is Nova on PBS night and that has been our standing date night since we got together. I texted her and asked her what she wanted me to get for dinner and she said that her “friend” had given her free tickets to the that game and since she was still in the city she’s was going to meet up with some other college friends (that I had no idea existed) for drinks then go to the game.

I said on text “look I don’t think how you’ve been treating me over these last few days has been fair. We agreed to be exclusive and start a commitment and this isn’t how you treat someone you have a relationship with.”

She responded with “I’m ok if we break up”

I asked her what that meant and that’s not what I was getting at rather that we just need to treat each other with respect. At about 5:30 last night that was all she said to me. It’s like she never even cared.


I was just getting over my divorce and starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel and I really loved her even though it had been a short time. And her last words to me were “I’m ok if we break up.” No explanation, no apology, no sadness, nothing.

throwRA397231,2021-06-15 14:22:05+00:00,Update My (22f) sister (25f) is being outright cruel about my pregnancy and baby,"Last post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/nv3elx/my\_22f\_sister\_25f\_is\_being\_outright\_cruel\_about/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/nv3elx/my_22f_sister_25f_is_being_outright_cruel_about/)

At the time of my last post, my parents did not know that my sister had called my 10 month old a cunt. I went to their house for some baby stuff, and during that visit I informed them and they were shocked. My father immediately had my sister come downstairs for a talk. She tried to play it off, but our parents wouldn't let her, and by the end of that talk, she admitted she was jealous of my husband. Not my baby or my marriage itself, just my husband, who is attractive, a good provider, and loves me. She apologised, and asked if we could start over, which I agreed to, more for our parents than for her.

Turns out that was a terrible idea. Our parents invited us to dinner that night, and she spent the entire night throwing herself at my husband, to such an extent that our dad called her out. My husband at one point went to the bathroom, my sister left the room, and then my husband came back shortly after and said that she asked him to leave me and the kids for her. We then left and my sister called a few hours later and apologised again, saying she didn't know what came over her.

I then told her to go fuck herself. My father agrees that her actions were inappropriate and has said that he will pay for her to have private therapy, while my mother has said that she apologised so I should forgive her and we should all try and move past this. My husband and I agreed that our family unit would be taking a break from my sister, possibly forever, possibly until she's had that therapy dad mentioned, but either way she tried to seduce my husband while I was in the room so IDK what is going on with her but clearly something is up and until she sorts herself out we're not touching it.

TLDR: Sister admitted she was jealous solely of my husband as a person and tried to split us up. Dad is getting her therapy and we are going no contact for a while.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/o0fj1d/update_my_22f_sister_25f_is_being_outright_cruel/,relationship_advice,2130,437,0.0

He wakes up so easily but he works nightshifts so not always home. He sleeps during the day and i spend most nights sleeping alone.
I snore but not loudly due to stress and issues with my nostrils and so on. He talked about my snoring before and how it keeps waking him up and he tried wearing earphones since he sleeps while listening to music.

Last night at 3am. I was sleeping after spending the entire day on my feet working. He was home all day and didn't have a shift at night. He was sitting next to me watching youtube.
I kept feeling him shaking me repeatedly then suddenly he stopped then slapped me across the face causing me to freak out almost falling out of bed. I yelled at him for slapping me while I was sleeping and he complained that my snoring was too loud and he tried to get me to stop but had no other way but to slap me to get me to wake up. I was livid I told him that what he did shook me but He said I was annoying him with my snoring I responded that he wasn't even sleeping but watching youtube.

ThrowRADeadFriend,2021-03-04 06:00:35+00:00,My best friend committed suicide after having an affair without telling her husband and he's now asking me what happened. I don't know what to do.,"*Names changed.
My (40F) best friend (40F), Rachel, had been married for 20-something years to her husband, John (42M). They moved away from Utah to stay in SoCal. We've kept in close contact ever since they moved, right up to the time she died. 

Last year, she came back to Utah to care for her father who had since passed. She was here for a year, and then returned to SoCal, where she complained that her life wasn't much. With her husband's encouragement and mine, she flew back here to Utah for a while to have a change of scenery and be close to family, and thats when the affair happened. 

One day, she confided in me that she started seeing someone. I was not that surprised as on a few occasions, she told me she was thinking about divorce, but never went further than toying with the idea. On hearing about her affair, i cautioned her that she should deal with her marriage first and foremost, and she should have known better before engaging in extramarital affairs. She mentioned a name in passing, Jasper, but it wasnt someone i knew. He was married too, from what she told me. I was alarmed and she was embarrassed and dismissive and that was the last we talked about it. Ocassionally she would tell me ""Oh I met Jasper today"". But things took a turn for the worse when she saw that he was having fun holidaying with his wife. She was upset and angry and incredibly sad. A month later, she drowned herself in her father's apartment, her body only found after the smell was noticed by a neighbour. 

It's been about 6 months since she passed, and her husband and daughter (24?F) are back in town. He sent me a text last night, paraphrased, saying that he was looking for the truth as to why she killed herself and asking if there was anything i was keeping from him. He mentioned the name, Jasper. I think he knows or suspects something. 

From what i know, her suicide letter just said: ""i'm sorry, this was all my fault"" but she never went into details. Her sister, who knew about her affair, told me to keep mum about it. I can only speculate why she killed herself, from guilt of the affair or from sadness that Jasper still was with his wife, or maybe even something else.

What do i do? On one hand, I have a dead best friend I need to dignify. On another its incredibly unfair for her husband and daughter. But if i tell them, lord knows what would happen. I'm at a loss.

Edit: Spelling

Update: Firstly, thank you all for your comments, I wouldnt have been able to make a decision without the help you guys provided. Being at a crossroads, balancing morals with consequence was tough. I've decided to approach her sister and talk to her about telling her husband. I've also wrote down a list of the facts (no speculation) for John to refer to, and i will pass it to him in due time when we meet up. I will not te his daughter, that is his choice to do so. I have not replied to his text as Rachel's sister has approached him already. We are going to do it in the next few days, but as of right now we have not settled a date. Some of you were right that her sister knows more, though she has not divulged that information to me. I will update again if there is anything significant. Thank you all for both sides of solutions, and for additional details i did not think of.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/lxe01n/my_best_friend_committed_suicide_after_having_an/,relationship_advice,2020,998,0.0

Anyways, I have to write a research paper about her family through an anthropological perspective and she has to do the same about mine. We had planned to talk over Zoom on Saturday. Before the meeting, she said that she was shy. I said that I was shy too. I didn’t think that she’d be this shy that her mom would be in our meeting. I barely talked to my classmate. Whenever I talked, the mom responded for her daughter as if she had anything to do with this project, which of course she doesn’t.

At one point during the conversation, the mother said to me, “It sounds like you want to get out of this project. If you have something to say, just say it. We won’t be offended.” I then said that wasn’t the case at all, but that my anxiety sends the wrong signals at times. I’ve now considered backing out of this assignment even though it’s a group effort between my classmate and I. The mother admitted to me that she read over the messages I sent to my classmate on Canvas, which discussed details about our project. I’m starting to believe that I’ve been in communication with the mom the entire time and it will remain that way until this semester is over. 

Should I talk to my professor about what happened? This is my last semester before I graduate. The last thing I want is to fail because I’m working with someone that is not my classmate. If my classmate is really shy and nervous to talk to me, I’m not discriminating against her for that. I’m the same way. I’m just annoyed that I had to talk to her mom and might continue to moving forward.

Bf and I just started talking about people embarrassing themselves and he kissed me and kind of semi made out and he said loudly that I'm the only girl he'll ever want. The next morning we all talked together and just asked her why she does it. She tried to deny it and we talked again later and had a D&amp;M about finding her a boyfriend.

Edit: just talked with her and she said she has a lot of gay friends and they say it to each other all time time, it’s kind of compliment to her.

My Fiancé (35/M) is acting like its no big deal.,"I hesitate to call (j) my friend. He's my finance's best friend. I've known J since we were kids. We were not close despite what he says. I've always found J to be...creepy. J is an incel (i think) and very un-PC. My Fiancée tolerates him because he knows he's harmless and joking but, I have to disagree.

We were at our Apartment drinking and watching netflix. J kept making jokes about raping me. One time i went to go get some more beer. J shouts ""hurry back or i'm going to rape you!"". and even my fiancée is telling him to chill. I didn't say much because I didn't want to ruin the move night but, yeah, it was really disturbing.

I told my fiancée that J was way out of line and made me very uncomfortable. But, he just told me to stop overreacting and that J is harmless and just stupid. Then my fiancée jokes ""J would never rape you without me going first, babe"". That just really did not settle well with me. We got into it and he thinks i'm a child and a baby for being so worked up over a joke.

And to be honest I do not feel safe around J. I've always had bad vibes about him. He's just very off, not wired correctly. I do feel he's capable of acting on those jokes.

ThrowRAwaymomvisit,2021-02-03 17:06:12+00:00,Mom keeps seeing the baby that was the result of my sexual assault,"Never wanted to talk about this but honestly it feels like no one else in my life understands what the hell im going through. 

I (25m) was assaulted over a year and a half ago. Not gonna go into the full details. I was beyond drunk, knew for a fact she wasn’t because she never drinks. I said i didn’t want this, didn’t stop a god damm thing. 

Days after it happened I told my friend who was there that night before he took off and he said it was probably just a drunk hookup an was no big deal. 

At that point I tried to let it go and forget about it. Especially when it would’ve so easily been written off as a drunk one night stand if I tried to report it. 

I cut her out of my life but then came to find out a few months later that she was pregnant. And yup, baby was mine. 

I wanted no part of that and I told her so. She knew what she did too, she tried to apologize for what she did that night like if that was somehow gonna make it better. 

But apparently wanted to keep the baby because it was innocent in all this and she couldn’t think about going through with an abortion. 

She left me out of the birth certificate though and said she won’t drag me into financially supporting the kid if I didn’t want to because she knows she probably ruined enough for me (understatement of the century). 

Everyone in my family was convinced I just knocked her up and didn’t want to take responsibility. My mom was the only one who believed me when I told her everything that happened.

That made me feel relief that at least she was on my side. Except recently I found out she’s been seeing the baby behind my back for months.

Last time I was at her house her phone started ringing and I see rapists name on the screen with a pic of a baby girl. My stomach started twisting and asked her what the hell she was doing.

My mom was freaked out about it but she ended up admitting she’s been communicating with rapist for a while because she just wants to spend time with her granddaughter. 

So she’s been inviting my rapist over to her house almost every week so she can play with the baby that was a result of my fucking rape. 

That was too much for me. I couldn’t even stand being in my moms house knowing she was there too so I got up and left. My mom was begging me to come back but I just had to get out of the there. 

She was blowing up my phone telling me she’s sorry and she didn’t expect me to find out about it. I called her up and we had another talk. 

My mom was really apologetic and she knows what happened to me was traumatic and I have every right to feel the way I do. But that I guess she couldn’t help that she wants to be in her granddaughters life even if it means tolerating *her.* 

I told my mom to just leave me alone and not call me for a while. So far she hasn’t so at least I’m not being bothered.

But I just can’t wrap my head around this. I know she’s got a right to do whatever she wants but it’s hard not to feel betrayed in some way if that makes any sense. Look, nothing against the baby. She’s innocent I know that I really do. 

That doesn’t mean I can stand thinking about her and not feeling sick knowing how it all happened. I’ve tried hard not to think about her all this time. 

I don’t know if I can keep seeing my mom after this. She doesn’t want this affecting our relationship but it’s all I can think about now and don’t think I can get past it. 

Knowing she’s spending time with them. It’s fucking up my mind...Any advice on what to do about this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/lbsbya/mom_keeps_seeing_the_baby_that_was_the_result_of/,relationship_advice,1279,523,0.0

Prestigious_Zombie87,2021-02-01 05:59:01+00:00,Today My Mom Disowned Me as Her Child,"  My parents and relatives, pretty much everyone in my community is Muslim and women wears hijab. I am 20 years old but when I first started to wear hijab I was only 12 years old and I just wanted my family to be proud of me and relatives to love me so I made a bad choice for myself. I immediately regretted it but scared of my community's respond so I tried to pretend like it was nothing. To be fair, it always made me feel ugly and unworthy. I never had a real chance to walk at the street with my hair on my shoulders and feel that freedom. I am also at the edge of regretting my religion so as you can see things are very f.cked up for me right now.

  I always told my mom and big sister, I would like to not wear hijab but they ignored what i said for years. I always accepted how I live and dreamed of someone who can see through me, love me besides everything. To be honest, it was a childish thought and I realised that I live for myself and even tho I wear hijab it doesnt change my inner self. Last 2 months, I decided that I am gonna tell my mom first and tell her that I want to feel beautiful and be able to wear pretty clothes. It was a very hard thing for me to do, I lost 7 kgs in 2 weeks for just preparing to say it. When I told her, she basically just manipulated me and said, ''You want it to look beautiful for men at your college''. It really broke my heart that I cant even express it within the words. I would be a sl.t (as she says) if I wanted to, hijab wouldn't stop me.

  2 or 3 weeks past and my mom literally ignored what I've said and pretend like it didn't even happen. Today I just told my sister and my mom heard it too. My sister didn't approve and told my problems isnt about hijab, taking it off will not change anything about my mental state. I also want to say, I HATE IT WHEN THEY SPEAK LIKE THEY KNOW WHAT I REALLY THINK AND FEEL. I hold myself for 3 weeks after that conversation with mom but I snapped at my sister today and told I will do it no matter what. Mom literally lost her mind and started yelling like a freak, she called me squint, asked God what was her sin to get such a bad daughter. Then she told me she will not make it happen. When I yelled her to leave my room, she yelled from the corridor and said, ''She will finish her college, find a job then will f.ck off from our house and will never see me again''.

  So yeah, it basically it. She literally disowned me because of it. I understand her but clearly it didnt help the first time when we spoke and she chose to ignore my feelings. I dont know what else to say.
Also I dont want you guys to question my motives because I really don't have energy to explain myself and how I feel throughout all of these years. I feel too tired and dead inside to do anything at all...

Edit: Thank you for the award!
I really hope my mom come around and we can see eye to eye. Her choice will not matter, I decided what I am about to do but just wishing for her to accept it easily.

Edit 2: I tried to read every comment I can but I still have school hws and exams and wasn't able to reply everyone. You guys mostly asked where I am from, Turkey. In Turkey we have a lot of different people but some of the parts live their lives in the edge like me and my religious family. In our culture, we USUALLY dont leave our parent's house till we get married. Can I change this? Sure, why not? But I need to earn my own money first, and I still have 3 years in college to finish. My lessons are too much and I cant find any spare time to work, also right now corona sucks and still colleges didnt open yet.

I love my family, I understand why they feel that way but it doesn't help the matter. So please don't send hate to them in the comments.

I think the main issue with my mom is that she is too controlling. I still have its impacts on my life to this day, I really have no social abilities since my mom protect me way too much. I am trying to chang its impacts on my life. They still dont understand me and think I dont have to take off the hijab to be happy. The main thing they dont WANT TO understand is that it doesnt show who I am. All of my friends know my situation right now and they stand behind me. Gratefully I was able to make friends who are like me but I dont think I can find my soulmate like this, it is impossible. I just want to be myself.

You comments helped me a lot and made me realise that I didnt do anything wrong. Thank you so much for your supports. There is tons of messages in my mailbox too and I cant show how grateful I am. Thank you so much, I hope I will get through this with the strength I got from bunch of kind strangers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/l9wanl/today_my_mom_disowned_me_as_her_child/,relationship_advice,1038,319,1.0

This morning I’m walking to my car (which is parked next to his) while on my phone and not paying attention, and suddenly I’m face to face with a man rifling through his car. I freeze in fear and the man slams the car door, dares me to call the cops and then walks off. I run back inside to tell him what happened and I ask him to go see if anything was stolen (luckily he had his phone and wallet on him). He takes two steps outside, looks around, says it’s fine and comes back inside. He doesn’t check if anything was stolen and he leaves the car unlocked. He also didn’t ask if I was ok (which I totally am. I don’t want to be dramatic because obviously nothing happened to me but it was still a startling experience).

ThrowRATheyLikeMe,2020-11-17 14:20:31+00:00,"My (M36) husband (M37) thinks everyone likes me more, including our therapist - and I'm beginning to think he is right","tldr: My husband gets sad/upset because he feels like people don't like him or like me more. I'm beginning to think this is true. How can I be supportive without making him feel like he is just imagining things?

&amp;#x200B;

Quick background: My husband (let's call him Dave) and I met 9 years ago. We fell pretty hard for each other and got married after 2 years. Like all relationships, we've had our ups and downs but overall I feel like our relationship is strong. We have started arguing a lot during COVID, mostly because we both work from home, live in a tiny apartment, and are not doing well mental health wise. We therefore started seeing a couples' therapist recently and had 7 sessions so far.

Here is the issue: Dave has pretty severe social anxiety and is often convinced people don't like him. I think this is partially rooted in his experiences with his family who reacted very negatively to him coming out, but have accepted him now. Anyway, he is often convinced that certain people don't like him or like me more than him. For example, he is convinced that his family dislikes him and likes me more than him, that our friends are mostly my friends and just tolerate him, and that our colleagues (we work for the same company) like me more. He gets very upset when I'm invited to an after work drinks thing or to lunch, even if he just wasn't around at the time and so it's not at all a reflection of them liking me more. He also gets upset when a mutual friend messages me privately instead of in the group chat, even when it's about something that he has no interest in (e.g. a movie the friend and I like but that my partner hasn't seen).

Whenever this happens, I try to reassure him and say things like ""well, colleague X probably just invited me because she walked past my desk and saw me - you're on the other side of the building, so she probably just didn't think about it"" etc. I never feel like this helps much, but I try anyway.

Most recently, he got upset after a therapy session because he feels like the therapist likes me more and always sides with me. Now, the therapist doesn't really takes sides, but I can see what he means. When there is some ambiguity in what we say, she will often interpret it in a way that is more supportive of me and suggests that he needs to work on certain things. She will also more often say more positive things about me than him (but says positive, affirming things about both of us).

So when he became upset about this, I didn't really know what to say because I actually agree that it seems like she likes me more. I avoided the issue by suggesting we try a different therapist but he doesn't want that because it's hard to find an LGBT friendly one where we live and we already spent a lot of money on the sessions as well.

Anyway, this made think about this issue more broadly and I think over time I have realized that it isn't just his insecurity - some of this is based in reality. I have no idea why, but his family is kind of cold to him but they are super nice to me and I get along with all of them amazingly, including his two sisters who he used to be close with but no longer is. I do get invited to more stuff at work (or did, when we still went to the office) and I don't think it's \_just\_ a reflection of coincidence - I think I am more popular for whatever reason. I'm not saying this to brag or anything but I generally just have an easy time connecting with people and making friends. He isn't \_unpopular\_ and he has some very close friends from his childhood and college but I think his concerns are to some extent a reflection of reality.

How do I deal with this? How do I reassure him without lying or, worse, making him think he is crazy because he is imagining these things? I want to be supportive, but I don't know how.

Some additional info:

\- he has done years and years of individual therapy. He is doing much better than he used to but this is still an issue.

ThrowRAsen,2020-11-16 16:51:23+00:00,I was blind to my daughter’s (15) sexual abuse for so long and I feel like a terrible mother. Every time I see her I just break down.,"Please can someone answer, how do I get over this pain? How can I even begin to help her if I can’t help myself first? This pain and betrayal is more than I ever knew I could ever possibly feel and I don’t want to imagine her side of it. I feel like I completely failed her. He was a family friend that I trusted and so did everyone else which let him do this for over five years. There was so many times I left them alone together. So. Many. Times. I feel so stupid. My only rationale was the fact that he’s only ten years older than her, and because of that I didn’t imagine he could be a p\*dophile. I should have known how stupid it is to think that. But it honestly didn’t come to my mind when I saw him.

I just can’t get over this pain. It feels like it’s literally eating me alive. And I feel like I can’t look at her either, because I just get the most awful images in my head and the guilt I feel just swallows me whole. Why couldn’t I see what was happening? Why couldn’t I have protected her? I don’t know what to do. I know that we will be making a police report very soon. I would appreciate any advice. Thank you.

Edit: I just wanted to clarify a few things that I didn’t mention before after reading the comments:
1. My husband is her biological father. They have a good relationship. 
2. I can look at her, it just hurts. I don’t actively ignore her or anything like that. We are together every day. 
3. I was raped by a stranger at 12. I didn’t feel like mentioning this before simply because I didn’t want to, but hopefully that gives a new insight. Her abuse has brought up a lot of memories from when I was younger that has made it more difficult for me to be strong for her. 
4. I’ve known the man who abused her since he was very little. He became an “older brother” figure to her growing up and like another son to me. This is why I always felt like I could trust him. 
5. My daughter only recently disclosed to me what happened to her. Not immediately making a police report is her request. We are waiting until she is ready simply because we don’t want to force her to do anything she doesn’t want to do. 
6. I’m already looking into therapy for the both of us to go to separately.

He was hurt, not bad enough to have to go the hospital or anything but bad enough that he was bleeding a lot and none of his friends really knew what to do because they're 12 and dumb and his phone got broken in the crash so they couldn't call us. Anyways we found out when this guy Nick who is super cute and goes to my school showed up at our door with my brother and said that he saw that he was hurt and gave him a ride home and even brought his bike too. 

My mom was freaking out really hard trying to make sure that my brother wasn't too hurt so I was the one who was telling Nick like ""omg thank you so much"" and I kind of lost my mind and gave him a hug which I was worried he would think was totally weird because we don't really know each other but he hugged me back and was just so nice and gracious. Then Friday at school he came up and started asking me if my brother was ok, and were we able to get the bike fixed, and he told me that he really liked my hair which my friends thought was flirting but I don't know??

Anyways my mom baked cookies today for me to bring to school on Monday and give to him as a thank you and my friend thinks that I should ask him out or at least say something flirty to make it obvious that I'm into him but what if he doesn't like me at all and is just being nice? I have only ever dated one guy before and he asked me out so I don't know what I'm doing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/jv0bbj/i_16f_have_a_crush_on_the_boy_17m_who_helped_my/,relationship_advice,2263,552,0.0

We live on the eastern side of the US. I work in an office making great pay. She is a trust fund kid, so she obviously makes more than me. 

Our marriage has been horrible since we walked out of the church. She had my location on at all times and would question me daily. 

When I saw that she had been sending lewd messages to men and women online. I would ask her about it and she would tell me that I was seeing things. 

It all came to a head three days ago. I questioned my wife about the messages and this time I continued to press her and this time I got her phone. 

I didn't need to read much. There were pictures and messages about them having sex. I told that I had seen the messages and she snapped. 

She picked up our lamp and hit me in the face. The glass is thick so it didn't break. I tried to get up and she hit me again, this time right in my groin. 

I stayed down because if I had gotten up, I might have ended up writing this story behind bars. I laid there while my wife gathered some things and took off.

 https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ioneid/would_i_38f_be_an_idiot_if_i_got_back_together/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Its been a few days now since I've posted and reddit has given me some solid advice especially the kind redditors who messaged me directly. I'm very grateful for this cause it helped me calm down and not give in to my impulses. 

The morning after I posted, I texted Mike saying that I needed time and space to think about everything. He then replied with ""I've waited 10 years, I can wait a bit longer"". My heart melted. 

When the kids woke up, our son was looking for his dad. He's at the age now where he pretty much idolized his dad. I get why though, Mike is an amazing dad. Our daughter gave me the stink eye all morning. 

After lunch, when our son was in his room playing video games, my daughter confronted me about Mike. She basically said how she knew there was something going on (guess we're not that sneaky) and that she didn't want our fighting to affect their lives. She thought we were fighting. 

Now, the divorce affected her but not as badly as expected. We made sure to get her counseling immediately after and made extra sure her life was as normal as possible. I'm not gonna delude myself and think she wasn't hurt by it but I'm pretty confident in saying we dealt with it pretty well. Or as well as we could.

I then had the conversation about how we weren't fighting but quite the opposite... We were thinking about getting back together. She thought about it for a while and said she was happy for us and hoped it was forever this time. 

The next day I dropped my kids off at my parents house so I could talk to Mike at his place. We had a long talk about how we felt about each other, what we plan to do about it going forward, and as many of you suggested what he planned to do next time we hit a rough patch especially since we plan on having a 3rd kid. He told me that the night he cheated still haunted him 10 years later. He told me how it wasnt worth it one bit and how it was the biggest mistake of his life. He said that if ever we hit a rough patch again, we would talk about it like adults. He even suggested we do couples counseling every now and then even when times are good. I liked this idea. There are some details about our conversation that I want to keep private but long story short we got back together. We are going to take it slow and in every step we take, we both agreed that our children would take priority over everything. He's not going to move in yet but he would spend a few nights a week at home with us. 

Later that night, we sat the kids down and broke the news. Daughter didn't say much cause she already knew but our son was over the moon. Since we divorced when he was a baby, the concept of both his parents being together was quite new to him. They obviously asked questions and we answered them. We're also planning on doing family counseling to help make the transition easier for everybody. 

Overall, I'm really happy right now. Mike made a mistake 10 years ago but I don't hold it against him and have completely forgiven him for it. I know he loves me now and won't cheat on me anymore. I'm back together now with the love of my life and father of my kids and I couldn't be happier. 

As I type this out, Mike is in the next room playing video games with our son. I'm not entirely sure what the future will look like but I'm happy he's back. 

Thank you reddit for the advice. It really helped with our talk and how we proceed going forward. I think I'll stay online for an hour or so to reply till the kids are asleep and he comes to bed then it's my turn to have fun.

ThrowRAeucalytustree,2020-07-24 13:10:00+00:00,My (23M) girlfriend’s (22F) diet is making her crazy. How to do I reason with her?,"ThrowRA - she uses reddit more than me.

I’ll just get right to it. About 2 and a half weeks ago, my girlfriend decided that she wanted to lose weight. I have no idea how much (she won’t tell me her start weight or any of her goals), but I’m guessing it’s in the realm of 20-25 pounds. It’s no secret to me that she’s overweight, but I like her the way she is and this is the only way that I’ve ever known her. 

Anyway, she signed up for that Noom program, which is basically an app for counting calories from what I understand. She eats a strict 1200 calories per day and drinks almost a gallon of water every day. In some ways it’s been good because I get a lot of home-cooked healthy dinners, but that’s beside the point. We’ve also started going on long walks (1+ miles) every other night or so, and she picked up some yoga off YouTube. 

The problem is, since beginning her diet, her self esteem has spiraled out of control. She wakes up every morning and weighs herself and then tells me that she “doesn’t deserve food today because I gained .2 pounds overnight,” “eating is overrated,” “why don’t you break up with me for someone pretty,” stuff like that. This morning, she texted me to say that she’s been waking up an extra 30ish minutes early before work so that she has time to get back in bed and cry after weighing herself so she doesn’t burst into tears at her desk “again.” It’s nuts. 

I’ve done a bunch of research and even met with a dietitian (a friend of mine) on her behalf, and I’ve learned more than I probably needed to about women and hormones and how birth control affects weight loss and all that nonsense, but she won’t listen to me when I try to reason with her. I just want to tell her that her body is in shock from the sudden adjustment in her eating habits and she needs to tough it out for 6 weeks. She doesn’t want to hear it, she’s too busy crying over a quarter of a pound and swearing up and down that she’s doomed to be ugly forever and I’m going to leave her for a “skinny legend.”

I love her, I really do. How do I reason with her?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hx1i21/my_23m_girlfriends_22f_diet_is_making_her_crazy/,relationship_advice,1024,2482,0.0

I wanted to thank people for giving me some good advice, she was hiding a lot from me. She has been bank rolling her parents way of life. I have only met her parents a few times and i am an idiot for not seeing it earlier.

Her dad isn't a doctor he is a dentist, and his practice has not really been profitable for a long time according to her. So she has basically been giving almost all of her paycheck to her family to cover this deficit. In general i think her parents are total pieces of shit, since last time i was there they were very well off (big house, multiple cars, etc). 

She showed me her finances, after i gave her an ultimatum that she needed to go to therapy for her penny pinching or i didn't see this relationship working out. She is more or less completely broke, she has no savings, no nothing. All the money goes to her parents.

I told her how wrong this is, and i told her how wrong it is for her to project this unhealthy behavior onto how i spend my own money. I also fully told her i am going to move out when her lease is up into an apartment that is suitable for two adults constantly working from home, and i told her we can move out together, but i am not going to be forcing myself to her extreme frugal behavior.

Her reasoning behind all this is basically she has this huge feeling of debt to her parents, and she ""doesn't need nice things to be happy"". 

I don't really know what is going to happen but today we ordered fancy delivery food something we haven't done in ages, and i paid for it without her making a fuss. She has also agreed to see a a therapist, but she isn't fully set on atleast reducing the fact she is giving basically 90% of her paycheck to her parents. 

I don't know, i don't really get it and i probably went about this the wrong way, but it is something. 

TL;DR; SO has been bankrolling her parents lavish life style, she has no real savings or anything.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hwsfok/update_so_29f_is_frugal_to_the_point_where_i_30m/,relationship_advice,1230,469,0.0
ThrowRA_painfulpussy,2020-07-23 23:38:59+00:00,"My (24F) Boyfriend (26M) Keeps Pranking Me, and I'm At My Breaking Point [NSFW]","It all started around a week ago, I went to the grocery store to get some things we needed, and when I got home, I went to put the stuff in the fridge. As I was about to close the door, I got whipped cream smashed on my face. I got annoyed at first, but hearing my boyfriend laugh made me laugh, and all was good. I needed a shower after interacting with other people at the store anyway. It's fine.

I thought it would stop there, but I was wrong. The pranks he did were something from a YouTube video on pranks or something, I swear, they were so annoying, but I handled them at first as playful banter.

They ranged from putting tape on the doorways so I ran my face into them, to toothpaste in my Oreos, to the whole ""standing backwards in front of the fridge with a hoodie on so he can pull it down and scare me"" and I was getting irritated at this point. They happened a few times a day, and I was about to murder him. I couldn't do anything without fear of being pranked.

Two days ago, I sat him down and told him he's had his fun, he's 26, he needs to grow up, it's annoying now, I'm not laughing anymore. It was fine the first 30 times, but I'm tired. He said ok, and I thought that was the end of it.

But no. Yesterday he asked for some toilet paper, and as I was about to give him it, he put ""poop"" on my hand, expecting me to freak out. I simply walked away to wash it off. Even if it *was* real poop, I've babysat, I can handle some poop. I told him again to stop and started crying in the middle of it because I was fed up. He hugged me, gave me kisses, and apologized and said he'd stop. I made some dinner (with no interruptions thankfully), we ate, and went to sleep.

Then this morning, he was awake before me, so he made some breakfast. Nothing wrong with it, it was delicious. After I finished, things started getting a bit heated, and pretty soon we were doing the deed. I started to feel a tingle *down there*, but I ignored it. Pretty soon it was burning. When I say burning, I mean **burning**. The motherfucker had rubbed jalapenos on his hand (from breakfast) intentionally, and rubbed it on me. In the middle of sex. Right while I was about to finish. He laughed.

I blew up on him and told him he was a piece of shit, and what he's doing isn't funny, it's childish and immature. I'm not one to cuss, but boy did I explode. With my ruined orgasm, and all the bullshit, I kicked him out of the house and told him not to come back unless he's acting his age.

I'm lost at what to do here, having a conversation with him isn't going to work, I'm not petty enough to prank him too, and I don't know if this is worth breaking up over. I'm sitting on a towel with some milk right now, it's wayy better than in the morning. I need help, I'm lost.

Thanks for reading this long ass post, any advice is appreciated.

Edit: Annndd, there's vodka in my mouthwash. Of course.

Edit #2 There was no camera in the room recording, because I told him to leave, and he didn't get the chance to touch anything else. I have an update ready and typed up, I tried to post it, but the mods said it hasn't been more than 48 hours since my last post, so I'll post it later. He should be home soon, so I'll have my second update up in a few days. Thanks for all the love and encouragement.

ThrowRAhebephile,2020-07-23 19:45:57+00:00,UPDATE: Boyfriend(29M) admitted that I am the oldest girlfriend(21F) he's ever had and now I want to break up with him,"I could not post an update on the original post because it got removed after reaching a cap.

It has been a difficult time to be honest, my world has been turned upside down and I have been reeling from everything that happened. I cannot link to the previous post, but basically my 29 year old boyfriend nonchalantly admitted to dating a 15 y.o(when he was 27) and a 17 y.o(when he was 28) before he got with me.

I had been staying over at his place for the week and when I woke up from what i could only describe as a depression nap he was already in his home office working. I took the opportunity to pack my things and brace myself for what I was about to do. A part of me was still very much in denial of him being a predator and so I opted to fix breakfast so that I could get him to talk about it more and find out the true extent of these relationships.

I brought up his ex whilst we were eating, and he was more than inclined to talk about her. She went to the same high school as his sister (20F), and  that is how he met her. My now ex boyfriend makes a 6-figure salary and he drives a really flashy car, which he says was the reason she approached him, ""to check it out"". He continued to insist that she threw herself at him, and used him for his money when they finally got together. I asked him about the girls parents, and he said he met them and that they clearly didn't like him, but ""as long as their daughter was happy, they were alright with it"" that particular line did me in, but he harped on about how the dad never let him near his other kids and how much convincing it took for her parents to finally be alright with her sleeping over at his place.

He says that they broke up because she found someone wealthier and she dumped him. He apparently met the The second girl(17F) he dated online. I asked for specifics and he said she lied about her age on Tinder because she was turning 18 soon anyways (she apparently specified this in her bio) and they just ""clicked"" but he was only looking for a rebound - so they didn't ""really date"" they just ""fucked"" (his exact words). That apparently lasted a month until she dumped him as well.

When I asked him if he prefers girls in that age range he said ""for sex yes, but obviously I want a more mature woman to grow old with"" and he looked at me as if that statement was supposed to somehow reassure me, or make me feel better. I couldn't act passive anymore after that and I told him I do not think I am the woman he is going to grow old with. An argument ensued and he told me i was a ""horrible fuck anyways"" and ""How dare you accuse me of such a horrible thing, you're sick"" when I told him his proclivity for young girls was not normal and it might do him some good to get help for it. I grabbed my bags and drove back to my apartment.

Hindsight truly is 20/20 because so many red flags are glaring me in the face. I am petit (5'4, 120lbs) and he always liked how small I was, he constantly commented on it (I am not saying this is wrong, people have preferences but looking at the entire series of events, this is a bit eerie). There were a few times where he told me I remind him of his ex and even though it made me feel uneasy, i just dismissed it as him having a 'type', I also didn't know at the time that she was a teenager. He has been insistent on me moving in with him and quitting my job because he makes enough money for both of us to live comfortably and he made it sound so romantic - I was genuinely considering it (I think he might have been trying to isolate me, he already didnt like most of my friends). He was also very emotionally manipulative, all the times he has ever guilt tripped me or used the things I told him in confidence against me, all came rushing into my mind. I am starting to see how far from perfect our relationship was, and I am sick to my stomach thinking about it all.

We are in Washington and I do not know how I can possibly stop him from doing this to someone else because I have no evidence and I am afraid my claims will be dismissed if i report him. I am also concerned about how this will affect the victims in this case, is it really alright for me to report something on their behalf? I would like some advice on this, the guilt will eat me up if I do nothing.

tl;dr - I dumped my boyfriend because he didn't see anything wrong with him dating teenagers, but now I do not know how to stop him from victimizing even more young girls.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hwmll2/update_boyfriend29m_admitted_that_i_am_the_oldest/,relationship_advice,12802,2484,0.0

We went into foster care for a few months, then my parents adopted me. He was adopted a few years later by his parents too.

My parents never told me I had a brother and not only never attempted for us to spend time together but they declined when his parents came forward and wanted my parents to let us get to know each other when we were kids. And my parents picked a new name for me.

I never knew any of this until last year when he approached me. Parents denied at first but eventually admitted to everything. Since then we’ve been getting to know each other and getting close.

Since Covid hit I’ve been spending a lot of time with him and we’ve been bonding very well. He has two moms who are great too, they’re very nice to him and me and always make me feel welcome and relaxed.

My parents are upset about all of this and keep telling me that I should keep my distance, I’m doing it too fast, I’m trusting him (and his parents) too soon, I’m gonna end up hurting myself (really?) and things like that.

They also don’t like it that I’ve developed an attachment to my birth name and he does call me by that name and I like it. I think this is even more of a big deal for them than anything else.

And then there is my grandma who hates my brother with a burning passion who thinks I dress too inappropriately in front of him because “girls shouldn’t wear thin clothes, robes or swimsuits in front of stranger boys” as if he’s just a random guy to me. She lives with us and if he comes over she always plays detective to figure out what we’re doing together. Her objections are that I dress too immodestly, we laugh too much, we sit or lay down on bed too close together, and worst of all we close the door when we’re in my room (yeah because she doesn’t respect our privacy). I should go to jail for these serious crimes!

So last night parents and grandma had a sit down with me to voice their concerns. They accused me of forgetting about my real family and losing my soul (what does that even mean). They say they’re worried about me and will only allow me to continue spending time with I’m if I agree to three boundaries:

1. I am always to be referred to by the name that parents picked, rather than birth name.
2. I should be a lot more careful about what I wear in front of him (this is grandma’s rule). She wants me to basically dress like her. I don’t think my parents care about this rule as much. 
3. My time with brother must be surprised by my parents or grandma. That means no going out or at his place or with door closed.

I find all these rules to be very unreasonable and I find their objections to be childish (and I think my grandma needs help). How do I keep the peace while seeing my brother?

tl;dr: parents didn’t tell me I have a twin brother and didn’t let us grow up knowing each other. Now they’re upset that we’re bonding and want me to follow stupid rules.

My wife and I got into a huge fight because we were talking about having kids and she said she wanted to be a stay at home mom.

This had never been agreed upon before and I said no, because I would have to up my hours, which I don’t want to do. I said that she could take her maternity, and maybe the first year off, but after that she would have to work. We fought for a while and then I finally gave in a little and said that she could be a stay at home mom if she did 100% of all the chores and cooked very night. I basically shouldn’t have to lift a finger.

She got very upset at this suggestion and tried to kick me out of the house and said not to come back unless I’m going to apologize. I’ll admit what I did next was rude but that’s not the point. I called her a bitch and said she couldn’t kick me out since I own the house(it’s my parents old house). She was drinking a beer and hit me in the head with it and then kneed me in the balls and literally pushed me out the front door and locked it. I was tempted to break back in but I figured a neighbor would call the police and get me shot.

I don’t even know what to do now. There’s no way I’m groveling to be let into my own fucking house but at the same time I can’t live with my friend forever. What do I even do?

Edit: a lot of people are calling me entitled and a slaver, but I just don’t want to work 70 hours a week. I don’t see how not wanting her to quit her job is entitled. And I don’t see how expecting her to make my life easier if I’m working 70 hours a week is entitled.

Thank you all for your comments and advice. I’m glad to know I wasn’t overthinking the situation.

I called Tori yesterday and gave her the opportunity to meet up, apologize and explain more in depth. She accepted my offer and we had lunch at a nearby restaurant today. Some of you guessed that the reason that she didn’t want me at her job was because she could’ve been hiding something. That was correct. 

She told me that she was indeed having an affair with a coworker. I didn’t buy it at all. It just didn’t make sense because if that was the case, why would she tell her husband that she sabotaged me rather than keep that to her self? Turns out that my husband was pressuring him for answers as well and her husband kept “reminding” her to ask her boss why I didn’t get the job. That’s when she told him what she did. She also gave him a completely different explanation of why she didn’t want me working there. She showed me months of steamy texts and sexts between her and her coworker so I knew then that she was telling the truth. 

I asked her why she didn’t just tell me? She said that she was scared that people at her job would ask me questions and it would come out that she’s married. The guy at her job that she’s been seeing doesn’t even know and thinks they are in an exclusive relationship. She said that if I found out about the affair, she was afraid that I’d tell my husband and since our husbands are best friends, he would tell hers. She gets together with her coworker for a few hours after work and on weekends. Apparently, she doesn’t even work weekends! Her husband thinks that she is at work all this time. She said that having me work there would ruin things as our schedules wouldn’t add up and it would get back to her husband and he would question her about why.

I asked her why would she have me apply and say that she would get me in knowing she had no intentions of having me work with her??? She said that she didn’t think I’d really take her up on her offer as I’ve made comments before about her work sounding boring and that she was really hoping that if she dragged it out long enough, I’d get tired of waiting and look elsewhere. 

The million dollar question that I asked her was: what did you say to your boss to change her mind about offering me the job? She said she told her boss that having me work there would honestly probably just be a distraction and she wouldn’t perform her best and that I was known to be lazy and a slacker. (Definitely not true) she DID offer her sincere apology and said that she felt terrible knowing what all Jon and I were going through and she didn’t help. But I just can’t see myself forgiving her or even trusting her again after this situation. 

Basically the best friend that I have known all these years has turned into a complete stranger! I feel like I don’t even know her anymore. This isn’t someone I want in my life. Especially after she caused me to look foolish by badmouthing me to her boss. I told her that our friendship was over and that she’d better have a talk with her husband because no way was I holding this back from mine. 

A few hours later, my husband got a call from hers. Tori told him the news and they are now separating and he will file for a divorce in the upcoming weeks. Tori is, believe it or not, moving in with her coworker. I haven’t heard from her since leaving the restaurant and honestly don’t plan on talking to her ever again. Almost 30 years of friendship gone over a string of lies. 

As for my husband, him and I had a long talk after revealing to me that he already knew what Tori did. I explained to him that it is NEVER okay to keep things like that from me, no matter what. I understand him and Matt have a very good friendship but me and my feelings should come first in future situations like this. He agreed and will eventually gain my trust back.

Edit: just to clear things up, my husband never knew about Tori’s affair. All he knew was that Tori sabotaged the job.
Also a lot of you are saying the coworker deserves to know and I agree. I emailed the HR department at her job and requested a meeting with the woman I had a phone interview with. The meeting is Friday and I will tell her then, about Tori’s lie and about the affair and I will let her handle it how she wants to from there. After this, I’m completely done with her.

Edit 2: a lot of you think that me talking to her boss is a bad idea. If anything, I probably won’t bring up the affair situation, but I do want to bring it to her attention that Tori lied to her. I don’t think her boss would appreciate having employees that would easily lie to their face to cover up shady stuff that they’ve been doing. I may just send her an email with that part of the recording attached and a quick explanation instead of going to meet her. And yes, I recorded our encounter. If I figure out how, I could possibly post it if anyone would be interested in hearing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hvwgo7/update_my_28f_best_friend_29f_since_birth_gave_me/,relationship_advice,8793,1286,0.0

ThrowRA_SB,2020-07-22 08:50:34+00:00,[Update] How Can I (20F) Tell My BFF (20F) That I'm Sleeping With Her Father (46M) And Not Lose Them Both? [Advice Please][Long},"Hello, all. Update time.

Link to the original post for those who want it:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/hrhsbf/how\_can\_i\_20f\_tell\_my\_bff\_20f\_that\_im\_sleeping/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hrhsbf/how_can_i_20f_tell_my_bff_20f_that_im_sleeping/)

So, I was awake late into the night after making the post and reading everyone's comments. I appreciate everyone who weighed in with something other than reminding me that I'm a horrible, fucked-up piece of shit as a person. I had come to that conclusion on my own but it was nice to have it verified. So, thanks.

I gave a lot of thought to the questions posed to me from  *helloiseeyou2020* and came to some conclusions.

I want to get better.

The day after posting I was visibly bothered by deep thoughts at work and one of my coworkers was concerned and asked me about what was bothering me. So... I told her the whole story. Together we looked into if my insurance would cover therapy. It does and even with COVID making it a video-chat-only kind of deal I started yesterday at lunch (Tuesday the 21st).

I decided to GTFO of the situation as well. I moved out of the house this past weekend and into a spare room that one of my coworkers offered for me to use until I can get some money together to relocate once the pandemic ends and I can get a transfer to a different branch. Hopefully out of state. This is awkward and life just took a crazy turn but I'm told that getting through this mess that I made will make me a better person in the end.

I spent Friday night down at the shore at my grandpa's house so I could be somewhere that I love and feel safe at for the next part:

I called Kate.

It went like anyone would expect. No lies. Worst conversation I've ever had. I told her when it was all said and done that I wasn't expecting her to ever forgive me as I don't know if I deserve it. She knows that I'm not there anymore and I'm going to try my hardest to put as much distance as possible between me and her family ASAP. I ended the call by telling her that I won't be initiating contact any more. I'm going to give her all the space and time that she needs, even if that means I'll never talk to her again.

I really do love her more than life itself and I hope that we can eventually recover but I doubt we will.

This is my own fault and I'm trying to take accountability, here.

Thanks for the input, everybody.

ThrowRA7649,2020-07-22 01:30:24+00:00,My ex boyfriend (24) and his fiancee are forcing me (18) to have an abortion,"It's pretty long but I needed to tell someone. 

My ex is my brother's friend and they've been friends since middle school so I have known him for a while now. Since my brother moved out when he went to college I haven't really seen him. My brother also cut the family out of his life and I haven't seen him in 2 years. 

Last year I ran into him (ex) at the mall and we caught up and exchanged numbers. Turns out he's not friends with my brother anymore, don't know why. Fast forward and we end up dating. 

Things were great at first and he was really a sweetheart. I didn't see him very often and he told me it was because of work. He wouldn't invite me over much and often refused when I asked to go ( I don't think she lives with him, I have never seen her things). I thought it was a little weird but I thought that maybe he was really that busy. Now I feel really stupid. 

He would always say that he would love it if I moved in but it wasn't the time yet. I found out that I was pregnant and I'm ashamed to admit that I instantly thought that it would make him spend more time with me and I'll also be able to move in with him. I went to a doctor and found out I was 10 weeks along. 

After my doctors visit I called and asked to go over to his place. He actually said yes. I told him the news and it's like he changed into a different person. He told me to get rid of it and when I refused he pushed me and got in my face saying that if I didn't do it he would do it himself. I was so scared and confused because this was not like him. I cried and begged but he told me to get out.

I didn't want to get an abortion at all even if that meant I was going to be a single mom. I made a Facebook account and I found his mom I stalked her page a bit and saw a picture of her, my ex and another woman captioned something like my son and new daughter. I stalked the woman's page and found out that she was his fiancee and they've been together for years. I realized that he never cared about me since all of this is public. I made the impulsive choice and messaged his fiancee and told her everything. She read the messages but never responded. 

I didn't hear from any of them for a few more weeks so I assumed that they didn't care. At 15 weeks I got a call from my ex. He told me how sorry he was and that he ended things with his fiancee and wants us to be a family. Again because I'm stupid I fell for it.

When I got to his place his fiancee was there. I was confused but before I could say anything his fiancee jumped me and accused me of being a homewrecker and wanting to ruin their lives. He just watched as she hit me over and over again. She was about to stomp on my belly but he stopped her. He told me that this was my final warning before he takes it into his own hands and he'll make it as painful at possible. 

It's been about 2 weeks and I'm terrified. No one knows about it and I'm scared that if I call the cops on them there's a chance that they won't get in trouble. I have very little faith due to previous encounters.

Luckily there's nothing wrong with the baby but one part of me wants to get the abortion so this can be done and over with. I really don't want to but I'm so scared. 

I know this is a lot but what do I do? I'm freaking out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hvkg8h/my_ex_boyfriend_24_and_his_fiancee_are_forcing_me/,relationship_advice,2723,1326,0.0

Op: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/htzv84/my\_31m\_wife\_30f\_says\_i\_dont\_have\_the\_right\_to\_be/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/htzv84/my_31m_wife_30f_says_i_dont_have_the_right_to_be/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

I want to first of all say thank you for the help and advice. I tried reading as many comments as I could. It’s a lot to get through and I appreciate the help.

I read a few comments that sort of blamed me for my wife’s reaction and assumed that I treated her pregnancy and the birth as if it wasn't a big deal. I'm not sure where I implied that. When I say that the pregnancy went smoothly I meant that the doctors never found any medical problems and that both of my girls were healthy. I have never once and never will dismiss that experience. If I treated everything she went through like it ""wasn't a big deal"" I wouldn't even be here asking how I can make things better for her. I also never even equated our pain I believe what I wrote is "" I know she has it worse than me because she carried our angel and gave birth to her.” And “I know that my wife is hurting which is why she's reacting that way. How do I support her better but also let her know how I feel in a way that doesn't seem like I'm taking away from her?” I’m not sure where I equated our pain. If anything I am diminishing my own pain in order to support her or at least I tried to.  Even after what she said I wasn’t mad at her. I was hurt but I wasn’t mad. I know she said it out of pain. It still hurts. I didn’t need to read that I’m a piece of sh\*t husband that doesn’t care for my wife because I’m also grieving the loss of our daughter.

I see her every day. I see the pain that she is in. I hear it. I can’t begin to imagine it and I never will be able to understand it. I know that what she is going through is worlds different than me. If I could take all her pain and put it on me believe me I would. No question. What I also didn’t need to read is how my wife is “evil” and other countless mean words. That wasn’t the point of my post. It wasn’t to boost my ego and to bash my wife. It’s incredibly rude and unhelpful in every way. I asked a question because I was at a loss and didn’t know how to proceed. My wife isn’t a bad person at all. She’s an amazing woman and she honestly deserves the world. She doesn’t deserve this at all. Thank you to those of you who acknowledged what she said but also didn’t speak ill of her. It doesn’t make me feel any better having people say those things about her. She’s not abusive or a monster. It made me sick reading those comments. It’s upsetting that I even have to say this but it’s the internet, I get that.

Apologies for the rant I just wanted to let off some steam.

I've always felt the need to be ""superman"". When I was 16 I lost my father and it was extremely hard on my mother and I. I had to be her rock then or I would've lost her too. This caused me to act out in ways people would call ""evil"" to others around me. I've lost friends because of that. I held it in at home for my mom and it came out in an ugly way. I can understand why my wife is reacting this way and I'm not going to leave her over this. I wasn't planning on it. I want to be there for her but I don't think I can be there for her the way I have been. I can't carry the weight of both our pains on my shoulders anymore. I'm barely holding on right now. I feel like I'm in a speeding car with no steering wheel or brakes.

I haven't mentioned anything to my wife about her comments and I don't think I will right now. I'll be looking into some counseling dealing with this type of situation. I also want to look into some counseling for ppd for my wife. I’ve heard stories of how heartbreaking it could be when it isn’t taken seriously. I don’t even want to imagine it. I hope we find the help we both need and that we can come together eventually.  Our friends and family have been by her side as well. They call and text her often. Her mom and sister come over too. I’m happy that she is getting extra support. I wish I was doing more for her myself. It didn’t occur to me how me crying in her presence could make her feel worse. I feel guilty now like I’m failing her. It would be nice to get a check in from our loved ones once in a while but she needs it more so it’s ok, I want her to get the most help. I’ll use the counseling.

As stupid as it may sound, having strangers tell me that it's ok to cry made me tear up a bit. The only person in my life who has told me that is my father. Whenever I would get hurt as a kid instead of telling me don't cry, he'd say that it's ok to do so. He's the type of man and father I aspire to be. Hopefully, with the outside help I will be stronger for my wife. Thanks again. I love my wife and I want us to get through this and come out stronger together. I love my daughter and she will forever be my first born.

ThrowRA-wifeconundr,2020-07-21 17:54:34+00:00,My [32M] wife [30F] was assaulted in the process of cheating on me,"Three days ago, my wife told me that she was assaulted by two men two weeks ago. While initially comforting her, I asked her to recount what happened so we can contact police and etc and while she was hesitant to speak at first, said she invited two men over while I was out of town so she could cheat on me. She said they were from Craigslist adult personals.

I asked if she was sure and maybe she was just shellshocked and she said it's the truth. Within 30 seconds I was out the door and left to stay with my parents. I didn't tell them what happened, just my wife and I are taking a break. I plan to file for divorce.

But even if my parents don't know, a few of my wife and I's mutual friends do know. And they think I should be supportive of my wife because she ""technically didn't cheat"". To me, she has. She invited them over, and, well, they had sex. I don't know how to word this but the invitation was cheating and anything after the fact is ancillary. I'm being torn to shreds by people who I thought were close friends because they think her being assaulted matters more than the cheating.

I don't really know what to do. I believe my wife in her account of events. I had absolutely no idea anything happened. She could have kept everything from me and I wouldn't have been the wiser. Why open yourself up like that if you could get away with cheating scot-free? I say this not to absolve the men but to corroborate her account: she was assaulted, I believe this. But I don't think it matters or concerns me anymore because of the circumstances surrounding it.

My partner (31M) and I (31F) have a 9 month old baby. I will call my partner Jack. Jack went to pick up food for us real quick with our baby in the back of the car. From the window I saw them pull back up, and I went to the front door to unlock it and hold it open for them.

When he got out, he waved to a convertible car with the top down that was driving up, and the car stopped. I saw that it was two young girls. Jack starts talking to them, I don't hear the words, but assume they are asking for instructions or something. But this continues for almost 10 minutes and I start getting more and more confused.

I thought he still had the car running the whole time for AC for the baby. It is stifling hot today, 97 degrees at that time.

After a few minutes I sit on the couch for a bit. When I come back up to the door I see that one of the girls has her phone out and it looks almost like she is recording Jack, so I start to open the door a little. This is when I realize that I don't hear the car engine and it's off. I also never saw him check on the baby. I start to walk out to get the baby, and when the girls see me they pretty quickly say bye to Jack and leave. I hear one girl complain about not being able to film him doing his tricks.

Once inside, he tells me that they asked him about his job, which is in acrobatics, and they asked to see some stuff so he was showing them tricks he could do in the street...

I was furious about the baby, but my anger was completely overpowered by him. He starts yelling at me in front of the baby and our older child. Calls me an asshole for the first time ever in our relationship. I try to get him to calm down multiple times and stop yelling but it takes a while. Soon after he leaves to do random stuff at work (he was not scheduled) because he is so mad, and I don't know what to say to him later. He insists the baby was fine the whole time.

Please tell me if you think I have a right to be angry. I would really like an outside opinion before we talk again.

UPDATE: Since my last response, my partner came up to me and just went off for around 30 minutes about this. I feel so much worse now than I even did before. I told him I wanted to talk tomorrow but he kept going. 

He also guessed I posted on reddit because of me typing on the laptop a bunch. He went on and on about how stupid reddit is and how it's just an echo chamber and no one knows what they are talking about... I didn't confirm or deny that I had posted.

He still insists he did nothing wrong and that the baby was completely fine. He said he acknowledged that the conversation with the girls went on for too long, but that our son was never in danger. He said he knows science and chemistry and how these things work. He said babies can die in hot cars, yes, but this wasn't like that. 

He started trying to bring up other issues repeatedly, and I stayed really calm the whole time and told him I would not engage with him about any other issues. We could talk about them another time, but not now. He regularly scoffed and laughed at me even though I barely said anything during the whole conversation. 

He also said it's my fault he gets angry, it is only a reaction to me and he doesn't have that problem with anyone else. This I know for a fact is a lie because he has talked about trying to control his anger since he was a child to me numerous times before. I tried to say he was still responsible for himself, I told him I was upset too but not raising my voice in the slightest and he just laughed at me.

I guess I should really go to bed. I feel really lost and helpless. No matter how many times I calmly said, ""the issue is that you put our son in danger by leaving him in a car without running AC for 10 minutes"", he refuses to acknowledge any danger. I don't know what to say. Things weren't supposed to turn out this way. 

Even if I don't respond to your comment, I have read everything and I truly appreciate it. I will try to respond a little more tonight and then tomorrow. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/huuurc/boyfriend_31m_left_baby_sitting_in_the_car_with/,relationship_advice,1446,1115,0.0
throwRAapartmentbaby,2020-07-20 21:41:18+00:00,"Update: My (f22) best friend (f21) is moving in with me, but has now gotten pregnant and wants us to raise the baby together","Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hptbzd/one_of_my_f22_best_friends_f21_is_supposed_to/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

So this was not a big post at all, but one or two people asked for an update if there were any and so here I am again. 

For a quick recap: I am possibly going to rent the entire 4 bedroom apartment I currently sublet a room in sometime around September/October and two of my best friends are moving in. My friend Layla has gotten pregnant and were planning to move in with me and have the three of us taking care of the baby, as physically and financially. 

I took the advice someone gave to talk to my other future roommate Indy about it, and we both agreed that it was not something we wanted to do at all, and we decided to confront her about it together so she could understand it wasn't going to happen.

We got together at my place on Tuesday and had some tea. We just sat down and said that basically we were very worried about her and the scenario that she had in her head about us raising the baby together is just completely irresponsible and we don't want that at all. We decided to not lay out the whole thing about her mental health, job situation and all that because we didn't want it to feel like an attack on her but more just us setting some boundaries. 
She got really emotional and told us that she knew it was ridiculous but she was scared and in shock and really didn't know how to react or think straight. Apparently it wasn't even her idea to begin with but some of her other friends we don't know very well who came up with it and sorta pressured her to feel a certain way because they were extremely excited for her. 
She just said that she has been crying every day since she found out and she's so scared for the future and really just want everything to go back to normal. At that point we just said that we totally understand and we of course will be there for her no matter what she decides to do, but we really also felt that it would be a lot for her to be a mom under these circumstances. 

So yeah. She decided getting an abortion would be the best thing for her. She said her initial reaction was to terminate the pregnancy but she had a lot if guilt associated with that as she has been brought up in a very conservative family
I'd rather not hear anything about the morals of that decision, as I don't think that would really be helpful to the conversation. We told her that we would be with her every step of the way if she needed it, and so we both went with her to the doctors on Thursday to confirm she was pregnant and to find out the options. Since she is only 6 weeks pregnant she could get some pills to take over a 48 hour period and that would make the embryo detach. She got the first one at the hospital on Friday where we were there with her too, and then they both stayed over at my place the whole weekend for the rest of it since her parents still doesn't know and she didn't want to tell them. 
My roommate is conveniently on holiday with some of her friends for the rest of the week so we had the whole place to ourselves and nothing to explain to anyone. 
She took the other pill yesterday and everything seems to be going smoothly, she just has a heavy period basically, which coincidentally ligned up with both Indys and mine (TMI sorry) so we have all been laying in my bed with heating pads and Netflix being a little miserable together, but things are going well and the pain have not been too much for just regular painkillers. 
There has been some crying, lots of hugs and long talks and walks in the forrest and I feel like things are going to be okay. They're both staying here until my roommate gets back so she can get through this in a comfy environment without having to pretend nothing is wrong. 

So yeah, it seems like the plan of moving in together is back on as originally planned, and everything will be okay. Layla was offered some counseling at the hospital about getting through an abortion and the feelings about it which she is starting some time next week.

Thank you so so much for the people who gave me advice when I needed it. This outcome is better than I could have imagined and I wouldn't have thought of doing it this way if it wasn't for you guys so thank you ❤❤


Edit: 

This got a lot more attention than I thought it would, given that my original post had 7 upvotes and 9 comments, so a bit of an overwhelming read this morning, but thank you to everyone for commenting, I've read them all and I'm very moved by the overwhelming positivity! It feels really nice to know that you guys think we made the right call in going about it this way, and it means a lot to me that you think we are good friends ❤

I figured I'd just respond to some of the main comments/questions that I've received a lot so its all just here at the top.

So first off about getting an STI test; she already had that as part of the initial examination and she was all clear thank God!

Second about getting birth control, then she was apparently using condoms, which I didn't know when I made the original post, so correction there. Birth control pills are not an option as they don't react well with the particular type of medication she is already on. 

About her other friends, the ones who came up with the idea of us raising the baby together; a lot of people commented on how shitty friends they are, and I agree which is why they aren't my friends. Layla still likes them but she wants some distance. They have all grown up in the same church environment so I think she excuses their behavior because of that. They don't see abortion as an option so I think they were just trying to comfort her and look for a solution, though out of touch with reality. A lot of people suggested to tell them she had a miscarriage but we decided that telling them it was just a false pregnancy would be better because knowing them I would be worried that they might throw a memorial party or something of the sort for her and I just don't think that would be helpful at all. We've written a draft for the group text she has with them but I think she will wait a bit to send it out. Indy and I are just staying silent on the matter, I don't feel like it is my story to tell or not tell and I wouldn't be comfortable lying about it, so as far as we are concerned, she just had a false positive pregnancy test and that's all we know.

Someone brought up about health insurance and if it would be possible that her parents could find out that way, but we live in a country with a free health care system so that was thankfully not a concern. 

And lastly; some people brought up that she shouldn't move in because she sounds unreliable and irresponsible. I will definitely agree that she was out of touch with reality for a while there but seeing how difficult of a time this has been for her I really don't blame her at all. I would probably have done something equally crazy if I was in that position. I have probably also made her sound a bit worse than she is because I was pretty annoyed with her when I wrote the first post. She is normally a very responsible and reliable and I trust her completely with moving in as I wouldn't have asked her in the first place if I didn't think she could find a job and pay rent, just I did not think she would be able to do that with a child too. 

On just a final note; I didn't really want to have the morals of the decision to terminate the pregnancy discussed but I guess that's inevitable. I'm surprised by the number of people being supportive and finding comfort in the way we went about it and talking about their own experiences. That makes me happy to see. 
To the people who disagree then I'm not going to have that discussion. It's not my choice to make or to decide between right and wrong and if you want to judge me or my friends for making the choices we thought to be right then you can just go ahead and do that.

To everyone wishing us the best I wish you the best right back and I'll make sure to give her hugs from all of you ❤",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/huufju/update_my_f22_best_friend_f21_is_moving_in_with/,relationship_advice,20822,1731,1.0
ThrowRAMessag,2020-07-20 21:25:32+00:00,My [26M] wife [24F] is going on a business trip with a male coworker who sent her a suspicious text. I need help.,"So first things first. About a week ago, my wife's phone was on the coffee table while she was in the kitchen. It buzzed and I looked at it. It was a text message from someone named Alex with the message ""I bet you do"" and a winky face emoji. I figured it was one of her girl friends from work gossiping so I brushed it off.

Now fast forward. Earlier today my wife told me that she has to go on a business trip about 200 miles away. I thought this was incredibly strange, because she has never had to travel for work before and with the coronavirus going on, I don't know why her bandage manufacturing company would need her to travel. Because of these intuitive curiosities I asked a lot of questions, which made her a little irritated. One question I asked her was how many people were going - she said three. Her, Alex, and Barbara. The name Alex brought back the memory of that text, and all of a sudden I got a little worried that maybe it wasn't what I had originally interpreted it to be.  So I asked ""Just you three girls,"" and she said ""Well, no, Alex is a man."" We continued the conversation. I didn't want to let on that I saw her text message from earlier.

Now I was a bit paranoid so I called up her company and asked to speak to Barbara in my wife's department. The receptionist told me that nobody named Barbara worked in that department. I was crushed and just hung up because I couldn't come up with anything to say after that shock.

Now I need to know - what is going on? What should I do? My marriage feels shaken to the core all of a sudden.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/huu567/my_26m_wife_24f_is_going_on_a_business_trip_with/,relationship_advice,1091,683,0.0

ThrowRA_1083,2020-07-20 09:37:24+00:00,I (17F) was assaulted less than a week ago and my mother (41F) is forcing me to 'move on',"Six days ago I was sexually assaulted. The people in question followed me to a small stream leading onto a park I was walking to, then proceeded to grab and grope me, hit me and tell me they were going to rape me, and try to forcibly remove my clothes. Thankfully a couple walked by and saw what was happening, and got me out of the situation. I was taken back to my home and I called the police, then a report was filed.

Two days later my mother forced me to go on a walk with her, and told me I was 'being dramatic'. I had a panic attack halfway through the walk because I was worried that it would happen again,as we were near where it happened. My mother told me that I just needed to 'move on' and 'carry on with life'. I tried to explain that it wasnt that easy, and that I couldnt 'move on' less than two days after it happened. She proceeded to get extremely mad at me, and tell me that I 'wasnt even sexually assaulted'. She didn't believe I was, even though the police told us it was sexual assault becuase they had grabbed and touched me without consent. She still wouldnt listen.

This continued up to the point where she got so mad at me that she wouldnt speak to me. My father tried to calm her down, but he ended up siding with her and agreeing that I should 'move on'. We haven't properly spoken in three days now, and they wont speak to me until I 'move on'.

I don't know what to do, I can't move on as easily as that. I wont get into details about what happened to the boys, but they were taken into police custody. My mother also uses that as an excuse to get me to move on, and she tells me they cant hurt me anymore. I can't just move on, I can't and my mother doesn't understand. She wont let me go to therapy, or talk to anyone that can help me, she just says I need to 'suck it up'. I don't know what to do.

 Can anyone give me advice on how to make her understand I can't move on as quickly as that, and that I need time to heal?

ThrowRA_idkhelp12921,2020-07-19 23:29:48+00:00,"SO [29/f] is frugal to the point where i [30/m] cannot handle it anymore, i did groceries alone today and she is in tears because i spent 8 dollars more then her ""budget"".","We have been dating for around 3 years now, and moved in togther a year and a half ago. Back then she was somewhat of a penny-pincher, and always insisted on instead of eating out we would buy or make something (which i was okay with because we both love to cook). Lately with COVID she has gone from bearable to completely and utterly pinching every penny.

We both work in tech and we make great money. To give some context with live in NYC and her monthly budget is less then $600, including rent, utilities etc. The rest of the money goes somewhere i am not privy to her finances. However we both have no real debt at this point. 

Right now we live in a TINY and i mean TINY bachelors. Originally i moved in with her and we had plans to get a proper apartment when her lease was up, rather then me signing another new lease. However that plans have gone on hold due to COVID and her paranoia about job security (she works for a very stable company). 

Lately she has become one of those extreme couponers, even if it is just saving a few dollars here and there. Today the grocery store was extremely busy, and i didn't want to fiddle with the coupons/etc that she gave me. So i just said screw it. The result was the cost going about 8 dollars over our ""weekly"" budget. I really didn't care at all since i was paying for the groceries.

When i got home she immediately took the receipt and started to get very upset about how i overspent, etc. I said i paid for groceries and she started to get very upset. 

I tried this afternoon to sitdown with her and ask her to explain why she is being so extremely frugal and her response is that she isn't sure of the ""future"" for her career and needs to pinch every penny. The thing is by my math she has saved a ton of money up. 

I know she sold her stock options last year, for a fairly large amount. I just cannot understand how she considers herself so poor. The other thing that is bothering me, is that she didn't grow up in a poor family or anything. Her family is extremely well off from what i have seen. 

She doesn't seem to want to discuss her financial situation and i am struggling to understand where this is coming from. 

What can i do?

Update: I showed her my finances and asked her to share hers because i said her behavior is not healthy. She refused to show me anything. She says she doesn't have any sort of debt, and asked me to trust her about it. It doesn't make me feel happy. 

TL;DR SO's frugalness is becoming unbearable, she doesn't want to explain why she is becoming so paranoid about money lately, when we are both extremely well off.

throwRA78wdhsg,2020-07-19 22:50:45+00:00,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat,"I can't believe I'm about to type this but here we go.

I've been dating my GF for 7 months. She's amazing and we're super compatible in a lot of ways. She is an outspoken vegan, and she made it clear at the start of our relationship that it was important to her that any potential had similar cruelty-free values. Me, already being a pescatarian, had little difficulty transitioning to a fully plant based diet. My GF was proud of me for going cruelty free and everything seemed well. We became ""the vegan couple"" on our college campus.

Then there is my cat, Mittens... I've had her for three years and I adore her. She's such a sweet and cuddly cat. However, my GF was always a little apprehensive around her, and she blamed it on not growing up around cats. After a while we sort of made a tacit agreement to mostly hang out at her apartment instead of mine, so Mittens never really came up again in conversation.

Fast forward through all the quarantine stuff... My gf and I have spent a lot of time together during this pandemic and we've started talking about taking our relationship to the next level. We began seriously looking at either buying a new apartment together or having one of us move in with the other.

However, after a lot of talking and planning, my GF sat me down and dropped a bomb shell on me. She said that with this next phase of the relationship, she did not see a future with me unless I was willing to give away Mittens. She said that she believed owning a cat is unconscionable for vegans, because they hunt mice and eat meat, and because the very act of owning a pet is a violation of vegan principles.

I was stunned. I told her that I was absolutely not willing to give up Mittens, and she had no choice but to eat meat so I was reducing harm as much as possible by buying reputable brands of cat food. Plenty of vegans own cats and think along those same lines. My gf got mad and said ""how much flesh does your cat eat? How many animals died to make all that food? Would you be okay with that being human flesh?""

I got mad and told my GF that I would have really appreciated her telling me about her cat opinions before we got serious. She went on and on about cats killing animals. I ended the conversation there. I was so angry that I left my gfs apartment. And I snuggled with Mittens when I got home! Although the mood soured a bit when my GF sent me a link to a Reddit thread advocating for the extinction of domestic cats. Sigh

I think it goes without saying that I am not going to get rid of my cat. However, it pains me to think that an otherwise wonderful relationship could be ending because of a difference in ideology. I don't even really understand where my GF is coming from because like I said, a lot of vegans own cats. Now granted, cat ownership can be a controversial topic in vegan circles and I probably would not have gotten a cat if I had been vegan at the time, but I have Mittens now, and she deserves to eat. (Yes, I've researched vegan cat food, but Mittens has some digestive issues and my vet strongly cautions against it.)

I've talked to some of my vegan and vegetarian friends and they all think my gf has lost her mind. Some have suggested that it's not about Mittens and my gf just wants an excuse to end it. They probably don't understand why I haven't broken up yet, but I care about my GF so much. I'd hate for this bizarre curve ball to be the end of a beautiful thing. I want to try and work something out.

Where do I even go from here? I will not compromise on Mittens and I don't think my GF will compromise either.

Edit: wow, this completely blew up while I was asleep. I am trying to read every comment but there are a lot. Also, please allow me to take this moment to reiterate that my GFs views are not representative of those held by the wider vegan community!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hu9xlv/my_22m_vegan_girlfriend_21f_wants_me_to_get_rid/,relationship_advice,21135,15734,2.0

ThrowRAoscar,2020-07-19 20:38:48+00:00,My 'girlfriend' gave birth to my son yesterday. I only found out an hour ago.,"Yeah sorry if this gets a bit 'ranty', I'm hella pissed and my friends aren't answering.

My gf Jesse (22f) and I (21m) got into an argument a week ago about something stupid. It was actually over our son's name, once again. She wanted to name him after her father but the name is awful and I don't want our son to have the name. She took it personally, got into an argument and she hasn't spoken to me since. Now here I was hanging out with my younger brother when I get a call from my mother who's in tears telling me her friend congratulating her about her new grandson who was born- wait for it- at fucking 9:43 am yesterday. I actually don't even know what's worse and more terrifying, my son being born almost a month and a half early or that I wasn't told about it. Apparently her parents are all there even. Just not me. I've checked my call log, messages, and even my fucking emails but there's nothing. Anger is an understatement to what I'm feeling right now. I don't understand how I wasn't called or informed possibly because of her pettiness. None of them are answering their phones. My dad just left to go to the hospital to see what's going on because I guess I'm too angry right now and he'll call me with more details and hopefully a picture.

I just don't know what to do right now.

UPDATE: Thanks to everyone who's responded. I do appreciate all the responses even though I haven't responded to every one of them.

Great news! I've just come back from finally meeting my son this morning. Long story short, she's at her parent's house and she called to say that I could come if I wanted to. It wasn't nearly what I expected or wished but at least I saw him and we got to hang out even though the little guy was sleeping the whole time. He's actually doing quite well for a premature baby (4 lbs for the win) so apart from a few breathing 'difficulties' he's pretty healthy. Jesse didn't want me to hold him to avoid waking him up so I just sat by the bed lightly playing with him and taking pictures. Still a special moment regardless. Unfortunately his name is Keeler which isn't that greatest but she did give him my name as his middle name. I personally don't even like my name but I appreciate the sentiment behind her decision so yeah. That's that. 

I did try to ask her more about why she didn't call me or let me know about the birth etc but she didn't really give any answers except a few shrugs and telling me to just leave it. She was actually weirdly cold towards me but also giving mixed signals at the same time so I'm not sure where our relationship is going. She very distant but at the same time she's also questioning me about when I'm getting a bigger place for our family. As much as I'm mostly over it, a part of me is still upset with her about this. But I do love her and probably love her more now than I did before so we'll just see how things go. Thinking back I probably should've included her in the photos I took with KJ. Probably should've brought a gift for the two of them as well but I can still do that when I see them again later this afternoon (suggestions welcomed).

So yeah, as much as I didn't get to hold him, I'm still fucking over the moon right now and can't wait for the next time I see him. Could probably still use more advice on what to do with Jesse though regarding our relationship.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hu7oci/my_girlfriend_gave_birth_to_my_son_yesterday_i/,relationship_advice,2464,1811,0.0

&amp;#x200B;

I ultimately decided against getting a secret camera set up because ironically enough I didn't want to betray my partner's trust. Though part of me wanted to get one to squash any worries of someone living in my walls, as per some comments said!

I did though plan to leave work early, which is something I've never done before. My boss allowed me to leave after a half-day.

Upon returning home, nothing seemed amiss. I was expecting another car on the drive or parked outside on the street. There was no other car I didn't recognise. Quietly letting myself in, I was immediately confused. In the hallway, there was a pair of shoes I didn't recognise, and not only that, they looked like men's shoes.

Standing in the hallway trying to work out what to do; if I should sneak around or make my presence known, before I could decide, my husband walked out of the kitchen with two cups of tea. By my husband's face it was obvious he was surprised to see me.

Playing along with naivete, I asked my husband how he could have known I was coming home early to make me tea? Expecting my husband to lie, he surprised me by sitting me down and explaining everything.

At the beginning of lockdown, his friend; someone I'm not all the close with because only met once, was evicted, lost his job, and had been couch surfing. So for some days over the past couple of weeks, this guy has been travelling to our house, and with the acceptance of my husband, using our bathroom to freshen up to attend interviews. He was also borrowing shirts and suits from my husband. As it turns out, my husband's friend has long hair and a beard.

So it turns out my husband isn't cheating on me but was hiding the fact his long-haired friend was coming over to use our shower. After his shower, I ended up meeting ""Dave"", and he turned out to be a very nice bloke just down on his luck. I wished him the best for his socially distanced interview and he went on his way.

I asked my husband why he didn't just tell me, as I wouldn't have had a problem with it. Turns out he was worried about my reaction and me not liking his friend or approving of the situation. He also told me Dave was very embarrassed about the whole situation and didn't want people to know what he was having to do. I told my husband I was starting to believe he was cheating and he was shocked, having not even considering those implications while attempting covering for his friend. I told him this whole thing was ridiculous and even suggested his friend live with us until he's back on his feet.

Funnily enough, my worst-case scenario which was mentioned in the replies was either a homeless man or woman living in my walls and sneakily using the shower. And though this seems to be half the case, I'm glad it wasn't a stranger as such that wasn't unwelcome and someone that wasn't living in my walls!

I started by asking her where did she get the ""advice"" that she saw on the internet that said that scaring blind people was a good thing to be done. She was very reluctant to tell me, but when I pressured her a little more she ended up telling me. Apparently there's is no article, no research, no elaborated study, nothing... The advice she got came from a friend of hers on facebook chat, and she just went along with it. She also told me she lied about her mother telling her that, to clarify, her mother is a social worker where we live, so she thought that if she said that her mother had also said that it would maker her ""friend"" advice a little more credible because she couldn't find any article or study. I tried to ask her about why would she think that her friend advice was good when she could nothing to corroborate it, she didn't want to answer.

I asked her them why would she ignore me when I told her to stop and kept scaring my brother. She told me that she didn't thought that I would find it that bad, and that if I really loved her I would just ignore it because she was trying to help and that she feels that I don't love her because I would choose my brother over her just because now he is a ""crippled"" (her own words) on something so ""trivial"", and that he should grow up and deal with his problems himself, and I as her girlfriend should be on her side allways. Of course I was very angry at this answer and we ended up getting on another fight. On her words I shouldn't have asked my brother to come live with me, but as I ended up asking he should just be quiet and obey and accept what we do because we ""know better"" for being adults.

Before going to her house I took some people advice and I decided to ponder abour our relationship until that moment. And looking back I could see a lot of things I believe I didn't want to see. First, every single approach on our relationship was taken by me... want a date? I was the one inviting her, let's go see a movie? I allways had to be the one to invite, romantic time? I had to start allways, looking back the entire relationship look's one sided... Second, she doesn't look like she care much about ""boundaries"" from the start, she disregarded every single boundarie I've had before, I never took much action about them because they were small things, I believe that if I had made myself more clear before it wouldn't get to a point where it would cause problems to my brother.

I made a decision, I didn't want to break up, but if we were to continue a relationship with her, all of this would have to change. I talked with her and told her that I didn't want to break up, but if we were to continue a relationship, first she would not be allowed near my brother and wouldn't be welcome to my house when my brother is there, second she would have to apologise to him and promise and this time respect that promise, that what was done wouldn't happen again, and third she would have to go to counseling with me. Those where my terms and if we were to continue together things had to change.

She got mad at me, cursed me, told me I was and idiot to choose family over her, and that I was crazy to end a relationship over this, I talked with her about those things I mentioned earlier and she call me stupid, that this is what a ""good relationship"" look's like. Of course we got on another fight.

In the end she wasn't willing to compromise and make the relationship work. So, I decided to end things... yep we broke up, of course I left her house being called a lot of names, I blocked her on both my cellphone and social media, and right now I'm focusing on my brother. It hurts a lot that the person that I've been calling the love of my life recently could be that cold but I guess it was for the better.

A lot of you recommended therapy and counseling for my brother, he is already on it. Before coming to my house he already was on it.

I would like to thank you all for advice, I don't think I would have ever looked back at my own relationship if I haven't got to that point and I don't think it would be safer to continue in that relationship anymore, she already disregarded boundaries with me, I didn't do nothing about it, and it got to a point where it ended affecting very bad my brother and I feel very guilt for that.

Thank you all for your help, and for your kind words of confort

ThrowRAconcernedHB,2020-07-19 12:39:44+00:00,My ( 31m) wife (30f) says I don't have the right to be upset about losing our child.,"My wife and I have been together 6 years and married 2. We have always wanted kids but wanted to wait ans not rush at the start of our marriage. The pregnancy came as a surprise but a very welcomed and happy one. 

Everything went smoothly throughout the pregnancy. There were nevernany signs of issues. We decorated the nursery together and put up the furniture. We were so excited to meet our baby and be parents. She carried to term and the day of the birth again things were ok. She gave birth and we didn't hear any crying. We were so confused and you can see it in the doctors' eyes that they were very concerned. I can't begin to explain the heartbreak when we were told that our little girl didn't make it. We were able to hold her and she was so beautiful. 

A funeral home has a free funeral service for little angels so we buried ours just the two of us.I have never seen a casket so small. I have been trying to be strong for my wife. I only cry when she's not around so when she needs me I'm there. It's been hard to stay strong when she's crying in my arms. Seeing her like this adds to the pain.

Last night I couldn't hold it in and started bawling with her. She didn't like that at all. She started saying that I was trying to make it about me. How I should be the man and support her. She also said that I don't have the right to be so upset because I wasn't the one carrying her and giving birth. She went to bed and left me there.

I know she has it worse than me because she carried our angel and have birth to her. I just didn't expect her to react that way. But I lost my daughter too. I wanted to be a father, I didn't get to change her diaper for the first time and spend my first sleepless night with her crying. I lost her too. 

I know that my wife is hurting which is why she's reacting that way. How do I support her better but also let her know how I feel in a way that doesn't seem like I'm taking away from her?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/htzv84/my_31m_wife_30f_says_i_dont_have_the_right_to_be/,relationship_advice,4993,1178,0.0

Feel like I'm going crazy.","Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/hpf5l4/my\_28f\_dog\_attacked\_my\_stalker\_after\_he\_broke/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hpf5l4/my_28f_dog_attacked_my_stalker_after_he_broke/)

I definitely didn’t expect my last post to blow up the way it did. Thank you so much to everyone who commented. I appreciated that I got advice from all over the spectrum, from people who completely agreed with me to people who completely agreed with my SIL, and people who thought both of us had a point. It helped me see that the problem is more complicated than I thought, which helped me understand that my SIL wasn’t just being a dick. It also helped me decide what things were and weren’t fair to be angry about. 

I also appreciated seeing a few people comment making fun of me for needing my dog with me, and the majority of people yelling at them and saying I was acting pretty reasonably for someone who endured a violent attack. I don’t want to be seen as someone delicate, and I’m glad that most people don’t see me that way. Reading everyone's comments, I had this moment where I was like, ""Yeah! They're right! I *did* almost get drug out of my house and murdered just a few weeks ago. Who the hell are these people to say how I should act???"" That felt really good and I really really appreciated it.

Anyway, the conclusion I came to in all of this is that while my SIL is well within her rights to protect her daughter, she went about it in a way that disrespected me, both as a friend and as a victim of a very recent violent attack. Both my parents and her parents live locally and babysit all the time; she and my brother could’ve easily dropped my niece off with them and came to visit. It probably would’ve been awhile before I even noticed my niece wasn’t coming around, at which point I would’ve been in a better place and more understanding that she was uncomfortable with her daughter around Thor. Regardless of what some people said about how my SIL and brother don’t owe me anything and all their allegiance goes to their daughter, I simply do not feel that way. We were extremely close before this happened; I was always there for them, and would literally drop plans to babysit my niece if my brother and SIL needed a night to themselves. The very least they could’ve done for me, after I was almost kidnapped and murdered, is try to find some compromise. We went from seeing each other 3 times a week to pretty much not seeing each other at all. Even if they weren’t okay with me crating the dog, they could’ve easily dropped their daughter off with Grandma and Grandpa for a few hours so I wouldn’t feel completely isolated. I also have a yard, so they could’ve come over with her and we all could’ve hung out outside, while Thor stayed inside. I’ve been upset about this for awhile, but wasn’t sure if I was right to be upset until so many people echoed that sentiment. So I appreciate it. 

I invited my brother and SIL over (I promised it would only be an hour or two and insisted they leave my niece with my parents), and tried to lay all this out without being confrontational or acting like a dick. To my surprise, my brother and SIL had no real understanding that I’ve been having a difficult time. They thought I was basically fine and everything in my life was more or less back to normal now that my stalker is in jail. I didn’t get into it in my previous post, but during the year that I was stalked, I worked really hard to not show many outward signs of fear. I even made jokes about having a stalker. I knew people wouldn’t want to hang out with someone who was constantly going on and on about some bad thing that was going on in their life, and I didn’t want to be “that person” who was perpetually in crisis. And more than that, I just didn’t want to always be thinking and talking about having a stalker. I wanted to not think about it as much as possible. So I guess I might’ve come off as unaffected by the whole thing.

I’m not sure if I totally buy that they didn’t know I was going through something traumatic and that it was taking a huge toll on my mental state. I mean, I got a gun and paid for tactical training. I bought a home security system. I got active in self defense classes and strength training, things that I previously had no interest in. Even if I wasn’t walking around telling everyone how scared I was, I think anyone would’ve been able to tell. Plus, who just brushes off having their house broken into in the middle of the night? It seems crazy and they don’t seem so emotionally unintelligent that they’d think that. But both my brother and SIL did apologize for being insensitive, and when I pressed my SIL on why crating the dog isn’t good enough, she eventually relented and said that it would be fine. It probably helped that the entire time they were over, Thor was asleep and loudly snoring in his crate.

The paranoid part of me is convinced they just don’t want to deal with me in a fragile state, made up an excuse about my dog, and are now just going to come up with some other excuse about why they can’t see me. I invited them over for dinner in a few days and they’re coming, so I guess I’ll just have to see from there. I can’t stress enough that these used to be my best friends, and I’m heartbroken to have not had their support. I’ve been trying to rely on my friends more now, and thankfully they've all been really supportive. I’m really lucky that this happened during the pandemic, because nobody is getting frustrated with me that I’ve basically refused to leave the house for a month—they’re all perfectly happy to pick up takeout and come over to watch TV for the 5th night in a row.

In other news, yesterday I left my dog at home and drove around my block alone. I was shaking the whole time but I did it! I keep trying to remind myself that I spent a whole year fighting back even though I was utterly terrified; I can’t just lay down and die now that I’m so close to getting my life back.

tl;dr Things are better with my SIL and brother but I don’t know if they’ll stay that way. I’m relying on friends for support instead. I’m disappointed but also doing better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/htnyo6/update_my_28f_dog_attacked_my_stalker_after_he/,relationship_advice,23583,1452,0.0

ThrowRA_927,2020-07-14 14:14:20+00:00,My sister and bil won’t let me kiss my bf,"I (30f) have agreed to carry my sister’s(42f) baby for her as she is unable herself and lacks the financial resources to pay a surrogate. I am happy to do this or at least I was. 

I am 6 months along at the moment and I met a lovely man recently and we are in the early stages of a relationship. He knows about my situation and is very accepting and considerate. Before agreeing to carry their baby we had some firm rules placed. They asked me to stay away from any sexual contact with men. I agreed and I really didn’t mind nor do I mind it right now. The agreement was no sex of any kind. 

And I have not done anything with anyone as was agreed. 

A few days ago I introduced my new bf to my sister and bil and at first everything was great. They invited us for dinner last Saturday, we had a great meal and a great time together, they all seemed to get along that is until he had to leave. When my bf had said his goodbyes to my sister and bil he then came over to me and hugged and kissed me, quit passionately but not in a vulgar way nor was it for a long period,literally seconds. 

As soon as he left my sister and bil jumped down my throat talking about how I broke the rules, how disgusting and wicked I am. I genuinely was shocked I had not expected such a blow out or their irrational behaviour/feelings towards me literally just getting a kiss.

I decided not to argue or even go in conversation with them and just walked home. I live about 30 minutes walk away and by the time I got back home I had an email waiting for me. The email contained our original agreement but now it included a section with “ No kissing of any kind” and they want me to sign the new agreement.

I don’t want too as I have been more then accommodating and considerate of all their original request. I feel like they are now crossing boundaries and acting as if I am some kind of farm animal they own and control. I don’t want to create any further animosity between us. They have been calling and texting me since then and I have yet to answer. I would like to reply back via email so that there can be no confusion and to create some separation. Any advice on what to write would be great! So how do I reply back to their email without being rude? Or how do I deal with them in general?

Edit: They did offer to drive me home but I declined as I enjoy walking and at the time it is my only way to comfortably exercise. 

The baby is biological my sisters and bil. This child is made from her last and only viable egg. They had tried many times before but they all failed. So I understood their anxiety and worry when we originally made the first agreement and I viewed it and still view their initial request as acceptable. I wasn’t in a relationship at the beginning of all this and they were worried about potential STI and I understood and I was already taking a break from sex and men at the time. I am doing this completely for free and without any reward other then helping my sister have her first and only biological child.

Edit: I’ve decided to send this as a response.


[Dear  “sister and brother in law”,

I am truly shocked and saddened by your reaction to my partner kissing me and with your continued behaviour.

I'd like to remind you that I am a human being, an adult and your family. I am honoured to carry your child, and to help you as best I can, however, I insist on being treated as a person and not an incubator. 

I can understand both of your worries and irrational thoughts as this is your last attempt for a biological child. I truly empathise with you and want you to have your beautiful family. This is why I’ve agreed to do this completely for free with the restrictions that we’ve originally agreed to and set.

I have been nothing less then compliant and considerate of all your request. I have upheld my side of the agreement. I have kept my word and upheld my responsibilities towards the baby and yourselves.

However instead of being beyond grateful you two have decided to stop respecting me, so much so that you now feel your in a position to make any demands of me. Instead of treating me as the kind and very generous sister I am being. I love you and I love the baby I am carrying for you. I would never, ever, do anything to harm the baby or cause any disruption to a healthy, successful pregnancy and birth.

I will therefore, under no circumstances, sign the new agreement as I do not agree with it.

However I do demand you both take a step back and try to look at this all rationally. I fully understand your anxiety around the baby, given the struggles you've faced. I feel for you greatly but that does not mean you two get to treat me in this manner. 

The stress and distress that you two are causing me is far more damaging to the baby than any kissing between my partner and I. 

Again I ask you to rethink what you're doing and if you are not capable I will have to start distancing myself from the both of you until after the birth of your child. 

Lovingly,

Your sister]",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hr29qg/my_sister_and_bil_wont_let_me_kiss_my_bf/,relationship_advice,19375,6389,1.0

I'll be destroying this throwaway after a  couple hours of posting this but some people asked for an update, so  here it is:

Firstly, thank you to  those who responded with actual advice, I had a lot of people calling me  out because it is apparantly basic knowledge that ejaculate on a towel  will not get a girl pregnant, please understand I lived a heavily  sheltered life, my parents made me see sex as a bad thing so naturally I  never bothered looking into it.

So, the verdict?

The dumb bitch cheated on me.

Yeah,  after taking a lot of the advice on board from the previous thread I  decided to put the pressure on the GF. She became instantly defensive  when I brought the possibility back up and tried to deflect my questions  with ""shouldn't we be focusing on what to do with this baby?"" and  things like that.  Finally she cracked and said she had a one night  stand with another member of our church group. I was obviously mortified  by this revelation and began to cry. She told me that she didn't feel  anything with the guy and that since then she has prayed for  forgiveness. Well, clearly God thinks she is an asshole too because she  got a baby out of it.

We had a big  bust up and I told her she needs to take a pregnancy test immediately,  she really didn't want too and honestly, I couldn't force her too.  Eventually she told me she already took one and it was confirmed she was  pregnant.

My head is a bit of a  mess right now, on one hand I want to stay with her and help her see  through the maternity, if she decides to keep it. On the other hand I  want her to denounce her religion and leave our parish for good.

I  suppose the silver lining is that A. I don't have a child and B. I  don't have to tell anyone my awkward ""ejaculate on a towel"" story.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hr19t8/update_i_think_i_have_impregnated_my_gf_without/,relationship_advice,1074,911,0.0

ThrowRA84635,2020-07-05 20:15:39+00:00,I (18f) just found out that I was a product of rape.,"My mom (48) and I have never been on the best terms. She's always been cold and distant towards me. She did the basics as a parent but nothing more. It was really hard growing up because I've been fighting for her approval my whole life and nothing I ever did was good enough. I never knew my dad and she never spoke about him and whenever I would ask she would yell at me and tell me to shut up. Now I understand why but I didn't then and it really hurt. I always felt worthless because even my own mother didn't want me around. This made me get into self-destructive activities (partying, drinking, drugs,etc.) fairly early in life. I guess I was trying to numb the pain. This made us bump heads even more.   


I disappeared for days without a trace with my phone completely turned off. I was on a complete binge and unaware of the world around me. When I finally came home my mom exploded so I did too. While we were fighting I yelled, ""why are you so mad you don't even care about me"". This made her even more mad and she told me that I should be grateful because I didn't want her and she almost drove full speed off a cliff with me in the back seat. I was shocked so I left again and slept over at a friend's house. She texted me an hour or so after I left and told me that she was sorry and that I should come home tomorrow to talk. I was surprised because she has never been that nice to me.   
When we spoke she explained that a man that worked in the same building had taken advantage of her after hours during overtime. She's never met him and she never saw him again. She said that she made the decision to keep me and that raising me was the most difficult thing ever. I have been crying and drinking excessively ever since I found out. I grew up hating myself and this didn't help at all. I still want to have a good relationship with my mom but I don't really know how to proceed. My existence is such a painful reminder to her. She looks at me and sees her rapists face so what should I do?

throwRA-whatdoido201,2020-07-05 20:09:51+00:00,"My wife (32F) has been having an affair, and I’m broken.","My wife (32F) and I (30M) got married in September 2018 after being together for 3 years. Right before our honeymoon, we bought a house together in VA, and after we got back, pooled our remaining money and time to completely redo her old starter home in MD and sold that in early 2019. 

We both work full time jobs in Virginia. I make pretty good money, she makes even better money. My wife, let’s call her Katie, decided to pursue an MBA and started last fall. She had an educational trust that her parents started for her, and therefore didn’t ask me for any financial assistance. However, because I saw how time consuming the MBA was on top of her already large professional workload, I took it upon myself to take care of everything related to our still relatively new home - including dealing with contractors, managing all our bills, maintaining the house, taking care of our dog, purchasing/assembling furniture, yard work, cooking, cleaning, laundry, and hosting/entertaining her family that insisted on coming over at least 2 weekends every month. 

Lately, Katie had been unhappy with our relationship, complaining that I wasn’t spending enough quality time with her and not making her feel wanted. I tried to argue several times that between her work and studies, and my work and home responsibilities, that there simply wasn’t very much time to spend together in general (we would frequently not even get to eat dinner until 9:00 or 10:00 at night, and I would either need to bring her a meal to her home office, or we would quickly eat together, and she would return to schoolwork to study or percolate in group projects/session). She would argue back that the things I was doing around the house were simply my responsibility as a husband, and that while she “appreciated it,” it didn’t count towards me trying to maintain or build our relationship. We’d also been arguing a lot about other things, and combined with the lack of free time, would be intimate maybe once a month. 

But after one particularly emotional (and drunken) conversation - about 3 or 4 weeks ago now - I vowed that despite what I already thought was prioritizing her needs, that I would go even further. I began to take off work (I, unlike her, still had to go in during Covid), or go in late/leave early, stopped seeing friends, skipped workouts, and would even wait until she was occupied with something else to even take a shower, all so I could spend as much available time as possible with her between her obligations. As a result, things seemed to be slightly improving between us. 

And now we arrive at last Wednesday. As per usual, I was making dinner for us. We have a tablet in the kitchen that I primarily use for recipes. As I was finishing up, the tablet began pinging nonstop, and I checked out what was happening. As it turns out, the tablet is linked to her google credentials, and I first saw an ongoing hangouts conversation between Katie and a friend, discussing what to do about “someone’s wife” who had come to our house that day while I was at work. Scrolling through the conversation history, I found more about Katie’s lack of feelings for me, and the longing and dreaming to instead be with some guy, who we’ll call Luke. 

Physically shaking at this point, I decided to venture away from Hangouts and open her Gmail, where I found several emails, going as far back as March, between her and Luke, calling each other “babe,” “sweetheart,” and “my love.”

Unsure about what to do next, I first took screenshots of everything I could find, then stepped outside to call the only person with law experience that I knew, an executive at my company who I’d become friends with. He advised that I immediately confront her, but first call someone to come over to the house to act as a witness, in case things became physical, or if she might later try to claim they did. So I had a friend over in about 20 minutes, I confronted Katie, and she confessed to the relationship and admitted that they had been intimate several times over the past 4 months, both at hotels and in our home. 

Now completely distraught, I tried to maintain my composure, and asked her to leave. She stayed at a hotel for two nights, then despite my protest, came home on Friday, stating this was her house too. She insisted on talking when she returned, and not having a witness this time, I decided to record the entire conversation on my phone. She tried to reiterate that she had been unhappy, but despite that, had been reaching out to her friends and mother about suggestions and resources she could use to help our relationship (even though I had suggested counseling in the past, but she refused). She tried to tell me that she made a mistake, that she had already broken it off with Luke a week ago, that I was the only person she wanted to spend her life with, and the only reason she hadn’t told me about it was because her friends had advised her not to. She also said that if we truly love each other, that divorce was a mistake, and that we should be able to get through anything. I replied that love is worthless without trust, and then said that if she insists on staying here, to please stay in the guest room. Obviously free usage of her home office and the guest bathroom, but to please stay out of our bedroom/bathroom unless telling me first. 

So now I’m here. Sitting in my house alone with just my dog. Her and her aunt/uncle/cousins are currently at our neighbors house for a bbq (they don’t know about what she did). I can’t bear to go over there because I don’t want to talk to or even look at Katie, much less pretend in front of a bunch of people that nothing happened. 90% of me wants to get a divorce, but despite her feelings, I was very happy with the life we were building. We had even been talking about being pregnant by this time next year. But no matter what I decide to do, I know I don’t want to make that decision without getting more information about what I can do, what might end up happening if we proceed, and I definitely want to talk to a few VA lawyers to protect myself. We only have one joint account with less than $20k in it, and the only asset we share is our house. 

So that’s it. I’m sorry for writing so much. If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading. And I would really appreciate any and all insight, suggestions, or advice.

throwra-help1,2020-07-04 17:16:38+00:00,I [24F] was locked in the basement for two hours yesterday after a huge argument with my boyfriend [27M]. I need to end things with him but I want to do it in the best way I can.,"I've been in a lot of denial over the last few weeks, telling myself that it was my fault whenever something bad happened and that things will get better and he will change to make it all okay again if I can just endure it for a little longer. I found it very difficult to accept that he's a different person to the one I fell in love with at the beginning, none of it makes sense and I thought I must be doing something wrong. He has severe anger issues and I can't know when the next outburst is going to happen. The stress from his job is making it so much worse and I've finally decided that I can't live like this anymore. In constant fear that he will seriously hurt me or do something even worse to me. Even though we've been together for three years now and I've put up with so much, I think I'm at my limit now. Yesterday morning we had a massive argument where he slapped my face. I punched him in the face in response. I raked my nails down his arms and drew some blood which made him furious. He gagged me and locked me in the basement before leaving for work, with no way to contact him. He did come back two hours later to let me out. I was very still by then and I refused to say a single word to him even though he was apologetic, I just went to my room and sat on my bed for a long time doing nothing. I don't know how to describe the way I felt then. Sort of cold and empty. I went to sleep, woke up to eat dinner then went back to sleep.

We didn't talk to each other this morning and I've just been eating and walking around the house for the whole day. I called my mum and said that I needed a place to stay and she agreed to take me in, so I at least have that. I don't know exactly what I'm going to say to him yet but I've completely made up my mind that I'm going to leave him. Is there anything important that I should do or keep in mind? I've never ended a long term relationship before so I want to make sure that I approach this the best way I can.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hl6wcv/i_24f_was_locked_in_the_basement_for_two_hours/,relationship_advice,2230,1238,0.0

ThrowRAinterracial,2020-06-28 16:49:03+00:00,I’m a Korean female (24) in an interracial relationship with a white male (29) and struggling with identity issues,"I’ve met my soulmate. He’s amazing, I’m crazy in love.. But the closer we get to marriage and children, the more resentful I become. I’m  sad and resentful, at no one and everyone, and I’m struggling with how to come to terms with it.

He’s white, I’m Korean. We’ve talked about race on multiple occasions. He’s even brought it up by asking what it was like to live in the US as an Asian female. He listened to my experience and asked a lot of questions. He’s the first non-minority I’ve ever dated who has made me feel heard and understood. He also has a million other wonderful traits, I love him very much and I’m so excited to have found the person I want to share my life with.

However, the more serious we get, the more frequently I experience episodes of anxiety about identity. I’m a Korean female adopted into a white family. My parents are white, my siblings are white, my extended family is white, my adorable little nieces and nephews are white, and I am almost always the only Asian person in whatever room I am in. I struggled with identity issues as a child (I learned how to use makeup to make me look ‘more white’, I stuffed my bra, hated my hips, begged my mom to let me dye my hair and buy contacts, etc…). With age and a lot of therapy I finally feel comfortable with who I am... and now I’m in a relationship with a 6ft tall ginger. He’s beautiful and I love him, but he looks nothing like me… and I fear that neither will our children. Maybe I’m wrong, but after using Google Images, I’m imaging slightly ‘exotic’ looking white children. I’m sure they’ll be absolutely adorable and I’ll love them to pieces, but they won’t look Asian.

When I thought about my life, I always imagined having children and I always imagined them being Asian. The idea of finally living in a home where there are people who look like me has brought me comfort for so long… and now I’m realizing that it may never become a reality. My partner and I do plan to adopt. We want to experience pregnancy by having one biological child and then adopt the rest. Adoption is very important to me, but we’re interested in adopting children who would otherwise grow up without a family- which means foster children and not the private adoption of Asian infants. The likelihood of us coming upon an Asian foster child who is available for adoption is quite small.

I’ve spent my whole life being ‘the other’ and now even the child who grows in my womb won’t look like me. It feels like a death in the family. It feels like I’m grieving this life that will never be and it’s bringing up a lot of pain I thought I had moved past. I don’t know how to feel.  I am incredibly sad about the idea of not having an Asian child, but at the same time I feel like his/her life would be better if he/she didn’t have to grow up as ‘the other’ in a predominantly white country.

I love my family, I have no regrets about being adopted. They’re incredible and have surrounded me with so much love and support. I love my boyfriend, and I want to spend the rest of my life with him… but I have so much anger and hurt inside of me that I’m always the friggin Asian girl. I hate being the only Asian in the room. I hate being the only Asian in my family. I hate it. I hate that I stand out in whatever group I’m in, and now I’m realizing that there will probably be a family portrait hanging above our fireplace of my white husband, our white children, and me.

I just reread this before posting, and it has a lot of anger. I just want to be clear that I have moments of anger and pain, but most of the time I’m happy and excited to start my life with him… it’s just rubbing old wounds that feel really raw. I feel stupid and petty putting it in writing, but the pain is real and I want to be able to move past it. Has anyone been in a similar experience? I would love any insight.

TLDR; Asian girl in a serious relationship with a white male and grieving that her children probably won’t look like her.

Edit: This got a lot bigger than I anticipated. I have noticed a lot of comments expressing concern that I would resent a white child or that I only want children to produce a lookalike, and I can understand those concerns- but it's not how I feel at all. I do want to add that  Relationship\_Advice is filled with posts from people who are expressing their deepest and darkest/most private fears. This is a deep, dark, and shameful fear of mine. Everyone has thoughts they are ashamed of and want to resolve. I would never get pregnant just to produce a lookalike, and I will love any child I have (biological/adopted/white/asain/blue/purple/green) with all of my heart. That doesn't change the fact that it can be really difficult to be the only person in 99% of the rooms you're in who looks like you. It's very common struggle among transracial adoptees and minorities in general. This isn't something I struggle with 24/7, it isn't one of my defining character traits, but it is a private pain I have. I was hoping to find other people who have experienced the same thing, and talking to them has been incredibly helpful. Thank you so much :) I really appreciate all of the insight and advice I've received. I'm going to get back into counseling to address these new and confusing Identity issues that have starting popping up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hhhq2f/im_a_korean_female_24_in_an_interracial/,relationship_advice,4728,3385,0.0

As the title says, I decided to break up with Jess. I kept going back and forth because I was worried I was throwing away a great thing over something that happened in the past. But the problem is I thought I really wouldn't able to get past it. 

I can't help what she did was really shitty. Yes, I know that technically she did not cheat. But she knew that I wanted a real relationship and that we were potentially moving in that direction. But, meanwhile she expected me to plan (and pay for) interesting dates, court her and prove that I was ""worthy"" of her while she happily hooked up with randos who basically did nothing but show an interest in fucking. Fuck that. 

In a follow up conversation it also came up that her friends sort of guided her to act like this. That she should basically allow herself to have fun and to keep her casual options open but with me to ""make me work for it"" and show that I wasn't just looking for sex but was capable of being a committed partner. The whole thing just seems so manipulative and ugly, and these were also mutual friends who I considered to be nice girls and now my friends as well. Now I never want to see any of those pieces of shit ever again. 

Anyway, I know this is starting to sound a bit like a rant lol, but I felt pretty pissed off and basically called it quits. The actual breakup was actually quite unpleasant. No harsh words were exchanged, but Jess cried and we kind of talked about some happy times. I guess that's the hardest part about this, like I don't think she is a bad girl and maybe we could have had a nice future together like we did over the past few months. But in the end, I do think I made the right decision, I want to be with someone who treats me well from the get-go, not someone who manipulates me while playing games just so she can have her cake and eat it too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hctqfj/update_to_my_27m_gf_22f_of_a_year_slept_with/,relationship_advice,1912,689,0.0

Hi everyone, it's been a long time since my last post. It was really hard to accept what everyone was saying about my bf and I basically shut down for a week trying to process it. I eventually began reading up on grooming and I even watched the documentary ""abducted in plain sight"" that another user had mentioned, and I felt positively sick, seeing my life through other people's eyes. This kind of stuff was just normal in my family and the people I interacted with. My mom had my sister when she was 16 and my dad was 25, and they seem to have a happy marriage, and I thought it was normal. 

I'm still a bit of a mess but since having this revelation I've felt disgusted by my ex bf. I couldnt stand to be touched by him. When I was young, it felt natural, but looking back on it I was just a kid! At 19, I could not imagine any kind of sexual or romantic attraction to a 13 or 14 year old and the thought of it makes me want to hurl. I moved out to live with one of my long time friends a few weeks ago, and I've processing what has happened and trying to heal. I thought of contacting the girls parents, but I didn't even know her last name, so two days ago I called the non emergent police line to report it. I feel a weight being lifted, one that I didn't even know was there, and I feel even hopeful for the future for the first time in a long time. 

Thanks for opening my eyes, Reddit

EDIT: Thanks to everyone for the support! I'm getting a bit overwhelmed with the comments so I won't be responding after this edit, but to clarify, I reported him for statutory rape and I gave the officer what information I had on the girl so that they could find her and hopefully protect her from him. I've also gotten a few nasty comments on the original post so I just want to ask everyone not to upvote or comment anymore.

Thanks again to everyone for the support. I'll be in counseling soon, and hopefully I can put this all behind me! I love you guys ❤️❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hc1qq2/update_im_19f_starting_to_get_suspicious_of_my_bf/,relationship_advice,2375,917,0.0

throwra_sodaa,2020-06-13 15:09:10+00:00,"UPDATE: My girlfriend [F24] called men ""failed abortions"" and is now trying to walk it back [M23]","Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gv88ba/my_girlfriend_f24_called_men_failed_abortions_and/)


Sorry to have been a while with this, it's been a bit crazy here but here's the update. It's long but there's tl:dr; at the end. 


We left off while she was trying to apologize to me about the statement she made about saying all men were failed abortions. One of you commented something that really stuck out to me - that if she was apologizing *at* me it was a lot different than apologizing *to* me.


Luckily it seemed that she was trying to apologize *to* me. I had told her I needed some space so when I came back I kind of interrupted her apology and said I needed to say some stuff. I was pretty honest and brutal with her.


I said that it really hurt to hear what she had said. That it was really difficult to process someone who tries to promote equality in their life making what I felt was a hateful and unnecessary blanketed statement. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out why I felt as strongly as I did and I realized that it felt like she was not only grouping me in with a group she felt like should have been aborted, but that she was saying men were worthless, failures, and were better off not existing because they weren't women. Echoing what a few commenters quoted, I was simply an incomplete female to her. I was limited by my XY chromosomes. 



I said in the original post that I've had some questioning of my gender identity but I guess I didn't provide much background to it. It ended up that most of those sentiments are things I've thought to myself at one point. That I'd have been better off being born differently. That I'm worthless, a failure, that women are ""better"" than men out of femininity alone. 


I said all that to her, not as smoothly or without some discomfort, but I said it to her. Afterwards she cried a little bit and said she didn't know I felt that way and was sorry she said what she did. I pressed her a little bit to ask why she said it because... well, call me insecure but I'm not the kind of person to make statements like that out of anger and was always taught growing up that they're off limits. 


It turns out that when she was in her second year at college she was accosted by a police officer while walking home one evening. It ended with her being sexually assaulted. From talking with her about it, it seems all this stuff with the police has understanding been bringing up a lot of feelings for her. 


I wasnt really expecting that but I said if she needed to talk about anything I was there for her. I feel kind of selfish about it but I did say that I don't think I could deal very well if she made some similar statement again. I told her that I knew why she'd say those things, but if she needed to say them that she shouldn't do it with me. I feel like that was harsh and selfish but I told her I couldn't deal with generalized statements and I didn't feel like I could distance them from my own emotions. I apologized for that and said I'd be there for me if she needed it otherwise. 


At this point things just felt differently. I told her that I had decided I needed to talk to a therapist about my issues and try to figure out where I'm going with them. I floated the idea of her seeking out therapy too and she said she'd consider it. I think she will. 


I told her I loved her no matter what but that I felt like I needed a break to recenter myself and get more understanding of my identity. She agreed to it, and that's where we're at today. We are still friends and still talking, but have taken a departure on the more intimate discussions between ourselves. 


Thanks to most of the people who commented, there were a lot of good comments from both camps. Things ended up being in the middle of both sides. 



Tl:dr; We're on a break. I'm seeking therapy for my gender identity questioning. She's considering therapy herself and apologized for what she said. She had reasons for making the statement. We cried. I said I'd be supportive of her but set a boundary on future generalized statements.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h899cg/update_my_girlfriend_f24_called_men_failed/,relationship_advice,6840,1262,1.0
throwRA_needclosure,2020-06-12 23:49:00+00:00,I (44M) want to read my daughter’s (17F) diary to find out why she left us. My wife (43F) says we should absolutely not,"EDIT: After another restless night, I was very surprised to wake up to this. Thank you so much for your condolences and for sharing your thoughts and experiences. I wish I could respond to all of you but I am mentally exhausted. If this post warrants an update, please let me know. Again, thank you all so much.

My (44M) daughter (17F) committed suicide two months ago. It was honestly a big shock as she’s never shown any signs that she wanted to take her life. My wife and I blame ourselves and wishes that we could’ve done more. She was in therapy for something unrelated, she was very afraid and would panic at the sight of blood, so we thought that her feelings in general would be addressed during her sessions. We were always very supportive of her, asking her about her days or if she’s having any troubles about anything when she’s noticeably looking down. 

We only started cleaning out her room a week ago. I was going through her closet and tucked at the very back was a small backpack with her diary in it. I really wanted to read it because my daughter didn’t leave anything behind, not a note saying why she did it or anything, so I was hoping that maybe something in her diary would shine light as to why she did what she did. I brought the idea up to my wife and she said absolutely not, though she’s not with us anymore, she still deserves the utmost respect. My son (14M) also wants to know why her sister left but doesn’t think that reading her diary is the way to go about it.

I don’t know, I feel like we need closure. My family and her friends need closure. My wife cries herself to sleep every night, repeating that she wishes we could’ve done something different, and I comfort her. My son obviously misses his sister as they were so close. He misses her so much that sometimes we’d find him asleep by the door of his sister’s room in the middle of the night. My daughter didn’t have any social media presence but had a good amount of friends and none of them know why she did it either. This diary is our last shot of giving everyone she knew the answer why. I know diaries are very intimate and the last thing I want to do is disrespect my daughter.

If I don’t end up reading her diary, how will I find closure? How will my family move past this? Everyday is filled with tears and many thoughts of “why?” Was it my wife and I’s fault? We don’t know, which is why I want to know. If it was us, I don’t want to have us make the same mistakes with our only child left. I don’t know exactly what I’m asking for but anything would be appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h7w3b7/i_44m_want_to_read_my_daughters_17f_diary_to_find/,relationship_advice,7432,1442,0.0

ThrowRA-Sleeping,2020-06-11 16:50:44+00:00,I think that my (26f) fiancé (31m) masturbates to me while I'm asleep and gaslights me about it,"TLDR: I am almost certain I caught my husband masturbating to me in my sleep several times. He denies it and blames it on the mental illness running in my family. I suspect he drugged me, but I can't be sure. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills...

The summary above says most of it. For context, my mother has schizophrenia and so do I, but unlike mom, I am high-functioning; I have a Master's degree and a high-paying job and never had meltdowns. I have common auditory hallucinations, rare visual hallucinations, common depersonalization episodes, that's about it. I take Abilify in small doses, I don't even have a therapist, I'm doing just fine. I moved in with my fiancé, ""Bob,"" about two years ago. We don't have a very active sex life (mostly because he claims he has a low sex drive, which is fine by me) but we're a very ""dialogue-oriented"" couple based on mutual respect, which is why I'm with him in the first place. We can (could?) say anything to each other, and he knows everything about my mental illness.

Troubles started about two months ago. Before that, I had vaguely heard some things that sounded like Bob masturbating in the bed next to me at night, but I didn't care enough to look into it. He masturbates, big deal, right? Two months ago, I was woken up by him fapping with so much energy that his hand kept bumping against my ass and the whole bed was shaking. I made it clear I was awake, and he stopped right away. Okay, whatever. A few minutes later, he started again. I spoke up, said that I'm fine with him fapping but could he do it in the bathroom? I'm trying to sleep. *He denied doing it* and told me I was dreaming. Okay, whatever, I roll over. A few minutes later, without fail, *fap fap fap*.

I tried to talk to Bob about it, and we can usually discuss every topic freely, but he stonewalled me right away. He denied everything, including *ever* masturbating, and he kept chalking it up to me dreaming it. I was convinced I wasn't dreaming and double down, and Bob got *angry* like I'd never seen him get angry before and said he wouldn't tolerate these ""accusations."" I wasn't accusing him of anything, I was trying to be understanding and have a discussion. I told him that if that was a fetish of his or whatever, we could incorporate it into our sex life, that I don't mind pretending to be asleep or whatever to turn him on. He denied everything very strongly and refused to discuss it further.

I'm working from home and Bob has to go to work every day, so I figured I could afford to stay awake later at night to keep watch. Without fail, within days, I was pretending to sleep and Bob was masturbating to me. It happened several times, and I confronted him every time. He started blaming my schizophrenia, saying that I'm having delusions and that I'm hallucinating the whole thing. He strongly recommended that I increase my prescription medication. I repeatedly told him that I know he is doing it even though he denies it - that there is no shame in it and that he can just admit it, but he violently denies **everything.**

Last night was the worst one so far. I woke up in the middle of the night to Bob kneeling on the bed by my face and fapping just inches away from it. I recoiled and was like ""WTF?!"" but I was feeling super drowsy, like kinda seasick and confused. I got up and tried to fully wake up, while Bob was loudly telling me that nothing was happening and that I was hallucinating it all. I'm not sure how I fell back to sleep, but I woke up this morning with the sun high and Bob already gone for work.

Bob'd left a note telling me that my illness is getting worse and that I need to call my psychiatrist asap to get reevaluated. I think that's bullcrap. I looked through Bob's things and found sleep aids that he got like a year ago but never used - but the box is mostly empty. These things dissolve in water and Bob has a million opportunities to feed them to me, and I'm starting to think he's been drugging me for a while now to keep me asleep while he does he thing at night. I haven't confronted him about that yet and I don't know if I should. I can't erase the possibility that I am indeed somehow hallucinating all of that - I have seen my mom convince herself of the craziest things that look absurd from the outside but seem fully real to her.

First of all I want to say thank you to all the kind souls who left supportive and kind messages. I tried to read them all but there were just too many.

My husband and I have decided to separate for the time being as I can’t really get over just how weird and abusive he’s been over the past few months. He is currently letting me stay in the house until we figure out the next steps and although he keeps apologizing, I’ve decided to leave him and start my life over. 

To everyone telling me to go back to my home country. I can’t. It’s not so easy. I did however call my family and told them everything and they were surprisingly supportive and we’ve talked everyday since my original post and I couldn’t be happier about that. 

To everyone who left me horrible messages. Im sorry you are so full of hate and wish horrible things on people. But I will end up stronger than ever after this. So thank you.

My husband has been nothing but supportive In my wanting to leave and start over so all I can do is figure it out and take the advice of my family and my lawyer. Yes, I’ve been in contact with a lawyer but haven’t hired her yet as I’m waiting to get the money from my husband who has volunteered to pay for it. 

Thanks again, hope this update was sufficient for everyone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h0urwu/update_my_24f_husband_38m_keeps_sexualising_my/,relationship_advice,18348,746,2.0

ThrowRA_2020060969,2020-06-09 23:00:20+00:00,A little over a year ago my wife threw a 7-pound salt rock lamp at my head. I am still in the relationship and struggling mentally.,"This wasn’t the first time she had been violent, but by far the worst. 

We’ve been married for 5 years and together for 9. (33M)(31F)

The biggest causes for conflict in our relationship are: 

1.  She does not like my family even though they have not treated her poorly. She particularly does not like my mother...My mom is a single mother who raised me and my siblings on her own when my dad decided to dip a year after I was born. 

I am the youngest and family was important growing up. I tried to express this her but it had no impact. I’ve made my wife a priority in our relationship and have respected her needs to the detriment of my relationship with my family.

2.   Anything that takes my attention away from her. Family, friends, dog, hobbies, passions, career...etc. The dog part is especially painful. About 4 years ago she more or less had me believing that giving my 9 year old dog up for adoption was the best thing to do since I was working 12-hour days and wasn’t around to give him much attention. When I did it created conflict. She on the other hand wasn’t working and just didn’t like him. I wanted my dog to have a better life than I was providing so I went along as she set up the adoption with a local shelter. I should have known better and it still hurts to this day.

Her words on the ride there and how she treated me after still do even more. In my state of grief, she mercilessly mocked me when I was upset, calling me a pussy and said I should just get over it. Not even a month later she was demanding a kitten. I didn’t want her to as I thought it would be a good time to focus on us and maybe travel more. Well she got it and took a year and a half off from work to “raise the kitten”. There are many more stories that cut deep, but this one reached my core.

3.  After years of actively trying, we have not conceived a child. She has often expressed how much she wants a child and it has lead to much sorrow that she hasn’t. I told her many times I would get checked out to see if there was anything going on with me. I’ve read that many times it’s on the man’s side and I wanted her/us to have some sort of resolution. She felt it was unnecessary, maybe embarrassed, but just keep trying, so we carried on. However, in one particular argument she said “I was less of a man” for not getting her pregnant. Well that didn’t sit well with me so I decided to schedule a visit with the doctor which leads us to the event in the headline of this post.

The evening in question began a few days earlier when I got my wife the wrong kind of flowers. I had been preparing for one of the biggest business meetings I’ve ever had and was very excited and focused. After the meeting I stopped by the store to pick up some wine and flowers to celebrate and reconnect. All the store had at the time we’re carnations, ehh it will do, it’s the thought that counts right...Wrong, apparently carnations were insulting to her...I was cheap and thoughtless. I ruined her night. Well these feelings persisted for the next couple days.

After a couple days there was still tension in the air...I went to work and while there I got a voicemail from my mom saying she’ll be in town for a business meeting the following week and she wanted to get together. It had probably been at least 6 months since the last time we’ve seen each other.

My wife took this particular day off from work and when I got home she hit me with the, we need to talk. Apparently during her day she happened to “find” the specimen collection container I had hidden until I could get to it. She was upset and told me not to do it...how could I do this without telling her? I tried to reassure her that it was ok and it was time we get some answers rather than feeling the way we have been. 

She was not having any part of it and wanted me to throw it away. At this point she tried to grab it from me. Rather than continue and escalate, I got up and walked to the bedroom to cool off and hide the container again. 

A little while passed and it seemed that we had cooled off enough to speak again. 

She had mentioned many times in the past that she likes to have a week’s notice before company visits and it just so happened to be a week until my mom would be in town. I knew it probably wasn’t the best time, but I had no idea it was going to be this volatile. 

I mentioned it to her and immediately she blew up. Telling me to call my mom and tell her not to come. Telling me to make excuses for not seeing her or just don’t call back. None of these options made any sense to me so I told her we’re all going to hang out for a little bit and she’ll be fine. It didn’t seem like that big of a deal. 

We argued some more and after feeling exhausted from the constant arguments, I decide that I was going to go lay in bed and try to unwind. 

Some time went by and I thought we were going to go to bed and move on from all this. Wrong again...she busted into the room tearing through everything trying to find the “sample container” and demanded I give it to her. Still lying in bed I tried to calm her down but to no avail. She then began to attack me...scratching, hitting, yelling, pulling the covers off the bed. It was getting chaotic. 

At this point I rolled away from her to the opposite side of the bed with my back turned away from her. Maybe she’ll just stop attacking me...wrong again... 

I heard some commotion going on behind me and something along the lines of “your stupid lamp” when I felt a blunt object strike my head near my left temple... I originally thought she threw a full size football helmet that was near my night stand...nope...as I regained my vision I started to see blood pouring onto the bed sheets and onto my hand. 

Dazed I picked up my glasses and looked around to see what hit me was a 7-pound salt rock lamp that was originally plugged in on my night stand. I saw that my wife had literally just unplugged the lamp in a rage and intentionally threw it at my head.

As soon as she saw the blood running down my head she freaked out and began apologizing. I grabbed a hand towel to stop the bleeding, threw on some gym clothes that were laying on the floor, grabbed my flip flops, wallet, keys, phone and took off. I didn’t have a plan or even know what to do, I was in total shock. 

I ended up sleeping in my car holding a towel to my head until morning when I could go see the doctor and not be charged a crazy fee (American healthcare). 

A few stitches or glue the doctor pondered...he decided glue would leave less of a scar. In that doctor’s office I broke down and told him all that had happened, but decided not to press charges. I felt betrayed and humiliated beyond anything I thought was capable. It felt like the deepest part of my being had been violated by someone I trusted. It still does. 

I wanted to leave the relationship immediately, but was somehow convinced into staying. 

A year later and she hasn’t physically attacked me again. She did refuse to go to my grandmother’s funeral leaving me to make up excuses as to why she couldn’t make it. Worst of all she tried to dictate how much time I spent with my family. It felt like the same old same. 

I can’t say everyday is unbearable. I’m very grateful for the acts of service she does around the house from preparing our meals, washing clothes and keeping a clean house. She can be thoughtful and kind. She’s even been more encouraging of my goals lately. It’s noticeable she’s been trying to keep her anger in check, but I’m still uneasy. I still feel like this is a momentary peace and I don’t want to be sucked in. 

I haven’t been feeling like myself this past year. I’ve been very depressed, started drinking too much and put on about 20 pounds. I went to therapy for the first time in my life and tried to get her to come with me. She refused about a dozen of my requests and I’ve given up asking or wanting to do it with her. The therapist basically told me I’m straddling a fence and need to make a decision one way or the other. Either way I choose to go, do it and don’t look back.

I want more than anything to open my heart and feel light again. If this incident didn’t happen, maybe I would feel like there could be a chance to reconcile. I thought infidelity would be the worst thing to happen in marriage, but I was wrong. Domestic violence was not something I would have ever expected to happen to me or would expect myself to tolerate. My heart goes out to all that are going through that or have. 

She’s keen on making it work, but my gut feeling is that it’s time for us to move on. Every time I try to open my heart and move on from what happened, a wave of all those hurtful memories comes rushing out and my heart closes down. My body feels like it’s rejecting a connection to her. I still love my wife, but it doesn’t feel like I can or even want to come back from all of this and reconnect.

What do I do? I never thought I would be in this position. Any advice is much appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gzyihn/a_little_over_a_year_ago_my_wife_threw_a_7pound/,relationship_advice,1942,375,1.0

This all actually happened a few days after my original post, but things have been pretty hectic since then, but I wanted to write a quick update since I got some useful advice in the first thread. The best advice was to insist on seeing the chat one last time to see if she had written anything about me. She initially said no, because it also has private information about her friends, etc, etc. But I basically said if she doesn't let me see the texts it's over and she reluctantly agreed, but told me to keep in mind that this was a year ago and how much we grew as a couple since then blablabla. 

I scrolled to the period when we started dating and yea sure enough there I was in the texts. It actually made me feel really weird reading other people talking about me. Right around the time we first slept together someone asked her if I was better than some guy (apparently a former FWB of hers). Without missing a beat she fires back no, that it was kinda disappointing because I was nervous and had some performance anxiety and then actually went into detail about what we did. She knew I was feeling anxious since I hadn't been with anyone in a while after a bad breakup and she was supporting in person, so it felt extra shitty that behind my back she was complaining about me. A friend of hers even mocked me and she said nothing. 

Katie saw the look on my face and tried to tell me again that we grew so much and things became really good when we got comfortable with each other and connected. She even showed me a text where she said that to her friends. But honestly at that point I was already done. I asked her to move out and after a bit of drama and nasty words, she moved her stuff to her mother's place. 

As others said, I have no doubt they are not talking shit about me together, but honestly I could not care less what those pieces of shit are chattering about, I just never want to see any of them ever again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gz52uh/update_to_i_found_out_that_my_27m_gf_23f_of_9/,relationship_advice,19411,1985,1.0
ThrowRA968,2020-06-08 18:29:25+00:00,"My (18F) brother (17M) keeps egging me on to kill my self, amd I don't know what to do.","I'll preface this with my life isn't a happy one. More and more lately, no matter what I do, it seems to blow up in my face. I got rejected from my 3 top pick schools, I worked my ass off for a scholarship, and they gave it to the kid of who picked it. 


To put it bluntly, I'm less than cheerful.


My brother has always been abusive, this is nothing new. He's told me he hopes people shove me down the stairs at school, and when I come home crying, he mocks me and says I deserve it for being so annoying. He always takes the side of whoever mistreats me, I once got shoved on the ground and broke my nose, and he said he was grateful to whoever did it. Every word from his mouth is an insult, and if my mother asks me to ask him something, he pretends he can't hear. He steals whatever he wants from me, and often uses it as hostage to get whatever he wants.


He's physically abusive as well, he's held a knlfe to my throat, threatened to hurt our cat of I don't do his homework for him, and has pinned me down a multitude of times.


He puts this fake nice persona on when we go to school. One pf my friends said they didn't believe the difference, so I recorded one of his tirades, and showed them. They were appalled. Everyone one in my family says it's normal for a growing boy to act this way, and I should suck it up to keep the peace. Everyone I talk to at school however, says that it isn't normal, and their younger siblings never act that way. There was once a family breakfast at the school, and everyone was sitting together with their brother/sister. My brother choose to sit alone, and when I asked him to come sit with me, he told me to ""fuck off.""


His reason for this mistreatment is that, ""you annoy the shit out of me, and your constant crying is fucking annoying."" 


I'm just...So tired of all the abuse...I feel trapped and sick. I try to hide my crying from him, but one time he went to take something something from my room, and spotted me. He again began to laugh and mock, and said, ""Kill yourself, why don't you? Do the whole fucking world a favor.""


Seeing as how that upset me, he now takes to saying ""kill yourself"" whenever he sees me. I'm not going to give him the pleasure however.


I'm tired of being the punching bag, if I ever insult him back, I'm punished, but he gets off scot free, because ""he's younger, you should know better."" I think that excuse would work if he was 5, but he's 17 years old. Now, he's even starting to abuse our cat, no matter if I appease him or not. He screams and slams his feet untill the cat cowers and starts meowing. He locks her in a pet carrier, and kicks it. I rather he abuse me, than the cat, and I'm worrried he's going to try an kill her. Doing his essays for him doesn't cut it anymore, and he's abusing our poor cat for the fun of it.

I got a lot of good feedback and you guys are right; I did let my temper get the best of me in front of her on multiple occasions and that makes me a bad boss.

I went to her office unsure of what to expect. The door was locked when I got there, so I stood outside waiting. She came up behind me and said my name. She asked me if I was ready to interview and I just said yes.

We sat down in her office and she pulled out her phone and started recording. She asked me if I minded being taped and I said no.

She asked me basic interview questions, and then she asked me if there was anything that I knew I had to work on. I told her that my temper was an issue in the past, but that I have had a sudden wake-up call about my temper and that I was actively working on it. I apologized for leaving her hanging with training and that I was glad to see she was in a better position.

She told me that one of the things she had learned was forgiveness. She had left the company she was at and rehired to because they had wronged her during the merger. When she was offered the position back, it was with an apology, a raise, and now she is in a better position than when she left. She said sometimes an apology can start you down the path towards something better.

She told me that she is willing to hire me for a good wage because she knew I was good at a lot of things at my previous job. She said if I lost my temper during the trial period, it would be the end, but she was hopeful that it wouldn't happen. She asked me if I could start Friday.

She started training me today, and I definitely realized I was the problem and why she didn't succeed where I was. She is absolutely wonderful at the job with great client interactions. She should've been able to easily pick up the work I was throwing at her if she had been properly trained. I'm glad that she gave the company a second chance because she deserves everything they have given her. I hope to learn a lot from her and show her that she didn't waste her time on me.

I've also signed up for therapy to manage my anger online.

TL;DR: I ate my humble pie and went to the interview. She is giving me a second chance and I hope to be a good employee. I'm starting anger management soon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g3frb9/update_the_hiring_manager_30sf_where_i_30sf_am/,relationship_advice,1961,789,0.0
ThrowRAdadlookalike,2020-04-17 00:59:04+00:00,I think I'm starting to hate women,"I really really debated posting this especially because so many kind people sent me PMs but this is eating me from the inside and I need help. If anyone who sent me a message is reading this, I'm sorry, this has nothing to do with you and thank you so much for talking to me.

If you want a lot of detail, check my post history. To sum all of it up, basically my mom was raped by my asshole father, he picked up everything and ran for the hills when I was three, my mom remarried to my stepmom when I was six and brought two stepsisters, five and eight, along with her. My mom loved me, I know she did, she'd play outside with me and push me on the swings, and hug and kiss me and tell me I was the most important person in her life. But I grew and I started looking exactly like my father. I'm his literal spitting image and now she hates me. She and my stepmom dote on my stepsisters and love them more than anything and they're a family. Just not me. I'm the Harry Potter of the family, holed up in my room upstairs and if I ever come downstairs they'll glare at me and ""gently suggest"" I get the hell out of their face.

So fast forward to now. I went to the convenience store and there was this random lady behind the counter. And I got *scared*. Like my heart started beating really fast and I put my head down so she didn't see me, and hid behind one of the chips shelves. It was fucking ridiculous and I felt so stupid doing it but I didn't want her to see me. I just stood there, probably looking suspicious as hell, head down for at least five or six minutes. I finally went over and without looking up bought a bag of chips and then I left.

After that? I've noticed that when I see a post on Reddit of a mother is being awful to her kids, or a terrible sister-in-law, or some fucked up female friend trying to steal your boyfriend, I think *oh yeah, that's normal*. I get irrationally angry when I hear about these things in posts and less so for when it's a man. And it's a lot of distrust. I feel uncomfortable around women.

Fuck me. I'm scared. I cannot become an incel. I don't want to be that. But I don't feel right when I'm around them. I feel scared, and my temper is shorter with an annoying female classmate than a male one. I get more annoyed at female teachers than male ones. And they freak me out. I feel like my skin is crawling when I'm around them.

I'm assuming I'll get a lot of suggestions for therapy. Trust me, I would fly to one if I could. I mentioned it to my mother once, and she told me to stop acting like I was ""damaged"". She said she went through way more than I did and didn't get therapy, I don't need one either. I'm an attention-seeker blah blah blah.

Help me. Help help help help. How do I fix this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g2rv1y/i_think_im_starting_to_hate_women/,relationship_advice,4372,526,0.0
ThrowRA-9272,2020-04-16 14:05:24+00:00,My little brother is out of control and I don’t think I know how to parent him properly,"Back story-I (21f) am the legal guardian of my 13 year old sister “A” , 14 year old twin brothers “B and  C” and recently turned 16 year old brother “D”. Our parents died back 2015,they were driving home one evening after going on their date night and they were hit by a drunk driver,they died on impact. Our maternal grandmother then became our legal guardian, she was my rock and my co-parent but she unfortunately passed back in March 2018. I have since been the sole and legal carer of my siblings.

I am worried about my brother D. D has some really warped and disgusting views when it comes to women. He somehow excludes me and our baby sister A from his strong held views as we are “not like the other girls”.
Back in December 2019 I got a call from a parent from his school complaining about his online bullying of their daughter. Apparently my brother and some other boys had been dm’ing her and “saying”he wished she was raped, beaten and lit on fire. He didn’t use those words specifically but the memes he sent were very violent and could only be taken to mean as such. [extra info on the incident ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g2fikt/my_little_brother_is_out_of_control_and_i_dont/fnlrusd/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) 
I confronted my brother and he tried to say it wasn’t “that deep”. He tried to say it was just memes and gifs but I wasn’t having that bs excuse. We got into big argument and eventually I took away his access to our wifi, I confiscated all his devices including his phone and had him on house arrest for 3 months. He was only allowed to go to school and back,so no friends no activities, no tv or internet, no phone, literally nothing. He eventually calmed down from the initial shock of the length of his punishment and then I had him write long letters apologising to the poor girl and her mother. We went and hand delivered it with our apologies. Thankfully they accepted our apology. I then continued to keep a close eye on him and I believed he was behaving.

Last month I did one of my random checks to see the kids internet usage and to check which websites they regularly used and who they spoke to or what they spoke off.  I noticed that D has been on what I can only describe as incel sites were disrespectful young boys and crazed grown ass men congregate to trash talk women and girls. I guess that’s were he learned the word simp. I never knew what it was but he’s been using it so much that the B and C were regularly using it. Our little sister A is really interested in makeup and the boys especially D have made several disparaging comments towards her dream job or the women she looked up to. A wanted to one day own her own make up brand. She no longer talks about her love for make up,fashion or design as freely as she once did. The boys are literally killing her confidence,her believe in herself,other women and even in men. 

I don’t know why D hates women or doesn’t respect them. He has been loved and cared for by women all his life. How do I help him? (I can’t afford a therapist or do much that cost money. FYI we already go to a free grief counselling program in our area. Also when advising please factor in that I am poor)

FYI: D is very popular at school, he has many friends (both online and real world) and he has many girls chasing him. He gets along easily with most girls/women and people in general are drawn to him. This behaviour has been going on since I would say late 2018(November/December) I only noticed it around April/May 2019 and took it very seriously from his online bullying incident. I don’t feel like he’s lost as he understand things when I sit down with him and explain why the things these men say is so hurtful and why he shouldn’t be replicating it. 

Edit- I gave up my childhood so that my siblings could have one. So I really don’t understand why he feels the way he does. He has no real responsibility other than to himself. The only thing the kids are responsible for are their chores(walking and feeding the dog, feeding the cat, cleaning their rooms, doing their homework and filling their laundry baskets and every three months we deep clean the house together from top to bottom)

I do everything else on the regular like cook them dinner, make them breakfast/lunch, sort out their laundry,clean the house, help them with their homework, drive them to and from their extracurricular activities,outgoings and their friends.

[an explanation on why I check up on their internet and phone usage ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g2fikt/my_little_brother_is_out_of_control_and_i_dont/fnm1m3g/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Edit: Some of the advice I will be implementing or looking into. He will be getting a job as soon as this whole lockdown is done(so that he has something productive to do and he gets to have a little money)
I will be looking into the big brother/sister program for all of them. I also will  be signing him up on some sort of sport related activity. He likes to run and so that may be something. The twins already take swimming. I will also be focusing on A more so she doesn’t lose her confidence and knows that I am always on her side. I will hopefully be able to find her something with fashion and make up, so she can pursue it with confidence and my support.

Edit: I know what the word simp is and I understand it can be used in a humorous way. That is not the way the D and his friends use it in. Also we don’t believe in  a god, so church, synagogue or mosque support/youth services aren’t an option but thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g2fikt/my_little_brother_is_out_of_control_and_i_dont/,relationship_advice,11434,1200,0.0

ThrowRAwifeobese,2020-04-15 20:57:40+00:00,Update: My (29M) wife (37F) is nearly 400 pounds.,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/epbkpf/my_29m_wife_37f_is_nearly_400_pounds/

A couple edits first: She's 38 now and I also found out her weight is 522. Not nearly 400. Over 500. This was shocking to see. I guess once you pass 300, a hundred pounds give or take doesn't even look any different.

I initiated a trial separation a few weeks after I posted. I also found an attorney. That came after attempting a final come to jesus talk informed by some of the advice I'd received. She took it as poorly as she'd taken all my other attempts to talk to her about her weight and eating habits. To my decision to separate, she reacted explosively, and blaming it on things that were never true. Such as I'm a misogynist or must be cheating with a younger woman. 

Due to her anger she threw things at me. Nothing that hurt but for the first time I felt afraid of her. 

I quickly packed some essentials and moved out. This was a bit after Valentine's Day which was not what I would have ever imagined for the holiday but so it goes. When COVID 19 started to really take root I was already out (we live in NYC) and staying with my sister's family in Upstate New York. My job in software development can easily be done remotely.

Once I left my wife began texting, calling, and emailing nonstop. I got hateful messages from people I don't know on Facebook. So did my sister, and some of those people even found her husband and 15 year old daughter! This all crossed a serious line and my entire family as well as myself now have her and anyone who found us on her behalf blocked. 

In her own messages and texts to me, my wife was swinging between begging me to come back with apologies for ""being such a horrible person"", and insulting me that I am ""too weak for her anyway"" and ""she can find plenty of men but no woman will look past my toxic bullshit."" And she'll ""expose who I really am"" to anyone I try to date.

As I said we blocked her on social media but I didn't block on my phone. After all I will need a way to get in contact with her once this blows over and courts reopen, because I did decide after those stunts to go through with the divorce. 

But I ended up needing to block her number too. I'd already muted her texts, and it seemed like she was wearing herself out, but then a few weeks ago she began blowing up my phone at all hours. 

She demanded I needed to get her upstate with me or she was going to die. I recognized this as guilt tripping. So thank you to everyone who showed me the ways my wife had been manipulating me. I felt like I was seeing clearly for the first time.

She claimed all sorts of other things like that she couldn't move, had no food, ""was trapped in the apartment because the national guard is keeping people inside"" and just a lot of nonsense. She also said she had the virus, even though she hardly ever goes outside. Let alone to a doctor. She was calling every few hours leaving messages saying I need to help her and I finally blocked her number.

I have not heard from her since shortly after that. Email is the only place I didn't block (for any future divorce-related communication) and her last email was around a couple weeks ago. So I'm relieved that stopped. 

I've been working remotely and enjoying spending time with my family. My sister and BIL have been incredible supports in my life right now. They've helped me find the strength not to cave in. They've been by my side for most of the guilting messages showing me what it looks like to not fall for manipulation.

A lot of you recommended me to start therapy. I did go to the first two appointments, but then ended up leaving NYC as I said. To be honest I haven't contacted the office to see if I can continue with online sessions. I don't have any good excuse, just focusing on adjusting to things I guess. I know I need to get back to it and I will.

What I'm still struggling with is guilt that I should have been able to fix this, although a lot of you explained how that's irrational. I still feel it. I'm fighting the urge to run back to what I'm used to.

I'm also struggling with who I even am as a single man. I have no relationship experience besides her. What do I want out of life? Will I ever be able to date again? If I have asperger's then that's a mark against me, but even if not, could I risk another relationship when I now know she could end up becoming what my wife did? I couldn't go through this again.

And lastly I just don't get it. Some of you said my wife had an addiction due to past trauma which was a really unfamiliar way of looking at it to me. For one she never hinted at any sort of trauma. For two, I can understand drugs or alcohol because they chemically put you into a different mental state that lets you escape from whatever's troubling you. But food is just food. It doesn't have any mind altering affect like that. It just makes you fat. So you're still aware of your demons and you've piled on hundreds of pounds. What is the point?

Anyway I won't ramble anymore. That's an abbreviated version of where my head has been at.

Thank you to everyone on my first post who took the time and care to comment, and some who privately talked with me. I'm truly grateful. I don't really have any friends so seeing strangers care was unexpected and moving. I'm very sorry for the late update too since I logged in to see a bunch of messages wanting to know if I'm okay. I'm getting there.

TL;DR: Our divorce procedures began before COVID and are now pending the reopening of the courts. I've been doing as much as possible with my lawyer remotely. I'm also working remotely for my job while staying with my sister. Still struggling with major feelings of guilt and confusion, and it has not set in that I am free.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g20lfj/update_my_29m_wife_37f_is_nearly_400_pounds/,relationship_advice,20238,2227,1.0

throwra848484748,2020-04-14 13:26:51+00:00,My mum dumped my siblings on me and ghosted. I have no idea what to do.,"Yeah. This is a doozy. I've been trying to post it since it happened but just haven't really been able to process it. 

So I'm 23M, and I'm the oldest of five siblings, the others are 16M, 14F, 10F and 10M. Our mother is severely bipolar but very resistant to treatment and, to be frank, is an absolutely shit mother. I've done my best my whole life to raise my siblings since she clearly isn't going to, and I like to think I've done quite well. I managed to keep them out of the Care system most of the time, at least. 

Two years ago, I finally moved out of my mum's house and started university. I stayed in the same town incase the kids needed me, but I decided I had to start putting myself first a little bit and I couldn't keep putting off my own life because my mum is a failure as a parent, you know? With the exception of a few minor incidents, it's actually gone rather a lot more smoothly than I thought thus far. I currently have a house with two other students from my uni, though one is currently back in her hometown for the lockdown. 

So, the problem. Yesterday, there was a knock on the door around noonish. I wasn't expecting anyone but figured maybe it was the postman or my flatmate had ordered out for his lunch or whatever and opened it. To my shock, all four siblings are stood on the doorstep looking about as confused as I felt. 16yo informed me that Mum had dropped them off here without saying why or where she was going, and she was in the middle of a pretty intense manic episode and was just sort of rambling nonsenically instead of answering any questions. Of course I wasn't going to abandon the kids  so I let them in and have been trying desperately to get hold of mum ever since. I know she's getting my texts because I've been sending them on WhatsApp and it's showing me she's reading them. Also, when I call, it's ringing two or three times and then cutting out so she's clearly seeing the calls coming in and rejecting them, rather than it ringing out. I've tried reaching out to her friends with very similar results. 

I don't know what to do. I don't have the space for 4 kids in the house and it's *so* unfair to my housemate (though bless his soul he's an absolute angel of a guy and keeps telling me not to worry and he's fine with it). I currently have the girls staying in other housemates vacant room (with her permission) and the boys are in my room with me. Obviously not ideal. I also frankly can't afford to take care of 4 kids all by myself. No idea what groceries are gonna look like from here on out. The kids haven't brought many belongings with them, so they don't have many clean clothes. 16M and probably 14F can get away with wearing my clothes if it comes to it, but I have no idea how I'm gonna clothe the twins if they're here for more than a few days. I don't want the kids going into the system if I can avoid it, I've had too many traumatic experiences with it myself. Can anyone wiser and calmer than I am offer some advice on what my options are here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g15i07/my_mum_dumped_my_siblings_on_me_and_ghosted_i/,relationship_advice,18089,780,0.0

It broke my heart to do it but my boyfriend convinced me that I was too young and it was for the best.  We split the cost of it and it went well.  Now, just a couple days ago, he confessed to me that he made a mistake and he got his ex pregnant, and she's keeping the baby.  I'm, of course, shocked and terrified and angry, but more so because he is trying desperately to stay with me.  Initially, he was telling me how much he loves me and he's so sorry and I'm his soulmate and he'll do anything to stay with me.  He said that we could overcome this obstacle together, and I told him that this isn't an obstacle, it's an entire human life and it's his responsibility.  I told him that his number 1 priority is his child now.

Then, I found the other girl on social media and spoke with her, and she told me that he's been telling her he loves her and that he's just using me.  She also told me she wants nothing to do with him and warned me that she's known him since they were sixteen and he's a narcissist.  Also, not to bring race into this, but they are both black and I'm white, and she had some choice words about him choosing a white girl over her.  I confronted him about this and he immediately switched up on me and was furious that I'd spoken to her.  He told me he doesn't love her and he wants to be with me, I told him he was manipulating both of us.  This infuriated him.

After he stopped telling me I'm a dumb bitch and he hates me, he came around again and now is apologizing and saying he wants me back.  He says I'm his rock and he can't get through this alone.

Am I delusional to think this situation is salvageable? Do I need to man up and leave him? If so, how? I have a feeling he'll continue to chase after me if I leave, even if I try to block him. He's never been violent but he's strong, he's emotional and angry, and he has a couple guns. I've never seen him like this. I don't know whether to try to appease the situation or get out of it.

I know that this sounds very straightforward and I need to leave him, but I don't know if I can. I have a really unpleasant home situation, and the time I've spent living with him has been the happiest time of my life. I don't know where I'll go if I leave. I feel absolutely heartbroken and manipulated. I miss my baby. I miss my relationship. I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I knew when I made this post the kind of responses I was going to get, but I'm really grateful for everyone being so straightforward yet understanding. I know I sound like an idiot for even asking these questions, but it's really helpful for me to have like 100 people all saying the same thing.

ThrowRANdGhostingAdv,2020-04-13 19:33:54+00:00,Update: My (38/F) ex-fiance ghosted me (39/M) before our wedding. It's been 16 years and now she wants to talk it over again. Should we reopen closed wounds?,"[previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fz8bw7/my_38f_exfiance_ghosted_me_39m_before_our_wedding/)

Well, that was something. I got closure at least.

We met at a cafe and sat and talked outside. The first thing I noticed was how badly scarred her arms were and how much pain was in her face. Long story short  she  wanted to break up long before the wedding, she was too weak and cowardly to speak up for herself. She had a complete nervous breakdown over everything. She had been tired of being forced into doing things she never wanted to do and never having the guts to stand up for herself. She was mad at her family pressuring her to get married and pump out kids, she was mad at them forcing her into a degree that she didn't want, she was mad herself for not being able to speak up. Nothing she did was justified which we agreed on.

When I first proposed to her I did it in a public area. I had put her on the spot and she wanted to say no but, she couldn't bare to see me hurt. She was right. I made all the choices for her. I was a very different person back then and she was very ""meek"" as in she just went with the flow and had no backbone. I drowned her voice out often and often never gave her the chance to grow to be a person. Back then I was often focused only on myself. 

Well, everything came to a climax and she had a complete mental breakdown. She ran way from her problems at the beheast of her best Friend and only person in the world she ever trusted. As she said it's the only thing she knows how to do: run. She never had the spine to speak up. 

Her life just spiraled downwards. She did a few years homeless after her bestfriends husband kicked her to the curb. The rest of that time was spent in Prison, which she didn't specify what she did.  She was released about a year ago and has been turning her life around. She has a job, she's reconnected with her parents and she's finally reconnecting with me. She never stopped trying to get in touch with me. 

As for our future. We have none. We both agreed to end things and  go our separate ways. We both are changed, two different people.  We have nothing in common and don't live near each other. She doesn't justify what she did nor does she want to be forgiven. She thinks its repulsive and is ashamed of her actions. I wanted to be angry but, i couldn't. I just forgave her. With that we shook hands said our goodbyes and that will likely be the last time we ever see one another. 

It's bittersweet. I got the closure I wanted. We both did. It feels like a burden was released. I know now we never had a future together and  never will. But, on the other I'm sad because it's over. All these years maybe hoping something would happen were for naught. But, in the end this is an ending and I finally have closure. Not many get to say that.

Do I believe her story? Yes, I do and even if she's full of shit at this point does it even matter? I've always known her to be very weak willed, meek. She often just does what everyone tells her to do and often runs when things get too difficult. She avoids her problems because was too weak to stand up  to them.  I mean it makes sense why her family would not talk to me about her. They were the typical tiger parents that disowned their problem child.

Please any help?","So for context, my dad left our family before I could even get to meet him. My mom [45f] met my step-dad whenever I was around 5, so I've known him pretty much my whole life. I don't exactly remember much from when I was super young but around age 7 he became noticeably more touchy towards me. I never really thought about it much because I was so young, but it still bothered me. I hated him touching me, because it just felt wrong and horrible. I don't know why it felt wrong, it just sorta did. He would do things to me such as whenever I did something wrong, it would always be a spanking. I could drop my plate, get a bad grade, be mean to someone, ANYTHING and it would result in a spanking. This still happens to this day, anything that goes wrong, I get spanked by him. He always has to pull my pants and underwear down as well and he's probably just doing it to stare at my butt and thing and just to generally bring me pain. It seems like less of a punishment and more for his enjoyment. I hate it so fucking much. It's not just the spankings either, it's the just touchiness from him. He's ALWAYS touching me, he says he slips up sometimes and touches my butt or my boobs and that always bothers me, but he tells me that it's okay and I shouldn't make such a big deal about it. It seems that he's more interested in me than mom at this point, and it just feels so fucking wrong. 

I told my mom about all of this around last year, and she didn't seem to either care or believe me at all. She just dismissed it as he's either punishing me for being bad, because the same thing happened to him when he was growing up. He got spanked and that's just how he sees punishment. I told her about the touching, and she just blew it off as him being touchy towards his ""daughter"" (I hate this term so much because I'm not his daughter) and that I shouldn't be ""such a bitch"" towards him for loving me. 

I guess I tended to believe her for a bit, because she's my mother and has no reason to lie to the daughter she is supposed to protect. Two days ago I know it was all a lie. He raped me. I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO DETAIL PLEASE DON'T ASK!! I only say that because I made a post similar to this a while ago asking about my dad and I had 3 dudes message me telling me they were doing dirty things and wanted to know more about it, which is why I hesitated to post this, so please don't.

Last night while my girlfriend was sleeping she received some texts from a random number. I never snoop through her phone but I found it really weird so I checked her phone. It turns out that she had been cheating on me. I woke her up and told get the fuck out of my apartment in the middle of the night.

I feel like a pathetic fucking loser because even after she cheated on me I still want to be with her but I know I should probably cut her out of my life. I found out that she slept with this co-worker multiple times so it wasn't just a one-time drunk mistake. We were planning on moving in together soon and had talked about marriage and children.

I'm really fucking hurting inside. I have felt like I'm going to vomit for the past 12 hours and haven't slept since Friday night.

If anyone has been in this situation or anyone has any fucking advice I could really use it right now. I have nowhere else to turn.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thank you guys so much for the fast responses. This is the only place I can vent about this and I'm terrified to tell my family after the life we've built together. I'm going to take a long walk and try to clear my head. Most of you are saying to just cut her off completely and I know it's what needs to be done. I just need to gather the energy and strength to move on.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2: The final text I sent her about 10 minutes ago:

""It's over \_\_\_\_\_. You fucked everything up and I can't forgive you. I hope he's worth it because he's all you have now. Even now while I'm struggling more than I ever have in my entire life I know that I'm worth more than this and deserve better than a lying cheater. I'm not giving this any more thought don't bother reaching out again. I'll drop off the rest of your stuff at some point and let you know when it's there.""

&amp;#x200B;

She texted me saying that she wants to talk but I'm done responding. Thanks again anyone that was kind enough to give some input, I honestly think that if I had just been sitting completely alone all day contemplating what to do I may have taken the weak route and considered trying to mend things.

blablabloblobleee,2020-04-12 01:57:32+00:00,Just found out my (19f) bf (21m) slept with the girl who’s in love with him the night he met me,"Hi all. I met my bf “Jake” 6 months ago at a club (haha, remember clubs and crowded places?) We were both with groups of our friends, his group included a girl named “Anne.” Jake and I hung out that night and clicked immediately, we danced, we talked and flirted, and at the end of the night he asked me to go home with him but I don’t enjoy sex with people I don’t know so I told him I’d like to get to know him more on a date. 

We went out and things have been great so far except for one roadblock. Our friend groups have started to integrate so I spend a lot of time with his friends. Anne has liked him for a long time (as one of Jake’s friends told me about 2 weeks into the relationship) and when I asked him if this is true, he said yes but he finds her to be annoying and has never liked her back. I realllllllly hate being a “jealous girlfriend” stereotype so I wanted to leave it at that, but I have to bring up when things bother me. When Jake and I got serious, I told him that I wasn’t comfortable with him hanging out with Anne alone because her crush can be obvious at times (with the way she looks at him, talks to him, and tries to touch him.) He said okay but there have been a couple times where he has just hung out with her anyways without telling me and bringing it up later. He gives reasons like they had the same class and needed to study together, or someone else was going to come but cancelled, or no one else was free and he bored. 

I’ve tried to tell Jake that I’m not trying to be controlling or anything but I’ve been the girl with an unrequited crush and everytime you hang out with them you think of it as another shot to win the person over. I don’t care if she’s there during group hangouts but it makes my heart hurt to think of her having these very strong feelings for him and being with him alone. Oh, and a few weeks ago she was apparently crying over him not wanting to be with her, so this is a big deal for her. Jake said he’s not going to do anything &amp; they don’t even hang out that often so I shouldn’t worry. 

Well, now that corona is happening, they obviously are not hanging out, but Anne came
up in conversation over facetime with Jake and he said he thought she would just be over him by now, and I asked if there was any reason she might think he had feelings for her back. (I really tried to not ask this is in an accusatory way, I swear.) He said no at first then said “well...” and didn’t finish his sentence. I pressured him into saying what he was about to say and he admitted that they did have sex once. I asked when this happened, he said around October. I asked if this was before we met or after. He said “technically after...” and then said that it was actually the night we met. 

So I was really upset when I heard all this. First of all, I think he should have told me that he had hooked up with Anne before because she’s in his friend circle and I just think you should tell your SO if you’re still friends with someone you’ve had sexual relationships with. His defense was that I never asked and I’ve said I don’t think sexual history should matter in a relationship, which I guess is a good point.

The second reason I’m upset about this is because things from Anne’s point of view make a little bit more sense now. We’ve never really liked each other for obvious reasons, but she has never been mean to be and I think she’s probably a nice person. She has never outwardly confessed her feelings towards Jake, even though she tells everyone else and it is fairly easy to tell she likes him, and Jake has never said anything about knowing she has feelings for him. Now, it’s one thing to like a guy and have him dodge your advantages and never mention it, but it’s kind of another to like a guy, have sex with him, and then have him never mention it again and start dating someone else. I asked Jake if he knew Anne like him at this point and he said yes, but he didn’t think it was that serious. 

Things just don’t sit right with me. Jake said he met me, he liked me, but ultimately he didn’t know me or have a commitment to me and I didn’t want to sleep with him that night so he went for something meaningless. That’s fair, I guess...But he knew Anne liked him, and after getting “rejected” by the girl he had been trying to hook up with all night, he went with someone he knew he could get easily because he was horny I guess. It just seems a bit...Sleezy, I guess?? My reason for comig to this subreddit is that should I be upset over this or am I making a big deal out of something that happened a while ago? Is there something that can be done to make me feel better? Becuase he asked what he can do and I have no idea.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fznvhn/just_found_out_my_19f_bf_21m_slept_with_the_girl/,relationship_advice,3613,857,0.0
nobodyimportant-30,2020-04-11 19:09:53+00:00,Is my view on sex in relationships so wrong?,"I (26f) am not a prude by any means. I’ve had 4 boyfriends in my life (one for 2.5 years, two for just over a year each and one lasted 8 months) and have had 5 sexual partners. I enjoy sex when I feel emotionally connected. But I do not feel emotionally connected fast. I’ve been kind of dating around for the last 6 months and every single guy starting initiating sexual talk, guilting for sexting, trying to get handsy on the first dates, etc, despite me making my feelings crystal clear. 


I have nothing against that sort of stuff, but not right away. I want to be with somebody for a bit and actually like them, and when they’re talking about all this sexual stuff right off the bat it’s a major turn off. These are the same people that insist they’re looking for relationships. I just don’t understand it- am I so ridiculous in wanting to form a deeper connection in terms of personality and general interest in each other before having sex? I have absolutely no interest in sex with somebody I barely know and I’m starting to think I’m a freak because it seems to be the norm to *want* to sext and talk dirty and get really physical immediately. 


Is something wrong with me? Do I need to readjust myself? Or are there people who think this way and I’m just not finding them at the moment?


Edit for clarification: I see some people commenting about me wanting to wait 6 months before having sexual encounters- I think I worded my post funny or something. Usually within a month or so of getting really interested in someone and seeing/talking with them frequently, I become interested in sex and physically affection. It’s not a 6 month timeline and never has been. I’ve just been dating around for the last 6 months and seeing different guys, all of whom have been stressing sex hardcore after just a bit of talking.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fzewn5/is_my_view_on_sex_in_relationships_so_wrong/,relationship_advice,1287,516,0.0

ThrowRAindiandil,2020-01-03 14:47:11+00:00,"How can I(30f) convince my acquaintances(who thinks that they are my friends) that I am not an innocent, manipulated, gaslit victim? I am just an Indian woman living my life happily in a western country.","* I have never been with anyone but my husband. We had an arranged marriage and I am perfectly happy with it.

From a young age, I had high hopes about my man. I wanted a well educated, physically and mentally sound teetotaler with a good job and nice family. And yes, he should love and respect me. If I had met anyone like that, I might have fallen in love. I didn't want to spend my time and efforts on clueless teenagers or jobless young men. I didn't want to play trial and error with my life and I am happy that I didn't have to, at least till now.

We found the person of our dreams through arranged marriage and there aren't any compatibility issues since our families did thorough background and character enquires before marriage. 

*These friends of mine thinks that I missed out so much 'fun'. I don't regret spending my time on some worthless men*

* They hate that my MIL lives with us for half of the year

I use the term MIL so that the readers will understand things clearly. I use the same term to address both my mother and mother in law(Amma). I think my husband's mother is my mother as well(keep your stupid incest jokes to yourself). She too thinks that both her daughters in law are her own daughters, except that we entered her life quite late. She had always wanted to have a daughter and when her son's got married, she was really thrilled. She is more like my best friend or partner in crime than an authority figure.

She divides her time between her two sons and both of us are happy to have her with us. She is a very friendly and kind woman. When she is with us, she helps us with the household tasks and looks after our 18m daughter. When I am too tired, she manages everything alone. I feel guilty but she tells that she could pursue a career only because her mil looked after her children and it is her duty to support her daughters in law.

Also, we often have 'girls' nights'. I am a bit of an extrovert but my husband likes spending time alone at home. On some days, I, my daughter and mil go out, and enjoy while husband chills at home. 

*My friends think that she is taking away what should have been dates between me and my husband. None of us thinks so*.

* Our daughter is quite fond of her. I don't feel jealous that she likes her grandmother, sometimes even more than me. Grandma is more fun, knows many stories, plays with her often and spends more time with her.

Also, we make our daughter sleep on our bed, between me and my husband, like most Indian kids do. Though my friends tried to scare me with SIDS statistics, I didn't budge. Most if not &gt;90% children in Asia and Africa sleep like this and end up as perfectly normal adults. When mil is here, she takes the baby to her room sometimes so that we can get some 'private time' easily (an unspoken arrangement,of course) . 

I don't think she is stealing the affection of my daughter or that I need to establish some 'boundaries'. Even I used to like my grandparents more than my parents when I was young. That doesn't mean that I 'unloved' or disrespected my parents. I don't think that I need to be the centre of my daughter's existence. 

* Once, when my friends asked my husband whose cooking he likes the best, he replied that he likes his mother's cooking. Even I like her cooking which is far, far better than mine. I don't feel insulted or belittled. But they were like 'He shouldn't have disrespected you like that'. Wtf?

Basically they think that I and my husband should be a team, 'we' and everyone should be some outsiders, they. But I consider my family (immediate and extended) 'we'. It is not as if we are some petty nuclear family teams fighting against each other. We are a big family and everyone likes and respects each other. 

Most of them have toxic mothers or mils. These intolerable insecure women also think that everyone except their husbands and children are some monsters who are out there to steal their 'family' from them. All my family has always been good to me. And my family includes my in-laws too. It is not a bubble. 

Tl; Dr: How can I convince my acquaintances that I have a perfectly good family life? Or, how can I tell them to fuck off without coming off as too offensive?

Updates

**Why do I hang out with these women if I have a happy life?** and different variations of it

I am used to being friends with my neighbors. In India, we were like family, almost. I knew every Tom, Dick and Harry in my neighborhood. My father was friends(including his bf) with the people who used to commute with him in the train. 

Also, I am used to being a part of different social groups. I don't have to drop one to join other.

**How do these acquaintances know so much about me?**

It is my fault. Since I am not used to having too much privacy(as I said earlier, I knew a great deal of things about my neighbours and vice versa), I didn't care.

**Why did I call them 'intolerable insecure women'?**

They are intolerable. They have told me that they are insecure. And they are women.

**If I had an arranged marriage, could I go without changing my name?**

Yes. My grandmother, mother and mother in law have kept their maiden names. So did most of the working women I know. In my family, my grandmother's mil was upset, but things changed. We are from a fairly progressive area in Kerala, so we are able to live according to our convictions. 


**Am I materialistic? Why don't I like 'jobless' young men'?**

I am materialistic because I am not interested in suffering. While I am aware that we often end up suffering due to unforeseen consequences of our actions, i didn't want to make choices which are very likely to cause suffering, especially since better alternative are  available. 


**Who takes care of my parents?**

My brothers. They visit me occasionally.

**Won't grandma get bored?**

Today we had a conversation about money, family, and commitments. She basically told me that her money is hers alone to use, and I, being the guy, am supposed to pay for everything related to the family, including her allowance and expenses. Her argument is that her mum told her that a guy can easily cheat on the girl, leaving the girl with nothing, so she has to have her savings as a backup plan. She also told me giving birth is a big enough sacrifice, so I should be the one supporting the child.

Is it normal for a girl's expectation to be like this? I'm really confused and I don't know if I can handle supporting a family alone. This is really stressing me out. I mean, I don't mind being the sole breadwinner, but I probably need to earn 3x of what I do now to give my future child a good life.

ThrowRA_perplexed19,2019-11-06 20:51:19+00:00,UPDATE TO: I found out I have a daughter who thinks I was her mother's rapist. It wasn't rape. What next?,"Ten days ago I requested advice and the post got removed after a day because I didn't use a ThrowRA.  I'm reposting it below, along with an update, since some people asked for one. I alerted the moderators I would be doing this, so hopefully it will allowed.

ORIGINAL

I received an email last week from a woman claiming we are a DNA match and she is my biological daughter. It was a long and emotionally charged letter. She said she knew she was child of rape, and while she had no desire to form a relationship with me, she wanted me to know that she existed and to understand the pain and anguish I had caused her and her mother and grandparents. The letter was gut wrenching.

I was shocked but also skeptical. I have been married 25 years and I have three great kids. I have never raped or abused a woman ever! I thought this had to be a prank or scam. I had done home DNA ancestry testing two years ago, and it had not shown a child I wasn't aware of. But when I logged into my account, there she was.

I did some sleuthing and figured out that her mother was a woman, Terry (fake name), I had dated for about a month during our first semester of college in the mid-1980s.  We broke it off mutually and remained friendly. The very last night of the second semester, we hooked up at a dorm party and went to my room and had sex. It was a casual hookup and I remember it as 100% consensual and very passionate. Also unprotected. Afterwards we went back to the party and had a great time dancing and mingling with friends. We both went home the next morning for summer break. Terry didn't come back to college the next year, which I gave very little thought to since we weren't close and hadn't bothered to communicate all summer. 

One of the reasons Terry and I were incompatible was religion. She was Catholic and I'm Jewish. I was not religious but she had grown up in a strict household. My supposition is that when she discovered the pregnancy, she told her family she had been raped rather than admitting to premarital sex with a Jewish ex-boyfriend. But who knows, maybe she had other reasons. 

It kills me that I have a daughter in her 30s who has been fed lies about her father. I can't imagine growing up thinking I was a product of rape. That has to be so hard psychologically. I am in pain for a child I didn't even know existed just a few days ago, and who hates me.

I have been debating what to do. I have not written back to my daughter. I badly want to tell her the truth, in a way that she can believe (but how?). My wife, who has been a rock the last few days, keeps telling me to give this some time and thought. My best friend says I should hire a lawyer. I don't know what to do and it's eating me up. Advice, please!

UPDATE

I hired a lawyer. He recommended that I respond to my daughter's email to unequivocally deny the rape allegation. I wrote her a short message and described how and when Terry and I met. I was careful not to attack Terry and to offer sympathy. I explained that our sex was consensual. A week went by with no response.

Two days ago my daughter wrote me and said Terry now claims she was raped a month after she and I had sex, and that she was told by her doctors that the baby was born premature 8 months later. She's basically saying she was misled by her doctors. I find that very hard to believe, but if it's true it is awful and if it's not I guess it gives Terry a way out without exposing her big lie which is maybe best for everyone.

Yesterday I spoke to my daughter for the first time. She was crying and so was I, so it wasn't easy to say much. Before we hung up, I told her that I loved her because she's my flesh and blood, and I hoped we could get to know each other and meet my grandchild. She sobbed so much after that, and said she's been waiting her whole life to hear those words.

My wife and I told our kids about a week ago. They are teenagers and took it really well. All three are interested in meeting their new sister and niece. My wife....my beautiful, caring, bestest friend ever....she's been nothing but supportive. She has offered that we invite my daughter and granddaughter to visit over the Christmas holidays, even suggesting we pay the airfare and offer them our guest room. My daughter is going to call me again tonight and I'm going to propose she come, or offer to fly to her if she's more comfortable. We have a lifetime of catching up to do.

Meantime as for Terry, I feel like my daughter and I were robbed, but I really don't want to dwell on it. She hasn't reached out to me and I don't plan to either, though I'm prepared to be cordial if she does, and to listen to her story and be open minded.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dsmcm0/update_to_i_found_out_i_have_a_daughter_who/,relationship_advice,27623,1079,0.0

I \[42M\] am a single father to my daughter \[14F\]. My wife passed away with excessive bleeding after childbirth, so it's just me and her. She's a fantastic young lady, always on honor roll, really good at basketball, and a social butterfly. She doesn't see too much of me because I work 9-7, but I'm home for dinner and she's started getting really good at cooking something little for both of us.

Around Tuesday, I noticed there was something off about her. She was a whole lot quieter than she usually is and there was no chatter during dinner. Right after dinner she went up to her room, even though typically we sit and watch TV together. I figured it was just moody teenage hormones. Except it doesn't stop. Friday I finally take her hands and ask her what was wrong. She looked at me and just burst into tears. She cried more, so I held her until she was ready, and that's when she whispered, ""I'm pregnant.""

I was shocked. Utterly and completely shocked. I kept on hugging her, but my mind had gone blank. I took her upstairs, tucked her into bed. I didn't think asking her about what she planned to do when she was so vulnerable was a good idea, I'd wait until she calmed down a little. Saturday she came down for breakfast and I sat her down and asked her her plans. She said under no circumstances will she abort the baby, it's her baby and she plans to keep it full-term. I then asked about adoption, and she said she didn't want to, that she could care for it. I calmly explained that we were no way financially able to care for a baby, and who would take care of it during the day? I go to work, she goes to school, and my parents, although were a big help in taking care of my daughter when she was younger, are too old to watch a baby. She suggested she start online school, which I refused, saying I don't want her to ruin her life.

The thing is, I don't even want to consider adoption. I can't imagine her going through pregnancy, then labor, especially with what happened to her mother. I don't know if high-risk pregnancies are genetic but if she has one, what if I lose her?I told her this, and she asked me if I had no love for my grandchild. But I don't. I don't care at all about the clump of cells in her uterus, I care about her. The girl I raised. I told her today that she had to abort her child. She cried, screamed, begged, telling me to reconsider, telling me that she'd run away. There's no way I'm letting her give birth, she could tear her body apart. And for school, I don't want her to face the stigma and hurt of teen pregnancy.

At this point, I see only one way out of this, and that's telling her if she doesn't abort it, I'm kicking her out. It hurts me so much to do this but if she doesn't do one, I'm afraid her life will truly be over. I won't actually, but I'm hoping it'll push her in the right direction. I'm pretty much manipulating her, but how do I get out of this?

Where do I go from here?

TL;DR: My daughter's pregnant, we can't afford a baby, she doesn't want to give it up or abort it",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ds59s0/my_42m_daughter_14f_wont_get_an_abortion/,relationship_advice,1141,353,0.0
ThrowRAmrenzi,2019-11-05 17:06:46+00:00,[Serious] I (40M) think it’s time to disown my son (M18) and would like some outside perspective...,"Long post. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

For some context, we are a very normal upper-middle-class American family. We have been married for over 20 years and have three boys, now 18, 12, and 6. We have always provided a very stable home filled with love and support. We are very active in our childrens’ lives and interests/activities. There has never been any economic instability, abuse of any kind, or substance abuse issues in our home. 

Our oldest son has created many problems for the family for the last 8-9 years or so. It started off with academic issues, essentially a refusal to engage and participate (there is nothing that happened around this time to precipitate this). He is remarkably smart, scoring a 112 on an IQ test that maxes out at 117, but just refused to do the work. Teachers and administrators thought he was just not challenged enough by the work, but we could not find a solution to get him to engage. 

Shortly thereafter began the thievery and non-stop lying. He stole from schoolmates, neighbors, businesses, the list is endless. In one instance he used our emergency key to enter a neighbor’s home, went into her purse, into her wallet, and stole hundreds of dollars. This neighbor is so close to our family that she often vacationed with us, and that relationship was destroyed. Ultimately, his thievery led to him being expelled from his high school. We had to place him elsewhere. At this same time, he was caught stealing at school, again. This time his defense was that he was stealing money to buy food because we did not have enough money to feed him at home. Though we were very well-known to be one of the more wealthy families in town, a school administrator saw this as a mandatory report incident, and reported the family to DFS, which started an investigation. That investigation was soon closed, of course. 

We placed him in a mentorship program within his new school. The school resource officer was his mentor. This gentleman had mentored more than 20 other children in his career, successfully. After only two weeks, he told us he would no longer serve as mentor because our son was manipulative, lying, and continuing to steal, now from him. We attempted to get him mental health assistance, but every professional (literally, every one) ultimately refused to see him any longer as he was manipulative and we were informed that the therapies were actually making him a more refined and confident liar. 

Late last year we received a call from the school stating that our son had been accused of inappropriate sexual contact by numerous fellow students in his theater program. We were shocked as these kids were at our home almost daily, for months. Our son had the lead in the school play and they had been rehearsing. According to the resource officer, these activities were mutual between he and his peers, and others were being charged as well. In one instance a female classmate stated that she had “so much homework to do that even (her) boobs are sad.” In response my son grabbed her exposed bra straps, hiked them up, and told her to “put on (her) big girl panties and get to work.” She in turn slapped him on the ass. Both were ultimately charged. Our son was charged with 7 counts and a court date was set.

Then, this past March, he came into our bedroom at 6am and told me there was a cop at the door that wanted to speak to me. I had just had a very large piece of commercial machinery delivered because my company’s new commercial space was awaiting the occupancy permit, so I assumed he was there due to some complaint about the forklift in the driveway. Boy, was I wrong. I politely introduced myself and before I could finish speaking, our lives were forever changed. I suddenly noticed I could hear a helicopter approaching as the officer asked “Who is in this residence?” Before I could even answer, our home was raided by a multi-jurisdictional SWAT team. Every member of our family was literally drug out of their beds (my wife and other children) and we were lined up against the wall of our dining room at gun point. I was handcuffed in front of my children and drug out of my home to a waiting car. They had our street blocked off, a chopper hovering above, and about 40 people total, including DFS to take custody of my children. My then 5 year old was in hysterics about the “soldiers in our house with guns.” Neighbors were outside recording everything on their cell phones and streaming it live on Facebook. I just built the home and we had only moved in a few months earlier. There was our local police, county Sheriff’s Dept., State Police, and the FBI. It was like a scene from a movie. I was informed that while this was going on at my home, my company’s offices in two major US cities were also being raided. Additionally, warrants were being executed at my banks for financial records as well. 

I was very harshly questioned about my sources of income, my business activities, and most pointedly my sexual preferences and habits. It was so unreal. I just could not figure out what the hell was going on. At this point, one of the FBI agents shows me a thick file folder and informed me that I might as well come clean because they already know everything. He then told me that the warrant allowed them to remove every device from the premises (home and offices) capable of connecting to the internet. They took every phone, tablet, PC and Mac, TV, even removed the smart thermostats and home automation controllers. For hours they paraded evidence boxes out of my home. They searched every last inch. All the while DFS is questioning my wife and children. 

It turns out my oldest son had opened an account with a social media platform, in my name. He had over 24gb of child pornography, which he stored on one of my company’s servers. It included content of children as young as 5 years old. Because his phone was in my name, the home was in my name, the companies are mine, the servers belonged to my company....they thought they were raiding a 40 year old man who was distributing child porn. And potentially profiting from it.

About a month after the raids, we had a court date for the charges at school. The day before that court date, we get a call from the school that our son broke into a science lab and stole approximately $500 from numerous backpacks. I was told he was being charged and would be taken to the police station. I then received a call that he had made suicidal comments and per law, was being transported to a facility for a 72 hour hold. I had no say over where he was taken (the county contracts with a specific facility). Turns out they were not in-network and it resulted in $55,000 in medical bills. They released him after 30 hours and stated that his suicidal comments were not genuine and that he was using his knowledge of the 72 hour mandatory hold to avoid the new charges and pending court date. 

Now, let’s fast forward eight months since the raids. Because my son was still 17 when this happened, nothing is public record. There are now rumors circulating throughout the town that I am a money launderer, a drug kingpin, and my favorite: that I am a mob boss. I wish I were kidding here, folks. Of course I cannot address the situation without exposing the true nature of the raids, so I’ve had no choice but to absorb the character blows. 

We have been nothing but supportive. While he awaits trial, we got our son into a residential treatment house. He has 24/7 access to counselors and mental health professionals. We have brought Sunday dinner to him every week so we can eat as a family. I have literally bankrupted myself in legal fees and business ramifications. My home is in pre-foreclosure and my banks do not wish to do business with me any longer. I have millions of dollars in equipment sitting idle. His actions have literally cost me everything. Even through all this, and after over 4 months in this highly-respected residential program, he was again caught stealing from numerous stores and purchased a knife at a pawn shop, all in violation of the agreement with the DA that allows him to be in this program as opposed to juvenile detention while he awaits trial (as he was 17 at the time of the offenses). 

Folks, this literally covers about 10% of what we have been through with this child. I could simply write for days here to tell the full story. We are great parents and give every measure of ourselves to our boys. We have dinner together at the table every night unless I am traveling for work. Even then, I fly home if needed to be there for Sunday family dinner. Every. Single. Week. We hike, camp, are avid bikers, spend summers on the beach together, travel, and never miss the kids’ events. We sit at the dining room table doing homework, and every single night we visit each boy’s room just to talk one-on-one about their individual days, their friends, etc. I don’t know in what way we failed our oldest child, but we cannot endure any more. We have two other sons to worry about, both remarkably successful in school, social acumen, and life in general. I need to rebuild my business and focus on them.

I think it is time to quite literally disown him in pursuit of the family’s best interests. The damage he has already done is immense, and he shows no remorse and is continuing the same patterns of behavior. I would just like some outside perspective in making this decision, as it is finite and irreversible.

sisuma,2019-11-05 13:54:53+00:00,I(M38) found out my wife(F35) is having an Affair with my cousin.,"Two years ago I caught them kidding by logging in to my home security cameras. She explained it away but I always still had that suspicion ever since. Today I learned the whole truth.  They have been sexting, meetin up secretly, saying the L word. He even bought a ring for her that she has been wearing on her ring finger.  Of course excuses and lame explanations for all these suspicious activities which I didn’t buy.  They met up in another city for a long weekend getaway, he bought a vibrated for her that he can control remotely and so much more.

I’m so livid that my hands are shaking as I type.  This is the ultimate betrayal seeing as this was my cousin, that I grew up, lived with for a time, hang out with all the time, etc.

Problem is that we all have kids and are close. We hang out all the time, at least one to times a week.  I plan on kicking her out tonight and finding a divorce lawyer.

CharlotteRossss,2019-11-04 18:21:37+00:00,My cousin told everyone what my brother did to me as a teen and my mom won’t stop yelling at me for speaking out,"Sorry for formatting, this literally just happened and I don’t know what to do or if this is the right place to post.

And sorry it’s long, there’s no tl;dr , my mind is foggy as it is, sorry.

So, for context, my mom’s Mexican and she’s got this whole “pride” thing that goes on, I don’t know, but she’s prideful in how people see her.

Because of this, I’m (20) female and my older brother is I think 24 or something? I haven’t spoken to him ever since we were kids because he used to molest me as I slept and I’d wake up in different clothes that I fell asleep in and things of the sort.

A lot of that time is a blur because of time and I think I’ve blocked out some of the bad parts that aren’t worth terrorising myself out these days.

Anyways. In high school, I had severe depression and anxiety and was pretty suicidal but I got therapy in my 10 or 11th year for it. But after I told my therapist about what I hate and feel guilt for the most, about my brother, she told my dad that she was going to report that and in turn, my dad told my mom and when I got home, my mom yelled at me for the better half of an hour.

If I’m honest, I can’t remember most of what she said but I did record it (i deleted it later because of guilt I felt) and long story short, I stopped going to the therapist even though I really needed to.


Some years passed and my family had a reunion here, and while here, I told two of my cousins what happened. One of those cousins is moving over here soon and he’s a bit of a loud mouth and he told all my aunts and anyone who could hear that he was going to hurt my brother for what he did.

Naturally, this got around to my mom and once again, she yelled at me, but this time I managed to choke out my point of view because I can confidently say, she doesn’t scare me anymore. No one can scare me anymore. And no one can make me feel guilty for telling people about what happened to me.

Even so, I cry all the time when I talk about this so I was really choked up but I still fought back and I recorded it again, but this time it only lasted no more than 6 minutes.

It’s for the most part in Spanish, but i finally have a recording that I won’t delete.. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do with it but it makes me feel a bit more secure if that makes sense? As if she’s gonna try to deny what happened though..

It mainly consists of her yelling at me that mistakes happen when people are kids and that I have no idea how embarrassed she is that “everyone” knows about what happened and how obviously I’m not ashamed about anything that’s happened since I’m telling the whole world about it.

I retorted that this isn’t about her and how dare she feel embarrassed for protecting him and not sharing it. I would also say that I’m not ashamed of what happened, I won’t feel shame for something I had no control of. I also told her if she’s feeling this way, maybe she’s the one who needs therapy and that seemed to quiet her down a bit..

Relating it to the group, I guess I could do with some advice on how I should go about this? I know I’m not guilty of anything wrong because I honestly just told people what happened and it spread from there.. I don’t think my dad knows yet since he’s not home. 

Usually when she gets mad at me, she ignores me for a few days entirely but now, I don’t know what she’s going to do.. I don’t want this to blow up at all, but I’m scared if it does. 

How should I talk/approach her? Any advice on how I should continue is highly appreciated, thanks for reading..",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/drlp60/my_cousin_told_everyone_what_my_brother_did_to_me/,relationship_advice,1068,78,0.0
relthrowit,2019-11-04 15:05:26+00:00,My (M36) girlfriend (f29) introduced me as her friend,"So my girlfriend and I met through an outdoor sport that we are both very passionate about. The sport is kayaking, it’s male dominated and is hard for women to be taken seriously. When we started dating, I knew and expected a lot of her friends would be male and that was not an issue to me at all. We both have friends of the opposite sex...we’re both adults and  comfortable with that.  This relationship has been one that I’ve felt great about since day one. We communicate well and I’ve really had the feeling that we are not just in love but a great team also. 

    This weekend however was a rough one. We were hosting a friend after recently moving in together and went to a big annual race on Saturday. I was pretty tired after a long work week and getting ready for our friend to visit and I already knew I wasn’t at my best Saturday. 
We were hanging out at the race and she ran into one of her long time male friends. This was my first time meeting him and initially, I was glad to get to. When she saw him however, her face absolutely lit up and she got this very high pitched voice to say “hi”. I was a little thrown off by that but I chalked it up to being tired and grumpy. Then she started talking  to him and introduced me as “This is my Friend (my name)”  she has historically introduced me as her boyfriend up until this person. 

I didn’t know what to do, for some reason it killed me on the inside and I was immediately jealous. I told her right away that I thought that was messed up and I couldn’t even be around her. We spent the rest of the event apart. I didn’t want to fight in front of our guest. Later that night, I asked her why she chose those words. She said she didn’t know and I never got a real answer back. She just said she loved me, etc.. We talked a little about the guy, said she never had a history with the him but it’s still not sitting right with me. I’m really to the point where I’m questioning wether or not this is worth my time anymore.

ArizonaThoraway,2019-11-04 12:16:40+00:00,"Final Update: My Son [17] found a sex tape of my wife and I [35F &amp; 40M] and now our kids are freaking out and not talking to us, now with extra problems","So I wasn't going to post anything more, especially after the reception my last posts received, but it's very early and I'm not doing anything for a while yet so I decided to let everyone know how it all turned out.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry to disappoint but: I haven't killed myself, my children don't hate me, and my life isn't in ruins.  So for those of you who told me to ""neck myself"" and everyone who decided that my relationship with my children was ruined forever, I sincerely pity how terrible a relationship you had with your parents and hope you never breed.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, my last post yielded little advice and consisted mostly of people telling me  how fucked everything was (shoutout to u/sabreyna for actually giving some advice) so I decided to just ignore you all and do what I thought was best. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went to see my sister on the Saturday morning and when I arrived she seemed surprised to see me but invited me in anyway. She explained that her shortness over text was because she was dealing with her own problems with her/my children. She told me that Cousin was being bullied by my Daughter at school apparently for no reason. I realized it must be about her blabbing about the tape so I explained the situation (leaving out the contents of the tape obviously cause I'm not stupid). She decided to punish her daughter for being disrespectful of someone indulging sensitive information and we agreed that I would talk to my daughter about how wrong her behavior had been. (Yes she is religious but she isn't insane and she doesn't judge me).

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to let my kids stew without their electronics until the Sunday while I helped my wife pull herself out of her shame spiral. After a long day of helping and supporting her she seemed to snap out of it and slept peacefully for the first time since this all happened which I was very grateful for. On the Sunday we decided as a team to sit down with our kids and talk to them again. We started with out daughter as she seemed easier to deal with. 

&amp;#x200B;

We sat her down and I explained to her that what she did was similar to me reading her diary and then telling other people what was written in it. There's nothing wrong with having a diary and there's certainly nothing wrong with what was written in it, but it is embarrassing to have others know.  She understood the example and apologized. We then got onto the topic of the cousin and explained that, while what cousin did was very wrong, she shouldn't be so hard on her and to stop with the bullying. Our daughter agreed although she said their friendship was done and I said that was fair enough. We gave her back her electronics and reduced the grounding to a week (what she did was still wrong and so requires punishment).

&amp;#x200B;

We next called down our son and talked to him about why he was punished. His mother is his mother and no child, regardless of the reason, has any right to talk to their mother the way he did, same goes for me. He apologized for what he said and then we talked about schools and if he wanted to change school. He was genuinely scared that we were going to switch his schools and he explained that the bullying wasn't that bad, just some ""loser kids"" who were throwing stuff at him and hassling him in the halls. My son is very well liked at his school and has many friends and loves his sports so we decided not to move school. I did the same with him that I did with my daughter and gave him back his electronics.

&amp;#x200B;

During the week I got a call from his school that he had been in a fight and was facing suspension so I went to the school and it turns out he got fed up of the harassment and beat up one of the ""bullies"". The principal was talking serious punishment but I told him to fuck himself and explained that my son was standing up for himself against people who were using sensitive information to bully him. At the end of the day it was decided that a series of detentions was more appropriate for both people involved which we accepted as a compromise. I told my son I was proud of him for standing up for himself and that he wouldn't get any punishment at home. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for the whole community finding out, well it turns out that adults don't tend to believe children when they talk gossip (shocking I know) and all that is known is that my wife and I have a sex tape. So no one cares, or at least no one we care about cares. 

&amp;#x200B;

So we are back to a sort of normal. The kids are talking to us again and eating dinner at the table and we are all a lot calmer, if still a bit tense. In the future we will be A LOT more careful about this kind of thing.

&amp;#x200B;

To address a few things from the last post: Yes the world isn't fair, but why should I then teach my children to contribute to that unfairness? Answer: I shouldn't.  

&amp;#x200B;

Why just punish the kids, what about your punishment? LOL parenting isn't quid-pro-quo. 

&amp;#x200B;

The laptop did have a password on it. It was unlocked as I had been using it barely 10 minutes earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

There is nothing wrong, neither morally nor ethically, with recording a sex tape of consenting adults. People calling me and my wife degenerates can crawl back to whatever sad little hole they crawled out of.

&amp;#x200B;

So sports is a very divisive subject! People also had a lot of really helpful advice and also reassured me that I wasn't getting worked up over nothing. 

The crux of the situation was that it felt like my partner was getting his way or the highway. He's never been fantastic at communicating his feelings, but the night after he told me the news, he sat me down and wanted to talk. He walked me through all the reasons about how what he did was wrong, why it was wrong, and how knows it was a huge mistake. He apologized profusely. I just sat and listened, and honestly it felt really nice to see him speaking up and taking responsibility. He did admit that he should have told me right away how much it meant to him to be making friends for the first time in ages. He moved to my country to be with me and was having a hard time making connections with people that weren't already my own friends. 

He assured me he is going to take 100% of the responsibility for planning our long weekend getaway. And today he took me out and told me we are going to do anything I wanted because it was my day. We had a great time just being silly and having a fun time together. He also apologized for trying to ""win me over"" with the dinner the other night, and said it was terrible to assume everything would be okay just because he wined and dined me.

mygoldenhandcuffs,2019-11-03 13:44:53+00:00,My(20F) boyfriend(27M) won’t stop making me to shower multiple times a day,"Hello everyone.

Me and my boyfriend are long distance, which means that when we meet we usually stay together for around 2 weeks either at his or my place.

We’ve been together for 5 months now, and from the start I knew hygiene is important for him. It wasn’t a deal breaker, and I didn’t think to much of it.

Now, a couple of days ago I went to visit him and i am currently staying at his place, the thing is that he is really insisting on me taking showers in certain moments. When we first met he told he showers both in the morning and evening. I said fine, I shower only in the evening, and the topic was over.

This time tho is different. On the top of the shower I take right before going into bed, in the morning he’d put a lot of pressure on me to shower, to the point I’m obligated to do so. He’d start saying how he would feel dirty, not fresh, how it’s just not right. When I told him that I literally showered before going to bed and literally hadn’t done anything or went out just like him he said that he would still feel dirty. When I asked him if he thought that I was dirty he didn’t answer and just gave a weird look.

Another situation is straight after sex, he’d put me in a position where I can’t say no. I’d obviously still clean up, but he explicitly asks me to get up and get a shower no matter what time it is.
This happens every single time and puts a lot of pressure on me, because he usually asks me to have a shower before sex too and it’s just mentally draining.

If I refuse to shower he starts giving me looks, asking multiple times if I won’t shower and I just feel dirty and unclean in general even if he doesn’t say it.

I tried to talk to him multiple times in a calm and rational way to ask why he felt this way and explain logically to him that I felt and was for a fact clean and didn’t need that many showers in a day. He won’t listen to me or accept my point of view. 
I’d also like to add that I am a fairly skinny girl and don’t have any sweating problems.

Any advice on how to handle this situation?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dr0jmg/my20f_boyfriend27m_wont_stop_making_me_to_shower/,relationship_advice,1091,253,0.0
Florentina5052,2019-11-03 12:10:08+00:00,My boyfriend has half-naked screenshots of girls that he knows in his phone.,"My boyfriend and I (we’ll call him M) have been dating for over two years now. About a year and a half into our relationship, I caught him looking at some screenshots he had taken of a mutual friend of ours off of her Instagram and sorry for being crass but well... basically using them to get himself hard.

Of course I freaked out and almost broke up with him but he stopped me. He cried and begged and pleaded and swore up and down that he’ll change and that he’ll never do it again. And I believed him so we kept on dating.

Flash forward to a year later (now) I look on M’s phone and find out that he took another screenshot of another mutual friend of ours from a Halloween picture she posted. Not only that, I find his secret Instagram account where he follows about 20 mutual friends and saves pictures where they look provocative in. Including some that I didn’t even know he found attractive including his ex girlfriend.

ThrowRAgold,2019-11-03 03:44:02+00:00,"My (f30) husband (m34) is having an affair, and excuses it by saying “I would never fuck you the way I fuck her”.","I’ve had suspicions about my husband’s fidelity but I always tried to tell myself I am being paranoid. But it was lingering in my mind. He will leave in the night or early morning, and if I ask where he is going he’ll tell me things like “mind your business” or “go back to sleep”. I didn’t want to be a jealous insecure woman and that’s how he made me felt if I said anything. 

But Thursday, his card statements came in the mail and I just decided to look. I thought what’s the harm in just seeing if there’s anything. But there were constant hotel charges, and even ones at a florist and jewelry store. I just didn’t want to lie to myself anymore and I really couldn’t, so I showed it to him when he came home from work. All I did was ask what it was and told him not to lie. He told me “I’ll tell you the truth if that’s what you want”. I nodded and he said he’s been seeing this woman for a little, he told me “it’s just sex, you know it’s different with you you’re my wife”. He told me he doesn’t love her, he only loves me. He said I am more beautiful. I asked him why he wants more than me and he told me “because I would never fuck you the way I fuck her”. I don’t really understand what he means but I am trying to imagine. I don’t know if it was meant to make me feel better, but I started to tear up. I just felt so defeated and all my energy was gone so I walked away from him. And I’ve been very distant since, I’ve been almost silent I’ve only said a few words.

He’s been trying to bribe me like I’m a child. Flowers and gifts. He’s already given me chocolate, wine, perfume, lotion, essential oils, candles, and jewelry he’s gave me a very nice bracelet and a necklace I’ve been wanting. He’s left them for me but I haven’t touched his gifts other than to see what it is, I don’t want them. It’s like it’s Valentine’s Day but we aren’t talking. He’s at least given me the space that I want, he doesn’t push me to speak to him and he’s not sleeping in our bedroom. 

I feel sad but it’s a numb sadness. I am less emotional about it than I thought I would be. I feel more petry emotions than strong hurt or anger right now. What more could he want? I try to be perfect for him I don’t see where I’m lacking. What do his words mean? Is there any hope he’ll stop? I rely on financially, we have a son, and I still love him so it’s hard for me to imagine leaving. But should I? I just can’t think with any clarity on my own, my judgement is clouded.

JesusofMethlehem,2019-11-03 02:28:53+00:00,I (26F) just found out I'm sleeping with a (legal) HIGH SCHOOLER,"My fiance and I parted ways in August so I decided to give Tinder a try to cleanse my palate. A month ago I matched with a guy whose bio said he was 21 and he looks it so I never thought twice about it. From the first messages we got along really well and since it's just for sex I figured whatever, he's in his 20s, five year gap is no big deal. We've been hooking up a couple times a week at my apartment (he said he lives at home which many 21 year olds do so I also never second guessed that, either). The sex is bomb, he's hella cute, all was going well UNTIL I sent my little sister (a current college freshman) a screenshot today of his tinder pic and she said he was in the grade below her at her high school!! 

He's in fucking high school! And I'm sleeping with him. I, a 26 year old woman four years into my career. That's fucked, right? I texted him to come over this afternoon and asked him point blank to please tell me his true age. Evidently he was held back in 1st grade and he turned 18 literally the day we matched on tinder. He says he put 21 in his bio because he has a fake from his brother and thought  girls on tinder might want to meet at bars and then once he and I started getting together regularly he never could figure out the right time to say ""hey by the way I could use a hand with my 12th grade history homework...because I'm an 18 year old in grade school..."" and I can see why he felt that way. I made him show me his real driver's license and he is indeed 18 but what now?? I should stop sleeping with him, right? Or no?

I'm(F) 19 this year, my partner(M) is 21. We've been together for about 6 months.
I've got minor-medium facial scarring on the left side of my face, and I have a prosthetic eye. Short story short wear bike helmets and don't be a fucking idiot when you're with your friends.

Alright, my boyfriend has been with me for 6 months now, and for the most part, we get along well. Now I'm gonna admit, my temper needs work because I can be snappy sometimes but I've made clear from the start that I don't want to talk about my scars nor have them be touched etc. It makes me uncomfortable and generally ruins any good mood in the situation. 

My issue is he keeps doing things like touching them with his fingers and calling me beautiful as if I want reassurance about the most fucking horrible thing about me. I try to be nice about it, but I just can't make it clear enough how much I hate it. He also makes comments about how I should get some stupid weird looking prosthetic with patterns and stuff and he doesn't get that I just want to look normal, I just want to be allowed to forget about that stuff as much as possible. 

I guess the problem is he doesn't get just how serious it is to me and that making light hearted jokes about it just makes me feel like I'm different and I hate it. I already have stupid questions from people who don't know me well that make me feel insecure, but he knows me and has been told.

I snapped about it last night and he went off saying that I'm making a big deal out of nothing and I should be grateful he's trying. Was I being unfair? I feel like it's okay for me to ask him to leave that part of me and my life alone so I can move on as best as possible but apparently not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dqkfrx/bf_wont_leave_my_scars_alone_and_keeps_bringing/,relationship_advice,7442,966,0.0

I’m 20 years old, my brother is barely 18, and my step dad’s sister (our step aunt) just turned 40 years old. 

My brother did something very stupid. My mom got remarried about 12 years ago and we have a very close bond with my stepdad’s family. We see her just like a normal aunt since she has been around when we were just kids. She started getting too close with my brother about a a year and a half ago. 

The past 2 summers she has wanted him to spend a week at her place and she has basically spoiled him because he’s her favorite. She has flirted with him like complimented him on his looks and his body before, but everybody just saw it as jokes, it wasn’t a real problem. 

She also stays at our place a lot during holidays since we live about 1 hour away from each other. She stayed last week because it was her birthday and she wanted to celebrate with us. Long story short, she was fcking my brother and we all found out because apparently my mom heard them after waking up to use the restroom.

Everybody freaked out and my parents have been shaming my brother since and they have also not talked with my aunt. My parents are pissed and I understand why, but my brother is just 18 and he really has no clue of what he was doing. I can tell it’s really affected him and I want to help my little brother out, but my parents are also kind of right because what they did is stupid. I’m stuck in between and I really need some advice!!

Throwawayelephant47,2019-11-02 04:25:15+00:00,My (31F) husband (31M) shared very personal / private information about me with his friends. Not sure how to proceed to feel less betrayed.,"I had an extremely tumultuous childhood - I had emotionally, verbally, and physically abusive and alcoholic parents. I have been extremely private with my personal life for my entire life. My husband is very aware that I like to keep my personal life private. 

My dad left me and my siblings when I was 14. He moved just a few streets away but decided he never wanted to have anything to do with us again. So I would see him around town occasionally but he would just always act like I didn’t exist. I had to drop out of high school my senior year after my mom was arrested to take care of my little sisters while working two jobs. 

My life was hard and it sucked for a long time. I eventually went back to school, got my masters in accounting, I’m a CPA, I work for a global public accounting firm, I bought a home and later met my husband. I keep my personal history extremely private. I have told my husband and maybe 2 other people in my life. 

This year my dad was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. I found out because my cousin posted about it on FB, I had not seen or spoken to my dad (except once at a court hearing) for 17 years. We called to see if we could come say goodbye before he died - he said no, that we weren’t welcome and had no interest in seeing us and then he died a few weeks later. 

Also this year my mom was arrested for her 5th dui after being physically abusive to my grandma and my sisters. So I needed to kind of deal with that out of no where.  After everything calmed down a bit with that I started processing stuff. I had never dealt with anything from my childhood - and my dad dying was just kind of a huge gut punch for me. I became extremely depressed and started drinking in a really unhealthy way (drank to just numb out and not think about my childhood). This went on for about 6 weeks - I then talked to a therapist and told my husband I had a drinking problem and checked into a detox and then a 30 day rehab / trauma program. 

It was amazing. I dealt with so much that I had just never dealt with before - it was life changing and life saving. I’m so glad that I did it. 

When I left for the program I made it extremely clear to my husband that I didn’t want any of these details from my life shared with others. He could tell people that I was with my family in the city where my family is and that’s it. He agreed and said he absolutely understood that it was my story to tell when and how I was ready and not his place to share. 

I came back from the program and everything was good then I found out about two months later that he told our mutual friends about my problem with drinking - after he had specifically told me that he hadn’t and he had also told them about my dad abandoning me / not wanting me / and that he died and told me he didn’t want to see me before he died (he said this is all he told them but who actually knows since he initially lied and said he didn’t tell anyone anything, then he lied and said it was just his one best friend, then it turned out it was his one best friend and his fiancé, and then it was also best friend’s parents and then it was also another friend... and that’s what I know about so far). 

I am honestly furious. I am extremely private and I have been my whole life and I feel like he has stolen my privacy from me and totally betrayed me. I also felt like a fool - because I told these people that I was getting some help, but never gave details - but was clearly not honest with them. So I feel like I’m painted as a foolish liar. 

He said he did it because he was overwhelmed by the whole situation and needed to talk to someone. I think that is why we paid for a therapist for him.  

I don’t know how to get past this. These people are his really good friends - so we spend a lot of time with them and I just feel so hurt and betrayed every time we spend time with them because all I can think about is how he told them my painful past. I also just feel really bad about myself when we’re around them. 

Tl;dr: my (31F) husband (31M) shared with friends some personal details that I specifically asked him not to. Any advice on how to get over and get past this? Am I wrong for being upset at him?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dqfjb4/my_31f_husband_31m_shared_very_personal_private/,relationship_advice,1050,246,0.0

By the time we got to bed and I tried initiating I was quickly turned down. Frustrated, I rolled over and tried to sleep. A couple of minutes later my wife cuddled up close and was my big spoon, which felt nice. She then started rubbing my butt, which felt even better. This is the first time in a very long time that she has touched me in a remotely sexually way without me asking. Her hand then goes to my butt hole area (still outside of my shorts). I had no reaction to this, positive or negative. She pulls her hand away and says she thought touching me there would scare me and make me jump, and asked if I wanted her to finger me. I told her I would be down for it if she wanted to do it. I’m open to the idea.

She absolutely freaks out, jumps out of bed and is walking out of our bedroom saying she is going to sleep on the couch before I realize what is going on.

I tell her she’s being ridiculous, and to come back to bed. We then cuddle until she falls asleep. I’ve felt like shit about myself all night and all day today. I feel ashamed and embarrassed for being ok with her touching me there. I’ve always told her I’m open to anything she wants to do with me or to me. I had no idea she was doing it to scare me.

ThrowRAsmoothies,2019-11-01 17:15:17+00:00,(33F) I caught my Husband (34M) putting his semen in my smoothies…8 year marriage.,"Yep you read that right. Absolutely at a loss here. 

So my husband makes me an energy smoothie on mornings I go to the gym. He has been doing this for the past couple months. I used to make them myself and when he started getting up early wanting to do it for me, I thought it was such a sweet thing.

Now today, this morning, I came in the kitchen to see him with his pants down and penis out, masturbating with one hand, the other holding the blender container in front of his penis. He hadn't noticed me because his eyes were closed, he was very shall we say engrossed. I didn't quite believe what I was seeing. I said ""what are you doing?"" This whole moment is kind of a blur, but what I remember is he startled a bit, and then all at the same time he let go of his penis, started to say something, and ejaculated into the blender. 

The fast-forward version of what happened after is that we had a huge fight, I was just in shock and so disgusted, I felt like I didn't even know him. Why the hell would he do something like that. 

He kept insisting this was the only time he'd done it. I said that's bullshit because ever since he started making the smoothies they tasted a little different in a way I couldn't place. I'd shown him exactly how to make them so I realized I'd just found the reason why. He kept denying it and saying I was imagining a different taste. So if he's done it before he's not admitting. He wouldn't answer the WHY either. First said it was just a joke. Then said he wasn't thinking and it seemed like ""a hot idea"" in the moment because he was horny. Yeah okay, says the guy with the sex drive of a rock who barely even looks at porn let alone initiates anything with me. I'm like so were you gonna blend all that shit up like that and give it to me? He goes WTF OF COURSE NOT WHY WOULD I DO THAT. Well I don't know, why would you JACK OFF INTO MY SMOOTHIE in the first place???

So he just kept being defensive, then aggressive and eventually said this was going to make him late for work, and stormed off upstairs to get dressed. He didn't even have to go to work for another hour.

I'm furious. I feel so gross and just angry, we've been in marriage counseling since the summer and I thought things were really turning around. We used to argue a lot and now we hardly ever do (until this). He cut back a lot on his gaming, started doing his share of chores around the house, and I stopped micromanaging him about it. I've started losing weight. It seemed like things were well on their way to being like when we first got married. Now I've caught him doing this. Now I'm wondering if the whole reason he started making my smoothies wasn't actually a gesture to show he cares about me like our counselor talked about.

I can't imagine facing him tonight. What do I say. What should I make of this. Why would he possibly think that's okay??

TL;DR: I caught my husband masturbating into my smoothie this morning and suspect he's been doing it for weeks. He won't admit anything. We both left the house angry this morning. Guess I was wrong about marriage counseling being a success.

ExcludedForBalto,2019-11-01 15:01:42+00:00,"[UPDATE] I [20F] found a spy camera in a room I occupy, and change in, at my BF's parents house.","Original Post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/doqgvp/i_20f_found_a_camera_in_a_room_i_occupy_and/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Okay so originally I typed this update 2 days ago, and much has happened since then so I'm just going to put what I had and update it as needed.

I'm really lost at this point. My BF and I originally decided the best thing to do would be to calm down, make a plan to move out and just go as soon as possible, but that didn't last long, and honestly at this point in time, I'm actually glad it went this way. 

On his way home he became very irritated and snapped. He couldn't just let this act slide, so he didn't. He first texted the photo I sent him to his mom and asked what the deal was, and much to my surprise, she had NO idea what he was talking about. It was genuine, but at this point I just can't see her the same way, involved or not. He then asked his dad, and the answer in return made my heart sink, ""It's a night light.""

My BF was furious. His dad tried to explain, but my BF was having none of it. He then asked me to see what was on the card because he was confronting him, no turning back now. Because I'm no good with phone technology, I had to wait for him to come help me. I stayed at a nearby friend's house until he was able to meet me there and help me review the footage.

When we were able to see the videos, it was weird. There were quite a few, but most were about 5-10 minutes long, and they were only dated for three days, one being around the beginning of October, one mid october, and the other on the day I noticed it in the room. The very first video was of the kitchen, it almost seemed like he was testing the device. The next video was a few hours later and was in the room I occupied. This specific day we would have been home, but decided to go out, so not much was captured. The placement of the camera is very troubling because it was plugged in under the desk I use and into the outlet I use for my laptop. The mid day was the same way, but I was in my BF's room for the morning instead on that day.

The videos dated for the day I saw the device are even more troubling. It shows video of me walking around, gathering my stuff, laying out clothes, packing my bag, folding blankets, basically everything I did that morning. Then there's one last video, that one I'm worried about the most. But fortunately/unfortunately? The video file is corrupted and I cannot view it; I assume it became corrupted when I yanked the device out of the wall when I first noticed it.

I didn't view the videos second for second, but instead just jumped around timestamps, but it's very obvious it was filming me, I was unware, and it was in seemingly secret spots. That was all my BF needed to see and know and from then he took off for his parents' house. I stayed and talked to my friend About the situation until he returned.

First words out of my BF's mouth was that it's very evident that his dad is lying. He tried excuse after excuse, changed the story multiple times, kept repeating himself to make it sound good, etc. It started with: he bought it long ago, and forgot about it. Then he didn't remember buying it at all. Then he did remember buying it, but didn't know there was a camera. Then he claimed no, he found it in a drawer and thought it was a Night light. He thought to put it in the room for me so I wasn't super dark for me. 

None of that makes sense to me. Its really hard to believe the most tech savvy person I've ever met wouldn't know what it was. It bothers me that he even bought one in the first place. If he did buy it long ago, was his plan for me? His wife? His daughter? Even his son? Its a spy camera, he obviously had some weird intent with it. Also, I doubt anyone would sell a night light without advertising that it comes with a camera and that the actual night light part doesn't work. Also, he put it in the room for me, despite me never complaining that it was too dark. There's the ceiling light, a lamp, and even my TV screen to help me see. And lastly, what I don't understand the most is why it was moved around so much if it was just a night light. It starts in the kitchen, then it's in the room. It had to have left the room several times because I've plugged and unplugged my laptop every single day and never have I seen it when doing so. Then it just magically appears in a different spot on a different day. If it's a Night light, why would you be using it 3 days out of the month and only for a few hours at a time, and, if I might add, when it's not even freaking dark out and mainly in the morning? It never shows being used while it's night or dark in the room. There's a night light in the hallway and in two bathrooms, and they have never moved once since I've been there.

Eventually after just being dumbfounded over the information I tried to collect myself and call my parents. They understood the circumstances and allowed us to go to my house and live there until we can sort out a new living situation. They were very understanding and even let my boyfriend stay because they didn't want him in that sort of unhealthy environment either. So from there I went home, and my BF went to his house to gather some belongings and then went to my house.

I don't know how long we have here, my mom is helping out by trying to find some affordable places, but I don't know what we could afford and how it will work out. My BF right now is working on getting his own phone plan, medical insurance, and all that because he wants to just cut all ties with his family, save his sister and grandparents. He ended up telling his sister and she was just struck with disbelief and rendered speechless. He wanted to tell his whole extended family, even his dad's mother, but I don't know if he will. I understand why he wants to, but (and I know it's stupid) I don't want his family seeing it as my fault. I know it's not my fault at all, but I'm involved and I just feel like they'll always see it as that. Its also kind of embarrassing in a way, and I just don't want that kind of attention to it (by people I know, I mean.) 

Continuing on, Yesterday we stopped by his house to gather what we could of our stuff. Something broke on his car, so we had to use mine, which I was fine with. I just stayed in the driveway in My car while he went in and gathered what he could. I was okay with this, he didn't pressure me to go or anything. But we got what we could and what we needed and left and plan to make a few more trips to get the last of our stuff. It makes it difficult that his dad works from home, but whatever. Right now I'm starting to wonder if this is why he started working from home, because he only started doing it in late September. 

Yesterday was alright. My BF spent a long time cheering me up and just distracting me, which I needed. Toward the night I realized it took a large toll on him too. He was very upset, and I did what I could to comfort him. He worries my parents hate him because he put me in that situation, but they don't think that at all. He's stressed about having to really be on his own and I don't think he's ready for it. We had Some stuff planned for the holidays but seems we can't really do that anymore, and tons of other stuff. I did remind him that while he is leaving his family, my family still loves him and will take him with open arms. 

As for me, I'm just really lost. I feel like everything is surreal, and I'm in shock of some sort. Like I have calmed down since the panic from the situation, but I'm still in this weird disbelief stage where my head is just like ""It didn't happen, it never happened"" but yet, I saw the video, I have the card, we moved our stuff out and to my house... Its just weird and I don't know how to feel. I don't think I'm processing this properly, but I don't know how to do it right. Never in a million years did I think this would happen to me, and I just don't know what to do.  When I think about it, I get weird anxiety washing up over me. I find myself checking corners and outlets more, and it's weird because it's my own house, my own room, my own space that I know my parents haven't tampered with, but I still feel the need to check. I'm trying to just immediately push it into the past, but I still feel weird over the situation. I feel a million times better about being in my own house in my own room, with my BF beside me, but I still feel so paranoid.

I wish I knew how to process and overcome this, but I'm not sure how. As for right now I think for the rest of the year my BF and I are going to figure out out finances and financial situation, start saving more, heal together, and look for places at the start of next year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dq5eaz/update_i_20f_found_a_spy_camera_in_a_room_i/,relationship_advice,1129,89,0.0
throwawaycraxkhead,2019-11-01 08:51:45+00:00,I(27) found out that my boyfriend(29) of 6 years has been putting crack in my weed,"I'm sorry if this is all over the place. 

As the title says, my boyfriend has been putting crack in our weed. 
This is a throwaway for obvious reasons. 

We have been together for 6 years. We have lived together for 4.

 We have no children. During the summer, I decided to start back smoking weed. It wasn't enjoyable the first few times as I was always too high but pushed through. 
I finally found the strain that works for me and enjoy it when I want to. 

The problem is, I do not know how to roll. When I do mine, I buy the cones where you just stick it in and twist. 
My boyfriend on the other hand is a pro.
He keeps the weed in a safe inside of his closet and he's the one we agreed will be responsible for rolling and he's the one that picks it up from the dispensary. 

Anyway, it started off as an *occasional* thing but I realized too late that I *NEEDED* to smoke. I have been smoking multiple times a day, any time I can. 
I could never smoke more than a few hits at a time, let alone an entire blunt but I was really going to town and tried to take a break for tolerance sake, realized I was completely unable to.
I made an offhand comment to him about how since smoking weed, I eat a lot but dropping weight like crazy. I'm already thin so it's not something I like. 
He brushed me off. 

I usually catch the tail end of him rolling a blunt, or I'll get home to one already done and I'll just partake. 

Today though, I actually walked in on him putting something extra in the blunt. I asked and he laughed and said it's something that makes the high better. 
""Well, what the fuck is it?"" 
He wouldn't answer, I assumed it was crystalized thc but he said no, and it didn't matter because I've been smoking it already anyway so it doesn't make any difference. 

I asked if it was cocaine and he said ""Yeah sometimes if we can afford it, crack is cheaper though.""


I have no idea what to do or say to something like that. 
How do you decide to get someone addicted to a drug like this???? I couldn't even reply, I just.... left. 
I've been sitting in my parked car at Walmart for hours in tears.

 What do I do? 
Do I go to rehab? 
How do I tell my family? 
Is this something that can be reported?

This is someone I've known since I was 15 years old.
This is someone I've trusted with my entire life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dq1l3h/i27_found_out_that_my_boyfriend29_of_6_years_has/,relationship_advice,1131,164,0.0

This_a_Test,2019-11-01 00:42:23+00:00,My (29M) girlfriend (26F) peed on me today,"Sorry for any formatting issues as I'm typing this on my phone.

My girlfriend and I took our first shower together today. We started out with some heavy kissing and then had sex. After sex, we both stood embracing each other. Which ended up in a very serious/intimate talk. We were turned sideways in the shower where the water was hitting both of us. Her back to the wall. My body pressed against hers. It was an amazing talk, eyes locked, one of my legs between the two of hers. Such an amazing moment. 

This talk is about 15 mins in when I kind of get a faint smell of urine. I think to myself, ""Wtf!? Where could this be coming from?!"". My dog follows me EVERYWHERE so I instantly think maybe hes peeing in the bathroom! 

So I start to back up from my gf. I notice her eyes begin to turn to fear. As I'm backing up, I look down to realize... shes peeing... on my f'ing leg!!! Her, being mortified, begins vomiting words. ""OMG we were having such an amazing moment and I didnt know what to do, and we were in the shower, and... and....."" I instantly bust out laughing. It was so awkward I didnt know how else to react. I ease the awkward situation by making a little fun of her and calling her R. Kelly the rest of our day. 

So I have to ask you, Reddit, would you ever try to sneakily pee on your partner to not end an intimate moment?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dpwwl0/my_29m_girlfriend_26f_peed_on_me_today/,relationship_advice,1066,176,0.0

I am in the process of finding a new place. He admitted to me the other night that he had his ex over while I was at work. So is whole family knows this but yet they smile in my face acting like nothing's wrong. Of course they would, of course they're going to cover for him. He says that she brought up getting back together but the important thing is that he chose me but to me it doesn't matter. I don't see why he would even have her at the house.

The way he talks about her, it's clear that he's not over. So I told him that if he thinks he would be happy with her than to go for it. If he feels that strongly about it then he needs to just go ahead and get back together with her. The thing is, she's with somebody too and I'm sure he wouldn't be too happy if he found out they were talking to each other because he can't stand my now ex.

To me that is the ultimate betrayal. Why the hell would you bring an ex over to the house that you share with your current partner unless you were doing something Shady? He claims nothing is going on between them but I don't believe him. He admitted to me that he talked to her while I was sitting right across from him. So I'm done.

 I'm moving on and I'm prepared to raise this baby on my own. Nothing good can come of me staying with him. He's made it clear that I do nothing but annoy him so I'm out. He says that I cut him off at the knees but he makes me feel the same way. He makes me feel like I can't be myself around him without him criticizing me. I know that that is the number one sign that someone is cheating or getting ready to is that they criticize everything you do.

God knows how long this has been going on between them. She couldn't stand me and made no effort to hide it. I don't care if he says he chose me, the fact is he still entertaining other women while he's with me. His Facebook friends list is 99% female. I deserve better than this and I will find somebody eventually regardless. He is trying to convince me that no one else will want me because I'm going to have a kid now. That's bullshit and we both know it. He's just trying to make me think I can't do better so I'll stay with him and he can continue to abuse me.

The worst part about it is that his family sees what he's doing to me and does nothing to help me. To me, if you see abuse happening and you don't do anything to interfere and try to stop it then you're as bad as the person who's doing the abuse. His whole family is toxic and I want nothing to do with them. Looks like I'm going to be doing this on my own but honestly I'm okay with that. It's better than my son being raised in a chaotic environment like that. We'll be fine. Thank you for all the comments on my previous post.

We haven't had sex yet, but we've done oral and kissing a lot.  Everything has been going great until I get a message in the game from her account saying it was her brother.  He told me that she has been lying about her age and I need to break up with her.  He told me she was actually 12.  I was shocked and didn't believe it, but he showed me proof.

And then all I did was asked him if he felt alright, and he just stood up and flipped the table. All the glasses and plates shattered. I had candles burning and the tablecloth started to catch on fire but he dumped a pitcher of water on it before he stormed away. 

I was stunned. My son was crying his heart out. I just tried to soothe him but I felt like crying myself. After my son went to sleep, I cleaned everything up alone. I’ve been in the bath for hours because I don’t want to have to face my husband. 

I just don’t understand where I went wrong. Maybe I should have just been quiet but it was only a question. And my tone wasn’t disrespectful or anything. I just wanted to know what I can do for him.

First of all, Thankyou for each and every comment, and to the people who messaged me personally with their experience and warnings. 

I hoped to provide an update after returning from hometown, didn't feel up to it. Presently was at my parents house for Diwali, am really happy after what seems like a long time. Thought of updating the good internet people.  

So basically I was an idiot, a big one.  Made 2 mistakes. First one was to expect that the woman who didn't spoke against the harassment of her daughter is going to go home and confront her husband. She did nothing of that sorts. Not even told her husband that I confronted her (got to know this later). Second one was to take my wife to her hometown despite warning from kind strangers here on Reddit. 

Long story short, there was a confrontation, ugly one between me and FIL. I basically booked an earlier flight, fuck traditions, fuck ceremonies, and returned the same night the day we went. Can't go into much details. Only thing I feel bad is my wife's younger brother was there too, and I kinda dragged him also into this, for not protecting his sister. He didn't knew anything. He was the only person who apologised to me, and to his sister, for what happened. In heat of the moment I said some harsh words, like told him to not bring his wife to that household when he marries 

Taking advice from reddit, I played the family card. My wife is telling whosoever from her family is asking what happened is that her in laws do not want her to go to her hometown as relations between my parents and her parents are soured. And her mother is telling people that Damad Ji (Me) is angry with them, which I actually am.  Her mother still calls my wife, almost daily now. She used to cry on the phone, that has stopped. Don't know if she talked to her father yet, as I'm at office during the day, if she did, she didn't told me. 1st week was worst. Things pretty much normal now. Everyone from family is thinking problem is dowry related, so nobody is asking too many questions. Everything is hush hush.  

As for my wife, she refused to see a therapist, and I didn't insist on it. Have followups scheduled with gynae for next month, will see what happens. She is pissed/mad at me I guess for keeping her away from her family, but tries to hide it. I think this will wane away with time. She knows why I'm doing this. I won't let that man near my daughter, ever. Gotta do what you gotta do for your family. Had a really good last week with my parents. Wife is happy too. Indian festival of Chaath is starting in 2 days, so everyone is busy in that.  Returning to my place after this week. Things would normalise after this I hope. First time in my life I understood the importance of festivals, it really really brings people together !

Happy Diwali, and Happy Chaath !

He was a great human being, made everyone in his class better human beings and had this way of being just the person you needed while you had problems. Mr. C's wife and sons sometimes stayed in the classroom during class, waiting for school to let out, and so I knew the kids as well. The year I graduated, Mr. C moved away and I haven't spoken or seen him since. 

Mr. C's kids died on Monday in a house fire. They were 9 and 11. Mr. C and his wife have lost everything. 

I learned about it this morning and have been crying all day. When I googled Mr C, I found his address and phone number. I won't call him, because that seems extremely cruel, but I was thinking about writing a letter to Mr. C. 

My question now is: Should I do it? 

I am pretty sure neither Mr. C nor his wife have any capacity right now to deal with my rather abstract grief, but I want to share my condolences and let them know that I am thinking of them. Mr. C was a lifeline for me in High School and I cannot imagine what they are going through. I just fear I would intrude on their grief and I would rather not make their greif worse by adding mine to it. 

So Reddit: Does anyone have any thoughts about this? Should I write them a letter? Should I not? Does anyone have any kind of experience with something like this?

throwra294,2019-10-30 12:08:51+00:00,I(30F) am scarred by hearing so much about my fiance's (30F) past sex life because we have issues with sex,"Is it normal to have heard extensive details about your partners past lovers? I know about the random guy who ran into her on her bike whom she ended up fucking, the guy from work who was twice her age whom she wanted to have sex with SO BAD but he wouldn't fuck her as much as she wanted, her old boyfriend who could get her off 5 times in a row (I've gotten 2 out of her just once), the boys dorm where she made her way up and down the hallways, the married guy who she had a one night stand with, etc. etc. There are so many I can't even remember them all. Now, I'm constantly comparing myself to them and wonder why her libido isn't that high with me. 

I am one of a handful of women my partner has been with. We just got engaged about a month ago (yay!) and have been together for a year and a few months, but this is an issue that concerns me for our future. For the majority of the time we have been together, sex has been an issue. She has a hard time with me initiating and usually turns me down. She has conveyed this is because sex for her isn't about love, it makes her feel trapped and like I want something from her. I've gotten to the point where I get severe anxiety about initiating and we have gone from having a lot of sex (like 5-6 times a week) to having sex sometimes just once a week. Even when we do, I usually feel anxious about it because I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable. There are also feelings of resentment for me around it now because it's always on her terms, I feel like when we do do it, she probably doesn't really want to, and also PARTLY because (and this may be horrible of me) I struggle with worrying that she might just be with me (a woman) because she has felt used by men. Even just with kissing she struggles. At one point we were kissing and she jerked back and practically screamed at me how much she hates kissing me.

bitchuthought,2019-10-30 02:26:43+00:00,My [25F] boyfriend of almost a year [22M] gets upset when I don’t “give him my yawns”,"I can’t make this shit up. 

I’ve been with my boyfriend almost a year and he is honestly a perfect angel. I want to spend the rest of my life with him. We’re great communicators and he’s extremely kind and warm and understanding. Which is partially why this is so strange for me and I’m not sure what to do.

A couple months ago he started doing this thing where, when I yawn, he puts his mouth to my mouth and inhales the yawn that I exhale. He refers to it as me “giving him my yawns”. This was cute and funny the first few times mostly cause it’s so random and silly.

Except it’s NOT a joke. After a while he started getting upset, almost offended, when I would yawn and not let him “take my yawn”. I seriously thought he was just being silly. If I yawned and covered my mouth, turned away, he would get this hurt look on his face and ask me if I was “hiding” my yawn from him. I explained to him that while I think it’s funny, it’s distracting when I’m yawning and his mouth comes out of fucking nowhere like a carp leaping out of water and is suddenly on my mouth. Then I stop mid-yawn and can’t get a satisfying yawn in and have to wait a few seconds and try to yawn again uninterrupted. It’s like when you have to sneeze and then you just can’t. It’s not a good feeling. I explained all of this to him and he just doesn’t get it. I told him maybe we could compromise and I could “give him my yawns” about half the time, and the other half keep them for myself, but he’s still upset. I don’t know if it’s a sexual thing for him or what. I don’t know what to fucking do.

Any advice would be appreciated. I love him so much, but I just... what the fuck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dp0kmc/my_25f_boyfriend_of_almost_a_year_22m_gets_upset/,relationship_advice,1059,231,0.0
Shinygoose,2019-10-29 22:19:18+00:00,"Husband (28M) and I (28F) are unsure how to continue ""Cool Aunt and Uncle"" dynamic with new kids added to the mix","Background: Husband and I are childfree by choice. I have 3 nieces (11, 7, and 1) on my side between two brothers, and my husband has a niece on the way. We do well enough financially that we can, on occasion, treat our older nieces (11 and 7, one from each brother) to outings, moderately expensive gifts for birthdays and Christmas, etc. We enjoy spending time with them and like being the ""cool aunt and uncle."" 

The problem we are having now has to do with adding in my brother's girlfriend's children to the family dynamic. My brother and ""Sally"" have been together for at least a year (not sure exactly how long as he didn't let on for a long time that he was seeing anyone). Sally has 3 young kids of her own (8M, 7F, and 3F). I don't know too many specifics, but Sally and her kids have had a hard life. Think abusive/manipulative parents, abusive spouse, poverty, etc. My parents recently offered their home to Sally and her kids (my brother and my niece (7) have been living with them for several years after he was recovering from some health problems and getting back on his feet financially) so that they could save up for their own place, be closer together, etc. This has been a huge adjustment for all involved but especially Sally's kids and my niece (7). Our families are now very enmeshed; Sally's kids have been calling my parent's Grandma and Grandpa for a while now, so aside from my brother and Sally being legally married we're essentially all one big family. 

My husband and I just don't know how to continue the dynamic we've had with our biological nieces and Sally's kids. We enjoy spoiling our nieces on occasion, but we can't afford to equally spoil Sally's kids. We really don't want to do anything that makes them feel left out or could lead to any resentment or jealousy at their age. We were inviting the 11 and 7 year old nieces to our house a weekend every month or two to spend the night and hang out with us, but I don't know that we can do that anymore without Sally's older kids feeling left out. Sally's oldest (8M) has autism, and the middle child (7F) is prone to severe outbursts and tantrums. My 7yo niece and Sally's 7yo are currently sharing a room and it's been very hard on my niece adjusting to no longer being an only child. My mom has discouraged my suggestion to have my 7yo and 11yo nieces over to give the 7yo a break, thinking it would upset Sally's 7yo. Honestly, I don't think my husband and I are equipped to deal with their needs if we were to try and have them all over at our house especially when they're all under so much stress right now.  We've also started to question how to handle things we had planned to do in the future such as: college funds for all the kids, helping them out with their first car, or taking them on trips. I especially hate that we can't do all these things for our nieces and Sally's kids because I feel that it just emphasizes that they've been victims of their circumstances their whole lives. Like these are the type of kids that probably need that extra helping hand more than most (My family as a whole is lower to middle class, and my husband and I are only more well off because we don't have children of our own.)

Do we continue to treat our nieces the same way we have been, but do it more ""behind the scenes"" to avoid hurt feelings? Do we stop affording our nieces special treatment in favor of more equitable treatment? Have any of you been the kids or the parents in these situations? How did you adjust?

We realize there's always the chance things might not work out between my brother and Sally and it might be too soon to worry about some of the more distant questions, but with the holidays coming up, at the very least, we need to figure out how to navigate Christmas presents for the kids. For example, before Sally moved in, we were planning to get my niece (7) a Switch Lite (the 11yo niece got a Switch last year), but now we're thinking of just doing a full Switch for 'all of the kids' living at my parent's house. Should we take all of the small expenses we would have used for our nieces over a year and pool them into some bigger expense for all of them? In the end, we don't want to be the source of any hurt feelings on either side.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/doxbpi/husband_28m_and_i_28f_are_unsure_how_to_continue/,relationship_advice,1049,92,0.0
lalu014,2019-10-29 18:24:03+00:00,UPDATE: After I (36F) told my Dad and Stepmom (both late 50s) about my engagement and their response triggered me to suddenly remember years of repressed childhood memories...,"Original: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/cfc6w3/after\_i\_36f\_told\_my\_dad\_and\_stepmom\_both\_late\_50s/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cfc6w3/after_i_36f_told_my_dad_and_stepmom_both_late_50s/)

Well, Reddit, its been 3 months and I could not have anticipated the way this was gonna go back then... I want to thank everyone who offered real advice and support.  I am very appreciative of having some objective voices weigh in. 

I did what everyone encouraged me to do and hauled my butt to therapy.  I shopped for therapists and found a really stellar one.  He is compassionate, attentive and clear.  I also got involved in ACOA (Adult Children of Alcoholics), which has been helpful for me. 

My response for a long while was just to hunker down. 

My sister decided she did not want to speak about this topic with me, so we have distant. 

My dad and I went almost 3 months without speaking.  He would text inquiring or asking to meet, and then cancel our meetings. 

I have avoided speaking with my stepmom all together. 

My fiance and I have gotten closer through this experience.  I have leaned on him and he has been really supportive.  We are doing joint therapy to work on making sure this does not affect the level of trust and safety we can have as we move into marriage. 

Emotionally, I have not been too well.  This experience called a narrative and history into question.  The shift that has taken place has been sobering and disheartening, but it also feels like a lot of who I am and my makeup has kind of clicked into view. I have that, among many other things, to be grateful for. 

All this hard stuff has led to some answers, even if they aren't the ones I wanted. 

My Dad and I finally spoke on Saturday.  It went precisely as I could have imagined.  Probably, about as precisely as many of the commenters warned it would go, honestly.  I went back this morning and reread a lot of the comments before writing this and was shocked by how right everyone was...  

Bottom line:  Dad has doubled down on ""Nothing Happened Here""

During our call, he said he did not want to talk about any of this but then went on to say how much I am to blame for the bulk of it.  He said he has always felt in the middle of our ""battles.""  I truly didn't understand this. I have always felt incredibly passive with my stepmom and rarely did anything to defy her.  When I questioned this, he said, ""you always said things - like ""you aren't my mom, don't tell me what to do.""  I told him I had no recollection of ever saying this.  He said it was when I was 4.  ""You had it out for her from the beginning"". 

The call was confounding.  He told me that maybe he should have not tried to stay in my life and just done what his dad had done and walk away.  He said this might have been better for me and part of him wishes now that he had just left and started a new family.   He said it probably would have been better for everyone if he had done it this way. 

He made references to me being like my mom.  He said I always liked her more because of all the drama. He said this was me just bringing up more drama.  I stopped trying to explain any bit of myself during the call and went quiet.  There was blame, gaslighting, denial, hostility, passive aggression, all of it. 

The odd thing about all of it was despite him offering no validation of what did happen or is happening now, I feel validated.  In my gut, I knew that was the way it would go.  At least I know why I didn't ever stand up for myself. There was never much room to...  I told him at least this much, that I knew this was the response he would give.  Didn't expect to hear him say he wished he had just walked away, but there it was. 

He sees me as the problem child and my feeling of being the scapegoat here was presented in clear view.  Maddening, a little, because I never even talked back as a kid. 

All in all, I am thinking this is one I just let go of and step back entirely.  I could not have imagined ever stepping away from family, but it does feel like the sanest thing to do. 

I will continue to focus on healing, on therapy, on figuring out this business of trust.

Thanks again.

Best to you. 

TLDR - The internet weighed in, a lot of you with experience in this arena were correct... This isn't something we are going to come back from, but there is a light at the end of all it, regardless.

bradystrib,2019-10-29 17:35:22+00:00,My (34m) daughter (10f) just told me her maternal grandmother is abusing her...long story,"Okay, here goes.

My daughter who is 10 years old just came to live with me for the next few months and it happened kind of unexpected.  There is a super long history here which I will attempt to break down. 

Backstory:

 My ex-wife and I divorced 8 years ago.   We went through a gnarly divorce in which she remarried pretty soon after to a guy in the army.  She sent me a letter saying they were moving to Germany together and I'd never see my daughter again on a regular basis. I live in Atlanta, Ga. I filed a change of custody petition and had her served and the next day she served with a TPO saying I was sexually abusing my daughter.  This case went on for 2 years before we got in front of a judge who said if he heard our case he was going to take my daughter away from both of us. During those 2 years there was a ton of doctor shopping on my exwife's side (6 general doctors, 3 different DEFAC's doctors). During the first few months of the TPO the judge allowed me to keep my visitation schedule of every weekend but to be supervised by my parents.  I took lie detector tests, saw specialists myself, enrolled my daughter in therapy - something my ex never did. Anyways it was a loooong time of it just being messy.  So we settled on the day we were supposed to have our trial which a few weeks prior her new husband was moved from Germany to Fort Polk.  They ended up moving to Louisiana at Fort Polk and I stayed in Georgia. I tried to see my daughter as much as I could (once a month). She lived with me for a few months when her little brother was diagnosed with cancer and was in and out of the hospital. They then moved to Colubmia, Sc and I saw her more because a 12 hour trip became a 3 hour trip.  Over the summer they moved to Daytona Beach and it's 8 hours again but i've been going 2 times a month to see her.  A few weeks ago her little brother was getting his scans and they found cancer again.  Her mother immediately pulled her out of school and enrolled her in virtual school.  Last week her mother texted me asking if I could take my daughter for the next month or so because they were going to be in and out of the hospital so much.  I of course said yes and checked with my daughter who was more than happy and excited to be coming up.  We really have a wonderful relationship.  

&amp;#x200B;

Today:  I work a normal M-F 9-6p job.  My fiance has a more flexible schedule and my mom and dad are right down the road from us and can help too.  Well today is one of the days were my fiance and I are both at work.  My mom is at home with my daughter today and helping with virtual school.   My phone rings and it's my mom. Sobbing.  She told me that my daughter had broken down during one of her online assignments after my mom tried to help her.   After trying to calm her down my daughter tells her story after story of her other grandmother hurting her.  Yanking her arm, hitting her with shoes, slapping her, verbal abuse.  I 110% believe my daughter.  Her grandmother is a very hot tempered cuban woman.  I don't know how to proceed from her.  My daughter is concerned about her brother and being taken away from him and she knows he's very sick. My daughters mother is also very hard to talk to and I still haven't forgiven her for what she has put me through 8 years ago.  I don't have the money now for more lawyers as I'm still in debt over the first one (over $75k worth of legal expense for nothing to change).  I need help or advice. Or something.  I'm at a loss.

He told me it couldn't possible be that bad, as all his other girl friends have loved it, so i told him if it was so painless how about we I use a strap on on him. at this suggesting he flipped his shit at me calling me disgusting and saying that is unnatural. I told him males have a g spot in there ass so its if anything more natural then it is for a woman. He went away to a friends and has not talked to me since.

ThrowRA1234543,2019-10-29 09:02:22+00:00,Update: Me (36M) found out that my wife (34F) was cheating on me with multiple men,"In my original post I was still unsure what to do as seen here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/dlxqbv/me\_36m\_found\_out\_my\_wife\_34f\_has\_been\_cheating\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dlxqbv/me_36m_found_out_my_wife_34f_has_been_cheating_on/) 

But after getting lots of great comments from you guys as well as talking with my closest friends, I got enough encouragement to gain some faith in my self. I finally opened my eyes to what I had thought deep down, that there was no chance in hell that I would ever gonna get over what my wife did, so I decided last thursday to tell her I wanted to end this marriage.

I think she knew it was coming as she didn't seem that surprised. She didn't even try to persuade me or anything. Just went like a broken record ""nothing I say will change anything"" whenever I asked her to say anything. There was lots of crying and she called in sick to work. We have since then been telling our closest friends and family about the incoming divorce, but she has been incredibly hesitant to admit what she did to her parents.

My mother knows everything, but I for some reason agreed to not tell the in-laws about what happened yet. Maybe I'm afraid of a ""war"" between my soon to be ex wife and me so I agreed to give her time to tell them. When we met them last sunday we told them about the divorce but as we had to leave two of our kids with them for three days due to school holiday, it didn't feel like the right time to come clean about their daughter's multiple affairs. Instead we told them that there was some ""unsolvable disagreements"", which felt really bad for me to say, because they seemed so disappointed. They have been part of my family for almost 17 years and I care about them, and they have been really supportive to us through the years, both financially and they love spending time with our kids. I felt really bad about lying to them, but I'm afraid that if I go and spill the beans, my soon to be ex wife will become hostile and make the divorce process that much harder. But my patience is not limitless. I will tell them eventually if my ""wife"" doesn't come clean soon.

I don't want the real reasons for the divorce to go public either, as we live in a small society and the truth would eventually find it's way to my kids and they might get picked on because of it. I'd rather for the truth to remain with our closest friends and family, while the official explanation would be that we divorced due to ""growing apart, wanting different things etc."". I also don't want to be known as the ""poor guy who had his wife porked by another guy"".

Now there are some big loose ends to tie. We need to sell our house and find apartments for ourselves. The custody will be shared where I will have the kids for a week and their mother for the other week. I also feel like their legal address should be with me, so I won't have to pay her child support. Would be unfair after what she did. I have no idea how this will end, but often in my country, the mother tends to get what she wants, as everyone always feels sorry for them. I will fight for my kids though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/don688/update_me_36m_found_out_that_my_wife_34f_was/,relationship_advice,8105,777,0.0

Me and him have been friends since high school . Both of us married 2 beautiful women ( My wife's name is Mary and his wife's Laura) . The 4 of us always got along very good , took vacancies together etc.. . After a while we bought 2 houses close to each other and from then we started to see each other every day.  Me and Mary had 2 kids and him and Laura 1 . Even the kids got along very well. 

Mary and Robert were working for the same company and had the same schedule so they were going with the same car to work . 1 year ago , while they were coming home , a drunk driver caused a car crash that killed both Robert and Mary . It makes me cry only when I think about it. 

It was a very hard time for our families and me . I lost 2 of the most important people in my life . To be honest , if I didn't have 2 kids that I have to raise I would have probably killed myself. 

Me and Laura started to get closer and used each other for comfort through this . She and her kid moved in my house because she couldn't stand living alone in a place where everything reminded her of Robert . 

Over the last year we got even closer as we started to live together . We spent every holiday together , every dinner, every day together etc.... Me and Laura started to cry together and comfort each other when we remembered our dead spouses . Me and her didn't date anyone because we haven't moved on from our spouses. 

That brings us to last week . Our kids were at school, we were at her house cleaning the place . At some moment we found an old photo album from a vacance in Paris from 4 years ago when we went together . We started to cry and to talk about the old times and how much fun we had back then . At some point we were on the couch hugging each other . After a while , while we were looking at each other , I don't know how to be honest , we started to make out and ended up on the bed . We had sex and it was amazing . 

After that we discussed and admitted our feeling to each other.  We decided to be together but to take things slow. We discussed to our families and they told us that this is wrong and we are basically cheating and disrespecting our dead spouses . 

I don't know what to say . I mean I really like Laura and she likes me , we are the only ones that understand our pain and our kids get along very well   .

dhstdhelp,2019-10-28 10:51:10+00:00,My (31F) husband (35M) knowingly gave me an incurable STD when we were dating and I just found out,"Throwaway because obvious reasons. 12 years ago about this time, my husband and I first started dating. About 3 months into it, he sits me down and tells me he’s got some spots that have come up on his penis, and google suggested it was herpes. He’s freaking out, crying that I’m going to break up with him, I was taken aback but supported him, he got tested, and was positive. 

About that same time I had a breakout, and it was fucking terrible. I could barely walk. I went to the doctor, and confirmed I also had it. 

At that point, it didn’t seem helpful to blame one another and we just kept going forward. We got married, have 3 kids, I had to take extra precaution during my pregnancies because of it.  It doesn’t effect my husbands life at all, where I have a breakout close to my period time most months. Not nearly as painful as the first. 

A few nights going I fell asleep on the couch with my head on his lap. His phone dinged and I opened my eyes, and could see it was a message from his ex girlfriend. I was groggy and asked what the hell she wanted, and he said he didn’t know but didn’t care to find out. I
Left it at that because tired. 

Next morning I asked again, because it was weird for her to reach out after a decade. That didn’t end on good terms so I didn’t think it was just a check in, and to my knowledge, they haven’t spoken at all. 

He suggested that she just said hi, and he was acting weird so I asked to see it or him read it to me. He was defensive at first and said no, but eventually handed it over...

It was her asking him about herpes from when THEY found out like 14 years ago. He knew he had it when we started dating. We had what I thought were some pretty open conversations a out sex before we slept together, should have worn condoms before getting tested but there’s nothing I can do about that now a million years later. 

I’m so torn. I’m pissed that he knowingly gave this to me. And I have to deal with it when he doesnt. And the fucking production he put on when it first happened. On the other hand, we’ve built a life together. Kids. Shared everything.

shouldvestayedhome69,2019-10-28 04:21:17+00:00,"I (23m, as a wingman) really hit it off with my friend's date at a party","Okay, so this literally just happened...

A couple of days ago, my friend (let's call him Nick, 23m), invited me to his birthday gathering (\~10 ppl) at an arcade slash bar slash restaurant. 

I lean on the social introvert side of things and I generally don't like haning out with groups with more than 4-5ppl. Moreover, out of the 10 people invited, I only know Nick on a personal level. 

I told Nick I might come but nothing's confirmed, but Nick made it very clear that he wants me to show up. 

&amp;#x200B;

This afternoon, Nick asked if I'm single and he told me a friend of his (let's call her Kathy, 25fm; note I didn't know it's a she before I got to the party) is bringing a female friend (let's call her Gina, 25fm). 

I told Nick yes I'm single, but not actively looking to see someone. The conversation ends. No big deal.

&amp;#x200B;

I will briefly mention how the seating is arranged because I think that's kind of important: the table is a long rectangle and there are 4 people each on the long side and 1 person at each end. 

&amp;#x200B;

I show up to the party last, maybe half an hour later than everyone else. 

I see Nick, he's seated at the end of the 4 person row, and the immediate two seats next to him are occupied with Kathy and Gina's belongings. They were at the washroom.

Before I even sat down (or met Kathy and Gina face to face), Nick pulled me out for a smoke and told me that he had met Kathy on a dating app three weeks ago. They've gone on a few dates but nothing's exclusive and he was hoping that they'd score tonight. 

&amp;#x200B;

He explicitly told me that he wanted me to be a wingman and occupy Gina's attention. Cool.

We go in. I got a beer from the bar and go sit down. The girls are back now; I introduce myself.

The weird thing is that Gina is the one sitting next to Nick and I'm sitting next to Kathy. 

(So it goes: Nick - Gina - Kathy - Me, on one side of the table)

&amp;#x200B;

No big deal. I remind myself I'm here to be the wingman, so I started a conversation with the random people sitting right across from me and made an effort to not engage too much with Kathy. 

&amp;#x200B;

About half an hour after I sat down, I started talking to Gina and Kathy. Turns out we have a lot in common. 

We go to the same school for graduate studies. Share the same interests. 

She's a violinist and we laughed at some classical music memes. 

I told Kathy how I got too drunk last month and bought a single first row ticket to a chaykovsky violin concerto next month. In reply, she told me I should just come watch Gina and her's recital. 

She asked me where I worked and I said XXX(a fancy startup hub/office building); she got real excited and asked if I saw her on Monday because she was performing in the lobby at XXX during that lunch break. 

&amp;#x200B;

Blah blah blah, you get the idea. We had a good convo. 

&amp;#x200B;

As everyone's plate gets emptied, I look over to Nick. 

FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUK THE BIRTHDAY BOY LOOKS PISSSSSED.

&amp;#x200B;

In my mind I'm like, damn I fucked up. 

As we left the restaurant area and moved towards the arcades, Nick asked me rhetorically ""if I'm here to help him or cockblock him?

I apologized for not being cool and told him I was just trying to be friendly (which I genuinely was). 

Soon Kathy and Gina left and Nick seemed even more upset. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nick told me it's not my fault but acknowledged that I wasn't cool. He said he's just upset that they left so early and he wasn't upset at me (he clearly was, though). 

&amp;#x200B;

I left shortly after and I felt pretty damn bad about the whole situation. But on my way home I started to have this 'falling in love' 'strong crush' feeling.

Nick and I live close to each other so I immediately messaged him and was like ""can we talk after you get home?

&amp;#x200B;

And now here I am. I just got back from Nick's place.

I asked him if he genuinely liked Kathy or if he just wanted to get laid. 

Because... I couldn't help myself from being attracted to her. 

&amp;#x200B;

He played the macho man attitude and didn't engage with my dialogue seriously whatsoever. 

I understand. But I've known Nick for years and I thought we could have a healthy conversation about where our minds stand. 

Turns out that's not the case because he shrugged me off and pretty much told me to leave and he'll see me some other time.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess a few questions:

\- I don't have their contacts. But it was effortless to find their insta. Would it be wrong if I clicked follow?

\- Nick just got out of a relationship right before he met Kathy and from my perspective, Kathy and Nick have little to nothing in common. In addition, the only concerns I've heard from Nick over the night was that ""he was really hoping to get laid tonight"". 

I would have a very bitter feeling if they fuck for a few times and he ditches her. 

Is it such black and white that if they met first, I should just back-off no matter what?

perplexeddad,2019-10-27 13:37:16+00:00,I found out I have a daughter who thinks I was her mother's rapist. It wasn't rape. What next?,"ThrowRA -- I received an email last week from a woman claiming we are a DNA match and she is my biological daughter. It was a long and emotionally charged letter. She said she knew she was child of rape, and while she had no desire to form a relationship with me, she wanted me to know that she existed and to understand the pain and anguish I had caused her and her mother and grandparents. The letter was gut wrenching.

I was shocked but also skeptical. I have been married 25 years and I have three great kids. I have never raped or abused a woman ever! I thought this had to be a prank or scam. I had done home DNA ancestry testing two years ago, and it had not shown a child I wasn't aware of. But when I logged into my account, there she was.

I did some sleuthing and figured out that her mother was a woman, Terry (fake name), I had dated for about a month during our first semester of college in the mid-1980s.  We broke it off mutually and remained friendly. The very last night of the second semester, we hooked up at a dorm party and went to my room and had sex. It was a casual hookup and I remember it as 100% consensual and very passionate. Also unprotected. Afterwards we went back to the party and had a great time dancing and mingling with friends. We both went home the next morning for summer break. Terry didn't come back to college the next year, which I gave very little thought to since we weren't close and hadn't bothered to communicate all summer. 

One of the reasons Terry and I were incompatible was religion. She was Catholic and I'm Jewish. I was not religious but she had grown up in a strict household. My supposition is that when she discovered the pregnancy, she told her family she had been raped rather than admitting to premarital sex with a Jewish ex-boyfriend. But who knows, maybe she had other reasons. 

It kills me that I have a daughter in her 30s who has been fed lies about her father. I can't imagine growing up thinking I was a product of rape. That has to be so hard psychologically. I am in pain for a child I didn't even know existed just a few days ago, and who hates me.

I have been debating what to do. I have not written back to my daughter. I badly want to tell her the truth, in a way that she can believe (but how?). My wife, who has been a rock the last few days, keeps telling me to give this some time and thought. My best friend says I should hire a lawyer. I don't know what to do and it's eating me up.

My sister had a baby 9 months ago. She named him after our stepfather. Our stepfather pretty severely sexually abused me from when our mother moved him in when I was 6 up until he died 3 years ago. He was never particularly private about what he was doing and mum and sister both knew. Mum didn't care and sister was a kid herself so she couldn't do anything. He treated she and my mother well, I was the only one he abused. 

I'm pretty hurt by her decision to honour him with naming her baby for him. I can't be around either she or my nephew because that name is so upsetting to me. I also feel like this means she doesn't care about what happened either. I'm just so incredibly upset. My sister got mad at me when I told her this and said I was being selfish and have no right to tell her what she can and can't call her kid.

throwRA-myname,2019-10-27 06:24:13+00:00,"My aunt is taking me to court after my mother's suicide and has accused me of ""killing my mother""","A few months ago my mother killed herself. I (22m) am her only son. My parents are divorced, and I had not seen my mother for a long time (about 2 years) due to the fact that I was living in Asia teaching English. I promised my mother that I would visit her when I returned home (she recently moved to a different state from my father), but about a half month before I came home, my grandfather on my dad's side became very ill and would not live much longer. My mother told me I should visit my father first because of this.

I should also add, that at this time and the past few years, I was very, VERY depressed and had some mental and physical health problems that would not improve. I really wanted to be at my home where I felt comfortable (my dad's house) and recover for some time. When I got home, my grandfather passed away on the day I arrived, and I was not feeling well enough to travel at all, so I stayed with my father for a few weeks. 

Later, my mother told me she would visit her parents (in another state) in a few weeks. I debated visiting her at that time, but I wasn't sure I would be feeling well enough to travel again. My grandmother (mother's side) called me and asked me to come at that time, but I told her I would have to think about if I can come then. Eventually I decided that I would visit them at the same time as my mother. 

The night I arrived at my grandparents house was one night before my mother and aunt would arrive. That night, my aunt called us and told us that my mother had just killed herself and they found the body at her apartment in the afternoon. I was driving home from the airport at that time. I remember that night so vividly as I could not sleep and was crying so hard my body hurt.  My aunt arrived a few days later, and we stayed together for some time. I noticed my grandmother's behavior was quite unusual at this time, and my mother had mentioned previously that she was beginning to show some dementia symptoms but both my aunt and grandmother were not hostile to me at this time. They seemed like they wanted to stick together and get through it as a family.

After about a week I returned to my father's home and stayed there. I was an emotional mess for the following month. I had a lot of trouble remembering simple things and felt exhausted all the time. Eventually I began to feel better and start to move things forward with my mother's probate and planning my own life, when my grandmother and aunt call me to tell me that ""this is my fault"" and ""you killed your mother."" I was absolutely shocked to hear them say this. They accused me of not calling her enough, not wanting to visit her, only caring about her money (even though she was a teacher with a small condo and was not wealthy) etc. They even insulted my father. Relatives from my father's side called me to help me through this, but I have not spoken to my aunt or grandmother since this incident. I know both my grandmother and aunt feel immense guilt for my mother's death. Especially my aunt since it was her who suggested my mother come to live near her, and my mother hated living in that area. 

Today I received an email from my aunt that told me that I would have to go to court. It simply stated that I should call this lawyer. I am so hurt that this is how they decided to handle a tragedy like this. It's so difficult for me to think clearly, and I can't believe that this is how they chose to behave. Any advice would be appreciated.

flahatya,2019-10-25 21:28:06+00:00,I need some male opinions,"Hi, so I (21f) need some insight into the male mind.

So for the past few weeks or so, I've been seeing/dating this guy (22m), its all been pretty good and I like him alot, but, i dont know why he hasn't tried to progress things further.

He asked me out first, kissed me first, and I reciprocated. But we haven't done like, anything further than just go on some dates and briefly kiss hello and goodbye and stuff. We haven't actually made out or anything yet.

I decided I wanted to try to progress things a little farther, so I tried to hold his hand when we went for a walk last night, but as soon as i grabbed it, he sort of asked in a teasing kind of tone ""what exactly are you doing?"", and I laughed it off and kept holding his hand and he seemed to take it comfortably after like two minutes. But to be honest, I was already kind of shy about it to begin with, so his teasing kind of made me self conscious that maybe I did something that wasn't welcome? I don't know.

So like, from the perspective of a man, what's going on here? Is he just like, nervous? Or is he not as interested as I thought he was initially? help.

I dont want to come on too strong, but I also want to let him know that its okay for him to try doing more physically with me.

My girlfriend takes college classes and works part time, I finished college 2 years ago, quickly got hired by the company I did my internship at and within a year I got a promotion and a large payraise and I am now making roughly 150K a year, while she makes 20K a year.

Now she moved in with me a few months ago in to the place I bought so I pay nearly all costs, mortgage, electricity, water etc, the only things she pays herself are non essentials like spotify, Phone bill, netflix and so forth.

Now recently we got in to a huge fight where she demanded we pool our money together and spend what is left after essential costs together, where as currently I pay basically every essential and my own shit, use a bit to enjoy myself and put the rest in to my savings.

Now she seems to be jealous I got a lot more to spend, which is not really true since after monthly costs I put the majority in my savings account.

In my eyes she already gets an easy ride and honestly she is just shit with the money she does have, she spends it on crap like stupidly expensive clothes and then complains she is broke at the end of the month.

So what do I do, I hate to put money in the way of ourvrelationship but if I am honest I am questioning mybrelationship as there is no way I am going to let her essentially spend my salary on stupid shit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dn1q0t/my25m_girlfriend22f_wants_to_share_our_incomes/,relationship_advice,15682,4110,0.0
bakerbabe126,2019-10-25 14:01:12+00:00,I just learned my dad used to pick my brother up for visitation and call me from the bathroom to say he was too sick to see me.,"
My dad never liked me. That was plain to see, but I didn't realize he had gone so far. My dad died from an infection he got and he had AIDS. I was 18. My entire time in high school I took care of him. After he died my brother nearly drank himself to death and told me my dad confessed he didn't love me at all. 

This didn't phase me much because I was finally free to admit I didn't love him either. It hurt a little but I was more worried about my brothers unnecessary guilt. 

After almost 10 years were both doing good. I'm married with kids, working on my degree. My brother is finally sober and building his own house. My mom just told me my dad used to pick my brother up (even going so far as to tell him to lie and say he was at a friend's house) my dad would call me and tell me he was too sick to come get me. I would be left waiting for hours before the call came. I'd have a bag packed and be waiting at the window as a kid. 

My brother still feels immensely guilty and has never told me this. Part of me wants to tell him its ok, but part of me is hurt my brother could lie like that. It makes me feel rejected again and unworthy of my dad's love. I was a kid and didn't do anything to him. I know it wasn't my fault but it's just hard to hear. I just don't know how to process this. I need to get back into therapy anyway but it's going to be a bit. Do I just talk this out with my mom? I don't want her to feel like she's upset me with this information I needed to hear.

I was at a dealership about 200 miles away (my wife and I live a few minutes from my mother) and found a pretty good deal on a car I was going to be buying in the next month or so anyway. Since I wasn’t planning on buying it yesterday, I had to call my credit union to get the loan started. A few minutes later, I get a call back asking about a credit card opened in 2017 with nearly a dozen late payments, some as late as 120 days. I obviously have no idea about it and ask the loan officer wtf it was and he gave the address on the account as my mother’s house. 

After not purchasing the car, I called my mother who confessed to it. She said she just needed a “little extra spending money” and I owed $2500 for it. She also said she couldn’t make the payment every month. My parents’ financial problems were the reason they got a divorce 10 years ago. My dad has always said that while he did love my mother, the main reason why we lived paycheck to paycheck my entire childhood was because of her spending. He finally got tired of it and set some hard limits, she went around his back and started taking credit card advances to make it look like she hadn’t spent so much. When he caught her, they got divorced.

My mother said it’s not a big deal but I got denied for a car loan specifically because of it. My wife and I are planning on buying a house in the next year or two.

I want to start off by saying thank you to everyone who gave amazing feedback and told me to stay the hell away from those pills, admired my confidence in sharing my penis size, and told me to communicate. I did not take, and do not plan on taking them now or ever in my life. I also want to thank those who said talk with her and offer solutions such as sheath/sleeve to help her fulfill her fantasy.

We had a serious conversation. She knew she fucked and admitted that she at no point took my thoughts and feeling into consideration and she regretted that. I told her what many of you said, to consider my health if I were to actually take those pills. I showed her examples of what could happen with all the chemicals and other crap those things have. I even told her those damn things could give me a heart attack or worse. She started crying as if I had died and jumped in hugged me super hard and asked me to please forgive her and that she would not want anything to happen to me or put my health in jeopardy. To help her understand why I told her to leave when she gave me the pills, I showed her my original post and let her see the comments all of you provided... In the end, I forgave her.

I just want to end it by saying that this was a good test in our relationship. We actually got intimate after and both of us did not have an issue getting pleasure (shocking, I know). Now she is giving me more attention, spoiling the shit out of me, and showing how much she appreciates me. :)

Apparently my thread blew up after I went to sleep. I didn't find out until the next morning, because my girlfriend told me about it. I was  so embarrassed and mortified. She had already read the whole thing and my comments. I honestly didn't know what to say I could only say I was so sorry and that I didn't want her to find out like this. She was calm.. Told me it was okay, said it touched her.. Can't really describe how I felt. We just held each other for a very long time. Might be weird but I knew I needed to be with her when she found out. I started thinking about a life without her, and I simply couldnt. I can't give up on this girl. We've talked a lot about 'us' the past few days, which was long overdue. I have apologized over and over.. She's so understanding and doesn't blame me for having doubts.. A person this special I won't find again, but I hate myself for having thought about breaking up. She's still the same person. I should have communicated my feelings to her. I'm a very lucky guy. I really do love her to the moon and back. 

Regarding therapy, I have called for an appointment but they have a few weeks of waiting time until they got time for me. Y'all were right. Can't hurt to give it a try, maybe I was unlucky with my former therapists. But I already feel wayyy better now that everything is out in the open. And the girl who I talked to I've cut off completely. My gf knew straight away who it was and wanted to warn me to stay away from her earlier, but she didn't want to come off as crazy. Didn't realize she was into me. We're doing some research so we can try to be intimate again but we got time, no hurry.

Thanks for the overwhelming support and replies. I was lost but I know everything will fall into the right place eventually.. I'm with her till the end. We're going to keep open communication, which will be priority. We're doing very well now. She knew something was up with me too, she knows me too well. Hope everyone here has a great day.

For context: my son is far from a problem child (in my opinion). He is an 18 year old high school senior who got into a great university to study computer science, he is one of the best swimmers on his team, he’s not getting into too much trouble aside from some drinking here and there, etc. He has a couple guy friends and a few girl friends who hang out and do socially awkward shit together. We have a great relationship with him—he listens to us when we talk about safe sex, avoiding hard drugs, etc. 

So—Yesterday I got a call around 4:30 from my wife, who was telling me I need to get home “RIGHT NOW”*. Apparently she had borrowed his laptop and found something on  it. I was terrified, thinking the worst.

When I got home, she had a Reddit account pulled up on his laptop. His username was signed in, and she had the posts pulled up. One of them was a picture of our son on a “femboy” subreddit wearing tights/skirt/makeup/etc. and my first reaction was *“Okay, Mija, we don’t need to be seeing this unless he is endangering himself. We’re not supposed to see this”*. She was pissed at my reaction and forced me to keep looking. His post was very highly upvoted and although it had no nudity, all the comments were pretty obscene. I said *”okay, we should warn him about putting his face online. Definitely bad”*. 

She said *”that’s all you’re worried about?”* I said *”yes, Mija. He is 18 now. I know this is shocking but this isn’t our business anymore”*. She looked at me like I just shot our cat. She went through his whole profile and pointed out the memes he posted to r/bisexual and jokes he made about “femboys”. Under her breath she kept saying *”fucking sick, this is fucking sick stuff”*.

 I said *”I know this is a lot for us to take in, but we taught him about safe sex and now the ball isn’t in our court. If he isn’t endangering himself, we should just let him be. If there’s anything he needs to tell us, he will do it on his own time”*. 

Again she looked at me with utter contempt and disgust. *”our son is...a fucking pervert, he is getting into sick stuff”*. She was borderline hyperventilating. 

I get why she’d be shocked (as am I), but this is also ironic and hypocritical coming from her. She is the most ultra-progressive, *”we don’t need to be constrained by gender roles”* type of person, regularly attending feminist conferences. Although to be fair, she is what the internet would call a “TERF”—basically she thinks all MTF trans people and gender-noncomforming guys are actually just sick fetishists who are out to rape women (we generally stay out of each other’s politics). I guess she might be associating our son with that stuff. 

Anyway, I was initially sympathetic to her, but I got pretty mad at her when she started talking about our son in a way that a loving mother really shouldn’t. I was scared for our son, when he comes home and hears this kind of talk coming from his mother. I got pretty mad and probably called her a neurotic, prudish bitch somewhere in there and she stormed into our bedroom and locked the door. My son came home and we acted normal, but his mom stayed in the room all night. I told him “she had a headache”. 

Fast forward to this morning—I am at work and have no clue what to do about this. I am an idiot in every single way, so please tell me what I’ve done wrong and what I should do going forward.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dmhu8p/my_wife_found_our_sons_reddit_account_and_is/,relationship_advice,13554,1453,0.0

We’re not supposed to see this”*. She was pissed at my reaction and forced me to keep looking. His post was very highly upvoted and although it had no nudity, all the comments were pretty obscene. I said *”okay, we should warn him about putting his face online. Definitely bad”*. 

She said *”that’s all you’re worried about?”* I said *”yes, Mija. He is 18 now. I know this is shocking but this isn’t our business anymore”*. She looked at me like I just shot our cat. She went through his whole profile and pointed out the memes he posted to r/bisexual and jokes he made about “femboys”. Under her breath she kept saying *”fucking sick, this is fucking sick stuff”*.

 I said *”I know this is a lot for us to take in, but we taught him about safe sex and now the ball isn’t in our court. If he isn’t endangering himself, we should just let him be. If there’s anything he needs to tell us, he will do it on his own time”*. 

Again she looked at me with utter contempt and disgust. *”our son is...a fucking pervert, he is getting into sick stuff”*. She was borderline hyperventilating. 

I get why she’d be shocked (as am I), but this is also ironic and hypocritical coming from her. She is the most ultra-progressive, *”we don’t need to be constrained by gender roles”* type of person, regularly attending feminist conferences. Although to be fair, she is what the internet would call a “TERF”—basically she thinks all MTF trans people and gender-noncomforming guys are actually just sick fetishists who are out to rape women (we generally stay out of each other’s politics). I guess she might be associating our son with that stuff. 

Anyway, I was initially sympathetic to her, but I got pretty mad at her when she started talking about our son in a way that a loving mother really shouldn’t. I was scared for our son, when he comes home and hears this kind of talk coming from his mother. I got pretty mad and probably called her a neurotic, prudish bitch somewhere in there and she stormed into our bedroom and locked the door. My son came home and we acted normal, but his mom stayed in the room all night. I told him “she had a headache”. 

Fast forward to this morning—I am at work and have no clue what to do about this. I am an idiot in every single way, so please tell me what I’ve done wrong and what I should do going forward.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dmgfat/my_wife_found_our_sons_reddit_account_and_is/,relationship_advice,1189,243,0.0
tornadonation,2019-10-24 11:35:20+00:00,[UPDATE] - I think my (31/M) girlfriend (26F) cheated on me and stole my money.,"https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c7ippv/i_think_my_31m_girlfriend_26f_cheated_on_me_and/

As anyone with half a brain would have guessed, she was cheating on me and broke up with me. Good riddance and from what I heard, the guy broke it off with her back in August. I know this because she left me a couple of voicemails at the time asking to ""talk this through"". I was having none of it, blocked her number and deleted the voicemails. Haven't spoken to her since.

I did call the police regarding the stolen safe the day after making my first post. They were able to make phone contact with her, she told them where she was staying and she did give back the safe with all of the contents. She claimed she just picked it up with what she thought was the rest of her stuff. Impossible but whatever, I was happy to be done with her and I've started dating again.

Fast forward to Monday and I received an email stating my credit card statement was ready, for my emergency credit card. The one I almost never use literally at all. I make a purchase on it every six months since I got it 3 years ago and even then, that's just to keep it working and it's always something like a tank of gas.

When I looked at the statement I was stunned. Beauty products, fast food, Target (haven't been there in a year), all sorts of things equaling about $2000. Needless to say, I went right back to the police with a printout of the charges and had to dispute the entire thing with the credit card company. They shut off the card and told me it wasn't swiped, it was likely used on an app.

She copied my credit card number down and started using it. I tried calling her but her phone has been shut off. Gee wonder why.

Thought I was done with her but I guess not. Hopefully she gets to see the inside of a courtroom and a jail cell in the end.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dmf47g/update_i_think_my_31m_girlfriend_26f_cheated_on/,relationship_advice,1069,30,0.0
morningcall25,2019-10-23 23:40:11+00:00,Best friend (f25) touched me (m28) in my sleep,"Hey,

On Friday evening I (28m) met up with a few friends of mine, had a few drinks and so on. At the end of the night I went to my best friend's apartment (25f), she was really drunk, was sick so I helped her with a glass of water and went to sleep in the bed next to her (this is a normal occurrence for us, we have always had a very platonic relationship).

I woke up to her giving me head, and I had to physically get her off me. She was then super aggressive with me , trying to pin me down and saying im not a man. I managed to get her off me after some time.

I just feel so crappy that such a close friend would do that, I feel really bad about it. And I guess I shouldn't because most guys would love that, but I just don't see her in that way.

I feel like I've lost my best friend, and it's not easy to make friends living in a foreign Scandinavian country. But I feel sick to see her again, and it's going to be hard to avoid living in such a small town with many mutual friends.

ThrowRA_nadted,2019-10-23 10:19:41+00:00,My [26F] girlfriend [24F] thinks she's an Instagram influencer and it's driving me crazy!,"When I met my girlfriend 3 years ago, I knew very quickly she was addicted to Instagram. She was posting maybe 3-6 times every single day and barely an hour of her day wasn't in her story.

This didn't really bother me at first - I actually found it kind of hot? Mainly because all the pictures of food and buildings and clothes became pictures of me - I felt, I guess, a little like a celebrity (she had 6,000+ followers back then I think).

Other than that, it's been a great and fulfilling relationship, but this addiction has been like a tree root splitting us apart. Every day is punctuated by ""Insta time"" where I'm not supposed to distract her, she gets up at bizarre times to post and maximize engagement which throws off her (and, by extension, my) sleeping habits, she's taking 2 hours to get ready for a 20 minute shopping trip, which is then stretched into over an hour for Instagram content... It's ridiculous. We've squabbled about it before, obviously, and she brings up things about me that irritate her (for the sake of balance, I'm extremely messy and frankly, plain lazy. I'm trying to work on it), but recently she stunned me during an argument.

It was routine stuff, I asked (well, snapped) at her to put her phone down and pay me some attention, and she gave me a horrible stare and said 'this is my career, if you don't like it, get out'.

So the thing is, it's absolutely not her career. She desperately *wants* it to be, but so do probably millions of others. She's been unemployed and claiming benefits for 2 years, but I didn't realise all that time she was ignoring me for IG, she was actually trying to make money from it. I know she made about €20 about 6 weeks ago for advertising some makeup start up, but that was basically for a friend of a friend.

Essentially, this is draining me to death, and it's gone from being flattering to intrusive. Before you say it - yes, I'm probably going to break up with her. But the thing is, she's got a really good heart and I genuinely want to help her, even if the relationship doesn't survive (if it does, that would obviously be a plus). Is there anything I can do to convince her to put the phone down and be a good, attentive girlfriend, and actually get a job that helps pay our bills?

Tldr: girlfriend thinks she's an Instagram celebrity because she made €20 through a friend, is actually just seriously addicted to the platform.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dlx8az/my_26f_girlfriend_24f_thinks_shes_an_instagram/,relationship_advice,14698,1388,0.0

Ashtasticle,2019-10-22 16:45:30+00:00,My dad falsely accused me of molestation and now wants me back in the family.,"So this is quite a long story and I’m new here so sorry if I miss something or edit back. 

Back in 2017 I went on a family vacation, important people and age at the time myself (21m) dad (40m) and sister(15f). Somehow on the last day of this vacation my sister came up with this idea that I molested her. This was completely random, no context it just happened. My dad came to me in a flurry of anger and very aggressively threw against the floor and wall without saying anything. Once I was able to sit and respond with probably like wtf he told me what she said. I was stunned and confused and explained that I never had done anything to her. He then told me my best friend (who lives 1000 miles away and had never met my family) told my sister I did it because I confided in my friend. This was the first major red flag for me that this wasn’t a joke or some shit but they were being serious. 

Now for some context. I am the oldest of 9. When I was 5 I myself was “sexually abused” by my ex-stepsister (moms ex husbands daughter? She was maybe 12 at this time) but I am the oldest. I didn’t know any better and it never bothered me a ton later on. We were kids. Saying that I was still the oldest and when I got to that 10-12 range I definitely got curious about human anatomy and I will say it here. I was a peeping Tom on my 6 year old sister. I didn’t know what I was doing. What I was looking at. Or what to do with it. And I never touched her. I was nothing more that a curious 10 year old child who was the oldest in his family. It took me a long time to be willing to accept that. 

This happened the second to last day of vacation. I slept alone and flew home the next day, they drove. I lived alone and hardly saw them due to distance but tried to go twice a month. I stopped contacting them and they all blocked my phone number, fb, etc. except my dad who continued to text call and harass me. My sister went to the police when we got home where the story changed to she found it in my phone which could have been possible as she had my old phone. I had to deal with state and dcf, and then the local police from the town we grew up where this would have happened. I met with an officer after playing phone tag for nearly 2 months with him and dcf leaving eachother voicemails a few times a week. When I met with him we talked over what happened on vacation, the accusations, and what happened to me as a child. That was the end of it from the police. My dad continued to text me so I blocked him finally. About 6 months go by and he calls my work phone which was emergencies only. I had forgotten he had that number. He basically said that the DA was filing paperwork to have me arrested, the fbi would be taking me and some other over the top stuff. It all seemed way too much but I called that officer I spoke with to check in and he had nothing new for me he said to call the da office so I did and there were no cases in my name or my fathers(he would have to represent my sister). After this we went quiet for 6 months until my aunt(mother’s side) called me cause she ran into my dad at Home Depot and he told her all these terrible things I did. She asked me and I explained everything and she was all good and no longer concerned about me with any of it. Then a few of my friends found out when he told them. Then some people I work with. After about a year I quit my job to get away from it all, changed phone numbers and moved across the country. Right when I moved I found out my sister just had a baby, at 16. 6 months later my dad emailed me asking to go see my grandfather on his deathbed and my sisters baby “let her show you the baby, let her tell you about the baby she really wants to” we’re his exact words. I said I moved across country and couldn’t and never responded again. 

Now it’s been about a year and he has been emailing an old email I use for spam for a few months begging me to text him or call him as he can’t live like this anymore and needs me back. I’m honestly torn on if I should reply to see what he has to say or just keep moving forward with my new life. So... any advice? 

Sorry if this sounds like a random jumble of words I don’t have time to proof read atm and will answer as much as I can’t after work. Thank you",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dlklea/my_dad_falsely_accused_me_of_molestation_and_now/,relationship_advice,1017,273,0.0

On Saturday, my GF of two years did something that somewhat hurt my feelings/destroyed my manhood a bit. She sent me a link and to some of those male enlargement pills that can supposedly grow a penis by three inches in 30 days. I thought she was just joking so I ""LOL'd,"" said no, and brushed it off. When I saw her yesterday (Monday), she said ""I have something for you."" To my surprise, she pulled out a bottle of those pills.

I said, ""What the F\*\*\*, are you serious right now? Really?"" She said, ""Relax I'm not saying you are not big enough. I just want to choke on an extra inch or three of you. I thought you would be cool with it."" I said, ""First of all, that is not for you to decide. Secondly, why would I do that for you? I'm comfortable with my endowment. Lastly, IF I were to consider this as a possiblity, you do know all of that is false adverting right? That stuff does not work."" She said, ""There is only one way to find out. Here, take them."" I told her to leave and have not uttered a word to her. My phone is still blowing up with texts and calls. From the texts and voicemails, I can tell she did not expect me to tell her to leave. I kept cool as all of this was happening because I thought she was still kidding... 

It irritates me that she did this. I wouldn't say she isn't happy with my size, but clearly her actions are alluding to this without her having to even say it. My question is, dear Redditors, am I overthinking/overreacting? I am considering ending it. She has apologized but I fear the damage is done. What she did was uncalled for and should only be done if one is insecure about their size. I still love her, but this stings still! Should I break it off? What should I say? Is there a way to recover from this? 

P.S. I did tell her, ""OK, I will take the pills, but only if you get a boob job."" She said ""Yes because I love you."" 😂",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dljukt/my_gf_28f_joked_about_male_enlargement_pills_i/,relationship_advice,10705,1808,0.0

thowRAcheating,2019-10-22 07:17:56+00:00,How should I reveal to my (21F) boyfriend (22M) of 5 years that I know?,"Buckle up. I'm about to vent and this is going to be incredibly long. TL;DR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I ever loved him as much as he loved me. We got together when I was 16 and he was 17 -- he'd been in relationships before, but he was my first everything. He didn't make me laugh but he made up for that in all the ways that count. There were many moments throughout the years when I thought that I should end it, but I didn't know how and the few times I tried, he begged me to stay and make it work. It may have been wrong to let it go on for this long but I loved him so much, and I still do.  I've just never been *in* love with him. I'm not really sure what that feels like but I don't think I've felt it.

Throughout our relationship I believed he was the gentlest, kindest, most honest person I've ever met. Lately though, he's been growing more and more distant. Not in an obvious way. He still cares for me: he asks me about my day, he calls me 'his love' and a generous selection of other pet names, he kisses me, he shows the utmost concern for my well-being when I'm at a low point in my mental health (which, I admit, isn't rare and I can see it taking its toll on him). I do the same for him. But I've been noticed the subtle early release when we embrace, the lack of sexual interest, the disinterest in even just snuggling on the couch together. He tries to hide it but I can see right through him.

For the past few months, he has been complaining nonstop about work and constantly telling me that he needs to work late. He's a chef and his kitchen is genuinely understaffed so I foolishly took him at his word. For context, his restaurant closes at 3PM and when he first started there, it wasn't unusual for him to stay til 6-7PM to prep for the next day or two. These days, he's been coming home anywhere between 8-midnight. Unless he's ""going out with his coworkers"", in which case he doesn't come home until 2-3AM. He comes home with armed with excuses on nights that he claims to have worked, often with alcohol on his breath -- but don't worry, it's just his boss constantly offering him hard liquor and the poor guy just can't refuse! 

So onto the climax. He came home late again last night and I'd waited to start the laundry so he could throw in his chef jacket. I asked him to pull it out of his backpack and he scurried away to the bedroom with it. He has his back towards me and I watched him try to subtly take a pair of my (!!) comfy fleece pyjama pants out of his bag and onto the floor. I asked him why he had them in his work bag and guys, I've never seen someone lie so swiftly and effortlessly to my face while being 100% certain they were lying. He casually told me that he brought them to work since he's been working such exhausting hours and he wanted to wear them while finishing up the close. We joked about needing to buy new sweatpants (most of ours have holes in them and we've been procrastinating getting new ones) and left it at that. But that nagging feeling that I'd been lied to wouldn't go away so I decided to do something about it.

I went through his email and found a bunch of messages from various men to his Facebook. I tried to login to his Facebook, but he changed the email to his account (it's still active) so I had no way of seeing those messages. I wasn't even aware he had another email address. I assumed the messages were sexual; I'd dealt with this type of cheating before. He had cried and apologized profusely, begged me not to leave him, promised he would never do anything like this again, that as a trans man, he felt like he just needed to feel validated by cis men. We worked through it then but I already knew I would not stick around this time.

Fast forward to today, I decided to do some more detective work. I noticed the cuffs of my pyjamas were rolled up -- I never roll them up, and he hasn't worn them lately. I lifted them up and smelled them. They smelled like a woman. Interesting.

 I decided to peruse his email some more. I noticed he had a staggering number of Uber receipts -- like, *hundreds.* I was intrigued and started clicking, and my heart was racing so fast as I realized he hadn't been Ubering from work all those nights he told me he was working late. I scrolled through months of our messages and his rides to and from this one specific place coincided with every time he was working past 6-7PM. He was Ubering to this place after work, after drinks with his coworkers, from there to our home. There's one ride I found that hurt me the most. I was experiencing some of my worst PMDD symptoms and seriously not doing well. Despite this, he said he wanted to go see a movie with his coworkers and I encouraged him to do so. He texted me from inside the theater saying the movie was just starting. *The timestamp on the text directly coincided with the time he was sitting in his Uber, on his way to his favourite spot.* He continued to tell me that he might go for drinks with his coworkers after the movie, and I expressed how hurtful it was that he didn't seem to really care that I was in pain. He agreed, apologized, and told me he'd come straight home after the movie and take care of me. I realize now that he was just trying to buy himself time with whoever he was seeing.

He's grown increasingly secretive with his phone but I managed to look through it tonight. He's been seeing a female coworker he's only mentioned to me in passing. Like, he'll talk to me at length about all his other coworkers but I never hear about her. They've known each other for a few months but I've already been replaced. They refer to each other as friends as she knows he's in a long-term relationship, but they exchange 'I love you's and sweet emojis every day. He talks about how pretty she is, about holding her, kissing her head, loving the way she thinks. He hasn't said those things to me in ages. The pyjamas? They were having a pyjama party with jello shots and ADHD meds that he stole from me.

I'm glad I know how he feels now, but honestly, it would've been better if they just fucked. Those incredibly personal texts were so painful to read. He writes record-breaking paragraphs to her when she's feeling down. He's confided in her about his true feelings towards me. He's even told her about an incredibly vulnerable moment I had recently during sex -- something I would never have expected him to do.

I feel hurt and betrayed, like I have no idea who I've been living with for the past 4 years. I'm not really sure where to go from here. He's asleep right now and I've put his phone back.

I hope I've been good to him and that he knows I've always wanted the best for him. I'm not sure if he thought he was sparing me the pain of losing him, but I want him to know that I see him for all that he is and that I'll be just fine without him.

What do I do now? Should I show him this post?

If you've read the entire post, I seriously can't thank you enough and would love to hear your thoughts.

Yesterday I go to count my money saved and I'm $80 short. I text him and ask him why he took it, he ignored me. I called him twice, he ignored me. Finally he writes back and says he let his friend borrow the $80 because he was broke and will pay me back in 3 days with an extra $20. 

I'm so angry, I work so hard and was so proud of myself for saving and not buying anything extra for myself. He says he doesn't see the big deal.

Advice please?,"I've been with this guy for over a year and he's wonderful but I just found out he has a very limited understanding of the female reproductive system. It all started because I've had some odd gastro symptoms and a few people had suggested that I could be pregnant. It's quite unlikely anyway (I'm on contraception) and I said that I was due to have my period in a few days so we shouldn't worry yet. He said 'oh, so does it (menstruation) kill the baby?'. It transpires that he doesn't seem to know why periods happen - he didn't realise that women don't have periods during pregnancy and indeed that one of the first indicators of pregnancy is a missed period. I'm just very perplexed as he is an intelligent person with a degree and a good job.

ThrowRA18484727,2019-10-20 12:56:39+00:00,UPDATE: I (20F) am paranoid that my boyfriend (25M) is recording me during sex,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/djwu80/i_20f_am_paranoid_that_my_boyfriend_25m_is/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

 I'll be honest, my original post was more of a way for me to vent my frustration at what I thought was just a stupid situation. But after reading the replies, I realized how not ok this phone thing was. My boyfriend always had this habbit of minimizing my problems so I always thought I was being overdramatic. Like how he told me can't ever let me finish because women's bodies are more complicated than a man's. Or how condoms are uncomfortable and the pullout method works, etc. He's not my first sexual partner, but i didn't know much about sex until we start dated so my whole perception is kinda warped. All those things bothered me but I always thought I was just being a baby. The phone thing was the first time I really expressed concern openly and consistently to him and out of frustration with his non-compliance I turned to Reddit.

So a lot has happened since my original post and I wanted to make an update. After making the post and a few hours of reading the replies I told myself I HAD to know what was on those flash drives. My boyfriend and I had plans to meet up with his friend at a diner for some lunch the following day. So I made a plan.

Before lunch, while at BFs house, I would grab all four flash drives when he wasn't in the room. I would go about the day normally but I would check them when I got home, all four, every single file I found. I made a few plans ahead of time that covered every senario I could think of.

If I found regular ol' porn on them I would return them the next day and apologize for invading his privacy but make it abundantly clear as to why I did it in the first place. If I found weird fetish porn I would do the same thing but express that I want him to be more transparent with me over his sexual preferences, I would not agree to do anything I'm not completely comfortable with. If I found videos of his ex, I would message her and ask is she was aware he had the videos and if she was ok with him still having them. Then I would confont my boyfriend and tell him I wasn't comfortable with him still have videos of ex while we were dating. If I found videos of myself I would save them to my computer and delete them off of the drives. I would ask him about it before and after telling him that I took the drives and depending on how that conversation goes I may look into taking legal action. I really didn't want to, I don't know shit about how that works and I'm already buried is student loans as is. I figured I would only do it if I found out he posted the videos online or something. But anyway, that was my plan. It was the best I could do. I'm a very shy person and a total pushover so I absolutely had to plan this out in advance and force myself to comply with what I needed to do.

So, at his house I swiped the drives while he was out of the room and stashed them in my bag. The day went on like normal until I had a certain conversation with my boyfriend's friend who we'll call Jon. Jon and I were having some small talk while my boyfriend was in the bathroom. The conversation of our sex life came up. Now, for a bit of context. This friend likes to give my boyfriend little ""challenges"" to do whilst we are intimate. Usually innocent things like shouting out certain movie quotes or doing something to embarrass himself. I think it's kinda weird but it doesn't really bother me as long as it doesn't become anything more I'm ok with it. Anyway, Jon decided to give me a little challenge, he told me to shout ""The British are coming! The British are coming!"" (My boyfriend is British but born and raised in America) I thought it was kinda silly and clever but he mentioned that I should record it. I kinda paused and I think he realized this made me freeze up so he assured me he wasn't asking to watch or anything. I asked him why he even suggested that in the first place and THIS DUDE TOLD ME HE THOUGHT WE LIKED TO RECORD OURSELVES. At least that's what my boyfriend told him. I almost burst into tears. I asked him everything that he knew and he told me that he thought we liked to record ourselves and that I was just shy a about it. Because that's what my boyfriend told him. Jon assured me that he was never shown any videos or anything. But the conversation ended there because my boyfriend came back. I asked Jon not to say anything yet and I wanted to get through lunch but I felt physically sick and excused myself from the table and went straight home assuring BF I was ok but that my food tasted funny and I was going to go home.

I watched all the drives. There was a fair number of videos in each. 10-20 per drive. I didn't watch the full videos, I just skipped around in them looking for signs of myself. The drives were actually category's and I don't think I can say names without breaking some kind of rule but just picture three basic search terms on any porn site. I saw no videos of myself. However, one drive, had videos of him and his ex. I recognized his bed, and it was definitely her. I had to skip around a lot because I was trying not to look at her body, just get a good view of her face. After I confirmed I was definitely not on the drives and that she definitely was. I messaged her over Facebook and told her about the situation. I apologized for watching them and asked if she knew about them. She seemed a bit surprised but assured me she did know he had them at some point and didn't really care is he still did or not. But she understood why I wouldn't want him to have them and got pretty pissed off when I told her about him possibly recording me. She told me to record him when I confront him about it.

At this point I was kinda lost. I didn't have solid proof that he did record me but after hearing about it from his friend and seeing videos oh him and his ex, I was very shaken up. I slept on it, well tried to sleep anyway. Then first thing in the morning, I went straight to his house and demanded to see his phone. I never ask to look though his phone ever. I think it's a total invasion of privacy and would never ask under any other circumstance. He kept refusing but I threatened to break up with him then and there if he didn't. He quickly handed it over. I looked through photos, apps, messages. Nothing. A few pictures of himself in his photos but none of me, let alone videos. I asked him is he has ever recorded me. He said no, I screamed at him and pounded his chest calling him a liar. He tried to calm me down and pulled me into the house. This all happened on his front porch and I was definitely making a scene. After getting inside and closing the door he asked why I was acting this way all of a sudden. I told him I know he's been recoding me and to just admit it because I've already asked his friends about it. A bit of a bluff, I only talked to the one friend. I pleaded for him just to tell me because it scared the shit out of me. I want to know what he did with those videos. I wanted to know if he shared it with someone, I wanted to know if he put it online. I begged for my own fucking sanity for him to tell me so I don't go the rest of my life terrified that one day someone will link me a video of myself on a porn site or something. He broke down and admitted that he had recorded me. Started crying and explained his ex was really into recording them and got him into it. He swore that he never saved the videos and immediately deleted them after we were done and never shared the videos with anyone because they never even stayed on his phone. Apparently he liked the process of recording the video. He didn't do it with the intent to watch them later. Because he knew I didn't want to do it. He thought if he deleted them immediately and I didn't know it wouldn't hurt.

I don't know if what he said was true or not, I didn't find videos of myself on the drives. And I looked through his phone before he had a chance to delete anything. But even if he was being 100% honest with me then, I didn't care. He lied to my face constantly, abused any trust I gave him and put his own sexual desires above my safety and care. I have never felt so violated in my life. Fuck this guy. I'm not proud of how I acted. I am by no means intimidating and powerful. I'm 4'10 and 105 lbs. But I ugly cried, screamed in his face and swung at him a bunch until he had to physically restrain me before I broke something. I just lost it, I swear I don't have anger issues but I was in such a state of mental anguish I couldn't control myself. I left shortly after that and you better believe I broke up with him.

So that's where I am now. I called off work for the next 3 days, skiped class this morning, and I've been burying myself in Netflix until I can bring myself to even think about what to do next. I don't think I'm going to pursue legal action. I don't have and proof of what he did, only a statement from one person. Part of me really wishes I did record the conversation like the girl suggested. However, I live in a two party consent state so I would have had to tell him immediately after confronting him that I was recording him. He may not have confessed then. I just feel tired now. Like I don't even have the energy to be upset. The sadness from the breakup is creeping in. I really thought I loved this guy. But I'm refusing to let myself get upset over him like this. So for now I'm going to get better aquatinted with stranger things.

On one hand I feel like it's totally unfair that I have to go through this with my own marriage and this other guy basically gets away with it. 
On the other hand I know that they have a kid and don't want to be the catalyst for something that potentially destroys their family.

It wasn't funny, but I didn't care, especially since I was drunk.

Fast forward 2 weeks and my wife is crying on our bed, confessing how she cheated on me with Sandra. I got upset about this, reasonably, and am now threatening to divorce her. My wife was apologetic at first but has since claimed that we discussed our polygamous relationship beforehand. I think that's bullshit, by all of my friends agree with her.

Don't know if we're compatible anymore.,"I know the title is horrible and everyone is going to call me an asshole but this is the truth. She got into a bad accident 3 months ago and is now in a wheelchair, presumably for the rest of her life. She's handling it like a champ. We've cried together a lot, but she's the most positive person I know. Always keeps her head up even after this. And I love her immensely, we are highschool sweethearts been together for 5 years. But everything that has happened has made me second guess our relationship. Recently I had a talk with someone and she mentioned how tough all this must be for me. Honestly I didn't really think about myself the ever since the accident, all I cared for was my girlfriend. But we kept talking and I ended up breaking down, because right there was the moment where I realized that this also has an impact on me, and our relationship. One thing that keeps repeating in my head is when she asked if I was my gf's caregiver. She has help that comes a few times a week, but I help her out whenever I can, though she doesn't always want me to. And if we stay together that's never going to change. I know how cruel this sounds but she will always be in a wheelchair. There's so much in the world we wanted to discover and do together but we can't do it together anymore and it so so breaks my heart. I am really bad at putting my thoughts into words sorry, I just don't really know what to write. I love her to the moon and back. But then I think, what kind of boyfriend am I if breaking up with her even crosses my mind. We were planning to get engaged next year. She's always so happy to see me and knows I've had issues dealing with the accident. She's so selfless it's not even funny. Sex hasn't really been working and she herself suggested I get a FWB so I don't get frustrated. But I don't know if that will fix anything and quite frankly, I don't want anybody else but her.

Sorry for this mess and I'm not an English speaker. Any way this is sort of like a vent but I don't know what to do. I sincerely don't.

Part of me was excited to hear it. I’ve been mostly single since my divorce 2 years ago. But the other side of me immediately went into over analyzing. 

We spent the next 2 weekends hanging out non stop. Honestly, it was perfect. He was literally everything I want in a person. But I couldn’t shake how fast things were moving. He was saying I love you flat out at that point. Talking about me moving in and buying a ring. I want nothing more than to find my person and be in love, but there’s no way that can be real, right? I ended up having a freak out and told him that I had only ever been told that by 2 other people in my adult life; my ex husband and a guy I dated for 2 months. I was with my ex my husband for nearly 5 years. I ended it after nearly 2 years of marriage because I felt we had grown apart. It also didn’t help that he was a narcissistic asshole and slept with an 18 year old when we were on a break. The 2-month guy really crushed me. He said I love you after a month. As it turns out he only said it to manipulate me into basically being his piggy bank. I wanted so much to believe that someone loved me that I let myself be fooled. 

I told him that as a result of those 2 painful breakups I have a hard time trusting. The last thing I want is to say I love you to someone that doesn’t really mean it. It’s not just a pretty thing to say. Those words have weight. I asked him if we could just move a little slower. He said he agreed. That night we got drunk and he told me he loved me again. I didn’t say anything but we kept seeing each other like everything was fine. 

Ultimately after another awkward drunken conversation about my fears and trust he did a complete 180 and started acting like he didn’t care if we saw each other again. I pressed him on why, and got upset that he didn’t call when he said he would. After that he said we should keep things light and fun while we build trust. 2 days later he broke up with me. 

I’m sad, hurt, and angry. I feel like I fucked this up somehow. Is it possible that he really did care that much that soon? He said he thinks I’m too dramatic and emotional because I got so worked up when I talked about my trust issues and that saying I love you was making me so scared.

The long and short of it is, she was upset I was talking to this girl in my Math class while we were waiting for the bus. All we talked about it were ghosts because there's a graveyard just down the road from our school. I don't talk to her often outside of class and that I swear. We just talked because it was the two of us until my girlfriend arrived. 

My girlfriend has jealously issues. She always has. Last year there was a girl who broke her leg at school, and all my girlfriend could do was make it about herself. She's weird like that. Anyway so we get the bus and go back to my house. When we go inside my girlfriend just starts to yell at me. She started to say that I think Arial is funnier or something. I said something along the lines of why are you always talking to Wade when you know I hate the guy. If you can talk to him then I can talk to whoever I want. 

She slapped me twice and somehow her ring managed to cut my eyebrow. I have no idea why if was bleeding so badly but it just wouldn't stop and left a nasty cut. My girlfriend left because I told her just to leave. She was saying she was sorry and trying to fix it.

discosten,2019-10-19 05:01:27+00:00,I’m (21f) apparently getting stupider and the way my boyfriend (25m) reacts to it really bothers me,"I’ll start with the fact that I guess I’m getting dumber and just not thinking before I do things. For example, last night, while at my boyfriend’s house, I had said early in the day that I was probably going to get some ice cream later. I thought I’d mentioned that I didn’t really want ice cream but rather something fruity, like Italian ice. I guess I didn’t. While at the store I also got a bunch of juice for me to have at my boyfriend’s house. He usually has a problem with me bringing home sugary things because he has impulse problems, so I usually don’t. But I knew he didn’t really like juice so I’d be okay. I also got him a case of red bull (I don’t drink it), but I forgot to get sugar free stuff. When I got back, he was pretty pissed because 1. I didn’t get ice cream when that’s what I went out for. 2. I got juice and he will drink it (didn’t think he liked it) and 3. I didn’t get the sugar free red bull. I’ll admit that I have problems when shopping and buy too much. And when he gets red bull, he gets sugar free, so I should’ve known that, but it was an impulse buy and I hadn’t bought it in a while so it slipped my mind.  I completely understand that these things are really stupid, and I don’t know why but my mind’s just been slipping on a *lot* of things lately. This is why I feel like he's partially justified in his reaction. I get why he’s frustrated.

Last night, I did laundry because we were cleaning his room. I didn't do all of it because we both work all weekend and I didn't think he'd need much besides his work clothes. I should've done two loads I guess. [This](https://imgur.com/a/QD9Y1ku) was his reaction to it when he found out (I didn't stay over tonight). He hasn't texted me since.

He probably calls me stupid, retarded, and sometimes autistic at least once a day. I understand that the things I do are really frustrating; they're frustrating to me to. But I almost feel like my absent-mindedness has gotten worse since he's been getting angry about it. I've brought it up to him that him calling me stupid so often really hurts my self-esteem and makes me feel disrespected, but he just says that he shouldn't have to lie and sugar coat everything because my stupidity really frustrates him. And I kind of get that. I feel stupid even writing this all out, like I should just stop being such so absent minded and this wouldn't be a problem. I just want to know whether I'm justified at all in this. I'm just kinda lost. Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: I have been really stupid/absent minded about things lately and it frustrates my boyfriend to the point of calling me stupid every single time it happens. This bothers me but I don't think that he's completely unjustified.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/djz98x/im_21f_apparently_getting_stupider_and_the_way_my/,relationship_advice,1473,485,0.0

I had a casual relationship with this woman for 1.5 years.  We used to work together so we didn't initiate anything. After she left we strictly established a purely sexual relationship. We both set the boundaries and were clear cut from the beginning. Near the end of the relationship, I didn't like what is was turning into so I was the one to break it off. Needless to say, it was a messy break off. Relationship started when we were 21 and ended by the time I were 23. I'm 28 now.

 A couple months later go by and she says she pregnant with my child. Long story short, she fed a story to her  parents on how we were dating for 3 years and that I was ashamed to be seen with her and that I was neglecting my responsibility to my child. I do some digging and found another man and ask her how she knows this woman. The details he told me line up with the time I broke it off with her. He ended up sleeping with her 3 months after our relationship was done. Eventually, the other man gets tested and it comes back he's not the father. Due to the circumstances at the time I accepted the fact that this was my child. (I know I was stupid and deserve all the shit that is given to me)

Ultimately, I ended up paying a collective of 9,000 usd for child support. After some time I found out that there was a third man involved and after a long process and arguing back in forth with this woman, he gets tested and he is indeed the father. 

After I found out I did some research and there was no gaurentee I would get my money however I still got a lawyer just to be sure. He ultimately petitioned the court to stop the child support. However he found a way to get my money back. At this point we complete the steps necessary to file a claim against my old fwb. Word gets out of what I'm doing and her friends and family are trying to talk me out of it, saying that I'm an asshole for suing a ""struggling mother."" And that I'm just neglecting being a father.

If this was my child I would without a doubt do everything needed to raise them, however I feel used and don't have an obligation to help the mother.

I'm just looking for perspective. Am I in the wrong for taking counter measures against my old fwb?

OWhateverNevermind,2019-10-18 21:40:46+00:00,My GF keeps forgetting to flush the toilet after she poops.,"The first few times I cracked up and did away with the poo train. Now it is becoming a frequent problem. We have 1 bathroom and the toilet does not like mass amounts of toilet paper. So sometimes she will either forget to flush, or she will unknowingly back up the toilet. After discovering this, I suggested to her that she throw in a courtesy flush into her routine and watch how much toilet paper she heaves down the toilet. 

We have lived together for 3 months. This happens 1-3 times a week. If I EVER had a partner tell me this, I would be MORTIFIED and become extremely diligent about making sure my poop was flushed. So far I have:

* Politely told her that she is forgetting to flush or backing up the toilet.
* Had a more direct conversation about how inconvenient it is to see her poop.
* Told her that seeing her poop was not sexy for me (sure as hell thought this would do it).
* Called her into the bathroom to flush the toilet after discovering it filled with thick logs and shit ton of paper.
* Got into an argument telling her it is common decency to make sure the toilet is all clear.

Nothing has worked, it still happens. It's really starting to gross me out and make her much less attractive to me.

We have 3 kids in elementary school.  Her issues consisted of I'm not involved enough with kids, she was tired of my moods/ temper. We would have these big fights every 6 months over little dumb annoyances that built up over time. She was just tired of dealing with me and wanted to move on. My complaint was she was mean to me and we had a mismatch in libido (she only wanted it once a month, I wanted it daily-weekly within reason). 

Now backing the story up a little, she was having bone pain in her shin starting in 2017. The doctors thought it was an injury. Never got better after physical therapy. Then they thought it was a bone infection. Then they finally said in Fall of 2018 that it was bone cancer. That threw our lives into turmoil with trying to understand what it meant and going to many, many chemo treatments, and everything. Then she had surgery to remove the section of bone with cancer and replace it with a bone graft and metal.

For a year she hasn't been able to walk or drive.  We went to probably over a hundred doctor's appointments.  Had no physical intimacy and barely even touched at all. I started to get emotionally distant. I felt resentment when fearing that when this was all over, she would go back into wanting to dump me and move on with her life.  I've helped her as a caregiver reluctantly the whole time, but she could see through it.  I was helping her because I felt like I had to, not really because I wanted to. It was a super hard year.

There were all kinds of twists and turns along the path but anyway, bringing us to now, she's cancer-free and we're trying to rebuild some kind of life. We're going back to marriage counseling. I keep hearing myself say things like ""why should I be fully invested in our relationship when I don't believe that she really loves me or respects me"". I say those things and it sounds weird coming out of my mouth.

I'm lonely, sad, starved for affection, and not sure how to make anything better. Shes still recovering so I don't think she really wants to deal with my thoughts and feelings. It seems like if I just keep my mouth shut and love her unconditionally that she'd be happy. But I'm not a saint and I feel like I'm falling apart.  Not really sure what to do. 

If anyone else has been through anything like this (as person w cancer or as caregiver), I'd appreciate some perspective.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/djo52o/my_m_mid30s_wife_f_mid30s_wanted_to_divorce_me/,relationship_advice,1057,126,0.0
Throwaway181809,2019-10-18 14:00:03+00:00,quiet kid beat up bully. Bully’s mom is furious. Quiet kid mom is unapologetic. Want to do what’s best and reconcile both moms [both 37] and cousins [both 17],"Hello, let’s call my nephews Harry and Dudley

So both are 17 and as far as I [F23] can remember, Dudley has always been a true bully to Harry. I don’t know why but he absolutely hates him and makes his live a living hell. Harry is a sweetheart, kind of the quiet kid who only talks if he has to. We do family gathering every Sunday so they see each other every week, and since this year they go to the same school. 


Anyway to keep things short, a few weeks ago, a tired Harry had enough and just lost it and beat the shit out of Dudley in front of Dudley’s friends. It was ugly and humiliating as my nephew is very popular and admired, you know the stereotype of the bully. 



Dudley’s mom (Petunia) never accepted to talk to his son about his behavior. She always said that Harry should man up and defend himself if that bother him so much. 



Well I guess he did, and it was ugly. 




Petunia is absolutely furious and wants Harry to apologize to her son. She also wants my other sister, Harry’s mom (let’s call her Lily) to ground him and take away his computer, games and book. She’s threatening to press charges. My mom told me that she thinks Lily should hit her son for  hurting her Dudley so badly but I don’t think she meant it. 



We (mom and dad and grandma and brother+ in-laws) are honestly so happy and proud (we really tried everything we could to make Dudley stop but the mother was in denial and our only solution was to keep an eye on my nephew when he was around) that Harry finally defended himself that we can’t hide our satisfaction and my sister is outraged. She doesn’t talk to us anymore and blocked us everywhere. 


Lily is so happy that she can’t held her smug face each time she sees my other sister. She smiles way more and is very relaxed now, as if she had been waiting for this all her life. 


Petunia and lily where very good friends before, they lived their pregnancy together, but their relationship became very complicated when Dudley started to abuse Harry. I think he’s jealous of Harry (parents in love, lovely home, good grades, effortlessly funny when he decides to talk, good health. Dudley’s life is chaotic because of Petunias multiple boyfriend and inability to keep a job)


I don’t know what to do to move forward as a family. I’m relieved Harry stood for himself but violence isn’t a solution and he really hurt Dudley. I don’t really like Dudley but he’s my nephew and I still hope he decides to become a decent human being. I guess I should scold Harry but I don’t want to. I want to reach to Dudley but I don’t know how. 

Any advice

I never noticed any signs, abusive behavior while seeing each other on outings or at parties, so this is a shock to me. I don't know if I can be friends with someone who does this (I should just straight up be not being mates any more) but feel confused.

I always initiate (kissing, touching, foreplay) while she almost never does. I go down on her. I try to 'hold it in' until she comes during penetration. 

Last week she gave me oral (almost never happens) and after I guess 6 minutes she tells me 'ok I'm bored'. Instant boner killer. I couldn't even get it back up after hearing that. Because it's not like giving her oral is my favourite thing in the world but I do it because I love her and I like to see her in pleasure. Her telling me she's bored after a few minutes kinda killed my interest in getting oral from her.

Apart from that, last night we had sex and she came from penetration. I might've been able to come, but soon after she said 'you're not going to come, are you?' and that was another question which kinda ruined the mood for me because she didn't want to continue as I 'wouldn't come anyway'. I just wanted to continue a bit longer cause it feels great.

Apart from that, I feel like she never initiates sex. I, even as a man, would like to feel desired sometimes. That she would start kissing me or my neck or my body. That she would want to have sex spontaneous. Doesn't happen. I am not sure how long I would have to wait to have sex with her if I didn't initiate every time.

What's wrong here? Is she losing attraction to me? Am I not good enough for her?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/djm3r3/i_29m_am_afraid_my_girlfriend_28f_is_selfish_in/,relationship_advice,1434,459,0.0
pinkpetals-,2019-10-18 07:47:17+00:00,"I’ve (25f) become my boyfriend’s (25m) new addiction, and I’m exhausted.","We have been dating for 6 months. He is a recovering heroin addict, which is new territory for me. Early on, I felt that he would substitute the high he gets from sex at an unhealthy amount. My suspicions ended up being true. 

Things were going fairly well for a few months.  It stopped when I realized that he becomes very hostile when we don’t  have sex as frequent as he wants. His rationalization is that he needs it to know that I’m still invested in the relationship, so he equates it to me not loving him anymore. 

One night, early on, I turned down sex and I could see the rage in his eyes. I felt very uncomfortable and left, but I’ll never forget that look. I thought he was going to hit me. He began throwing adult tantrums after that, admitting that while it was from his own insecurities, I was part of the problem. It’s like watching an addict suffering by not getting his fix. 

Sex started hurting a while ago, and when I told him, he accused me of making up excuses and not wanting to be intimate with him. It turns out I had a UTI.  I chose to not have sex for my health, and his, until it goes away. He’s not happy about this. 

Every time he tells me I HAVE to be intimate with him in order to keep the relationship alive, he drives me further and further away. I believe sex should happen worry free and stress free, without pressure. I’ve communicating this with him several times and he still doesn’t get it. 

He wants to marry and have kids with me, but I don’t see it happening. He says that he’s madly in love and has never felt this way before. However, we argue almost every day, and when talks about splitting up come up, he becomes devastated and starts weeping.

ThrowRAhelp6425,2019-10-17 22:42:36+00:00,My [45M] Wife [42F] revealed she was unfaithful and I'm divorcing her. Our children [15F &amp; 17M] hate me for it.,"My wife and I have been together for 18 years. We had our ups and downs but overall our marriage has been solid and she was my best friend. We've always been very close with our children and have raised them very much as a unit, and in turn they're very close to us.

About two weeks ago I brought up an advice column in the paper I had read regarding infidelity and talked about it for a bit, and I could see she had clearly started to tear up and was attempting to hide it, so I asked her what was bothering her. She confessed that about 7 years ago she cheated on me with a former coworker on a business trip, and then once with him after that before breaking it off due to guilt. This was around the time she left that job for a new one which she had told me back then was due to feeling like it wasn't a good fit but now confesses was because she didn't want to work with him anymore. She says she never had a good reason for it, she knew it was wrong then but gave into the urge and nothing has ever happened since. Claims she confessed now as she can't live with the guilt of hiding it from me. We talked about for the next three days when the kids were in school while trying our best not to let them know while they were home. I realized I knew I'd never be able to let this go, nor would I be able to forgive her. She's distraught.

We sat our kids down to tell them about the fact our marriage was ending. Obviously this was extremely tough. They acted as one could expect and blame was thrown at both of us. My wife and I agreed to tell them it was mutual, but I guess guilt got the better of her again because she ends up crying and telling them not to blame me, that she ""betrayed my trust"" in the past and just told me now, and that it's all her fault. This had the opposite effect that she intended, and now both our kids absolutely resent me for not ""forgiving mom"" and ruining our family. My wife has repeatedly tried to put blame back on herself, which only makes the kids double down and defend her more as if she's the victim. I don't want to drag their mother through the mud, so I'm being trying to explain as tactfully as I can, but they're gone as far as saying that when I get my own apartment they don't want to see me anymore and refuse my suggestion of seeing a therapist together and reject the idea that I still plan to see them on a regular basis and be on good terms with their mother. My wife isn't helping matters as she's been an emotional wreck since I've told her of my plan to leave.

I love my kids, but I don't know how to make them understand this without dragging their mother through the mud. I don't know how to assure them this has nothing to do with them or that I'm not trying to punish or hurt their mom. I just know that I cannot get past this, and for my own happiness I need to leave. Any suggestions on how to get them to stop seeing me as the villain would be helpful.

igotsixcanlockin,2019-10-17 15:59:04+00:00,Last night I (19f) received a call from my boyfriend’s wife. Please help me,"Before I start yes I know I’m the naive dumbass teenager here and I made a lot of stupid decisions. 

I met “Leo” 7 months ago. We have been together for 6. We met at a fair and he started flirting with me right away. He was so cute and charming, and I’m usually awkward around new people so I was excited to meet someone who could make conversation so easily. There was just one thing, he’s kind of a lot older than me (29) so I was nervous at first. We went on a few dates and they went amazing, we connected instantly. 

We became exclusive quickly and everything was perfect. He would bring me flowers and little gifts for no reason. He said he loved my brain and my attitude towards life. He assured me he wasn’t just in this so he could fuck a younger girl, that he really wanted to be with me. He told me that I was really mature anyways and that he didn’t even think about the age difference most of the time. I think he put me on a pedestal at times, he said I was the most beautiful girl he’d ever seen and I’d often catch him staring at me in a cute way. I’m really not that objectively pretty but I loved how he made me feel like I was really that beautiful. My roommates at my apartment are absolute nightmares so I started staying over at his place more and more, for the last month or so I’ve basically been staying over every night and it’s made us so close...I mean after sex we just lay under the covers and talk for hours until I fall asleep in his arms. 

Two weeks ago. Is when it all turned to shit. I left Leo’s house that day to go to class as normal. We had wonderful morning sex and then he kissed me and said he loved me as I left. Everything was great. Later he texted me and said he had come down with something really bad and couldn’t stop puking. I offered to come over and take care of him but he said no as he didn’t want me to him like this and prefers to be alone when he’s sick. 

That was the last I’ve heard from him. Two days was weird but I figured he was really sick and sleeping. After that I started blowing up his phone, he blocked me on everything. I couldn’t believe this was happening and I literally didn’t get out of bed for days (skipped my damn classes over him) because I had no idea what I’d done to make him leave me so coldly and not even tell me why. I even went to house once, creepy I know but I just needed to see him. Well he wasn’t even there so it was pointless. 

Last night, I received a call from a number I didn’t recognize so I didn’t pick up. Then I got a text 

“Hello ___, my name is ___. I am Leo’s wife. I believe we have a lot to talk about. I would like to meet with you.” 

I immediately was sure I was being pranked by one of my friends (we have a bit of a twisted sense of hunor, tbh I would’ve found it kind of funny) so I just responded with “nice.” and shortly after “wait who is this?” She told me this was not a joke and sent their wedding photo along with other pictures. She also told me that she had been out of the country for work. And she had just returned. 

All of this is about 100X more than I can viably handle. I’m fucking heartbroken that this guy I fell in love with, and who I thought loved me, could just cut me off without any notice like I’m nothing. I feel trashy for being the other woman even though I didn’t know. I feel like a stupid little girl for thinking that I had found something amazing with Leo. And I feel extreme guilt over the fact that I’ve ruined a literal MARRIAGE. I can’t stop crying and I just wanted this to not have happened. I flip flop between hating Leo’s guts and hoping he dies alone, and just wanting to be in his arms again. He knows how to comfort me like no one else and if this were any other situation making me so upset, he is the one I would go to. He would kiss my forehead and tell me that everything was okay and if it wasn’t he would make it so. I felt so safe with him. But it was all a complete lie I guess. I don’t know what his actual reasoning for doing this was. I don’t know if I ever want to speak with him again but I have so many questions. 

I also haven’t responded to his wife yet about meeting her. I probably should but I know I will cry and be a mess when we talk about Leo. At least she knows I didn’t know about her.

My friend (let's call him Paul) and I have been best friends since first grade, we've known each other for 11 years and I thought I could trust him with anything but apparently not. 

Yesterday I was feeling really down and lonely so I called him and asked if I could crash the night in his place, he said yes so I bought some weed, a 12 pack of beer and we sat down and talked for hours, 8 beers and 2 joints in I just fell asleep out of nowhere and left my phone next to me, now I didn't think anything about it, nobody knows the password and I'm a really light sleeper so if someone even stares at me while I'm sleeping I'll wake up so I slept like a baby alll night.

When I woke up I was looking for my phone, confused since I couldn't find it I grabbed Paul's phone to call mine and see if I could find it, I open WhatsApp and, not only did he sent messages to a lot of my contacts as if it was me, no, he had to go the extra mile, I open my chat and, low an behold, this piece of shit sent himself at least 30 pictures and 20 videos of _MY GRILFRIEND_, my *nude* girlfriend from my phone... While I was asleep. 

Now I know what a lot of you will say ""Why didn't you keep them in your phone's safe?"" and to that I'll say... It's *my* goddamn phone, nobody uses it but me, why should I hide things from myself, my privacy has to be respected. 

I'm at a loss for words, I just deleted everything he sent, grabbed my things and left, he'll know that I saw it once he looks for it and it's not there, but I don't know what to say... 

If I tell my girlfriend I'm dead, and tbh I don't even want to look at Paul's disgusting face, he's a fucking pig, but I know he'll try to contact me to say he's sorry and try to make up for this bullshit.

He is an incredible husband and father . He is very sweet , caring, kid, funny, smart and even good looking .

Samagalar,2019-10-17 07:18:05+00:00,"When I(18M) turned 18 about 3 months ago my parents informed me I will have to pay rent, so I did. However now I am moving out next week and didn't tell them until yesterday as such they are angry, I need advice","The title honestly is a short version of what is happening.

So a little over 3 months ago I turned 18, the day after my father and my mother informed me I would be required to pay rent and that my rent would be 350 Euro's. Now I happen to know that the total cost of renting the house my parents rent is roughly 700-750 Euro's, as such they were basically asking me an 18 year old with a part time job to cover half the rent  despite my lazy brother (19M) not paying a cent towards rent. Also let me add to this that having your children pay rent is considered to be extremely weird in my country, it basically happens to no one unless their parents are in extreme financial hardship which definitely is not the case here my parents are not rich by any means but my dad makes plenty to live comfortably and our rent is considered extremely low even by local standards. Atop this my wages for the month are around 800 Euro's on a good month but usually more or less around 600 Euro's generally, I tried to get more hours but my job would not let me as I am only a part-time employee.

Now of course I was angry about this but just decided to pay it as I did not want to get kicked out or something, but in the meantime planned for college, getting a college loan, getting a college apartment and getting a new part time job where I was going to study.

To make a long story short it all worked out, I was allowed to join the college courses I was joining late in the year and I informed my boss a month ago and he was sad to see me go but wished me good luck and I was allowed to finish the last month now yesterday my dad demanded my rent for this month, so I gave him a little over half the money(Around 250 Euro's) And informed him I would be moving out by the start of the next week.

This turned in to a huge fight where they were yelling at me because they did not want me to move out as I am apparently not old enough(I am legally an adult) and they had already planned my 350 Euro's in to their finances for the next several months, now what do they use my money for you ask? Going out to dinner, going to see movies, buying luxury goods, literally nothing towards paying the actual rent as my parents can easily cover it. So I told them about this and I added that they were really dumb for expecting me to pay them rent and then continue to treat me as if I am their teenage son, literally I still have fucking curfews and shit in place and I told them they were not charging my brother rent so I felt slighted to begin with. 

Well they told me to grab my shit and get out, so that is pretty much what I did after demanding they give me 75 Euro's back which was meant to cover my last week at home, at this point I am staying at a good friend of mine who have graciously allowed me to stay the week and store my stuff until I move to my student apartment next week.

Now here is the thing, I sort of need advice as to how to deal with my parents, as I do not want to lose them and their behavior these last 3 months is not representative of the last 18 years, on the other hand I want them to treat me as an adult and apologize for their idiotic behavior towards me, so what to do reddit?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dj2tub/when_i18m_turned_18_about_3_months_ago_my_parents/,relationship_advice,1122,199,0.0

She IMMEDIATELY noticed like within ten minutes after I'd blocked she sent a text saying ""did you block me on instagram and facebook??"" so I didn't beat around the bush, I said yes because I didn't like how she's messed with my personal relationships. She tried to guilt trip me about how I hadn't told her about my boyfriend (which means my parents must have told her about him like I knew they would). She exploded at me because according to her she would never have tried to ""stalk him or anything"", but I hadn't even gotten a chance to say I was worried she'd do this. She said it first so what does that say?

I told her I flat out didn't trust her to not try to take people from me. She called me psycho and selfish, but whatever really. I can't reason with her. She just never sees the problem with anything she's done. The way she thinks makes it like arguing with a young child almost.

I blocked her number, I still feel kind of bad doing this because what if there was an emergency and she needed me. But we live hours apart, so I figure/hope my parents would be who she contacted in that case...

Then, as for them, I also got a call from my mom soon after I blocked my sister who wanted to know what I was doing because she was upset. She'd already heard my sister's side which was just that I'd blocked her out of nowhere. So I tried to tell her my side. I did not tell her my sister's personal business about drugs and having sex, like I said in the first post I'm not going to fall to petty revenge. I just want her to stop interfering in my life. So all I said was that in the past she's been inappropriate with guys I've dated and has spread rumors about me and it made me unable to trust her. My mom then wanted to know what I meant by inappropriate (my parents are really conservative and don't believe in having sex before marriage). She also got my dad on the call at this point. I told them the details didn't matter. She kept trying to go back to this point, even wanting to know if I had been having premarital sex. It was really frustrating. 

I told them the point I'm trying to make is that my sister has broken my trust. They began saying I should forgive her because they care about our family and don't want to see us fighting. Well I'm not exactly fighting. I'm simply not going to be in contact with her. To them it's the same thing. 

Then they wanted me to come home for a weekend to discuss everything as a family. I said I wasn't going to do that, that I'd made my decision, and have no time for a trip. They said they'd come to me then. That brought up how they show up for random visits even when I've said I don't like it. I told them I didn't want them doing that anymore, and if they did it again I wouldn't let them in or talk with them. So they flipped out, that was fun, I got to hear all how I'm constantly making problems and don't care about my family.

I ended up having to block their numbers because they kept calling back. And blocking on facebook because they were sending messages going back and forth between begging to talk and accusing me of being a terrible daughter and sister.

I don't know wtf I'm going to do about them. They did threaten to stop paying for my college if I cut them out of my life. I unblocked them to say I want to be in touch with them and do love them but I can't do the unexpected visits, or them prying into my personal life. I said if they stop doing that then I'm happy to have a relationship with them. They had a million reasons why I'm in the wrong. I couldn't deal with it and reblocked them yesterday. So I don't know what my tuition deal is going to be now.

My boyfriend at least has been really supportive during this shit. He thinks my parents are way out of line and my sister is crazy. He's really helped keep me as sane as I can be. 

Overall I just feel really shitty. I wish any of them would ever listen to what I say. But if they won't then what can I do besides put up with what you all pointed out was really controlling, or take more control back myself. It just sucks it has to be so...final, I guess. I wouldn't mind a middle ground like PLANNING a visit with them ONCE IN A WHILE, or talking with my sister about nonpersonal things, but they want way more than I do. 

TL;DR: I'm not going to be in contact with my family for the foreseeable future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/diuo5c/update_to_my_22f_twin_22f_has_slept_or_tried_to/,relationship_advice,17743,1506,0.0
SleepFlower80,2019-10-16 12:50:47+00:00,I have birthday plans that don’t involve the guy I’m dating. He’s trying to pressure me to change them but I don’t want to.,"Can I ask here for advice please? Is this a red flag?

My birthday is next month. My mum’s birthday is 5 days before mine. We’ve decided to go to Italy to celebrate our birthdays together, just us. I can’t wait!

I (38F) been dating this guy (40M) for a little bit. I think he’d like it to be more serious than me at the minute (I’ve repeatedly told him I don’t want to rush anything and he says he understands, but I’m not convinced). He asked what I’m doing for my birthday so I told him. He responded that he’s devastated and I could’ve at least checked in with him first before we booked it. It was booked way before I started dating him so that’s not even the point. 

Now he’s pressuring me to change the dates. I’m sticking firm but he’s pissing me off, saying I don’t even consider him or his feelings. I don’t know whether I’m being dramatic about it or not. I’ve had some shit relationships in the past so perhaps it’s made me more sensitive to this shit and I’m making a mountain out of a molehill?

pancakesnxanax,2019-10-15 15:17:25+00:00,UPDATE: Found My (21F) Stepdad(44M) staring at me while I slept.,"Original post in my profile. I made the post roughly a week and a half ago and frankly it's been a long week and a half. Very long. I took into consideration what all of you had advised me to do. Cameras, pepper sprays, tell my very pregnant mum, move out, door lock and point blank confrontation. I decided that out of all of them, even though it would be the riskiest of them all, would be to tell my mom. She did not take this well. At first she claimed that I was lying, which was expected and told me to come with proof, which was also expected, but at this point, it would be MY word, her daughter, against his. She was mad furious when I told her. I didn't want it getting to her at all because of her condition, but it did. She had an anxiety attack after confronting him about what I said and he  blamed me for what had happened saying that if anything had happened to the baby, he would never forgive me. I was appalled. When she finally felt better after getting some medical attention, we all had a sit down and she was very hands on with the situation. Prior to this, I had explained to her that her happiness is my first priority and I wouldn't do anything to sabotage it. I'm glad she understood. Because she believed me. He however kept on denying the claims and yet again my mom backed me up. They've since ""taken a break"" and my mom doesn't want us crossing paths. He's back at his home town while I'm with her and I wouldn't have it any other way. I'm enrolling for therapy soon because I still feel violated and I want to be free from this pain. She mentioned that she wasn't going to let the baby grow up without knowing the father but there's going to be eyes on him every step of the way. I'm grateful for all of the pieces of advice that all 900 of you gave me. I'm also really grateful for sharing with me your similar cases and how best to protect myself from now on. Thank you all.

throwawayweirdissue,2019-10-15 03:40:35+00:00,(Update) Girlfriend (24F) wants me (24M) to stop hanging out with her father and refuses to explain why. How do I figure out what is going on?,"Original:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/dfrl6l/girlfriend\_24f\_wants\_me\_24m\_to\_stop\_hanging\_out/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dfrl6l/girlfriend_24f_wants_me_24m_to_stop_hanging_out/) 

So I just want to start by saying that I should probably start paying more close attention to the people around me.

After I made the post I decided the best route was to speak to Anne about our relationship and dig more into the father issue later. To my surprise this time it didn't take long because she just burst into tears. She reassured me that everything was fine between us but there was an issue with her parents and I wasn't supposed to know from her but she is very angry at her father and this was how the issue between us came to be.

Her father is having an affair, has been seeing this woman for 10 months. Anne's mother had no idea something was up until he said he was going out with me for a beer and then later Anne sent a picture of me and her at a party that same night. 

Then, he went out twice to meet up with me for a beer which was weird (we only went out once a month) but he told her I was helping him out with an idea for a project he had for their house. Since at this point she was suspicious she started to check with Anne whenever he said he was going out with me.

Things started to get more obvious and Anne's father ended up coming clean a few weeks ago. They broke the news to their sons and daughters but had a special talk with Anne since her father had been using my name in this mess and her mother thought it was only right for him to talk to me and apologize. Anne tried to keep quiet but ended up lashing out which caused the issue between us.

I did have a talk with her father and it was extremely awkward, he apologized and said he hoped we could keep being friends once everything was settled. Don't know about that though.

Anne has also apologized but this has really taken a toll on her so I'm not holding it against her. 

Thanks to everyone who replied to the first post, even though most of you made me a little paranoid that I was going to get dumped I still got some good insight.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/di23tj/update_girlfriend_24f_wants_me_24m_to_stop/,relationship_advice,1020,29,0.0

So I was together with ""Alex"" for 5 years and we were married for 2. We loved each other but it didn't work. We fought a lot over petty shit and it went to shambles when we had a pregnancy scare and got talking and neither wanted to compromise on names.

We divorced and 2 years latery sister confesses that she has been taking to Alex. I said I was uncomfortable but they were adults and could do however they please. Another 2 years later they got engaged. I was bummed to say the least but it was my sister. I was just super mad because Alex did do a lot more efforts with my sister than with me.

They have been married for 4 years now and our marriage is just a faint memory. But I can't help but get mad when I see how head over heals they are. I had to stay at their place for a few weeks because in my appartement they were doing some stuff. They never fucking fight. He helps her with whatever and the baby has both their names .

I'm really upset about it.","So the title is pretty self explanatory. My parents had me very young, fresh out of secondary school, and though they were never really ""together"" have always been good friends and co parented me well. When I was 10, my dad met a new lady and has been in a relationship with her ever since. He proposed to her three months ago. 

I've always got the feeling that my stepmother to be doesn't like me. She's very standoffish and distant. She refers to my bedroom in their house as a guest room, despite the fact it's full of my things, I'm there 50% of the time and they have an entirely seperate bedroom they give to overnight guests. She doesn't refer to me by name when talking about me with other people, just ""(dads name)'s son"" or ""your son"" if she's talking to my dad. She's deliberately planned family holidays without me and for the past four years has insisted I stay at mum's house for Christmas, instead of mum and dad taking turns having me stay like normal. All this to say, she's made it very apparent she considers me more a somewhat annoying regular houseguest than  a member of the family. 

There are five of us kids in total; myself and her 13 year old daughter from a previous relationship, then she and dad have 5 year old twin boys and a one year old daughter. I get on very well with the kids. It's just their mum who doesn't like me. 

So, the wedding. Last week I was at their place and they were discussing the roles of the kids in the wedding. 13yo is gonna be a bridesmaid. Twins are gonna be ringbearers. Baby is gonna be a flowergirl. I didn't get mentioned, so I asked what role I'm getting and they tell me I'm not, they want the focus on the younger kids for the aww factor. That was fine, until I found out that she has three other bridesmaids who are all adults, and all of my dad's groomsmen are adults too. 

I'm really really upset. I've felt for a long time that my dad loves the others more than me and this confirms it as far as I'm concerned. Not ashamed to admit I cried for a good 20 minutes when I found out I was pretty much being pushed out deliberately. I'm seriously considering not going to the wedding at all, but mum thinks I should. She says she acknowledges it's unfair but refusing to go would damage my relationship with my dad forever and I don't want that either.

I feel like a jerk. We have been married almost 12 years and have two kids, 4.5 and 1.5. 

About 7 months ago, my wife cut her hair pretty short. She told me she was considering it beforehand, and she had perfectly understandable reasons for it (easier to care for, harder for our youngest, who was nursing at the time, to pull on, etc.). She has long known that I don’t find short hair on women attractive at all. I told her at the time that I would prefer she didn’t, but that she is obviously free to do whatever she wants to her appearance. 

I have never specifically told her I don’t like it, but she definitely knows. I was really hoping it would be a one and done thing, but she keeps getting it cut. I’ve tried to make myself like it, but I just can’t. I really, really hate it. I don’t think it looks good on her at all, and it makes her look just like her mom, which creeps me out a little. 

I have tried very hard not to be critical. I have said things like “Would you be open to growing it back out? I really miss your beautiful longer hair,” etc. I don’t know what else to say, and I know it would be hurtful if I said outright that I don’t like it. I know she dislikes facial hair, so I made a point of not shaving for a while several months ago, and she was openly disdainful of that. I had to start shaving again for work reasons, though. I know it sounds stupid, but every trip back to the hairdresser feels like a little slap in the face. 

We have had sex twice in the last calendar year. She is not the type to ever initiate, and I have a much higher libido, but I struggle a lot with wanting to initiate these days.

throwRA-fhfsveyary,2019-10-14 12:31:56+00:00,I (17f) went to my school counselor about all the nasty stuff my stepfather (50m) does. It's caused chaos at home,"
My mom and dad divorced a few years ago, and now my mom is dating Zach. It was really stressful when he moved into the house with us, he's bossy and gets pissed off easy.

I started keeping a diary to vent, and every day I'd write in it and talk about what was going on in my life. It helped me cool down and relax when I was upset.

A few weeks ago, stuff got really stressful at home and I decided to put together a list of stuff that upset me and go to the school counselor for advice. I wasn't expecting her to get very involved, I just wanted to talk to someone. My best friend has talked to her about coping with her mom's death and she said she was very kind and helpful.

So i went to the counselor and I'd made a list of the things that Zach did that made me angry, because I wanted to be prepared to talk. I tend to clam up if I have to talk about personal things, and I didn't want that to happen.

So I brought this list that I'll copy here:

- Zach yells easily if he doesn't get his way. At me, at other people like the Applebee's waitress, the cashier at the Walmart, etc.

- Zach is big on ""making up"" even when I'm not ready; he will make me hug him even if I'm still mad, because he's over being mad and wants to make things better.. even though it doesn't work that way

- Zach doesn't respect my privacy, he want though my drawers and got mad because I had panties that he thought were ""too sl*tty"". I've got to hide my diary outside the house because I don't trust him to not read it.

- Zach is judgemental of my friends, how much money their families have or don't have. He says mean stuff about their families, like how (name's) momma is on meth

- Zach tried to go though my phone, look at personal texts with a boy I was dating, but luckily my phone was at 1 percent and died and i hid my charger

- Zach is an aggressive driver and I won't go in his car

Anyway, I told my school counselor all of that and i could tell she was very concerned. She asked about my diary, and I said I had more detail about all of this in my diary, I'd show her those pages if she wanted.

Showing her the diary was easier than talking for me. So i was happy to.

And after that, things went down hill. It seems like the councilor has the impression stuff is sexually motivated, but that's not how it is. And she's filed a report with cps, she said she had no choice because that's a law.

When I was at home and Zach was yelling at me about something, I let it slip what I'd done. I told him to shut up because CPS was coming soon and he shouldn't be adding to the list of nasty stuff he'd said.

He got even madder and is planning on going to the school today to confront the principal. I'm not sure what will happen. Plus there's still the thing that the councilor seemed to misinterpret.. what can I do?

TLDR - I am rely stressed after talking to s school councilor about my step dad. They made a cps report and i think they're assuming things are worse than they are",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dhpwj8/i_17f_went_to_my_school_counselor_about_all_the/,relationship_advice,7035,604,0.0

I (17f) live at home with my mom. She's got a boyfriend for about 6 months now, he doesn't live here but he spends weekends here. 

He's pretty obsessed with teaching me to be tidy, like his dad taught him. Which is trashing everything that's in the wrong place. I like to think I'm a pretty tidy person, but he keeps throwing away stuff. 

Lasagna on the kitchen counter? It goes in the trash. Schoolbook on the table when I'm not actively studying? Trash. Homework assignment I put on the printer? Trash. One of my schoolbooks is now damaged because of mystery liquids from the trash can, I'll probably have to buy a new one. 

I've tried talking with both him and my mom. He said I should just clean up after myself and I won't happen, my mom doesn't want to get involved. 

After this had been going on for a while I threw his car keys in the trash because he left them on the counter. Not as a revenge thing, but just to try and get him to talk about it again, make him see my POV. As of now he's very pissed.

ThrowRAmy,2019-10-14 10:03:45+00:00,My boyfriend [M27] opened a credit card in my [F26] name to pay a $2000 debt to his ex-gf [F27],"We started dating about a year ago, six months after he broke up with his ex of four years. Apparently they purchased his car together and he stopped making payments a couple of months before the breakup. His ex ended up contacting the bank, which repo’d the car after a couple of months of no payments and she paid off the rest of the loan in a lump sum in return for the car. His ex then sold him the car for $1000 upfront and $2500 to be paid in 5 monthly installments (the total she paid plus her approximate equity in the car). It was a simple contract notarized at the bank.

He paid the first month’s payment in May and didn’t pay at all in June. She sent a letter in the mail giving him two weeks to pay her in full or she would take it to small claims court. That was literally the end of anything I heard about it. No more letters, no court notice, he still has the car. 

We were drinking last night and I brought it up, since I knew for sure he hadn’t paid her in September. I figured she might have just forgave the debt since it was close enough. He tells me he opened a credit card in my name, took the $2000 he owed out in cash and paid her off. 

Of course I was floored, but then he told me he and I owe $3500 on the card. 

So he opened a credit card in my name, gave her $2000 without telling me about it or the card, THEN spends another $1500 on it. I got an Uber ride back to our place and just started crying. I found a statement in his mail pile and there it is, account balance of almost $3500. The last payment was in August.

Is there any way I can trust this man again? What do I do now? I have enough in savings to pay it off but I feel he is the one who owes the money.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dhognv/my_boyfriend_m27_opened_a_credit_card_in_my_f26/,relationship_advice,10790,1035,0.0
IxnayStudios,2019-10-14 01:43:11+00:00,How should I tell my friend that his older brother fingered his girlfriend in the car while we were in the front seat last night?,"I'm not sure how to handle this or how involved to get.
We were the last group to leave a birthday party late last night. His brother and girlfriend (that he lives with) were drunk in the back seat. Initially she was laying on her side and had her head in his lap but maybe 10 minutes later I saw in my peripheral her suddenly pantless with his brothers hand doing the dirty. I didn't have the guts to call them out when I noticed. We even went through a drive through and the kept going. I was trying to pretend like I never noticed and thought my friend would eventually realize. She was even moaning at some points. He did turn his head a few times but never enough to realize her pants weren't on. He was being so especially nice to her in those moments too, it was heartbreaking. 
Once we got to his house where my car was parked we went inside his house and he didn't notice anything weird. We got settled around the TV where she held her blanket up for a moment (assuming she was reremoving her pants) and tried pressing her feet against me to get my attention but I was ignoring her pretending like I was absorbed in the show. She upped the anti a few time and eventually put her leg on my lap. Friend still oblivious laughing and eating. I moved her leg of my lap but she eventually got up and asked the brother to come check out ""the food situation"" to which they disappeared into this 1 bedroom house. As soon as the show ended I left because I don't plan on witnessing a murder. Last I spoke to him was me entering my car and him being confused where his brother was since he expected him to be smoking on the porch.

I feel guilty not calling them out during the act but I couldn't work up the nerve to do it and was just envisioning a giant fight breaking out in a moving vehicle. I want to talk to him and let him know what I saw. What's the best way to handle this situation? There's a good possibility he's already found out, but how do I bring it up to show I wasn't trying to keep it a secret from him for them. His girlfriend and brother have utterly lost ALL the respect I had for them. I've already decided I don't want to speak to them or associate with them anytime in the future.
Last night might have been the worst night of my friends life. Any advice on how to handle this would be much appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dhjsml/how_should_i_tell_my_friend_that_his_older/,relationship_advice,1051,111,0.0
clit_hole,2019-10-13 22:23:08+00:00,My wife got her vagina pierced and didn't tell me.,"I had a little trouble deciding whether to post this to AITA or  relationship\_advice, but I don’t think I’ve done anything asshole-ish  yet, so here we are.   


My wife and I have been married for five  years and have been together for eight. A few weeks ago she started  showing interest in getting piercings.  
She kinda casually mentioned clitoral hood piercings, but I could tell she was measuring my reaction.   
I expressed I wasn’t into it. I just don't like the look, and we are in a monogamous relationship so I figured I'd let her know I think she's beautiful no matter what and not to do this for me.  


Another  week goes by and she brings it up again. I could tell she wanted it and couldn’t get it off her mind. I again expressed that I wasn’t into it,  but said she can do whatever she wants with her own body, but to please keep me informed. I also mentioned that I thought she should wait, as we don’t have money. Like.  We’re dirt poor. We both decided to go back into seeking a higher education and both of us are taking classes at hard institutions full time.  


Another week passes and she brings it up again. She mentions it would be to add to her pleasure during sex. This hurt my feelings a bit, as I felt inadequate, but I am fairly good at checking my ego and put my pride aside--and was willing to be open to the idea for her benefit. At this point I repeat my previous thoughts, calmly and politely, and now that it seems it may be unavoidable, I also express that if she were to ever have it done, I’d either like her to get the piercing from a  female or at least have me there if it were a male.  


I know I  know. This is probably immature on my part. Maybe I have some insecurities. I’m always working on myself. But I calmly and without  shaming her or giving off a controlling attitude expressed my feelings,  explained I wished I could be more chill, but this was a line for me, and we set the boundary.  


She agreed.  


I  went out of town for 10 days, and when I got back she had 4 new ear piercings. She avoided sexual contact for a couple days, and I had my suspicions. Finally, things got too steamy and the truth came out as the clothes came off.  


She had kept this a secret from me. It wasn’t a surprise. She knew I wasn’t into it, and she was putting off telling/showing me for as long as possible.  


My reaction was calm but intense. Mostly disappointment. But obviously not what she wanted. But I’m pretty sure it’s what she expected. She probably maybe even expected me to have  an outburst. I didn’t. But I paused sex stuff and asked a couple  questions. I wanted to know where she got it done and by who.  


She told me it was a guy, but did not say who, and she didn’t tell me which shop but said it was good. She said she got her ear pierced at one place, and the clitoral hood pierced at a separate even better place.  


It’s one thing to have a male gynecologist. That’s medical and professional.  But I know from personal experience (I have tattoos and piercings) that some of these shops and dudes working them are not professional and are sketchy and a little too casual.  


Some shops are amazing. I’d even say most! They’re clean and hip and the people are pros and act like it.  
But not all shops are nice. I was worried about safety, cleanliness, sexual harassment, and her being recorded.  


Maybe  I’m paranoid. But I just don’t like the idea of my wife going behind my  back and spreading her legs for another guy in a non-medical setting. My larger issue is not this, though. It was the dishonesty combined with it.  


I  stopped sexy times. Told her how I felt and that it just felt a little like betrayal. We had agreed on my boundary even though it may have been a little silly, and she broke that trust.   


I put my clothes on and headed out to get some fresh air and think.  


I  know I chose here and not AITA, but you can tell me if I’m an asshole  or not, or if my wife is, etc. as it’s good to have other input on my  thoughts and reactions, but what I mostly want to know is some  strategies on how to handle this.

&amp;#x200B;

Additional info: I just found out that she may have fibbed in order to do damage control... Digging herself deeper... Turns out she got all the piercings at the same place and that the guy who did the vaginal piercing goes to her school. I do want to mention that I trust my wife and don't think she did anything sexual, I just think she couldn't control her desire to get what she wanted.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dhhj63/my_wife_got_her_vagina_pierced_and_didnt_tell_me/,relationship_advice,1051,353,0.0
huhaway,2019-10-13 19:20:05+00:00,My ex girlfriend[26F] sent my fiancé [25F] a sex tape of me[25M] and her.,"4 years back I dated a girl named Alyssa. Alyssa was incredibly toxic and manipulative. We broke up a half dozen times or so but she would always beg me to come back and I did. After two years of madness I finally broke it off with her for good and blocked her on everything. A little while afterwards I met my current girlfriend Denise. Denise is so much different than Alyssa. She’s selfless, kind, and honest. I thought Alyssa would track me down and beg me to take her back, but I didn’t hear from her until a month ago. 

She tracked down Denise’s  Facebook account and started chatting with her. Alyssa sent all sorts of nasty messages like how ugly and uneven her eyes are(she has minor ptosis) and taunting her by describing how sex with me was like. Denise blocked her right away and i consoled her. I thought it was over, but then Alyssa somehow found Denise’s email and sent sex tapes of me and Alyssa. Denise’s self confidence is tattered right now and I don’t know how to console her. 

In the tapes I was more vocal than I usually am with Denise.(I’m usually not that vocal in bed regardless of the girl I’m with, its just that Alyssa wanted me to dirty talk more for the camera) Denise is jealous that Alyssa is attractive and has larger breasts(Denise was a late bloomer and was bullied for parts of high school for being flat chested) and said that I looked like I was enjoying myself more with Alyssa than I do with her. 

There was also a second video which wasn’t just with me and Alyssa, but a threesome with me, Alyssa, and my friend Zoey. Zoey is actually a really nice person and we’re still friends. The problem is that Denise and Zoey know each other. I told Denise that I’ve hooked up with Zoey before and she was fine with it. However we didn’t really go into details and didn’t know I had sex with Zoey in threesomes with my ex girlfriend. Not only that, but I asked for a threesome in the past. Denise said no and that was the end of it, but now Denise thinks that Alyssa is better bed because she did things like threesomes and while she didn’t.

Denise is really upset right now and I don’t know what to do. I keep telling her she’s the best partner I’ve ever had and I’m with her for a reason. But she keeps asking rhetorical questions like was her pussy better? Did she give better head? How were the threesomes? I’ve given her some space(she asked for it), but how do I handle this later on? Should I contact Zoey? Should I contact Alyssa and tell her to knock it off? What do I say to Denise?

I didn’t say anything. I wanted to take a really good look before I did and check time stamps etc. So anyways, I come home from work. I see the phone and see my chance to go through his pictures. Instead......I see recent photos that he took the day before of ALL my info!!!! My debit card, credit card, some mail I had there, my ID, and a paystub. He did this completely without my knowledge and now it’s creeping me out. One picture was of a Best Buy bill I had but it was unopened so it was just the part with my address. The next morning I asked him if he’d seen a Best Buy bill somewhere because I was trying to pay it. He said he had seen some mail on the table but didn’t remember a Best Buy one. Clearly.. he did. So that was a straight lie. I’m trying to figure out a reasonable explanation for this. Like maybe is he trying to pay my credit card off but then why would he take a pic of my debit ?

ThrowRa6733,2019-10-13 12:01:56+00:00,I(M43) had a child with my best friend(F40) and my girlfriend(F45) can't cope with it,"My best friend Jen and I had a child 10 years ago. No one of us had found a life partner and Jen was diagnosed with something that would soon leave her infertile. We decided that we were going to have a kid together and I offered to pay for the IVF because I was the one from a wealthy family.

We had our beautiful baby boy and have been happy ever since. We haven't slept together or anything. We live in the same house. But the house is separated in 2 apartments with a big inside patio on the first floor.

This living arrangement works for us and we can raise our boy in a functional family.
3 years ago Jen met Roger who is an awesome guy and father of a daughter. So we do have a patch work family. Roger is a good bud of me Yada Yada.

One year ago Monica and I got together. I was very upfront about my living situation. And she said she was okay with is. Monica herself has 2 kids that I really do like very much.

So now to the problem.
Monica was really nice to Jen in the beginning. But I have been noticing that she is being more passive aggressive towards her. When we have big family outings, meaning taking all the kids to the zoo or a park, Monica does her best to alienate us from the group.

She gets mad when she comes to my place and Jen and I are sitting on the couch watching some sort of cop show. We don't even cuddle we just share a couch.

She gets mad when we take our son to a family trip to a theme park alone because she says it's weird.

She got super fucking mad when I was walking down with Monica to help her pack her car and placed a hand on her back because I was ""inappropriately touching another woman"".

I love Monica and I have tried to be reassuring that, despite me having a child with jen, I don't feel any sort of attraction toward her.

She has been pressuring me to move out which I don't want. The city we live in, is very expensive and the house I live in is all paid for. It's 2 apartments we have full privacy from each other. Jen and Roger also do their thing. I know this is a weird situation. But I have never tried to hide it. I have always been very honest about everything and also honest about my intentions to not moving.

Monica hasn't talked to me in days and I wonder if this relationship has run its course or if I have a shot at repairing it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dh9pcm/im43_had_a_child_with_my_best_friendf40_and_my/,relationship_advice,2115,548,0.0

I could accurately use any cliche in the book to describe this woman. My world went from black and white to color when I met her, she knows me better than I know myself, and I feel complete for the first time. 

We’ve been dating for two years. We’re planning to move in together. 

She’s never met my parents, and it’s starting to get weird. 

I keep putting it off, because I know my parents won’t like her. 

My parents have very antiquated views about what a woman should be and one of those things is thin. My girlfriend has an eating disorder, she is 5’2 and roughly 200 pounds. 

My family thinks if a woman is overweight it means she’s infertile, self centered (doesn’t care if her man finds her attractive), inactive, poor impulse control, and not a contributing member of society, I could go on and on. 

First of all, my girlfriend has been an athlete her whole life and competed at a national level all through college. She went to an Ivy League school, graduated with Latin Honors, and is the youngest person to ever have the job she has where she works. 

She’s unfucking believable. 

She’s so used to being the best and succeeding at things that her weight is a major sticking point for her and something she is very sensitive about. 

I don’t know how to handle it with my parents if they make a comment (they did it to my brother’s old girlfriend, no reason to believe it won’t happen again) or if they’re just generally hostile. 

I’ve told her my parents are from a different time and place and are very sexist and whether or not they like her will have no bearing on how I view her but I still don’t know how to handle this. 

My girlfriend really wants my family to like her since we’re going to move in together and I don’t know what to do about this. 

Usually we talk things out very directly but her eating disorder stems from a traumatic period in her life so discussing it has to be handled carefully and I’m not sure how to basically say “my parents are kind of morally bankrupt in some ways” without ruining any chance of a relationship between the three of them. 

Should I call my parents beforehand and tell them if they plan to be rude they’ll just never meet her? Or tell my girlfriend if something happens she has my blessing to say “go fuck yourself” and walk out? Or something else entirely? I’m freaking out about this. 

*tl;dr: My girlfriend is overweight, I don’t care at all, she wears it well and is a perfect 10. I’ve been putting off introducing her to my parents because I know they’ll make a huge deal out of it and embarrass her. We’re moving in together and I can’t put off introducing them.

I started thinking about it tonight and to make a long story short I said it made me uncomfortable. He responds with “I’m not deleting it. Stop talking about it.” He says that he doesn’t look at it so I shouldn’t care. I told him that the video and his insistence on keeping it makes me uncomfortable.

My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years. This summer she planned a 2 week trip to  Europe with her best friend and she told me she wanted to tale a break from our relationship while on her trip. I’m not stupid and I know what she meant, she even told me she wanted to be single for her trip then come back to me after. I broke up with her, like a real breakup. She still went on her trip and I thought that she had just gotten over me. She texted me when she got there and she was upset and told me that I broke up with her so I could see other girls.

Basically she was making herself the victim when this was all her fault. I told her she was being a hypocrite and that I wasn’t going to listen to ger bullshit and I was pissed. One of our mutual friends knew about what happened and she asked me to hang out at her place one night. I drank and smoked to try and clear my mind and she asked me to get in bed with her and I had sex with her.  When my girlfriend came back she started begging for me to take her back, but she found out about what happened.

She’s pissed obviously, but it’s not like she wasn’t sleeping around with other dude on ger “trip” so I wasn’t going to let her treat me like if I was a dumbass. She forgave me and is still pretty mad about it, but now I don’t know if I want to be in a relationship with someone like her anymore. Would I be a bad person to just bail on her after everything that happened?

My sexual preferences are pretty boring, I just like regular old vanilla stuff. His tastes are a little more adventurous. I’ve always said I’m happy to try anything once. Trouble is I’ve never enjoyed any of the things we’ve tried and I feel like I’m leaving him unsatisfied. He floated the idea of maybe seeing a sex worker to allow him to explore some of these kinks and I said maybe that was an option we could consider at some stage. We are in Australia where sex work is legal. 

Anyway, recently he went on a work trip to Italy for 10 days. He used the services of a local MtF sex worker. He didn’t tell me about it. We had sex the day he got home. A few days later I was feeling unwell and experiencing strange symptoms, went to the doctor and found out it was herpes. 

I confronted him about it and he admitted what he had done and that he had also noticed a spot/mark on his penis but ‘didn’t think anything of it’. 

I’m so upset that not only did he go ahead and sleep with someone without checking in with me, he also put my health at risk. The least he could have done was get an STD test afterwards. I’m also now wondering if he would have ever told me if he hadn’t been ‘sprung’. 

I’ve always tried to be accomodating and understanding of his needs so I don’t know why he felt the need to go behind my back. I now find it hard to trust him and I don’t know if I can have sex with him again. Is our relationship salvageable? Or are we just sexually incompatible?

Yup. Most of you were right. I'm glad I posted here because part of me felt like I was overreacting, which wasn't the case. He realized I was pretty pissed, and I sat down to talk with him. I told him if there was anything I should know, he should tell me now. He acted stupid. So I told him that if he had nothing to hide I wanted to see his phone, specifically their conversations. To my surprise he actually let me see it, but it was super obvious he deleted a lot. Sooo I went into their Facebook messenger chat and he got super nervous, so I already knew what I was going to find. Took him a few seconds before he grabbed his phone, and he confessed right after that. They 'only kissed' and it 'didn't mean anything'. My god I felt like I was going to explode. How can someone do this, so close to our anniversary too. I left and haven't talked to him since. Pretty sure they've been fucking behind my back for a while. It disgusts me, there have been a few times where we were together after he got back from the 'gym' or 'hanging out' with her. So I'm definitely getting tested very soon. Can't believe how that bitch could be so fake to me the entire time, him too ofcourse. I just don't understand why. Either I was the sidechick or she was, and I don't understand why she would be okay with either. 

I did sign up for the gym yesterday, so yay. She can have him, I don't want anything to do with him anymore. In a way she sort of inspired me to get fit I guess lol.

She has an upcoming doctors appt with a new doctor/practice so we planned to meet there. This is only to the initial appt to make sure we’re both comfortable with the new doc and our daughter does much better when we’re both there to support her. We also attend any behavioral school conferences together. If it’s a school project or regular check up, we’ll take turns going but anything major we both meet there. We want her to see that no matter what happened between us, we love her and support her together. 

I let my bf know about this upcoming appt and he is absolutely furious. He says that it looks like my ex and I are on “a date” and it’s an embarrassing thing to do to him. While I can understand him possibly feeling threatened or uncomfortable, I think he’s being incredibly immature. He doesn’t have kids so that’s another factor. He compares our coparenting to how his parents divorce played out, which was very nasty. “My parents never went to doctors appts together. You’re lying and seeing him behind my back.” He’s insisting that he go with us to any appt that we both attend and I think that would make my daughter and us all very uncomfortable, the exact opposite of our goal. 

He says he can’t be with someone who makes him look bad like this is doing. Is coparenting this way really making our relationship look bad?

He has no motivation in life. His grandpa gave him around $1500 for classes and he dropped all of them. I had the suspicion that he dropped all of his classes but he didn't admit to it until I asked how finals week was and he didn't know what I was talking about. I was extremely disappointed that he dropped every single one of his classes but he at least still had a job. He lost his job around early summertime and has been passively looking for a job since. I say passively because he's applying for jobs but not following up with any employers. I told him that if he's expecting to get an interview that he needs to follow up with the places he's applying to. His response is that he's never had to do that before but he's only worked minimum wage jobs before. I'll admit that I took a semester off but I'm at least working my ass off at my job to maintain a good income.

 I'm completely unnattracted to his lack of motivation. I feel like it's ruining our relationship because we are unable to go out on dates anymore or do anything. I caught the bill for a few months for the both of us on dates before realizing that I'm only enabling his lazy lifestyle. It is also extremely disappointing to me that he'll turn down a date because he's broke but then invite me over to smoke weed that he's bought.

At the beginning of this year we moved out to the country, as we both wanted to get away from the homeless problem in our city/near his house and to sell before it became too big an issue. While I enjoy country living, I still work in the city and have an 1.5 hr commute each way (so 3 hr total) every weekday. So we don't get a whole lot of time together during the week, and we pretty much never leave the house except for groceries because everything is a 30+ minute drive away. BF works ~20 hours a week, the rest of the time going to doctor's appointments or hanging around the house/working on his cars.

Last week his sister flew down from LA to handle some personal business and they've spent the past few days just cruising around having fun. Only thing is, all the fun stuff they're doing is stuff I've asked BF to do with me and he said no or dismissed.

We have a VERY popular swimming hole nearby that BF had already been to before. I asked to go there and he said it wasn't worth it and to not waste time with it. What do you know, his sister's first day here they go swimming there and when I get home at 7PM they regale me with how amazing it was.

There is a local farmer's market during the week that I can't make it to because it's during working hours (I've never been to a farmers market). I happened to have a required day off one day on a market day and asked if BF wanted to go with me. He said everything was overpriced and his parents gave us farm fresh stuff from their garden and animals anyways, and that it was probably mostly CBD peddlers and goats milk soap. Feeling really discouraged, I ended up not going, but spent time together otherwise. Her second day there I come home to a fridge full of fresh fruits/eggs/meat and a box on the counter with used cupcake liners inside. None for me. This was were I really started to get ticked off. 

We have almost all our meals at home, which can be draining as BF doesn't start making dinner/waits for me to start on dinner when I get home, leaving me barely enough time to cook it all and eat before having to go to bed. I've asked repeatedly if we can go out to eat if I'm not in the mood for all that rigmarole, but he just says that we have food and he can just cook it if I'm tired. It's not a bad compromise, but I've told him about cool restaurants around town and places I miss eating at in the city and he says when we have time we'll try them. And the past couple of days he's told me to just pick up some food  for myself because he and his sister are eating at the hip new gastro-pub next town over or at the winery near by's italian restaurant. Also, all that farm fresh meat and produce they bought at the farmers market is wasting away because they keep eating out.

Really my breaking point wasn't until last night. There is a cool little town about an hour away that I'd wanted to visit because my favorite candle factory is there and they have a well-regarded fall fest and famous BBQ spots. BF at least agreed a day trip out there would be fun, but that we could go out there once things started to 'settle down'. I've brought it up a couple times since then, but he keeps putting it off, declaring more important things take priority. Last night I came home from working late and they sheepishly tell me about their trip and how much fun the fall fest was, going through the corn maze, bobbing for apples and that they'd had dinner at the BBQ place and fed the leftovers to the dogs. They'd visited the candle factory, but didn't buy anything.

I'd had enough at that point and went to bed quietly, feeling really silly for being on the verge of tears over this. Since I also leave early in the morning I haven't had a chance to talk about my feelings, but I don't know how to handle it. Part of me feels like I'm making too big a deal about this. With me working and his sister being here I'm sure they would have included me if I could take the time off. 

And I know she came down here without any clear plans of what she wanted to do, so I'm sure all those things I keep pestering him about doing readily came to mind when he had free-time with his sister to spend, and my work/commute schedule makes it hard to do any of that. But that doesn't change how down on myself I'm feeling about this entire thing. Like for some reason I'm not good enough to do these things for, but when his sister comes into town he pulls out all the stops. Logically, I know there's not much to stop him from doing those things with me when we both have free time, and he doesn't get to see his sister often, but this entire thing has me twisted.

Am I right to be jealous? How do I discuss these feelings with BF in a reasonable way? I feel like my feelings are reasonable, but I'm not sure what I would have expected them to do as an alternative. 

TL;DR BF and I live out in the country. Due to my work schedule we don't get out much together, but when we have time he dismisses things I want to do. His sister came down to stay with us and he's taking her to do all the things I ask him to do, and now I feel intensely down on myself for it, and slightly jealous.

Nonix09,2019-10-11 08:54:39+00:00,"UPDATE: My (21m) girlfriend (20f) does not accept gifts from me but accepts from a ""friend""","Hi guys, this is an update of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dexzwc/my_21m_girlfriend_20f_does_not_accept_gifts_from/) that I sent 2 days ago.

I confronted my gf again two days ago and she was still giving silly excuses so I decided to contact the other guy on Instagram. I got his handle from the pictures where my gf tagged him and we got talking. 

I introduced myself as an admirer of my gf and the guy laughed and said I know who you are and that my gf is always saying that she is dating me. I felt embarrassed and I opened up to him and told him the whole situation. He then explained to me why she rejects my gifts - it turns out that her ex bf was abusive and manipulated her with gifts so she decided to never collect anything from any guy she is dating. Also I found out that he is her childhood friend and both of their families are so close and that the reason she refuses to date him is because she considers him a big brother. He then told me that I should talk things out with her and make her understand my point of view cos he thinks that her decision could hurt our relationship.

So last night, I had dinner with my gf after work and I brought up the topic again. She kept giving silly excuses till I told her about my conversation with her friend. She then broke down in tears and opened up to me about things her ex put her through and her fears that I will turn into him if she allows me buy her expensive gifts. She said she is sorry and she doesn't want us to break up but she doesn't know any other way to prevent me from changing and becoming manipulative.

Long story short, we made up and she promised to accept gifts from me and I also promised to not become possessive or manipulative or even reference gifts I get for her if we fight.

I'm really glad I didn't just end things without trying to make up cos I was so close to doing that.

I'm grateful to everyone on this subreddit for their comments and advice.

Had to use a throwaway account because a lot of my friends know my Reddit username. Basically, in complete shock right now. My girlfriend of two years started distancing herself from me. She'd always say she isn't in the mood to cuddle or hang out. She would eat dinner without me. I thought she was just going through a phase. However, I decided to talk about it, at first she was being vague in her responses and denying any changed behaviour. After a lot of persuasion she finally opened up. She said she doesn't feel happy in our relationship and wants to break up. The main reason she said was that 'I don't have an apple phone anymore'. When we met in Uni, I had an Apple phone, our relationship made heavy use of Apple-specific features like Facetime and iMessage. My (ex)girlfriend said that once I got an android phone, we stopped facetiming and imessaging as much as we used too (we don't live together, but sleep over on the weekends but would video call on the weekdays most days). She believes that I prioritized better technology over her and wanted to distance myself from her, and so she broke up with me. We started using more of Facebook Messenger or Whatsapp to video call, but she said its just not the same. I apologized and denied that I changed phones for that reason.  However, she was set on breaking up. Fast forward, to a week later, she called me saying we can get back together if I get an Apple phone. I'm at a loss of words right now, I can't believe my girlfriend won't let me use my current Samsung phone if I want to stay with her. Using an android phone is SO much better than Apple, and I feel selfish that part of me doesn't want to give up my phone for her? I love her but why can't she see past this? What should I do, she doesn't seem to listen to any reason

WEN_44,2019-10-10 22:40:18+00:00,Brother has hated me since birth 20+ years,"The title says it all

We are both now in our twenties but his immature sibling hatred for me had never gone away. 
Shortly after I was born, he asked my parents when I was going back to the hospital, which isn’t unusual for young children when they get a new sibling. But when I was around 4 months old, he tried to rip my face off with has bare hands which is unusual for a toddler (he was 3 at the time).

From then on, it just got worse. He would actively go out of his way for my entire childhood to hit me, and steal things from me, and to this day, still hates me. For many years I would give him money just to leave me alone and be nice to me. Now that I am an adult I understand that’s now a relationship works. For most of our childhood, our parents had to keep us completely separated because he hated me so much and was unhappy when I was around. Our parents have tried to be as fair as they can with us, but it doesn’t do anything. My father was fairly abusive towards our family and didn’t really care what he did to me, and my mother loves him too much to do anything about it.
He hated me so much that when our parents got divorced, he went to live with our dad solely because he can’t bear to be around me (even though he also hates our father). 
We are both now in Our twenties, and although I barely see him (maybe once a year), I can still tell that he is physically and emotionally uncomfortable being in the same room as me or even speaking to me. I’ve been nice to him my entire life and I don’t know what ever went wrong. Everyone always said he would grow out of it when I was younger and I know that it’s common for siblings to hate each other as children but he always hated me significantly more than any other siblings I had ever met, and  it’s been 20+ years and nothing has changed. 

I know this is on relationship advice but I’m not really looking for advice rather seeing if anyone else has experienced something like this. I’ve never seen or heard of anything like it and it breaks my heart because he is some of the only family I have and hates my guts for no reason. Has this happened to anyone else, and if so, do you have an explanation for it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dg5t7v/brother_has_hated_me_since_birth_20_years/,relationship_advice,1011,142,0.0
throwaway5484142,2019-10-10 18:49:33+00:00,"[M25] Relationship issues because I'm ""too nice""?","This is literally the second time a long-term relationship has failed where my girlfriend says ""this is going to sound weird but you're too nice"". So I think it is a pretty big issue for me and I could use an outside opinion on what I should change.

Some background: I'm pretty easy going, don't think I've ever yelled at someone (outside of my family), don't really get in fights or heated arguments with people. Probably too non-confrontational. I think it's partly because I was raised having to just ""roll with it"" and partly because that's just my personality. 

I don't care about being first, or always getting the best item or seat or bang for my buck or whatever. If we're at a restaurant and my food comes out wrong, I'll eat it. It's not that I'm gritting my teeth and ""suffering through it""; it just doesn't bother me enough to the point where I'd ask them to remake my food. If the food is terrible I'm not going to complain to the manager and get comped for the meal; I just won't come back to the restaurant again.

If we're deciding what to do for the evening, and my girlfriend wants to do one thing and I want to do a different thing, I'm perfectly happy agreeing with her and doing what she wants. I know I'll be happy doing pretty much anything with her, so I'd rather have her have fun too than try to force her to do what I want. 

Those are all kind-of trivial examples, but it does manifest in some bigger relationship issues as well.

For example, throughout our relationship we've both expressed that we want to have kids someday (keep in mind it would be 3+ years away at the earliest). But recently she's changed her mind and is pretty against the idea of kids now. I told her that's okay, if she doesn't want kids then we won't have kids; I'm not going to force her to have kids if she doesn't want them. But then she says this is an example of me just doing whatever she says and not what I want. 

I'm not sure what I could have said though? ""I hope you change your mind because that's a dealbreaker for me""? But the truth is, it's not a dealbreaker for me. I'd much rather be with her than have kids with someone else. But how do I express that without making it seem like I'm just a doormat? Or am I just a doormat?

Does anyone have experience from the opposite point of view, where your partner always just enjoys going with what you want? And how that is frustrating for you or what things you'd like to see your partner do instead?

TLDR Relationship issues because I often times agree with my partner rather than argue ""my side"". But I usually don't even feel that strongly about my own opinions, so I feel like it'd be arguing for the sake of arguing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dg2j7a/m25_relationship_issues_because_im_too_nice/,relationship_advice,1035,295,0.0

She had a date with Phillip lined up for Tuesday after weeks of talking. 

Phillip is a  millionaire “T-shirt” company owner in San Diego in the process of selling his company.  He has plans to move from San Diego to Smalltown southern US. He loves beach sports that can only be done in the ocean and does them everyday. 

The area he is moving to is land locked, middle lower income with no beach/water sports and the nearest moderately large town is an hour away. Still no beach. 

He had to cancel the date because he has urgent business in Jamaica and Barbados. He also needs to sell his house in California so he isn’t available for two more weeks. 

She sent me pictures of him so I did what anyone would do and zoomed in and dissected the pics. 
I looked up the company and this is what I found out. 

He is not nor has he ever been the owner and no one named Phillip has ever owned the company. 

The man in the picture is on that company website but when I called, he hasn’t worked there in over two years. Nor has anyone named Phillip EVER worked there. 

The original owner still works for the company as a consultant and they were kind enough to call him and ask him. 

They declined to tell me “Phillip’s “ real name since he is no longer an employee but his picture is still up because it is a great product shot. 

The owner of the company and past owner are both married and their wives work with them. 

*Drumroll*.......She has never video chatted with him. 

They have never met and he is talking about marriage. 

She says he is like no other man and could not be dirty like other men. 

I wonder if I should tell her. Of course she will be upset and devastated. I mean it’s not my business maybe.  She has access to the same internet I do. She is choosing to trust him. 

She may get mad. And don’t tell me if she is a real friend that she wouldn’t do that. You know how people lash out when hurt. I don’t want her to get blindsided but then again,  we could all be more proactive now days.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dfy4bc/my_friend_is_being_catfished_should_i_tell_her/,relationship_advice,1028,247,0.0

It's caused major issues with his ex.,"Three nights ago it was my partner's night to have his son over. We normally have him every second weekend, however, his mother was just running late at work and had to stay back a little longer at the hospital. So she asked my partner to fetch Jake from school. The plan was we were going to have him until 8pm and then she'd pick him up. 

Around 6pm came and we heard Jake let out a scream. He came running to me crying as I was going to his room to see what happened. His hand was just gushing blood. He was understandably hysterical. Our house is fairly old, but it has been done up. It still has those type of windows you lift up and down. It was windy and it somehow slammed shut in his hand. 

My partner literally turned and ran back to the kitchen when he saw Jake's hand. At first I thought he was going to get the first aid kit. I told Jake to come with me to the kitchen. I look out the window and my partner is in the back on the garden staring off into the trees. I got a better look at Jake's hand and figured we better go to the hospital. 

I start calling my partner and he's ignoring me. I go outside to tell him we need to go, and he just started telling me he can't deal with blood and he'd stay here. I said that I didn't have time for this and took Jake to the hospital. He had to have stitches and a cast put on his hand. It was absolutely messed up. 

His mother arrived and she noticed that his father wasn't there. She started to ask me where he was. Jake chimed in saying that his dad didn't come. She turned to me and asked what he was talking about. She then put it together that he didn't call her and I did. She noticed he wasn't there. To say she was angry was an understatement. 

My partner is just kinda cowering now and he just keeps telling me that Mary is the paramedic. She can deal with gore and he can't. The problem is they never had a formal custody agreement because they were on such good terms, but now Mary is asking how she can trust he won't run away if Jake gets a worse injury because my partner feels sick at the sight of blood.

ronmexicosburner,2019-10-09 19:35:15+00:00,I (M25) caught my GF (F25) of two years cheating but she doesn't think it's cheating. She called it a transaction...,"For the last few months I have been living a lie. It turns out my girlfriend of two years has been cheating on me for at least four months. For a relationship that had been through so much, I thought we were able to overcome some of the low points. Together we were able to overcome that she has a child from a previous relationship and the embarrassing fact that I had to get a prescription from forhims (I’m only 25).To the point that she even started letting me leave it at her place (which is problematic now because my last three boxes are still at her place). 

A few months ago she explained to me that she was going to have to be traveling a lot more for work, and while she was upset about it, it was ultimately going to be a great opportunity for her to get another promotion. I too was a bit upset about this since I had just moved into her apartment and got a dog together. None the less I was still happy and supporting of the fact she was working towards a promotion. 

As she started to travel I was getting a little jealous of my girlfriend as she got to travel to DC, Miami, and Chicago in a 6 week this summer. On top of that when she was in DC and Chicago she got to go to Wrigley and see the nationals play. She said the clients that she was seeing had taken her to the games. These seats that she was getting weren’t bad either. For the game at Wrigley field she even got to sit behind homeplate. 

This is was an exciting time for both of us. She was doing great in work, we had an adorable dog together, and when she would get back from the road the sex was unbelievable. Nothing was out of bounds, there were no safe words. To say that we experimented with each other’s bodies was an understatement. She opened me up and exposed me to things I would have never considered like being pegging (It is shockingly empowering). 

I didn’t really feel like anything was amiss until she went on her trip to Miami for work. In the entire build up to her leaving that Monday it was like we were in the honeymoon phase of our relationship again. We hardly left the apartment all week, let alone bed. We were in the throes of passion it was pure bliss. 

This was the longest trip she was going to be taking. She was going to be gone Monday to Friday. Typically she would be traveling for only a few days at a time. She was gone that Monday morning before I woke up, taking an uber to the airport, I just had a single text from her “I’ll text you when I get settled” with a heart emoji. 

The two of us are in constant contact like true millennials nothing we do; we don’t not share with each other. So it was a little alarming when she went radio silent for the first two days of her trip. I was in a pure panic. Did something happen to her? Should I be worried? Do I need to call her parents, the police? I was wondering if I should even travel down there to go see if she was okay. 

Thankfully sanity prevailed and I didn’t go in search of her, and in her own time she finally responded and explained how busy she was the first day. And that she had unexpectedly seen some friends from college on the second night.  All was back to being right in the world, and the rest of her time away went by without a hitch. Needless to say I was thrilled for her to come back.

As the door to our apartment opened and she came in looking like her beautiful just more tan self I was instantly smitten. I rushed over to giver her a kiss, and she turned her head to the side and my lips ended buried in her hair. Weird I thought but maybe she is just tired it was a long day after all. 

The rest of the evening continued with this theme of her being distant and distracted by her phone. This wasn’t the girl that I had known and fallen in love with after swiping right on her tinder profile two years ago. As she went to our dog Lang out for walk, she left her phone out on the kitchen table. I am not proud of what I did next but I unlocked her phone and started to snoop. 

What I found was earth shattering. Turns out the travel was not work related at all, she had a sugar daddy that she meet on internet. She was traveling with a very well-off lawyer and going to all of these events with him. Her texts with him read like pure smut. It was degrading and vile. It was clear that she no longer loved me. 

Her and the dog returned and I asked her if we could have a conversation. She sat down on the couch and I took a seat next from her and I ask her to explain who “Laurence” is. She immediately went pale, and her bottom lip started to quiver. Through stammering and tears she tried to explain that they didn't have sex. But she would let him grind on her butt until he came and one time she gave him a handjob. 

She went on to try and explain all of this was to pay for her bills and pay for things for her kid. The kid isn't in her life a lot because the dad has majority custody but she still pays for things for him. Even though they didn't have Sex, and she viewed it as purely a transaction, I still feel like I can never trust her again. The only words I could muster were “Peyton how could you do this to me”. Not a lot of words were said after that as I quickly grabbed a few things and Lang.

I currently sit here writing this back at my mom’s. I packed un small bag of stuff and I brought the dog and his toys. I haven’t really talked to her since and she hasn’t really gone out of her way to contact me, which leads me to believe what I know that she thinks this is over.

I know this may be crazy to write but I still love her. Should I try and work this out with her? Do you guys think it's cheating if she saw it as a transaction and something she had to do to provide?

I wanted to thank everyone who commented on my previous post for giving me the strength to get out of that situation right away, you guys probably saved me from years of abuse. I just wanted to let you know how everything is going.

I texted the police after reading the comments and was able to get away from him safely. I went to the police station but I was having trouble breathing so I was taken to the hospital. They suggested a rape kit which I did. I don't know if I will press charges yet. 

I called a friend (same one I went to the movies with) and told him what happened. I really couldn't tell anyone else. I am currently staying with him (he has a spare room) and took some time off work. He has been amazing, taking care of me and driving me around, I will be forever grateful to him. 

I don't know how long it will take for me to stop feeling like shit, and honestly I don't even know if I want to go back to the police station and say what happened for the millionth time, but at least I am out of that situation.

I am still confused and don't know how to feel. I know it's horrible to say but I still love him. He's been calling and texting me. And his version of the events is so different from mine that I don't know what to believe.

dinosaurlegs27,2019-10-08 18:46:26+00:00,My Girlfriend wont stop leaving rubber bands EVERYWHERE,"I know this sounds ridiculous and like a non issue but it is driving me crazy. My girlfriend takes home rubber bands from work every single day. Sometimes dozens of them. She leaves them everywhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

**A few examples:**

I go to shift my car into drive and there are always a bunch of rubber bands tied around my shift stick. I have a new car with a nice leather shifting thing and there's always fucking rubber bands tied around it. I take them off and tell her not to put them there but lo and behold I'll see them there again later.

&amp;#x200B;

Just a second ago what set me off to write this post.. I was pouring hot sauce on my breakfast and fucking rubber bands fell of the hot sauce container (they were around the bottle) and almost landed in my fucking food.

&amp;#x200B;

They are always laying around on counters and tied around other shit like inanimate objects throughout the house. 

&amp;#x200B;

I find them on the ground all of the time..

&amp;#x200B;

I told her to stop brining them home but it doesn't stop. She's even building a ball out of them now.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how much longer it will be until I build a god damn rubber band noose and hang my self from the rubber band rafters.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/df4adt/my_girlfriend_wont_stop_leaving_rubber_bands/,relationship_advice,1003,176,0.0
ThrowRALoveless,2019-10-08 14:40:07+00:00,UPDATE: My [24M] boyfriend [27M] has turned into an anime character and I'm not sure what to do anymore.,"Original post for context: https://removeddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dbcfke/my_24m_boyfriend_27m_has_turned_into_an_anime

Saying the last couple of days was wild would be an understatement. That same day I made the original thread I stuck true to my word and talked to him about this during dinner. I made his favorite in order to ease the blow but I essentially came at him with the most blunt but nice way I could put it (thanks to the help of you lovely people). I basically told him that I'm happy that his life has improved drastically since this change but I really do miss who I originally fell in love with and I wasn't sure I could keep this charade up. There was a lot of crying from myself only and he kept his cool and composure as Soubi would. In all honesty it made me more upset. Our fights, although rare, would sometimes turn into a shouting match because he'd usually get really upset and fire back at me. Now he's calm, gentle, understanding, and it progressively upset me more and more. Yet he continued comforting me which only made it worse. It's weird how you when you love someone you even miss the bad parts about them when they go away.

After a while I calmed down. The two biggest takeaways from the conversation were that even if he found someone who was fictionkin to Ritsuka he wouldn't leave me for them because that was another life and, in this life, he has me now. This is important later. The second was that he himself felt that all his life he was putting on a mask and only behaving as people expected him to; including me. He claims he never really felt 100% truly comfortable in his own skin and this awakening was like a switch that needed to be turned on and now he feels like himself for the first time in his entire life. He then told me he understands that I signed up to date the man I fell in love with not Soubi and he wouldn't blame me for leaving. 

I couldn't blame him either. The truth is I know what that feels like. I was raised a very sheltered life and didn't really have a personality because of it. I only started coming out of my shell during my college years when I moved out of state to live on my own. I still find the fact it took a cartoon for this to finally make him realize that really concerning and I still didn't like that it was such a drastic change and I worry about his mental health. He assures me he is fine. I slept on it and I felt moderately better the next day. I decided at that point I was going to just try and change my perspective and adjust to this life. I love the guy. I want to at least try and make it work.

Over the next few days my distain for this Soubi thing died down. I was starting to feel attracted to him again. I started really liking how sweet and soothing he'd become. I'd get twinges of missing the old him here and there but as days went on it definitely became easier to move on from them now and focus on my new life now.

Then... Sunday night happened.

On Saturday afternoon he came home work and told me that he'd like me to meet some of his new friends that he's made over the last several months. He told me that a lot of them are just like him. They are kin to some type of animal, spirit, fictional character or they're transgender and it's like a support group in a way. It was a lot to throw at me but I decided, hey, I might as well see these other people like him so I can understand their culture better. He was happy and immediately got on his phone to message the discord group they have. The plan was to have people over tomorrow night for dinner and he wanted to cook.

Sunday rolls around and he told me that only one of them can make it. No big deal. I played a little bit of Spyro as he cooked. His guest finally showed up sometime during the evening and I went to answer the door. The person I see before me is this really young... how can I put this. They were somewhat of an androgynous mess. I couldn't tell if they were a boy or a girl. They were this weird in-between. I later found out they were a female to male transgender man so, for the sake of making this easier, I'll be referring to them as male. He makes me eye contact with me when I open the door. He's glancing to the side clearly way too shy to even look in my general direction. I ask him his name and mumbles it. I didn't ask again and just invited him in. My boyfriend greets him with... a pat on the head. Weird. This guy just stands idlely leaning on the banister in the hallway still looking like he hates being here. Also weird. I invited him to come sit on the couch with me and play Spyro while my boyfriend finishes cooking. He sat down and said nothing just watching the screen as I played. I offered him the controller but he brushed it off. He just watched and nothing more. He didn't even pull out a cellphone or anything like most kids his age would do. I mean, hell, I'm in my mid 20s and I'm addicted to my phone.

My boyfriend finished cooking and we all sat down to eat. His guest would not talk to me at all, but every time he spoke to him he would illicit some type of response from his guest. What bothered me was how flirtatious it all seemed. My boyfriend would make remarks like, ""You'd be even cuter if you smiled more,"" or how he would love to him more lively like he is when they hang out. His guest didn't really say anything but his face would often say it all. It was a mixed bag of embarrassment but liking it at the same time. I was confused and I felt really uncomfortable. He tried to encourage his guest to talk to me and tell me about himself but he wouldn't say anything other than what high school they were going to. Yes, high school. First red flag.

After dinner we decided to sit on the couch and watch a movie together. I sat next to boyfriend, obviously, but his guest sat next to him on the other side and I don't mean just casually sitting next to him. I mean he was as close as I was with their hips touching. Second red flag. As I was fidgeting with the menus my boyfriend was trying to comfort his guest. He was talking to him about how he shouldn't be afraid of me, that he can relax in our home, and was petting his head and stroking his hair. Third red flag. I was really not liking this at all and getting increasingly more upset. I went to grab my phone to distract myself and that's when I noticed that my boyfriend was holding his guest's hand and was gliding his thumb on the back of this dude's hand!

I flipped. And when I say I flipped I mean I legitimately got up and yelled, ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!"" My boyfriend sighed. He said he was hoping me andhis guest could have hit it off better but it was clear his guest wasn't ""ready."" What kind of fucking response is that?! I was fuming. I said I didn't care about that and wanted to know why he was flirting with an underage kid much less with anyone other than me! His guest bolted out the door by this point. My boyfriend stood up, faced me, but kept his eyes looking at the floor apologizing, saying he had this whole idea planned out and asked me to calm down so he could explain it. I put on a mask and pretended I calmed down but I was still fucking furious.

Apparently this guest of his, this 17 year old female to male transgender kid, was someone from his friendship circle that is fictionkin to Ritsuka; Soubi's 12 year old lover from the anime. There was never any intention of seeing anyone else; at least not yet. His plan was to get me to hit it off with this fucking kid, have a few more get togethers done, and he would then propose the idea of starting a polyamorous relationship with him, me and my boyfriend once I grew closer to the kid so I'd be more open to it. I felt fucking sick to my stomach. All I could see was red. I was screaming and yelling at my boyfriend for lying to me about his true intentions, that even if I were okay with poly the kid is underage, and he's sick for grooming a child like that.

In his defense he did apologize for trying to trick me. However he started making excuses saying he wasn't grooming the kid, he was expressing the same love he always gave Ritsuka, the same love he gave Semei (Soubi's original lover in the anime) that Semei told him to give Ritsuka should anything happen to him, and he would never take advantage of him and would wait until he is ready, that he was turning 18 soon anyway, etc. I told him that's not okay. He's late 20s and shouldn't be trying to date fucking high schoolers! He had the audacity to say that age is just a number and I damn near put my hand through a fucking wall... I'm sorry. I'm getting way too angry remembering all this. But I don't want to rewrite it. I had take a few deep breaths to finally get even close to speaking levels again. I then asked him what happened to the whole, ""You'd never leave me for a Ritsuka fictionkin"" thing. He assured me again he still wouldn't ultimately leave me for someone else but reminded me about the other day when he told me that he still misses Ritsuka and he thought maybe we could all be together. 

He wanted the best of both worlds. I feel betrayed and manipulated. The more and more I replay what happened the more I begin to suspect the people who claimed he was abusing me were right. I went upstairs, packed up a duffle bag with some essentials, and left the house, got in my car, and made the 18 hour trip to my parent's house. He never once tried to stop me. I think he understands the gravity of what he did. The only thing I got from him was a text message saying he was sorry. When I got to my parent's house I gave them the cliff notes version; Something happened, I haven't slept since Saturday night, and I need crash. It's 7:30 am and I'm now mustering up the courage to get out of bed tell my folks everything that happened.

I've calmed down after sleeping but I still don't know what I'm going to do. In all honesty I may not even provide another update. Doing this was more of a cathartic thing than it was seeking for advice and because I was asked to make an update.

Thank you for all of those who gave me such helpful advice. I think I'm going to just move on, break up with him, and find someone who isn't fucking deranged. I love you all. I wish you all good health and happiness in your futures.

My fiancée, quite graphically, cheated on me while on vacation and now I have nothing.

We have a son together and I love him more than anything in the world. He's my best friend, and now we're never going to have a 'normal' relationship ever again. 

I'm currently sat in my car, not knowing where to go; what to do. 

I don't want to live this.

ThrowRAinnoconfused,2019-10-07 22:31:55+00:00,UPDATE I (36m) was falsely accused by my gf's (29f) son (7m) of molesting him and she won't accept I don't want to now be with her?,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dd36oo/i_36m_was_falsely_accused_by_my_gfs_29f_son_7m_of/

I want to thank you all your your advice, well wishes and criticism. 

This is an update on 2 fronts. 

Firstly, I met up with my gf. She rang me and and I answered and asked if we could meet Sunday night. Normally I'd not answer but because she had it from a withheld number and I was pissed, I said yeah alright. 

When she came around, I was all set to be guns blazing and tell her to fuck off. But when I saw her, I felt all emotional and broke down - she did too. We hugged really well, and she kept on saying how awful I looked and how much weight I'd lost. 

She apologized and kept apologising profusely. She said she had to report me on the basis that her son looked so in distress and she couldn't not report it as a mother. But she said she in hindsight knew I wouldn't be capable of what he said I did, and she hasn't been sleeping or thinking straight of what I could be going through. Apparently once her so admitted to the police it wasn't me and it was his cousin, the police got a confession out if her nephew and he said he was molested himself do he was only doing what happened to him. I couldn't try and be all nice and understanding, and I said I couldn't give a fuck - she seemed quite stunned by this, but as she could see I was really distressed she didn't argue the point. 

Basically she said she wanted to know where we go from here and that she loved me so much and that she wanted to know if I could move on from it. She also had a letter from her son - basically he's been really poorly and he was so upset about what he said I'd did and asked if I'd read it. 

I don't know what happened at this point, but I got really angry. I said I couldn't read his letter. She got all pissed and said that he's only a kid, and he's been struggling so much - did our little relationship mean so little to me? I felt so fucking blind sided, and said that it wasn't my fault he accused me of being a Paedo. After a lot of arguing, raised voices and hurt feelings I said I'd take the letter but couldn't promise I'd want to reply - I mean his accusation is going to likely ruin my career. She said she was done at this point, but stressed how much she loved me and asked if I could ever forgive them. I said I couldn't promise. She also felt awful that I was likely losing my job the next day.  We hugged it out, kissed and left it there. 

On the subject of my work, it's bittersweet. 

I arrived there for my meeting and briefly seeing my colleagues, they were treating me like shit.  One woman who's been like my work mum and mentor, was looking down her nose instantly. I tried to talk to her and she just walked off mid conversation. Several others were all looking at me as if I'm the worst human being ever. 

When I got into the meeting, it looked as if I was just going to be sacked and that was it. But I'm a pretty good negotiator, and I managed to beat them back to being not to blame at all. Basically, we argue a deal where I resign, but they agree to give me a great reference. They also pay me in full for September, October, and give me a £1000 ""car bonus"" so I can buy myself a car. I'm due to go in and formally accept this Thursday. 

It's horrible because I've had to resign after 5 works of hard work and training, and cut ties with a place where I really gave it my all and I felt like I had a future. All because I've done nothing wrong. 

Tldr me and my partner have talked, we're not in a good place and I'm out my job but have a decent reference.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/deqyic/update_i_36m_was_falsely_accused_by_my_gfs_29f/,relationship_advice,18529,2052,0.0
Vioprof,2019-10-07 21:32:48+00:00,[UPDATE]I [21F] am trying to breakup with my girlfriend [19F] but she threatened to send a sexually explicit video of us to my parents.,"Hello everyone! Title kind of explains the situation, but here is a link to my original post if you haven't read it [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/ddp9up/i\_21f\_am\_trying\_to\_breakup\_with\_my\_girlfriend\_19f/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ddp9up/i_21f_am_trying_to_breakup_with_my_girlfriend_19f/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

First of all, I want to say thank you to everyone that commented, because every single person that told me to call the police was 100% right. I was nervous to do this at first, but it paid off.

Last night, after I finished freaking out, I knew I had to sit down with my parents and tell them what happened. I was scared, not because they had a problem with me being gay, but because who wants their parents to see them fucking? Not cool. Besides, if she could sent it to my parents, she would have zero issues sending it to anyone. I was honest with them, and they took my side. I told them I wanted to leave her, and they backed me up and sat with me as I composed a message essentially telling my now ex-girlfriend I had proof of her trying to blackmail me, and I was going to the police if she tried to send that video. I had my parents call her from their phones, telling her not to contact them. Best parents ever, seriously. But she started blowing up my phone, begging me to take her back. She was apologizing and saying she would never send videos of me to anyone. Yeah, okay. I blocked her immediately. She's insane and I deserve better than that shit.

Despite all the action I took to protect myself, I didn't feel like what I did was enough. I was past scared and I was just pissed off that she tried to use this against me. I did some research and from everyones comments, its obviously super illegal so I called the 24 hour non emergency line for my city, and after explaining the story, an officer came out to my house to take down my info and hear what happened. I showed him a few of the texts and he had officers GO TO HER FUCKING HOUSE. She called me from some weird ass text free number, and continued to blow up my phone apologizing for everything and begging me not to press charges. I decided not to but I just ghosted her. Some people may find that stupid, but she learned her lesson. We are over for good. She's blocked on everything and she's out of my life and I feel better than I have in 2 years (The length of our relationship).

Moral of the story is never ever EVER allow someone to force you into something or blackmail you. Fuck that. If you find yourself in this situation, you have to get ahead of it. CALL THE POLICE! I almost waited and you guys told me not to so thank you so much for everything. Feel free to PM me with any questions or anything.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/deq5et/updatei_21f_am_trying_to_breakup_with_my/,relationship_advice,1086,61,0.0
ouijamate,2019-10-07 17:59:04+00:00,Took my 3 month old and left while my fiancé was sleeping,"I feel like I’m at a loss right now. I really don’t even know where to begin but I’ll try my best. Over the last few weeks here and there, my fiancé has stayed out really late with his friends after work, coming home in the early hours of the morning. He is a bartender so he usually gets off around 11pm during the week, 2am-4am on weekends. I’ve noticed a pattern but every time I would say something it was always turned around to be my fault. He is fully supporting us right now and uses that as an excuse that he needs guy time after work. It’s to the point I have believed he is right and we make up, go about our life. Yesterday he worked a double at the bar and got cut around 6pm. He sent me a text asking if it was ok if he met up with a friend for a drink. I had absolutely no problem with that, it was going on 6:30pm. 10:30pm rolls around and he sends a text saying “sorry I’m basically babysitting (his friend) I’m on my way home.” An hour goes by and he isn’t home. I got a little worried and sent a text, he responded with a weird typo. It kind of freaked me out because he said an hour ago he was in the Uber on the way home- now a weird typo after he never showed up. I called him. He answers and is still downtown with his friends. It’s going on 11:40 on at this point- I lost my shit on him and basically said “you are 33 years old, you have a fiancé and baby at home what are you doing?” He got mad after explaining he just wanted to get a few beers with his close friend he hadn’t seen in awhile. It’s 6 hours after he “got a drink” and I explained that’s more than enough time to get a beer, and that he had said he was on his way home over an hour ago. He kept turning it around on me that I was acting insane- that there was nothing wrong with what he was doing. We sent several long texts back and forth- his drunk friend is calling me saying it was his fault my fiancé is still out at the bar and he wasn’t doing anything behind my back and they needed guy time. They come home around 2:30 am- my fiancé is on the couch with a blanket. I walk out and stand there- asking what the fuck is going on. He starts screaming and literally says “I hate coming home, I don’t even want to be around you anymore because you make such a big deal about me being out with a friend.” He also says “I’m so tired of this bullshit boring life we live, we never do anything anymore, all you do is sit at home and do the same thing everyday” “we never have sex, you don’t have any friends.” He also brought up that he makes all the money and he is always working to support us. I responded back saying “I stay home and take care of our 3 month old, I clean this house spotless everyday, I take care of the 3 dogs we have, im trying my best” He honest to god responds saying “are you really that incapable of taking care of a baby” “it’s not that hard” “I’m actually doing all the hard work bringing in money to support us.” I stood there speechless. I didn’t even know how to respond, and the things he had said were the most hurtful things I have ever heard. I have even gone to the doctor to get prescribed medication for ppd because it is now in my head I am so terrible to be around and our arguments are my fault. All I had asked of him was to come home to his family and that going out shouldn’t be more of a priority. Like I said, I don’t mind if he hangs out with his friends, he needs to, we all do, but staying out and staying “I’m on my way home” and not showing up isn’t ok. I felt like the smallest person in the world. I started packing bags and after awhile he caught on and said “this isn’t how it works, you aren’t just going to leave with the baby.” I looked at him and said “you can’t even stand to come home to me, and I’m the baby’s mother so yes he is coming with me.” He said “we have a 4 bedroom house, stay in one of the bedrooms.” At this point I was beyond over it, I knew the same thing would happen like it always does, we’d sleep in separate rooms, wake up the next day, eventually talk about what happened and I’d take the blame. I’d be the crazy woman who gets mad that her fiancé wanted to go out with friends and I was over reacting, he supports us so he deserves to stay out. He fell asleep on the couch (he had drank a lot downtown and he’s a heavy sleeper) and I left with the baby. I got a motel room off our exit. Keep in mind we live in the ghetto (up and coming area) of our city, our house is nice but the motels on the exit are absolutely terrible- a lot of prostitution, drugs, just dirty. I found what I could afford and brought towels / blankets from home so my son wouldn’t touch the sheets or bed. We aren’t in danger- probably in the nicest motel I could find over here. The man working the front desk could tell I had been crying and put us in a safe room right near the lobby- inside the building instead of outside. At this point I don’t know what to do from here. I don’t want to reach out to my fiancé because a part of me feels like I had every reason to be upset with him. Another part of me feels like I really am terrible to live with- be around now. Sorry this is such a long post but I feel like I’ve hit a wall and can’t go up from here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/den3ts/took_my_3_month_old_and_left_while_my_fiancé_was/,relationship_advice,1171,149,0.0
Lynette713,2019-10-07 13:45:32+00:00,My (29F) mother (59F) has extreme gender bias when it comes to grandchildren and keeps pressuring me to get pregnant,"My mother has been wanting a grandchild for some time. I had a very bad experience being pregnant about five years ago that could have killed me, so while I will still attempt to have a child eventually, I want to make sure that I am physically, mentally, and financially prepared for it, as my OBGYN states that the condition will most likely occur every pregnancy. 

She has massive baby fever and keeps bugging me about it. I usually brush her off or tell her my feelings about it, but it doesn't help. I tell her that she is not asking for some small thing from me. She is also dismissive of the fact that I went through something traumatic with the first pregnancy.

What's worse, she wants a GRANDDAUGHTER. She has deep seated issues with men. My poor younger brother (18M) knows that she wanted him to be a girl. When my niece was pregnant, my mother kept shouting ""girl!"" at the baby shower (niece wanted to wait until birth to know the gender). 

My SO and I don't care what the gender is, as long as it's healthy.

Senaeth,2019-10-07 08:03:49+00:00,My parents are saying I should not date my gf because she's deaf-mute,"This is a long one, sorry about that, tl;dr at the bottom

I (m26) relatively recently (9 months ago) have come out of another relationship where I caught my now ex in bed with another man. I ended that relationship then and there and returned the engagement ring I had bought the next day.

Then after 3 months of moping around some friends set me up on a date with a girl. That girl turned out to be deaf-mute, but with my limited knowledge of sign language, her lip reading and our phones we made it work. It was one of the most fun dates I've had ever and both me and her agreed to another date and I instantly felt an amazing connection to this girl.

We are now dating for almost 5 months and I know now that I am in a way better relationship than I have been before. I am pretty sure to say that she is the one for me and we've been progressing slowly but surely in our relationship. This is partly because of me I have become a bit more hesitant after what happened in my previous relationship, but she's been amazingly patient.

I have not always had the best relationship with my parents. Seeing the gravity of my previous relationship I had yet to tell them I had been seeing someone because I did not know where we would end up. So last week I invited them to go out for dinner because I wanted them to meet my gf. I felt ready for her to meet my parents.

Fast forward to last night we meet my parents in a restaurant. And I introduce her to my parents and vice versa both talking and signing at the same time. I have now become somewhat decent in signing, barring the occasional funny mistake.

My parents' face instantly had this look on them that I knew something was wrong. I also tell my parents to try to look towards my gf while speaking so she can lip-read and follow along the conversation better without me having to translate every single word they say. 

My parents keep this face of disapproval but we go on and sit. We go through the normal pleasantries how I am doing etc. etc. But the mood isn't pleasant, I also notice that they aren't really asking my gf any questions but all questions about her are directed at me. ""What does she do for work?"" ""Where is she from?"" And while I get that it may take some getting used to I know my parents weren't making an effort.

So dinner goes along, my gf was getting a bit uncomfortable and I know she's a bit insecure about her not being able to hear or speak. And I was getting annoyed with my parents' behaviour.

So we finish out main course and they ask me a question about her again and I reply with ""Why don't you ask her yourself?"" My mom replies to this with ""How can she understand me?"" And this is when I was done with it. I turned to my gf and in just sign language I asked her if she wanted to go and she only nodded. So we left without even saying something, I paid for the entire dinner and went home.

My gf ended up crying because of the whole ordeal and blaming herself for what happened. I just tried to comfort her and told her it wasn't her fault. 

This morning I had a text message from my mom saying how rude it was to just get up and leave and how I embarrassed them infront of the people in the restaurant (we know the owners pretty well) and that I should get back together with my ex. But the thing that pisses me off the most is that she said that I was making a mistake dating a ""disabled person"" as if that is something that makes her less. 

I have yet to reply because I know that if I react with my gut reaction I might ruin the relationship with my parents permanently.

Tl;dr introduced my deaf-mute gf to my parents and they as saying it is a mistake to date a disabled person",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/degf0k/my_parents_are_saying_i_should_not_date_my_gf/,relationship_advice,1155,112,0.0
ThrowRa6351iw526,2019-10-06 22:15:45+00:00,"I got pregnant at 16, my parents disowned me and tried taking custody of my daughter. After 10 years my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and both want to reconnect with me and get to know their grandchild. I need help on how to handle this.","
I am very sorry if this is convoluted and riddled with grammar and spelling mistakes.

At 16 I slep with my good friend Jared . The condom broke and my daughter was created. My parents 
, who were great until this point, didn't like that and wanted me to get an abortion. I couldn't bring it over myself to. I wanted to keep the baby. Ofcourse my parents told me to pack my stuff and leave the house and their life's. So I did. I went to my friends house and his parents took me in. They weren't thrilled but they said that we all had to help as a new family member was in the making.

In that time my friend and I started to develop feelings for each other.

I had my daughter and about 2 moths later Jared's  brother  came back into their life's. He was a recovering Heroin addict. As we had the baby, my mother in law told him he could not stay with us.
Eventually they let him stay more and more and he was spending nights until he had a relapse and stole a bunch of stuff. My parents got wind of that. They dug up a bunch of stuff and found out that my MIL also fought addiction after an accident she had 15 years ago left her addicted to pain mends.

So they called cps on us and a whole ass investigation was opened. It was a dark time I thought they were going to take my baby. In the end they didn't find anything substantial.

But them calling cps on me transformed into a tradition over the years. As it was a small town every mistake I made got back to my parents.

I was half an hour late to pick up due to my job? Cps charges because neglect.
I was out after 10 pm with my toddler(this happened twice because we went to family gatherings) . Cps.

Christmas loads of people stayed at Jared's house because it was a big family. Cps because many strange men were there.

They eventually stopped it because they were fined for calling them on me unnecessarily. If they had done it more I think it could have been an offence.

The last call was 5 years ago.

Eventually Jared and I married when we were 23 and we are quite happy. We worked retail jobs and studied. It took us longer than average to graduate but we did. With a lot of help of his parents. Jared is now an ingeneer and I work as a graphic designer.

We were able to afford a big flat and finally moved out of his parent's house. Our life's look normal now.

Anyway a week ago I get a call fromy mother who told me my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and that his ultimate wish is to see me and my daughter again.

I don't really know what to do. Because while they didn't have to take care of my while I was pregnant I wished they had at least supported me. And while I get that they were panicking because they thought I was going to be an unfit mother, they made my life hell for 5 years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/deaccl/i_got_pregnant_at_16_my_parents_disowned_me_and/,relationship_advice,15702,1451,0.0
ThrowRAhawkeye,2019-10-06 13:12:23+00:00,Ex incel[20M] here searching for some help. I never learnt how to interact or build a healthy relationship with a women[F].," 

So guys you are my last hope.

I never learnt it. Since childhood, it was a pretty big deal to talk to girls. I used to fap daily since i was about 14-15. I am a recovering porn addict too. The thing is that i have always seen women in sexual ways.

In school, i used to get bullied a lot. So i had a lots of self-esteem issues. It took me 5 years(2014-1019) to again become normal to believe in myself. I used to think i can never get a girl. I am still struggling with that stuff but i am 90% done.

Every girl that came to talk to me or i went to talk with, my end goal would be to have sex with her. I think this has a lot to do with my porn addiction. I have cut it cold turkey and havn't gone back for 10 days now. I am still making progress and i will never ever watch it again.

I have had girlfriends before(when i was in high school) and i fucked it up because of my insecurity and pervertness. I was always afraid that they would leave me and i am not good enough. And i was a huge pervert. I used to always ask them their pictures and always turn every conversation sexual. And they would end up dumping me. At first i used to be hateful towards them and all but now i have realized i am the problem.

The problem is every women i had been with or had any chance with before, i never tried to know them or enjoy the conversation or connect. All i had in mind was how do i get this girl to fuck me.

Now i know the basic better yourself and all those stuffs. Because that is not the problem. The problem is my personality. I don't know how to talk with them. what do you talk with women about? How to connect with her as a friend? And how do i go about with someone i like? I literally don't know anything.

Everybody thinks we are the ideal couple but our relationship has been hell since our daughter was born and we moved in together (we did this just a month before she was born).

He is the laziest man I have ever met. He won't do groceries unless I specifically ask for what's needed in the house. We waste money on Starbucks every morning when we can make our own coffee and croissants easily. He won't get diapers or formula unless I point out that we are running out. He won't do anything around the house (my geriatric father has to mow our lawn) unless I yell and nag about it.

Here's the kicker: I work and pay the bills...he is unemployed! He watches her only 2 days of the week and has 5 days to do anything he wants...he chooses to do nothing.

We fight every single day and I'm at my wit's end. He wants sex all the time but I'm too disgusted by his selfish behaviour to even get turned on. I'm still fairly young and attractive and I'm scared I will end up unhappy and alone if he doesn't improve and I divorce him later in my life.

I have suggested separation and he won't hear it. He thinks I'm bluffing...I'm not. Nine years is a long time and I don't want my baby girl to grow up in a broken home. I don't know what to do. Our family and friends are Muslims and don't want the word ""divorce"" mentioned.

He was making me laugh and we were talking and having a really good time. After we were done we left, and we were about half way home when I asked him if we could stop and get some dessert. He said something like ""Haha, didn't we just eat?"" and keeps driving. My stupid, selfish self pushes it and says ""C'mon, please? I want something sweet."", he replies that we have ice cream at home and continues driving. After that I kept on pushing it and pushing it and pushing it, and while he's being way more patient with me than I deserve, he's firm and says no. I give up, but then i see a fast food restaurant up the road and jokingly pull the wheel to go into the parking lot. Apparently I pulled harder than I thought because we actually ended up swerving, and hit another car lightly. To make things worse, he just bought this car. The driver motions for us to pull into the parking lot, and when we do he and my boyfriend get out, and the driver starts cussing him out and saying horrible things to him, even though there wasn't any damage to both the cars (the bumper has the littlest little dent on it, and the other car had no damage). They didn't even exchange any information. While he's being yelled at, I don't get out of the car and let him be punished for something I did. When he gets back in and starts driving, he's gripping the steering wheel so hard that the veins on his arms are popping out. His entire face is red and he hasn't said anything to me. To try and break the tension a little, I say ""Well, that could've gone a lot worse."" As soon as I say that, he stomps on the breaks and just tells me to get out of his sight, in the angriest voice imaginable. I've never felt afraid of him, but in that moment I did. He looked like he was struggling not to hurt me. I got out and he sped off. It was starting to get dark and I was in a stretch of woods. It took almost an hour for me to walk home, but when I got there him and all his stuff was gone.

I feel so horrible. I cant even apologize to him because he hasn't been responding to my calls and texts. We've had fights before about my childish quirks when they go a little bit too far, and now I don't have a boyfriend anymore because of it. I've been getting texts like ""Wtf"" and ""What the hell is wrong with you"" from our friends so I think he's told them what happened. 

It seems like everybody's mad at me. Is there any way to fix this? How can I apologize to them when all our friends are siding with him?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ddol0a/my23f_boyfriend25f_left_me_on_the_side_of_the/,relationship_advice,21118,2301,0.0

I could see he was starting to lose his patience and I told him “Honey I have to take care of him before you, you know that”. And what he said back was really stunning. He looked me right in the eyes and said “if you love him so much, why don’t you suck his dick instead of mine”. I couldn’t say anything, I didn’t know what to say. He stormed out of our bedroom.

I just don’t know what to think of this, what should I? What should I do? It just bothers me so deeply, it’s going to be hard for me to forgive.

What do I do?,"I babysit my 1 year old nephew from 7am-8pm Mon-Fri for free because a) I love my brother and nephew and b) I'm already a SAHM for my 5mo daughter and adding another kid isn't a big deal for me, I have everything he needs already at home and I love kids. 

The spare room in my apt has been transformed into a playroom with floor mats, exersaucers, toys, a nap cot, etc and that is where my daughter and nephew spend most of their time playing and napping. There is also a tv in there, and today semi hidden behind the tv I found a weird circular object with a lens in it. After some googling I found that it was a small hidden wifi enabled camera that live streams to an app. I flipped my shit, called my fiance and asked him if it was his. He vehemently denied it and suggested I called the police and explain to them that I need a bug check. The only other person with regular access to my home and the playroom in particular would be my SIL; she drops nephew off in the morning and picks him up after work, and Bro and our parents only come on the weekends. I suspect the camera was placed recently which rules them out. Another reason I suspect SIL is because I had put my nephew in a long sleeved foot pajama this morning because my apartment can get chilly, and 5 mins later she texted me ""it's going to warm up later so please don't dress (nephew) too warmly, thanks!"" It could be a coincidence, but now that I found the camera I'm not so sure.


If it's her, she knows I know since I'm assuming she saw me find it. What do I do? Do I confront her and ask if its hers? I couldn't even begin to imagine why she would think to put hidden cameras in my house; I have treated my nephew like my own from the start and love him wholeheartedly.

Hi you all. This will be the final update. Its been 3 months and i feel like i can give another update. Most if not all of you probably dont care or have forgot, but hey, if anyone wants to know. I haven're responded to most private messages because I didn't feel good enough, talking about it. I still kinda don't. To address the elephant in the room: my wife is back with us. She is at home and well and she laughs about the whole incident. More than I do, to be honest but thats just me. 

She immediately started her treatment at the mental health institute. At first, they kept her sealed off from me and the rest of her family and friends. They taught her relations and how the brain works and how to process love and affection and all stuff like that. Meanwhile I was at home and biting my fingernails away, while explaining to everyone what is happening. Turns out that many people I know and thought highly of, dont believe in psychological damage and mental problems so that was fun talking about too. Anyway this isnt really about me here. They somehow convinced her that she has a delusion. Appareantly she almost immediately believed them but said, she still doesnt feel anything towards us, even if she knows that its a delusion. Her trust in doctors and nurses made all of this so much simpler and im so grateful for this. They worked with her more and let her first talk to her parents over the phone. She started gaining trust again and they kinda re-bonded. Later they allowed me to talk to her and I wasn't able to say a single word because i basically broke down in tears when i heard her saying or more like asking a simple ""hello?"". She told me, it will be fine and she just needs some more time and that the doctors know what they are doing. I regained some strength and told her she should call whenever she wants to. Later she talked to the kids and it really helped her. She laughed with them told them jokes about mental health and recollected some memories. Gradually, they let her meet her friends, then her parents, her siblings and finally me and the kids. That was almost 5 weeks after she got turned in. When she saw me and the kids she started to cry too and kissed all of us. She said she was sorry but i assured her there is nothing to be sorry about. They still kept her a couple of days for some final tests and let her finally go. She got back into work fairly quickly and we have the great relation that we had before all of this. The kids are happy, still dont 100% know what exactly happened. There are still some traces of distrust in herself. She questions her feelings more often and glooms over stuff but all in all, everything turned out to be good. Also, it's still not 100% clear why it happened at all. She cant recall banging her head against anything or anything different. 

It feels good writing this down. I wanted to thank everyone who answered and helped me on the initial post. Rhanks to the people that almost immediately diagnosed her and made me call the police. Im sorry that I didnt answer your private messages. I was quite busy and talking about the mental health of my wife feels weird and bitter to me.

ThrowRAinnoconfused,2019-10-04 05:46:34+00:00,I (36m) was falsely accused by my gf's (29f) son (7m) of molesting him and she won't accept I don't want to now be with her?,"I know that's a hell of a title, but it's been a hell of a situation and I know a friend gets great advice on here, so I've decided to see if I get the same. 

Basically we have/had been together over a year and a half and we were going great. She has a son from a previous relationship, who I've not only met but was fond of. I wouldn't say step dad material by any means, but we had a little friendship going. The dad's in and out of prison and the kid's life, so I'm the only guy like that he's had in his life that fulfills any real decent male role model figure. Me and her were even talking about living together too. 

A few weeks ago, I get a visit from the police and they arrest me for sexually assaulting her son! I'd been bailed on condition I wouldn't go near them, and as a result I'd been placed on ""gardening leave"" at work. 

Last week, I got a letter saying the case had been dropped and I don't any longer have to attend my next bail hearing. That was it. I rang the policeman in charge of the investigation, and at the time he said he couldn't comment too much as there was still an active investigation but basically her son confessed he had made it up and I'm innocent!

To say I was mad/shocked/confused was an understatement. Basically a couple of days later, I'd had one drink too much and rang her to confront her. She answered, all apologetic and explained that this little fucking nephew of hers (12m - I've always hated this kid when I've met him, he's so disrespectful and always getting into trouble at school and into fights etc) did it to her son at this party they went to a few days before I was arrested and when her son confessed someone had touched him, he panicked and said it was me instead of his cousin. I guess him being questioned by the police scared him so he had told the truth. 

I was so disgusted and just hung up on her, deleted my social media too so I don't have to have anything to do with them. 

She's been ringing me since, texting me, emailing me and is collectively saying even though she's so sorry that she put me through all this, she can't be too sorry as are wanted to protect her son but she really wants us to get back to where we were again and her son misses me too and has been crying saying he's hurt me. She said this can make us stronger and we can have a good future. I've not answered at all, I've got nothing to say. I'm thinking of ghosting her. 

I can't lie and say I don't have love for her or her son, but if I'm honest I'm way too hurt. I'd always know she once thought I did something so unspeakable to her son, and I'll also never be able to forget that his lies (no Matter the reason) could have wrecked my life. And I'd never want the risk of running into her nephew again, I never ever want anything to do with him again. 

What should I do Reddit?

ThrowRafanily,2019-10-03 23:35:12+00:00,My parents chose their new families over me so I moved in with my aunt. Now they want back in. But I hate them,"Hi.

So I 16. Moved in with my aunt at 15 because my parents remarried and had new families.

My father married his mistress who allready had a son and now they have a baby daughter. My mom remarried my step dad and they had my half sister.

After all that I became a secondary character in their life and they looked forward to ship me off to the other home so they could pretend that I didn't exist and play happy family.

After a year I became fed up and started sleeping over more and more at other houses and when home I would never interact with anyone. Both my parents took that as a rebellious phase and would fight with me all the time. I wasn't a bad kid or a trouble make but soon I was labeled as the black sheep of the family. Every interaction with my parents became a lecture about my attitude problem and how well the other kids behaved. I was just so fed up that I packedy shit and disappeared for a few days. I took a bus and went MIA for 4 days. Ofcourse the police was called and when I appeared again I hit another lecture.

We got in a screaming match were they called me a disappointment and I told them I hated them. I called my aunt crying and she came to fetch me.

In the car I could hear how she was tearing my parents a new one.

Neither of them tried to convince me of coming back home. We informed the respective authorities about my changed living condition and my aunt is my current guardian.

My parents ways half assed our contact. Appearing only when it was convinient sometimes giving me money etc. Recently they tried to build more contact up but I was not interested.

I won a story writing contest and didn't tell them nor did I invite them to the celebration. And on the website where you can read my story the thanks goes to my aunt for loving me unconditionally. I didn't invite my parents to my sweet 16 party. Basically I have cut them out of my life.

I am not interested in their life's or families or anything.

Mom tried to meet up for my birthday but we didn't. She got upset and called me crying and..... I just didn't care. It was like listening to a TV character cry. It wasn't important she isn't important to me anymore.

Dad called me and said he was worried about me and how my reaction is not healthy and again I didn't care.

As far as I am concerned my aunt is my only parent. She encourages that I build up my relationship to my parents again but doesn't force me.

Anyway yesterday my parents pulled me out of school and invited me to eat at our old favorite place. Mom had tears in her eyes and even dad seemed hurt. They tried apologizing for their behavior and pleaded with me to come back and I just said no and left. I still resent them for choosing a new life over me. But I don't know if I am being a pretty asshole or what to do now. I don't want them in my life but would I be making the right choice?

1783997893,2019-10-03 14:21:17+00:00,UPDATE: How do I (m27) tell my wife (f26) that I was raped,"I just wanted to thank everyone who gave me advice on here and toke the time out of there day to comment. I read all the comments and they helped sort of.

I would also like to thank all the male survivors who reached out to me. Like sometimes with a “situation” like this it is easy to feel alone because it  is a problem that we never here about ever in the news, school, academia. So in a weird way it is nice to know that there are others out there and that I am not alone. 

I guess I’ll answer some questions before I get in to the update. 

Did I ever go to the police- No in the country I went to college in there is no such thing as female male rape 

Pregnancy- nope she was never pregnant or at least she didn’t tell me 

Now for the update

I have started going to a therapist to try and get over this issue that I am experiencing and it was hard at first to even go. I almost flaked on my first appointment I was so scared and felt pretty ashamed. 

But I guess this is where the problems start, my plan of thought was to not tell my wife until I was more ready or at least until I had processed it more. 

However I guess this only makes sense in the context of my job. So I go to work everyday from 8-8 and every night for about a year now I come
back sometime around 8:30 to 8:45. However in order to go to therapy I needed to take an hour out of my day at around 3 so I had to get home an hour later on therapy days which by chance land on Tuesdays and Fridays very week.

So after two weeks of this happening and me giving what I think are good excuses to why I am late, I guess she starts snooping around my phone a bit and well I guess she found it weird reddit was on my phone- not a redditer- so she clicks in it and sees notifications from my last post. 

So yah we kind of get in a.... fight??? I guess I don’t even know how to describe it like, she was mad at me for not telling her about this ever. And then she was also crying because she felt so sad this happened and it seemed like she was partially  angry at me for letting this happen. 

So after a heated discussion for a few hour, at this point it is after midnight, she goes to stay with her mother.

And it is like seriously women, you just learned my deepest secret ever, something that makes me feel nauseous to think about and you just leave.

Like I don’t know what I wanted her to do to me, like I kind of wanted to be comforted by her but she just left and I slept terribly that night I keep replaying the discussion over and over and again and ughhh.

Ya she came back the next day and got stuff from ours, to take back to her parents house and she’s still living there 🙁. 

So like I guess that’s the update pretty grim in the grand scheme of things but I thank everyone on reddit for the help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dcrkap/update_how_do_i_m27_tell_my_wife_f26_that_i_was/,relationship_advice,1022,161,0.0

I had twenty or so events as recommended by the doctor, then gave a sample to test for sperm. The test came back ""no spermazoa"" present.

She kept stating that vasectomies aren't guaranteed, I told her mine was up there. Doctor cut a good inch from vas deferans, tied and burned the tips.

Yesterday, she tells me she's a month late, that she took three at home pregnancy tests and they're positive.

I asked her to schedule an appointment with her medical provider to be sure and she's not willing to do that. Questions my trust and thinks I'll leave her.

I'm out of my element here, anxious, afraid, stomach turning, I wept for a good hour. I never wanted this. I don't know how to feel, I'm angry, disappointed, upset but I don't want to be angry at her. I hate to think it but could she have cheated?

Update to this post.

The comments helped me calm down a little, I really needed that. I was really stressing tf out. And yeah I know I'm stupid, didn't really think my actions through.. I did went back to her soon after my post and well, we cried hah. We've both had a lot of time to think and we've met everyday to talk, and we're pretty much 100% certain what's going to happen. So she revealed that she wants a relationship and be exclusive with me and asked me to seriously think about it, and that she wanted to know what I wanted before making a decision. And well yeah, I pretty much realized I don't know why we're NOT dating.. Lots of common interests. Always lots of fun together and the same sense of humor. Good chemistry in general. But I honestly thought I was only interesting as a FWB to her, because of our age difference. But apparently (lucky me) not. So I told her I want to be with her too, and after lots of discussion we agreed to go for an abortion.

 One thing she said stood out for me. She is serious about us, and wants to make it this work. And starting off with a child this early in the relationship is going to be very tough, so the chance that our relationship will survive is slim, and she doesn't want to take that risk. And she didn't plan on having kids for a few more years, and obviously I feel the same way. So yeah who knows maybe she or I will change our mind but this is the plan for now. Luckily abortion is legal in my country. Thanks for the advice everyone. On one hand I'm ridiculously happy that I'm now officially with her, like I honestly thought that wasn't a possibility.  But yeah the situation kinda sucks. And yes we'll be using condoms..",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dcgspa/update_my_20m_fwb_26f_got_pregnant_kinda_freaking/,relationship_advice,6969,256,0.0

Last weekend my sister was having a party at my place because my mom and dad have a pool and a big backyard. She invited a lot of people to the house. My mom and dad had me doing a lot of things like making salads, getting ice and all of that. 

Now I have a good body. I've done gymnastics since a young age and I work out. I was walking around in swimming shorts and my shirt off because that's just what I wear when I want to swim. Nothing different to every other time I got in the pool at my house. 

When I was getting food from my dad at the BBQ, my sister's friend touched my chest while I was eating. I didn't hear her come up behind me and she said that my chest is hard or something. I took her arm off me and said thanks. 

Later in the day she walked up behind me and grabbed my stomach/abs. I kinda jerked forward and turned around to see who it was. I just don't like people I don't know touching me. She told me again that they're hard. My mom was sitting with my aunt and she saw it. She walked up and asked Rachel's friend what she thinks she's doing.

insomniac_87,2019-10-02 14:42:03+00:00,"I [26m] slept with a old friend [25f] for about two weeks, And i just found out she is MARRIED and just had a baby who i think might be mine. Should i keep my mouth shut or tell him?","Guys and ladies,  I’m in a beyond fucked up situation right now and i need your advice.

Before i start, let me give some context to help better explain the situation, some of the details are NSFW but ill explain them as non NSFW as possible.



About 12 months ago, i seen an old friend at the store out of the blue, ill call her M. Me and M were very good friends throughout highschool and several years after, until we kind of just stopped talking for a few years.
Anyway, We began chatting for a short time and she eventually gave me her number and said we should catch up sometime. I agreed and that was that.

We texted back and fourth for a few days until she suggested we hangout. I agreed and she ended up stopping by that evening. Somewhere in the conversation she asked if i was single and i said yes, and she said “Same”.  Cool. That night we ended up having great sex.


The next day, we hungout again. I agreed and she ended up coming over again. things got frisky again and right before we did the deed, she asked me to ditch the condom because it hurt her vagina or whatever. She told me she had a IUD and assured me she could not get pregnant.
I stupidly agreed, i trusted her because she was a good friend of mine back then and she doesn’t seem like the type of person who would lie. 




Now this is where it kind of gets NSFW but i’m putting it in the context so it will make more sense in the end. Right before the end of the deed, i mentioned i was about to finish. She told me to finish inside so it doesn’t get all over her. so me being a complete dumbass, did.



Long story short, for the next two weeks give or take, M came to my house pretty much every night, and in those two weeks I probably finished inside her 30+ times.



Then one day she pretty much just went ghost. She would only text me once or twice a day, and was being very short, she said something along the lines of she didn’t want to catch feelings then eventually she just completely went ghost. I kind of was like whatever and moved on. 



Fast forward to yesterday, I hadn’t talked to her or seen her in about a year, and last night i went on Facebook for the first time in probably two years to check the marketplace for vehicles. I was scrolling through my feed just seeing what my old friends were up to when i seen a picture of her holding up a baby. I was shocked and clicked on her profile and sure enough shes married, and has been married to this guy for over 3 years now. All over her profile was pictures of her and her husband and her baby.




At this point i did some digging and came across a picture she posted in late October of last year of a positive pregnancy test and her husband kissing her stomach, that had the caption “after over a year of trying, it finally happened, me and (husband name) are so excited for what the future holds” that she had announced on her Facebook.


I decided to check my phone and see if i still had our messages to check the dates, but i had deleted them so i came up with the idea to see if me and M had taken any pictures around the time we were having sex and sure enough i found a snapchat i had taken of us drinking and it was dated September 28th of last year. well thats just fantastic. I kind of had a mini heart attack. These dates are way too close for my comfort.


To make matters worse the kid looks pretty similar to me, has my eye color and not the husbands. same hair color, same nose. doesn’t even really look like him. I don’t even know what to do at this point.


I barely slept last night and i feel terrible and incredibly stupid even though i had no clue she was married at the time. I haven’t told a soul about this besides posting on here.


I’m not sure if i should reach out to the guy and tell him she cheated on him let alone mention that the baby might not be his. I feel for the guy because ive been cheated on before it and fucking sucks. 


To make matters even worse, i now have a amazing girlfriend that i have been with for 6 months now, and i dont want to ruin it with her. 


So reddit, this is why i have came here to ask you, WHAT should i do? Could this kid be mine? Should i tell him?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dcb4tg/i_26m_slept_with_a_old_friend_25f_for_about_two/,relationship_advice,1665,372,0.0
acouplarunnas,2019-10-02 14:03:06+00:00,"UPDATE: My boyfriend has cancer, I want to pay for his treatment","Hi everyone, thank you so much for the advice on my first post. I’m on mobile and idk how to link it but it’s on my page. 

I got a lot of great advice on how to bring up my wanting to pay for treatment to my boyfriend. I have to say I was really nervous for some reason and couldn’t figure out exactly what to say. A few nights ago I was with him and we were talking about his diagnosis. He was really down and worried about his mom. And I just took his face in my hands and told him that I could help, that I wanted to pay and I had the money. He was confused at first and didn’t believe that I had all that so I showed him my bank statement. That was uncomfortable as fuck because as I said before I was raised to never talk about the wealth I was lucky enough to be born into. But I showed him and said that I knew this is what I wanted to do with my savings. 

Turns out, life is not that easy and you can’t just pay for a treatment and have that be that. There are checkups, hospital stay costs, etc. Oh and by the way, a lot of you guys mentioned insurance and medicaid and whatnot, it turns out his family is not eligible for a lot of programs because of some really complicated family history involving his father. Honestly I don’t know the details and it’s extremely personal to him so I’m not going to get into it here. They are on the best program that is available to them but it doesn’t cover even close to everything. But anyways, the total cost of everything (assuming there are literal 0 complications and he doesn’t catch any sicknesses during his recovery which he likely will because immune system) is more than I thought. But I still wanted to pay for the treatment at least which is the bulk of it. I told him I wasn’t doing this for our relationship but moreso for him and his mom. And his little brothers who are the cutest and funniest things on the planet.

He told me no at first but after much discussion he finally accepted my offer. I was really relieved and happy that he did. His mom called me the next day and expressed her gratitude, I love that woman she did so much to make my boyfriend who he is and it just felt right that I was able to help. 

The last few days have actually been good. My boyfriend and I both have had struggled with anxiety and depression and after the initial news that he has cancer we both crashed for a few days and nothing felt real or right. But now we are both looking at the future more positively, this treatment has a really high success rate and no one has to stress about the cost of it. The next few months are going to be really hard. He’s leaving school to receive his first round of treatment soon and he’s too far for me to realistically visit him more than once while still keeping my grades up. I have literally no idea what I’m going to do without him and it’s going to suck not being there if he needs me. And of corse there’s the fact that he’s going to be in increasingly more pain for a while. I’m worried sick about him and I’m just praying to a god I really don’t believe in that everything goes as smooth as possible. 

But with this fear comes a new appreciation for him. I’ve never loved before him and my parents while obviously quite generous with their money, never actually made me feel like I was worth a lot. But he makes me feel like I’m worth everything. There’s a certain beauty in the fact that I can feel his pain and he can feel mine. And I feel blessed that I can still kiss and hug and be with him for the time being. My boyfriend said that the doctors keep telling him to take it one day at a time so that’s what I’ll do as well. And right now on this day I have someone I love more than anything who loves me back and I don’t know what to feel other than grateful even though the road ahead will be rocky. 

Anyways,  I’m sure no one came for the sappy stuff lol. I’m glad he accepted the money I can’t think of anything I’d want to do with it more than help him. If anyone has had a loved one go through cancer and has advice on how to deal with it I would really appreciate it.

He travels away for work around 4-6 months out of a year . This has never been a problem and I really think the distance made our relationship better as we never got tired of each other. He came back yesterday from a business trip and I saw something different in him. I asked him what happened and then he starts crying saying that he has done something terribly. On the last day of the trip he went with his coworkers to a bar . He met a woman there and started to talk to her. He said that he had little too much drink and started to flirt with her . She was drunk too and invited him to her hotel room ( she was a tourist in that city) . He agreed to go with her. On the way to her room he realized what he was doing and left her . He said he didn't do anything with her and I belive him ( he is one of the worst liars I know and after 28 years I know when he lies) .

I asked him why would he want to have sex with someone . He started apologising saying he feels like a piece of shit as he had everything he needed home . Our sex life has remained the same for our entire relationship ( we have sex around 4-5 times a week) . Our sex life has always been good as we have always tried to eat healthy and keep in shape by working out regularly. He has always been a very good husband and father and he is a good person , but even good people can make mistakes sometimes and I want to forgive him.

LovelessThrowRA,2019-09-30 14:33:53+00:00,My [24M] boyfriend [27M] has turned into an anime character and I'm not sure what to do anymore.,"Hi lovely people. Throwaway account for obvious reasons. You know the drill. I tried posting this on r/relationships but apparently the mods there said it was inappropriate. So I am trying my luck here for guidance.

I've been with this guy for 3 years and I moved into his apartment some time last year. I love him to bits but lately I've been thinking about packing my things and leaving.

My boyfriend has always been a boisterous type and he's a turbo nerd. He loves his superheroes, anime, gaming, you name it. Whenever we watch anything, especially anime, he'll talk through the whole thing often criticizing the relationships the writers made for the characters, talk about his ""one true pairings,"" and he'll express how certain set pieces in the story make him feel. I'm not into it really but I'll take time to watch it with him because he makes it rather entertaining and I support his hobbies and interests. He'll wear his emotions on his sleeve too. He has no problem laughing, cheering, and crying over what's going on and I love him for that. I love all of him for that. But lately that's all changed and he's no longer the person I once loved anymore.

About 7 months ago we binge watched an anime called ""Loveless"" based on a recommendation by his friend. It was decent, albeit incredibly fucked up and depressing. The show tackles sex, abuse, memory loss, psychotic breaks, broken homes, love being equal to pain, that sort of shit. However I was moreso shocked that my boyfriend was completely quiet and focused the entire time. He was also quiet the rest of the day. It bled into the next morning too... And even for a few days. He wouldn't really speak or express any kind of emotion. I tried asking him what was up with him and even he didn't know. I thought maybe the show was too much for him and he was still trying to process it. So I paid it no mind and hoped it'd clear up soon.

After about 2 weeks he somewhat returned to normal but he wasn't really all that there. It seemed like he was trying to force his boisterous personality rather than it coming naturally to him. Throughout the next few weeks I'd find him quietly sitting at his PC either playing games or looking at websites and watching videos. I was getting really worried about him. He also picked up the Loveless books and read them. However he would need to take breaks in between each book because each time he finished one he'd be out of it again for a few hours or a day. This type of behavior was way out of character for him. This went on for about 2 months until he finished the last book he had.

Then, one day, a breakthrough happened but not what I expected at all. He began having a soft smile on his face pretty much 24/7. His voice and speech were soft, calming and often times philosophical in nature. He would stare at pretty much everything just admiring it, smile and all, as if he was just high on life and enjoying every little aspect of it. He was a lot more gentle with me when we had sex or being intimate often treating me like a delicate flower that he cherished so much. It was weird. Gone were the days of ups and downs and varying degrees of loud. It made me bitter but I'd be lying if I said he didn't look content and at peace. So I bit my lip.

At least for a little bit. I missed the man I once knew. I asked him what is going on with him. Normally confronting him about something would make him squirm. Instead he looked away and smiled, blushing a little, and admitted he owed me an explanation. He took me to his PC and he showed me all these blogs and websites he's favorited talking about otherkin and the different kinds of otherkin that there are. That's when he dropped the bomb on me.

He is fictionkin to Soubi; one of the main characters from Loveless. Meaning he thinks he is Soubi's reincarnation. He believes he IS Soubi.

I didn't know what to make of it at first. It sounded to utterly ridiculous and it is. How can you be the reincarnation of something that isn't real? A thing some writer or writers made up in their head? A piece of fiction. Yet, like I said before, he seemed much happier. He said Soubi resonates within him at a level that shakes him to his very core. He explained that the show made him have his awakening. He says he has Soubi's memories and has flashbacks of Soubi's childhood and such. So I accepted it and told him I'd love him regardless. He was happy with that.

I spent time getting used to the new adjustments I had to make. He's very happy that he can be ""himself"" around me more. But things got weirder and weirder. He wanted me to start calling him Soubi when we were at home over his real name. Fine, whatever, then he'd start casually calling me Ritsuka, the other main character, or some type of cutesy variation like Ritsy or his Sacrifice (another thing related to the show). He even wanted me to roleplay as Ritsuka in bed which is... really unsettling because Ritsuka is 12 years old (I told you the anime is fucked up. And yes, the characters are romantically involved in the anime too). He even bought me a cat ear headband so he could ""finally take my ears."" For context, in the show people are born with random animal ears and tails. They are supposed to represent innocence and virginity. When the character finally has sex in this world they lose the animal parts. I'll admit the roleplay was kind of hot but... fuck I don't know.

Then he started getting more obsessed with it. He grew out his blonde hair so it could be more like Soubi's. He bought every piece of clothing he could find to mimic all the ones he's seen Soubi wear in the show and books. He even bought a fake pair of glasses that looked like Soubi's. He began taking up art like Soubi does (which he's fucking awful at by the way). He even wants to get a tattoo of the word ""LOVELESS"" across his upper chest like Soubi has carved and scared into his. I'm SO glad he wants a tattoo but I'm scared it's going to evolve into him taking a knife and carving it into his chest like Soubi did. I'm no longer dating my boyfriend. I'm 100% dating Soubi in terms of looks and personality and I can't stand it. It's absolutely destroying me little by little each day. I don't want to leave but, fuck, I just want my boyfriend back.

Problem is... I feel like a selfish asshole. He's so much happier and this change seems to be less obsessive and more healthy in nature. He's a lot more outgoing now, he goes to social events, charity events, he has more friends, has been excelling at work and he's even being considered for a promotion, he's been losing weight and toning up, eating better... I don't know what to do. I don't want to ask him to change for my sake but all seems so crazy and unhealthy and yet I'm the one falling apart while he's living life without a care in the world.

When I did make the post on r/relationships people suggested he may be associating this with trauma he my have had in his childhood and he may be using this fictionkin thing to try and move past it in some way. Others suggested that this is dangerous and could lead to a much more dangerous path. Some also suggested I should try and convince him to seek therapy which I don't know how I'd do it since he believes he is truly fine and happy. Someone else suggested maybe he needs to just ride it out and it's a face. However because it was removed so quickly I wasn't able to get a general consensus on what might be best. I just feel like an enabler now since I didn't bat an eye.

What do I do, Reddit? I miss my boyfriend. 

tl;dr My boyfriend thinks he is the reincarnation of an anime character and has changed completely to the point he is this anime character and has been using it to improve his life significantly while I'm falling apart because I miss the man I fell in love with. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dbcfke/my_24m_boyfriend_27m_has_turned_into_an_anime/,relationship_advice,1117,183,0.0

If you pray, please pray for me and my family and all involved in this. If you don't, please send good thoughts. And for everyone be kind to each other.  


You can read my original update to the post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/d9m2l5/my\_36f\_husband\_40m\_has\_been\_accused\_of\_harassment/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d9m2l5/my_36f_husband_40m_has_been_accused_of_harassment/)  


I confronted him. I asked if he had ever been unfaithful. He looked like he was about to say no then he admitted four women and the nanny. Two were in a city he travels to frequently. One was a one night stand on a trip. And one was local. All told, he had a mistress for about seven of the thirteen years we were married. I can't imagine what the women went through. If they didn't know he was married, then they were victims. If they did know, then I hope they find peace from whatever demon caused them to sleep with a married man.  


I think I could've stayed with him if it had just been the women. Maybe, I can't say for sure. But the nanny was a violation of trust and an act of a troubled man. She had to fear for her job. I can't blame her in any way, and I'll reach out to her when the time is right to make sure again she knows she's loved.  


The kids cried when we told them. He's at an Airbnb until he can find more permanent housing. I'll stay here with the kids. The current nanny is moving in for the foreseeable future and my mother is coming to help. We'll all be ok.   


I did want to say one last thing. There were those who came into the original thread with hatred in their heart towards my husband's accuser. I looked at the place you came from, and it's vile and hurtful. I hope whatever pain in your life, current or past, that caused you to spew such hatred is exorcised and you find peace and love. Always look for the good in people and forgive their trespasses as you are forgiven yours.

atwin-and-agemini,2019-09-29 22:20:34+00:00,My [16M] twin sister [16F] has confessed she's in love with my boyfriend [17M]. She doesn't know we're together. I don't know what to do.,"This is a bit of a shitshow of a situation, and quite convoluted. Apologies for that. 

Obviously, my sister and I are twins. She and I are incredibly close, though we have different friend groups. However, if she has friends over I'll typically hang out with them and vice versa. I've also been grappling with my sexuality for the past about 3 years or so. I'm basically at a place where I know I like boys but idk if I'm gay or bi or what. 

Anyway, several months ago I began seeing her best friend, who is also a guy. He's openly bisexual but I'm still in the closet. I'm unwilling to come out rn because my stepdad is liable to react poorly. BF is fine with this and incredibly patient and supportive with me. He's fine keeping it on the DL until I'm im a position where I feel I can come out. This was working very well for us. However, a number of weeks ago, my sister confided in me that she had a crush on my BF. It freaked me out a bit because I don't even want to come out to her. I don't think she'd intentionally tell our stepdad, but she's horrible at keeping secrets and I'm concerned she might let it slip by accident to him or our mum, who'd tell him.

More recently, my sister's ""crush"" on my BF has developed to her claiming she's actually in love with him. She often pines for him and talks to me often about how she wants to be with him but she's afraid to ruin the friendship. She also talks about little things he does that she perceives as flirting and how excited this makes her. It's really really hard for me to hear this; not only because I don't like to think about my bf being with someone else but because I hate hearing my sister pine for something that isn't going to happen. Idk what to do. I really really don't want to tell her he and I are seeing each other because I don't want to come out, but I don't know how much longer I can cope with her talking about him in this way. Does anyone have any ideas on what I can do or say?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/db27cs/my_16m_twin_sister_16f_has_confessed_shes_in_love/,relationship_advice,1082,113,0.0

She doesn’t know I know.","Forgive my rambling here, I’m having a little trouble gathering my thoughts. A whole lot of suggestive pics, including nudes of her and way more dicks than I’ve ever wanted to see in my lifetime. So of course now I’ve seen all of this and I’m losing my mind a bit here. We’ve been together for 3 years now, I guess she has been bored with things, or is looking for attention/validation from other people. Part of me wants to confront her about it and end our relationship, part of me wants to be really petty and anonymously expose her and these people to the larger group we’re all a part of on discord before I walk away. 

I know it’s kinda childish to be so petty but a lot of where that comes from is her constant accusatory tone - whenever I am talking to my buddies she’s always making snide comments like “how’s your other girlfriend doing?” Even though I make it a point not to interact with other women any more than is absolutely necessary, as I am always faithful and never want to be put in that kind of position where anything can be taken out of context.

myhostsup112,2019-09-29 01:51:30+00:00,My [44F] husband's [45M] coworker [28F] told me that he cheated on me with her and I don't know what to belive anymore.,"Td;dr My husband is a captain on cruise ships and one of the officer told me that he cheated on me with her.

We have been together for 25 years and married for 20 years. We have 4 kids ( 22f, 19m , 13m and 5f). 

We met in college . I ended up pregnant and after we had the child he proposed to me. He has been sailing for our entire relationship and I never had a problem with it as I am an independent person ( I am a dentist and have my own cabinet) and his and my parents has always helped me with the kids when he is not home. He has always worked 4 months on sea and then 4 months of vacation so he is home around 6 months every year. We have always had a very good relationship as everytime he comes home we are in the ""honeymoon phase"". Our sex life has always been very good and have sex almost everyday ( when he is home of course). Even though he is home half of the year our kids adore him and can't wait to see him when he is gone.

He has been working on cruise ships for the last 10 years ( he has worked on oil ships before but never liked it bcs the work was very hard ) and a captain for the last 7 years. Officers and the captian can bring their spouses on the ship for 2 weeks and I always leave the kids at his parents and go to him at the last 2 weeks of his contract and then come back home together. 3 days ago I came to the ship and everything went good until yesterday when one of the officer ( a 28 years old very good looking woman) told me that she feels guilty and said that she and my husband has been having an affair for the last 2 months. I waited until my husband came to his cabin and confroted him. 

He knew immediately who I was talking about and started to explain to me calmly that she proposed to him to engage in a sexual relationship in exchange that he will put a good word for her at the company. He declined because he is married and loves me very much.He said that she told me that because she was probably mad that he declined her offer and was trying to get some revenge by ruining our marriage. I asked him why he didn't tell me and he said that he gets this kind propositions all the time because of his position but he never accepted them because he loves me very much and will never do that to me. 

I think that I have to mention that he is very smart, funny and good looking( he works out a lot) . I am 44 years and had 4 kids and no matter how much I work out I will never look as good as those young women from the ship that he works with. I try to keep my body in shape by working out regularly.

I don't know what to belive anymore . Today I asked the other officers if they have ever seen something suspicious with him . They said that women flirt with him all the time but he has never done something innapropiate. I need an advice please.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dap1z7/my_44f_husbands_45m_coworker_28f_told_me_that_he/,relationship_advice,1006,141,0.0

BjornForgottenAcct01,2019-09-28 15:55:59+00:00,My (30M) Wife (31F) believes being drunk is a truth serum and has waited for me to be blackout drunk to ask me very sensitive questions. Calls me mean and abusive as a result.,"Tl;Dr: wife asks me sensitive questions while I'm very drunk. Calls me mean and emotionally abusive for being blunt after she made me feel safe enough to be honest, even though I didn't want to tell her. I'm not mean, I'm not abusive. Why is she trying to make me seem that way?

I'm in no way perfect or blameless in this scenario, I'll clear that up first off. I'm emotionally pretty dumb and my wife is very emotionally sensitive. Add a good bit of rum to equation and my buffer is off. However, I know myself well enough to know I'm not belligerent or abusive, even in black out drunk scenarios. I often get far too sappy and trusting. If I'm ever mean, it's because I'm with friends and we give each other a ton of flack. I hope to God I have never actually directed any of it toward my wife. It devistates me just with the thought of it. 

I'm in a harsh spot right now due to my wife telling me I'm a mean drunk and start to cry about ""things I've said"" while I was drunk. She painted a picture that made me look like I was a straight up insensitive asshole that is emotionally abusive. This was during a conversation we were having about how I hurt her after expressing my feelings that she uses her mental illness (depression, anxiety with migraines) to get out of work or out of something she doesn't want to do. I said this to her because it's been an ongoing thing for several years and the only time she gets a migraine is while she's at work or right before something she has expressed that she doesn't want to do. She's able to do anything and everything else as long as it's something she holds an interest in.

 I've been supporting her 100% this entire time and now that she's been diagnosed by a doctor with pseudo-migraines secondary to depression and anxiety, i felt I needed to talk about this concern. She shut it down. We then have a conversation about how I'm not supporting her enough emotionally, that by saying what I said to her, I have practically reset all the progress she has made with her mental status. She then goes on to call me a mean drunk. Why this came up? No idea.

 I immediately became devistated. I abhor even the idea that I could or would ever be an abusive partner. I got madly depressed. Something didn't sit right, though. I've never been labeled a mean drunk, I've never even come close to being abusive... What gives? So I dug deep for a coupe of days, trying to replay these scenarios. I was able to remember being just drunk enough a few times to recall this: I would be getting to bed and she would strike up conversation. I get stupid chatty when I'm drunk. Now, what I remember is her asking me extremely touchy and sensitive things, me trying to not engage, saying no I'm drunk, I don't want to talk about this / I don't want to say the wrong thing. She pressed me into it, laying out a safe space to talk. An example: Why don't you want to have kids with me? This is what she brought up during our recent conversation. ""You told me you don't want to have kids with me because of my mental illness"". That stopped me dead in my tracks. Yes, that's the harsh truth about why I don't want kids right now, but I've kept that in my own mind, never to come out to her because that's a fucked up thing come out and tell anyone.

 I've had to be the primary on just about everything during our relationship. I work full time, I pay all the bills, excluding her car payment because I can't afford it, I buy all the groceries, I used to be the only one that cooked, now I just do it most of the time. I had to be the only one wearing the pants. I had to (and have to still) budget, make appointments, make sure both our meds are renewed, make sure she actually gets to the doctor, I used to have to pick her up from work when she got a migraine... It's a lot! It's like having a child as my partner... Someone I have to just about do everything for. She cleans somewhat, she did most of the dishes while she wasn't working. But cleaning meant she vacuumed and cleaned the bathtub. Everything else remained a wreck. I work 12 hour shifts. My job is emotionally taxing. I've done my best to support her how I was capable. I struggle with depression as well, I have horrible anxiety that I take medication for. I don't always have the brightest outlook on stuff. But I always do my best to treat her right and be there for her. The only time I haven't is when I would be just so mad at her for her inactions. Even then, I would just engage minimally, tell her I'm struggling and need to collect my head before I'm of use to anybody. So, hell no I don't want kids right now! It would be the worse move I could make as an adult. I'm not financially stable, I'm not emotionally solid, I'm already taking care of one grown person just about full time, no way am I going to add a baby to that. If work stresses her out to the point of having a debilitating migraine, whats a kid going to do??? She works at a coffee shop! Yes it gets stressful, everything does. All I see with having a kid is her checking out when it gets hard and it'll be completely up to me to tend to both of them. 

Anyway, if you've read this far, what do I do?... I feel like I can't trust her. I feel like I've been taken advantage of. I feel like all my efforts have been in vain and I hurt. I know I'm not perfect, I know there are plenty of things I need to work on, I've checked my drinking amounts and limit myself in order to not get black out drunk. I do my best to have productive conversations whenever there's a disagreement. I do my best to be proactive instead of reactive. If she's labeling me as a mean drunk to my face, what has she told other people? Her friends always act weird around me, like guarded and sometimes stand-offish. Having said all of this, she has made a ton of progress recently, she has been more involved with being an actual partner, she has stepped up to the plate on some things and it makes me feel so much lighter. I think that's what confuses me the most here...",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dahs7w/my_30m_wife_31f_believes_being_drunk_is_a_truth/,relationship_advice,1107,99,0.0

My husband had not been in the best mood all day anyway, he was very stressed from work and tired. So it escalated fast. I felt like he was taking out all his feelings on me. He was yelling at me, insulting me. All I wanted was to have some peace and go to sleep. So I got up and started to walk away. He grabbed me by my arm, pulled me into me and said “don’t walk away from me when I’m talking to you”. His grip was so painful and he just made me feel so small. I told him “please stop you’re scaring me”. As soon as I said that, he let go of my arm. He said, “why are you scared?”. I couldn’t say anything, I just started to tear up. I cried into his chest and he just kept stroking my hair, telling me it’s alright and I have nothing to be afraid of. He carried me back to bed, but he didn’t sleep in our bedroom. Which felt weird.

So I took alot of people's advice frim the previous post and one of the things i did was end it with her. I msg her about us meeting up to talk this whole week and she only decided to grace me with a pretty dry answer last night. So because of that I told her to hit the road via text even tho I would have preferred a face to face confrontation. She went ahead and tried to play the victim which is typical her and then I questioned why she had no issue avoiding the brother and the father but she is totally cool interacting with Owo. She had no answer and once again tried to turn it around. I had enough and told her I had no issue putting her and Owo in the same boat since she so wishes to interact and mingle with her. Which means deleting her of everything, but not before blocking her cause I don't want her ninja calling me. Deleting all social media post and blocking her then getting in contact with her sister and letting her know what's up so she don't go and play the victim. Funny thing tho, the sister said she had a feeling this would happen as her sister is fake and has only gotten more fake by hanging out with those group of females. She said her and I are cool no matter what she goes and tells her little ""girl friends"" cause she knew I dealt with alot of her shit and despite that I had been nothing but kind to her. She told me she would call her out to the family if the ex decides to go and bs or try to ruin my image in any way. So basically her sister is more loyal and trustworthy than she is. Man, makes me think I have been wasting my time with the wrong sister all these years. 
 
I also asked my mother for the tape and have put it in a secure place in case I'm ever gunna need it. Currently seeing a therapist to help me deal with that past trauma because I don't want to forget what happened to me that night. She is basically dead to me now because I don't want anything to do with a person like that male or female. 
Thanks to everyone who gave me that thought and opinions on the matter. I really appreciate it and I feel like a huge stone has been lifted of my chest. She only cared about her self and what she wanted so she can do all that as a fake ass single.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dabcoj/update_gf_of_5_yrs_says_i_should_forgive_and/,relationship_advice,1065,22,0.0

purpletowels09,2019-09-27 18:18:42+00:00,My boyfriend slapped his female coworker,"Throwaway, boyfriend knows my reddit account. I hope he doesn’t see this.. 


I’m 26F, been with my boyfriend 27M for 4 years, living together for 1 and a half (some details fudged). He has never ever been violent to me, or aggressive, or even so much as shouted. He’s never been mean to me or anything indicating he might turn to physical violence. I’d say we have a healthy relationship and we’re both stable well balanced people.. 


However, I found out 2 days ago that my boyfriend slapped his female coworker, Kate. They all went for drinks after work, and my boyfriend came back at 1am, a little drunk (more like tipsy), and said he was probably going to be fired. I was like huh? Why? And he said he wanted 10 minutes to himself and then he’d talk to me. 


I said okay, so he went and had a shower and a smoke and then he sat down with me. He said he slapped Kate. He said let me explain before I could say anything, and then he described how she’d been bullying him at work. 


He said he was embarrassed and felt awful, but he explained that she had been what sounds like essentially bullying. Like school stuff, name calling and blaming things on him, trying to exclude him from the group etc. He said that she had been even worse that day, and all evening. Then he went to the shop for cigarettes and she volunteered to go with him. He said she tried to kiss him, and he instinctively slapped her. 


I just listened and then he went to bed and I called my friend who also works at the same company (I met her through him). My friend, didn’t answer, and I haven’t heard from her since. She’s ignored my calls/texts/messages.


The next day, after he told me everything, I went to my mums house and told her what happened. She insisted that he was a woman beater and that he would eventually hit me etc. And that I needed to leave him. So I left hers because I thought she was being unfair. I then went to a friends house and she said the same thing...


Are they right? My boyfriend admits it was a hard slap and said he left immediately after, and really regrets what he’s done. He says he just snapped, he was so disgusted with Kate’s behaviour and felt he really hated her in that moment. He said it was an instinctive reaction because she was leaning in to kiss him and he was so upset by it, particularly as she’s been awful to him for the last few months, and it was so disrespectful to our relationship. 


I don’t know if he’s lost his job or not yet. I don’t know if he deserves to lose me too. I don’t know why my friend isn’t replying to me and if that means there’s missing pieces to this puzzle. 


What do I do next? Is my boyfriend dangerous? I feel so safe with him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/da4bvq/my_boyfriend_slapped_his_female_coworker/,relationship_advice,1089,421,0.0

My parents got divorced when I was very little. I have no memories of them together. My mom wanted nothing in the divorce but me and full custody, which my dad gave without much of a fight. A couple of years later he moved across the country (US) for work, and no longer used his visitations. For the past few summers I will often go and visit him for a week or two, and we face time maybe once every other weekend or so. That is about the only interaction I have had with him up until this year.

My mother got sick. Very sick. Cancer. I don't know what type, since I'm not even supposed to know. I overheard my mom telling her friend. She still hasn't told me even now. She just said that my father wanted me to come live with him for a year or two, and she agreed it might be a good idea. I know it's a lie but I go along with it to spare her because I know it's hard, we're very close. So since the end of June, I have been living with my father. 

There were the initial awkward things, he's a single bachelor suddenly living with his teenage daughter he's barely seen, so things weren't really comfortable. I am starting to get more used to being around him, but one major thing that bothers me is how much he dismisses my ""girl problems"". Primarily my period and emotions.

I have always had incredibly bad period pains in the first 2-3 days. I've been to the doctor many times, tried pills, medicines, nothing works. I just have extreme pain to the point I'm bedridden. The first few times I got my period I wasn't in school, and my dad just let me stay in my room all day. If I asked him to bring me something because I couldn't get out of bed, he'd just say ""you have two legs you can get it yourself"" or something like that. He didn't really believe I was sick, which is true I wasn't ill. Now that I'm in school, it's gotten a bit rough. My mother always let me stay home for the first 2-3 days when the pain was really bad. I would always make up work and never had any issues with grades, so it was never really a problem. Eventually the school asked and my mother explained and they didn't bother me about it again.

However, my dad forces me to go to school anyways. He says that I'm just faking the pain to get out of school, that ""it's just a little blood quit being dramatic"". He doesn't understand or believe my physical pain. I am currently on the second day of my period now and have spent both days in the nurse's office. That's where I am now, and she was nice enough to give me a hot water bottle for my stomach. The school nurse I have now seen twice in my life is more kind to me and respectful of my pain than my own father. 

Not only that but he makes me buy my own pads/tampons and won't even go through the checkout with me. When we bought them last, he sent me to the register farthest from him to pay on my own and waited for me to finish before leaving. This one here makes absolutely no sense to me. Why is a man in his 40s that embarrassed to buy feminine products for his daughter? When I'm even right there? He's not even alone so why is he so embarrassed to force me to do this?

My periods also bring intense food cravings, usually for rather unhealthy things. My dad doesn't pay for any snack-type foods I want, so I use my own money (savings from babysitting) to buy my craving food. Whenever I eat it in front of him he constantly tells me to stop ""pigging out"" because I'm gonna be ""a fat cow"". I play sports seriously and competitively. I run for 30 minutes before school. I then walk to school on my own. I always eat healthily other than this one week. One week of eating chips and ice cream isn't going to make me fat. Whenever I get bloated because of my period, he'll poke fun at me and say I'm getting chubby. It really hurts my feelings and when I tell him to stop he just laughs because I'm ""such a teenager"".

Other than my period, I am a 15 year old girl, which obviously means my emotions and hormones are a mess. Sometimes I get irrationally upset over small things. Sometimes I have to cry because I'm frustrated, sometimes I get really angry about something seemingly minor. But every single time something like this happens, he dismisses my feelings and tells me to quit being a baby. ""Stop throwing tantrums"" just because I get angry when he's blasting music while I'm studying. ""Quit crying, you're 15 not 5"" when I cried because he accidentally bleached my favorite red hoodie with non-color safe bleach so now it's ruined. Whenever I express any ""unnecessary"" emotion he tells me I'm being dramatic and need to get over it, that I'm being a child. Well I am. I'm a child with fucked up hormones who sometimes just needs to cry and not be told I'm pathetic for it. Not only that, but these feelings are heightened by the stress and anxiety and fear of my mother being far away and sick.

I really don't know how to get him to understand that my problems are legitimate and I need comfort and understanding. Other than these things, he's been doing okay as a father considering the circumstances. He's definitely the ""fun"" type parent, lets me do mostly what I want, and he at least goes to any sporting/school events. We often go out on the weekends and it's really fun to finally spend time and properly get to know my dad. I just wish he would be more understanding of me. Is there anything I can do to get him to understand?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d9zyio/my_15f_dad_40sm_doesnt_understand_and_belittles/,relationship_advice,1097,190,0.0

We came to Mexico to finally take some time off and enjoy ourselves. Last night I got DRUNK AF and woke up feeling awful, I really had a hard time today although I held my shit together and did all the activities we had planned(rafting , kayaking. Zip lines, water activities) We got to our room close to midnight and he wanted to party and go out. As you can imagine, I spent the day with a tequila/wine/beer hangover and all I wanted to do was had sex and sleep. I told him I was going to take a 45 minute nap to recover and then we could go out, he said he was feeling tired , that I could stay in the room and he’ll be out for just an hour. I fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow and woke up around 2:35 am, he wasn’t in our room and I texted and called him getting no answer so I went out searching for him. I did find him and in what way. He was with what it looked like a group of couples and he was hugging, laughing and kissing another girl, both drunk. I got SO ANGRY that I just stood in front of him and said hi and started walking away, I knew if I said anything else or saw that scene for 30 seconds more I was going to start a fight with the girl and with him. 

He didn’t walked after me or tried to find me, he just stayed there. It’s been 2 hours since. 

Can someone give an advice on how I should proceed on this. I feel so much anger right now that I can’t even think clearly.

not_me01,2019-09-27 08:10:32+00:00,I'm getting treated like the bad guy for not wanting to take care of a child that is not mine. How do I handle,"I'll make this as clear as possible.

I had a fwb relationship with this woman for two years. We are both 26. We agreed that if either of us were to sleep with other people, we would let each other know. Long story short, I broke it off because I had to relocate for work. The fwb agreement ends, and shortly after she a gets into a relationship. Months go by and she post on social media that she is expecting a baby. I try to contact her to see if there is a possibility that I am the father. Every time I asked for a valid story, I would just get told I'm not the father and eventually I got blocked. After the baby is born I get contacted because there is a possibility I'm the father because her bf was not. The bf leaves because he is not the father.

I meet up with her to talk about a potential timeline and I get tested. I am also not the father and she tells me that there was a guy she slept with shortly after me and before she met her now ex bf. Consedering the fact that I'm in a different for work, I don't keep in close contact with her anymore. A couple of weeks later some of her friends and start harassing me for not staying with her and try to talk me into being the father. Some of my family also did the same thing.

My reasoning for not staying was that I don't have a moral or legal obligation to the child, therefore I don't need to be there. They started telling me that the right thing to do would be to step up and be a man. I didn't buy into that, but that didn't stop them from continuing to harass me. They keep telling me that it would be commendable because her last partner doesn't want to be the dad. My answer is still no, yet she continues to publicly post about how I'm a terrible person for not wanting to be the dad.

I guess my question is, how do I keep my social life in tact and maneuver with the harassment from her friends and family?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d9x9sj/im_getting_treated_like_the_bad_guy_for_not/,relationship_advice,1081,181,0.0
frozone_layer,2019-09-27 02:42:26+00:00,Wife (29F) pierced hole in condom. I (27M) haven’t talked to her about it.,"My wife and I have a very up and down and sometimes unhealthy relationship. We have been better lately but we have definitely been through A LOT. 

We have a 9 year old daughter. 

Wife removed that birth control arm insert last year. Tried to go on pills but really messed her hormones so stopped so we just use condoms. 

She insists on having another kid and I keep saying “not now” or “not yet”. 

Our financial situation isn’t the greatest and I believe it would be extremely irresponsible to do that. 

Fast forward to last week, we are about to have sex and she hands me a condom. I notice it doesn’t feel “inflated” like condoms usually do when it’s unopened. 

I turn on the lights and see the obvious hole through the middle and immediately realize what happened.

I make up an excuse and say “I don’t wanna use this one, I wanna try that other one.” And place the condom back in the drawer. 

I gave her the benefit of the doubt BUT the next morning I go to check it and BAM condom is gone. 

I haven’t talked to her about it yet but I plan on it. 

It’s an absolutely ridiculous situation and I am beyond disappointed. 

Is this grounds for separation or divorce? How can I trust her going forward with anything? She doesn’t have a great history and constantly lies about stuff. I haven’t been perfect either but holy crap this is next level.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d65k4e/_/

Yeah well you guys were definitely right. I decided to talk with his cousin one on one instead of involving my boyfriend, because I wanted to avoid drama, and give her the benefit of the doubt. Very naive and stupid, I know. She denied everything, and then proceeded to 'freak out' and told my  boyfriend I accused her of wanting to sleep with him. And the waterworks started, jesus christ. I took my bf apart and explained the entire thing, and thank god he believed me. Cousin's friend had already invited him over to 'fix' her computer (he's a big computer guy) and when he came there, there wasn't much to fix and she was being very flirty and touchy. Somehow he hadn't picked up on his cousin's behavior, but he believed me.  So we kicked her out the same day. I think she has serious issues, like for real. She even messaged me saying she already slept with him lol, but now we're using that as leverage to make sure she doesn't spread any more bullshit. Family doesn't know anything about what happened, and we intend on keeping it that way.

Anyway, should have listened to Reddit in the first place. But it all worked out I guess. Though I'm still a little stressed out.

throwra_wifeaffur,2019-09-25 18:58:59+00:00,Wife’s [29/F] “Frenemy” [30/F] sent me an email outlining my wife’s attempt to reconcile with her Ex [35/M] (and sleeping with him) as we were getting more serious. I’m at work and don't know how to respond to any of this.,"My wife \[29/F\] and I \[28/M\] have been together for 4 years and married less than a year. Let me also preface this by saying I have a cold and am in desperate need of sleep. 

My wife, Katie, and I, started dating when I was in grad school. We were in the same social circle. She was in a relationship with a guy we’ll like “Mike” and it was clear it wasn’t going to work long-term. Mike was a “free spirit” and had a lot of personal issues, so none of us were surprised when they broke up. He decided to go on a retreat/road trip with his ex-girlfriend for six months and disappeared. She got over the relationship and about a year later we started dating. It was an odd coupling, we’re very ‘different’ – she’s a lot more artistic and free than I am; we’re on different levels in the looks departments and many of the things that make us who we are, are seemingly opposites. I’m more buttoned-up and traditional and she’s not. A couple of months in, we hit a rough patch but we worked through it. From then on, things were great. We moved in, I proposed, we got married and that brings us to today where we’re trying for a kid. 

My wife’s frenemy “Danielle” has never really been supportive of our relationship and they’ve been friends since middle school but have had several falling-outs over the years. Recently my wife couldn’t/didn’t attend an event hosted by Danielle, which prompted this recent outburst and along with it the end of their friendship. Danielle sent me an email saying that when Katie and I got together, she was unsure of which person to choose so when Mike returned, she went to him to talk about them. They met a few times during the first two weeks he was back and apparently had sex “once or twice”. According to Danielle, Katie ended it and never told me anything about it. She confided in Danielle about it, years ago, and I guess thought the matter was closed. I got the email this morning at 10 and was surprised Danielle emailed me and read it. Probably 30 minutes later I get texts from my wife asking if I got an email from Danielle, and did I read it. When I answered in the affirmative, she sent me a deluge of long texts explaining that it did happen, they had sex once and had coffee three times and that she hasn’t spoken to him since. I’m not sure what to respond. 

I have a cold, and have been trying to get work done so I can rest when I get home. I don’t even know how to deal with this. Part of me wants to go home, get into bed and sleep, pretending I never found out. Another part of me is furious that she hid this from me – I had a feeling she had seen her ex, but she then came to me a week or so later and wanted me to confirm we were exclusive and I wasn’t seeing anyone else. Part of me is terribly mad at Danielle for dragging this shit up years later. I don’t know what to do here. 

Is this that bad of a transgression? It feels like it was so far in the past that I don't know how to respond to my wife or Danielle.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d97th1/wifes_29f_frenemy_30f_sent_me_an_email_outlining/,relationship_advice,1140,849,0.0
notnowlana,2019-09-25 16:27:15+00:00,My fiancé (26F) cheated on me (28M) during her bachelorette party this past weekend. Lost and don’t know what to do.,"My fiancé went on a cruise for her bachelorette party this past weekend (Friday-Monday). When she got back Monday I was messing around asking her if she’s danced with anyone or kissed anyone. Right away I could see she was lying through her teeth. So I questioned a little harder til she admitted she had made-out with a guy the first night of the cruise. I was obviously furious and took a couple hours to myself before I spoke to her. Once I cooled off I told her we could work through it. I missed her while she was gone and was wanting the affection I guess. I told her I did not want to talk about it anymore and enjoy our evening.

On Tuesday she woke up saying she hadn’t slept all night and needed to call out of work. I called out too so we could play hooky together and work on getting passed this issue. While laying on our couch she was getting messages from her best friend saying they did not know if they could still be apart of our wedding in February. I asked her why her friend was being so dramatic if all that happened was a kiss. She then clams up and tells me there is more to the story. She said she went back to this guys room. I asked her 3 times if she slept with him before she finally admitted she had. I’ve also found out she slept with him the first night and continued to hang out with him throughout the cruise. She had a damn cruise boyfriend it seems.

I have been with her for 2 1/2 years, got engaged in May, and was supposed to get married in February. I have since left our apartment and am staying with my friend until I can get my head straight. She has been texting and calling non-stop telling me how sorry she is and how copious amounts of alcohol were involved in her decision making. I don’t know if I can accept the alcohol excuse. I love this girl with every ounce of my being but just can’t see there ever being trust in our relationship again. I know I shouldn’t but I feel a tremendous amount of guilt in potentially calling off the wedding. We have spent thousands of dollars planning and preparing for the wedding and friends and family love my fiancé as well. She seemed to be my soul mate and someone I genuinely wanted to spend forever with before this happened.

I am just so lost and confused and could use a little guidance or words of encouragement from someone who has experienced this situation before.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d95ori/my_fiancé_26f_cheated_on_me_28m_during_her/,relationship_advice,1129,278,0.0
Rattieraz,2019-09-25 14:39:01+00:00,Found out my (33F) partner (36M) knew he couldn't have children our entire 12 year relationship,"Hi everyone, first time poster (long time sub stalker). I (33F) and my partner (36M) of 12 years recently decided to get serious about trying to have a baby. I raised the idea of getting fertility testing done considering our ages, we wanted to have a child soonish and the cost is not a barrier to us. My partner was a little uncomfortable with the idea, which was fair enough, so we didn't pursue it. 

A few nights ago my partner went out with some friends, had a little bit too much to drink and came home a bit despondent, I ask ""hey what's up? Did something happen with the guys?"" It was like the question opened the floodgates. He admitted that due to a childhood issue he knew from a young age that it was highly unlikely he would ever be able to father children and never admitted it to me because he thought it would be a deal breaker and I would leave him. His thinking was there was still a chance that he could have children so it was not something he thought he needed to tell me. Except that apparently the guilt has been eating him for years. He also said that a part of him was 'waiting out my biological clock' so that by the time we realised we couldn't have children it would be too late for me to have children with someone else and I wouldn't leave the relationship. When he knocked back fertility testing he realised that children were a 'real' concept, he was being a selfish and horrible person and he wants me to have the choice to have children and knew that he needed to tell me, he just couldn't figure out how to do it. Leading to the drunken confession. After which he passed out leaving me shell shocked.

The next day he asked me how I feel about everything and if I hate him. I replied that I still love him but I am upset and need time to think about everything before we had a serious conversation. 

I'm still mulling this over and i need some external advice. 
My thoughts are:
Firstly, having kids is not a deal breaker for me. I would chose spending my life with him over children. 
Secondly, I'm devastated he kept this secret from me for the length of our relationship despite our in-depth discussions about having children of which he was a vocal participant. I just feel angry and upset... what else does he hide from me? Is this it? I feel like I was living one relationship and he was living another. I'm just really bloody angry. 
Thirdly, what a shitty way to tell someone you love something so important. Is this how you communicate? We are in our 30s, grow up! This makes me even more angry. I don't know if there is a good delivery but drunken crying and passing out sure doesn't seem like the right way to go.
Finally, at least he told me and it is out in the open. I recognise that when we first got together we were very young and you don't necessarily think about that stuff and maybe he became trapped in a cycle of his own making? 

So my question is where do I go next? Am I being too forgiving? Do I try and get the anger out first? Do I just swallow it and forgive and forget so that we can move forward and either remain childless or pursue other avenues such as adoption or fostering if he is open to the idea?  

My ultimate goal is for us to repair our relationship and for him to feel loved and supported while also calling him out for being a total dick and making it clear that this behaviour and secrets are not ok and that they are a deal breaker. Just, how do I achieve this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d946xs/found_out_my_33f_partner_36m_knew_he_couldnt_have/,relationship_advice,1080,143,0.0

Well we are both students studying engineering, and it was about midnight and we were both doing homework, I wound up seeing some texts between her and a guy she works with.

She immediately told me she was cheating and wants a divorce. I was really taken aback, this was out of nowhere, when we have a bunch of projects coming up and a really hard l nasty test on Tuesday.

We talked it out and I couldn't really understand what I did, but I think the main point was that I was baggy? I don't know, my brain won't let me process any of this.

We're in separate rooms, and I am just lying here, mulling it all over. Quite frankly I just... Don't know what I'm going to do. We had a life planned, we have similar goals and it was just so perfect. 

I'm a pretty laid back, trusting guy, so I don't know if I was too laid back, or too naggy. 

I talked when my best friend for a couple hours and then went to try get some sleep, but as soon as I laid down without her it just hit me like a freight train.

This is it, I've somehow screwed up again and it's coming to bite me. Oh and the reason I mentioned my birthday is tomorrow was to show my absolutely awful luck.

throwaway8675367,2019-09-25 04:12:25+00:00,How to I tell my wife I know she’s cheating on me?,"Throwaway account obvs. 

My (M 48) wife (F47) of over 20 years is bad with technology. Her hard drive on her laptop was full so she asked me to fix it so it coUld update the OS. Long story short, I did and when it rebooted, her messenger program automatically opened up and front and center was a message from a childhood friend of hers (M 47)commenting her on her oral skills. 

A little history, together with our two kids (13 and 21), she beat breast cancer many years ago. We were a badass family unit, or so I thought. But since then, we haven’t been intimate much either due to complications from her procedures, bad timing, kids, etc. We had fun when we could, but apparently it wasn’t enough. Recently, it was discovered that I have low testosterone and I have been taking steps with my doctor to fix things and get back to the way we were. She has always been a bit selfish in the bedroom, so it seems I wasn’t fast enough for her getting better and she decided to take matters into her own hands and more. 

I read MONTHS of text messages between the two of them. I had to know. They shared pics, plans and more. The worst was when she went to his  house, only 10 minutes away to have oral sex with each other while his wife and kids were away. I remember the day because she came home after and mowed the front yard as it was getting dark. I thought it was odd, but her mom had died recently and she had been doing lots of odd things due to grief. I know now it was to cover whatever sex stink she had on her so she could have an excuse to shower without me being suspicious. In their messages, they have expressed intentions to do it again and more. Threesomes, vaginal, anal and oral. They want to do it all. 

Finding this out has been a gut punch. I thought things were getting better but now I don’t know what to do. I’ve copied their messages and stored them in a few places in case I need them in the future. Part of me wishes I had never found out. I’m worried about our kids reaction if and when they find out. I’m worried her choices will get her sick, pregnant or both. And I’m actually worried about how this will affect her career if this all goes south. 

I know I need to confront her about this but am at a loss. I expect her to play the victim. To say it’s my fault for being sick and not enough for her, but I stood by her in her darkest hour and we looked death in the face together. To think that she wouldn’t do the same for me is soul crushing.

He only put his gun down then on the console, but he kept his hand resting on it. At the casino I just sat and watched him but he made us stay for two long hours. I was exhausted and every time I closed my eyes he scolded me. He let me rest in the car home and he carried me inside to bed.

I don’t understand why he would threaten me like that or treat me so cruelly. I don’t know what he was thinking. He’s at work now but he’ll be home soon and my hands shake just thinking of it.

\- She came with me to the hospital and tried her best to distract me by making me laugh (it did work at times)

*feeling vulnerable, might delete later*

Looking for any advice here, as a decision I’m about to make regarding the current custody arrangement with my ex-wife has the potential to negatively impact my family - especially my oldest daughter - no matter what the decision is. 

Background:

Ex and I have been split for 13 or so years, since my oldest was 6 months old. We were never going to work, but I tried to make it work and married her after she got pregnant (go ahead roast me). Long story short we met at a bar I was tending, started seeing each other —&gt; found out three months in she was banging another bartender buddy of mine —&gt; next day found out she was pregnant —&gt; forgave and married a few months later. I was young, confused, and acting in the manner in which i was raised. Do what’s right. 

Yes. My daughter is mine. 

Took five years to get divorced because my ex is a narcissist who used my daughter as a pawn/way to control me after I ended things. She was mentally/physically/verbally abusive. I would not divorce until she agreed to 50/50 custody, which is what is currently in place today.

My current wife and I have been together a total of 12 years, married for 8. She is an incredible woman, and I am grateful day in and day out that she is in my life - and is a great role model to my oldest. We have two other kids ourselves and have worked hard building our legacy. I’m stoked to be where I am now. Hands down. 

My ex on the other hand has been through multiple guys, had two kids with one of them and they ultimately split up. She doesn’t do much in terms of support for my oldest other than show up to the occasional softball game or buy her stuff. She is still supported by her mom as she hasn’t done anything to effectively better her quality of life, choosing to keep the same low paying job that she has had since we were together. Not necessarily relevant, but I’m voluntarily paying her $X a month because when her and her other baby’s daddy split up she asked for it because she wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford a place to live 🤷‍♂️. Things have been relatively normal/OK outside of what you would expect dealing with a narcissistic ex who doesn’t Co-parent. It’s constant stress in my wife and my lives but we deal. 

The Kicker:

About ~4-5 months ago ex meets a guy through a dating app, apparently someone she had met in person through a friend while in her previous relationship. We think nothing of it, never judged any of her previous guys, only ask/care is that she take caution with who she introduces to daughter as she is 13 and obviously very impressionable. About a month in, my wife finds out through FB that my ex is engaged. We laugh, that’s silly, only been a month. Whatever. I go to bed thinking nothing of it, people get engaged quicker than that sometimes. But there’s obviously a pattern of behavior with ex. 

I’m awoken by my wife a few hours later, she’s freaking out, I’m wondering wtf is going on. She’s on her laptop. Randomly decided to google dude to see how old he was - looked young - and the first thing that pops up is......the sex offender registry with this dudes face plastered all over it. We confront ex during normal business hours asking if she knew about this, she did just didn’t tell us. Says he didn’t do what he was convicted of. Won’t go into detail but let’s just say it wasn’t good - but also wasn’t against a child.  We express our concern and kindly but firmly ask she not have my daughter around him, especially overnight. We decide telling my daughter needs to come from us, ex has a history of twisting things and manipulating any given situation. We are up front and express our concern and are adamant she is not put in the middle, but needs to understand why we are uncomfortable with said situation. She doesn’t want custody to change, she’s 13, we tell her we will see how things go but if he or my ex so much as breathe in the wrong direction things are going to change. Everyone gets through this OK. 

Fast forward a month or so, find out he has violated his probation - not once, but twice. Not a repeat of the crime, but some minor offense. Nonetheless, he wasn’t following the rules set forth in the terms of his probation. Wife and I decide to wait it out to see if he goes back to jail - obv problem would be solved right there. Turns out he gets minimal time, to be served on weekends for a bit. 

Wife and i decide this is unacceptable and shows a history/pattern of behavior that we aren’t comfortable with. We have also seen things and heard things from my daughter that lead us to believe it may be an abusive relationship. There’s so many things wrong with this situation I can’t even get my thoughts around it. 

Met with attorney yesterday, considering filing for full custody. If i do, potentially damaging relationship with daughter and having to deal with the wraith of ex - she’s vindictive and has spent countless time making our lives a living hell just for fun. Also don’t know or trust her guy, other than what i read in court documents, so don’t know what he is capable of. 

If I don’t, and my daughter witnesses something or god forbid gets involved in something between her mom and fiancé - I am not going to be able to live with myself.

How can I make her believe I value our relationship despite this?,"My wife died unexpectedly 5 years ago. She was the love of my life and we were together nearly ten years before she passed away. After years of not even wanting to date or be involved with anyone else, I got together with my current girlfriend about one and a half years ago. We get along great and I honestly do love her. We moved in together 4 months ago. Everything about our relationship is great except she doesn't believe it's ""right"" that I still love my wife and miss her. She doesn't like the fact that I still have some of her things and photos of her etc. I thought she had a point about her/our photos being all around our apartment (she moved in with me) being disrespectful to her so I took the ones in the living room and bedroom but kept some in my study which is a room that mainly I only use. I also put all the other stuff I have of hers and from our time together in a cupboard in my study and keep it locked. I feel like I have made many an effort to reassure her and make her comfortable yet she is still not happy. She doesn't like that I still talk to my wife's family. She kind of expects me to pretend I was never married which is ridiculous. We have been fighting more and more because of this.  

I really do love my girlfriend but when she asks me things like whether I love still love my wife or whether I love her more than I do my girlfriend, it's hard for me to lie and say that I don't. And I don't think I should be expected to either. I didn't want my wife to die. I never wanted to have to find anyone else. But that is what happened and I love my girlfriend too. But I will always love my late wife too. How can I convince her that this is indeed possible? Am I not being accommodating enough?

This morning, she told me shes pregnant as she'd done 2 tests and both came back positive. She did a few more tests whilst at mine, and yep, preggers! After a long discussion, she confessed she'd stopped taking the pill about 2 months ago. Obviously I feel betrayed and annoyed. I'm not in a position where I can help look after a baby. Termination is not even a conversation she wants to entertain and I understand that to some extent, her body, her rules.

Judge_Trash,2019-09-24 10:11:00+00:00,"My (26M) pansexual GF (24F) whats to be able to sleep with other women, but doesn't want me to.","So my GF is a ansexual woman. I am a strait man. She has always been open with me about her sexuality and her attraction to women, and it's honestly been great being able to share that with a SO. However there is one issue we can't seem to reach an agreement on. She believes that she should be able to sleep with other women, and I disagree.

Her argument is that sex with a man and sex with a woman are two very different experiences. And while I satisfy all fer needs when it comes to sex with men, she also has needs that can only be satisfied through sex with women. As such, she wants to be able to sleep with other women.

My stance is that gender and sexual orientation don't matter in the context of a monogamous relationship. Hetero couples don't just stop being attracted to other people when they decide to commit to one person, they just make a decision to not act on those desires, and I feel that her sexual orientation doesn't give her exemption from this.

There is one other thing I feel is important to mention. At the start of our relationship, we had an open arrangement (her idea), however that changed the first time I slept with another woman. It turned out that she only liked open relationships when she was the only one sleeping with other people. She told me that none of her exes actually ever slept with anyone else, so when I did, she quickly changed her stance. This was actually the catalyst that lead to us deciding to be exclusive and then eventually a couple, and is the basis for my second argument. If you she doesn't want me to sleep with other women, why should I be ok with her doing exactly that? She has said that were the roles reversed I could sleep with other men if I wanted, but I feel like that is an empty gesture. Since I'm not attracted to men sexually, she knows I never will take her up on that. And when I reframe the situation to be, we can both sleep with other people were attracted to, she says I can't sleep with other women because shes a woman, therefore I don't have to go outside the relationship to fulfill those urges. She backs this up by saying she wouldn't sleep with another man because I fulfill those urges for her, but I don't feel like this is really a good argument.

So I guess my question is people of reddit, what do you think? Anyone who has dealt with a similar situation, either as the SO of someone with a different sexual orientation than your own, or as Someone who's orientation didn't match with your partners, how did you handle it?

Fu6996,2019-09-24 04:27:49+00:00,"I (30sF) need to know if I am being petty in regards to my ""stepdaughter"" (19F)?","I have been in her life since she was 12. Let's just say it has been a ride.

She ignored me the first 1+ year and I understood I was new in her life, so I never pushed it. I wanted my partner to be happy and I had read many an article on mixed families and kids, so I expected attitude.

Her mother was absent the majority of the time. My partner and I handled the finances and daily care of her. We got her to school and back, took her where she wanted, hosted sleepovers, etc.

She got a little older and her attitude worsened, although she was taking to me sometimes. She was thrilled whenever her dad and I would argue. That was annoying. But whatever, I got over it.

Then at 14 she wound up pregnant. Her mom pops up to get her an abortion. So, she goes on bc after. We keep a close eye. We had cameras in the house. 2, and not focusing on ""private areas"" like the bathrooms and bedrooms. At this point we couldn't be sure she was doing what she said, etc. She was a teen. She had let ""friends"" get into alcohol at our house when we were working.

I wanted her to stay with her mom when we worked, but neither her mom nor her agreed, so we did what we had to. We would have my partners dad drop in to be sure she was home alone and not getting into trouble every now and again.

So, her attitude continues. I tell my partner she is into something. Turns out I was right. She had multiple pregnancy tests and drugs in her room. A friend outed her behavior as far as doing sex favors for drugs, etc. This was getting out of hand.

During a confrontation where she came home late, my partner tried to take her phone. She threatened physically violence, etc. We got he copsninvilved and she went to bed apologizing.

Eventually, I find a note detailing baby stuff. I show my partner. My suspicions said she was pregnant or trying to be. She had mentioned when really young (12) she wanted a baby at 14, so I assumed she didn't get one but she still plans to.

Well, several weeks later I notice she hasn't asked for bc refill. She says ""mom said I dont have to take it"". (I'm still not certain of it was her or her mom's doing). Sure enough, she ends up pregnant again by the same guy.

She has the baby.

Not long after it is clear that parenthood is more than she thought it was. So, my partner and I are picking up the slack while she goes back to school. I buy her a car, we have a plan. She drops out again. Behavior worsens.

Later, we find she has been doing drugs around her kid, and overall not being productive. Cops are involved 3 times over theft, drugs, violence.

I have had enough. She gets voluntarily committed and after release behavior is good for 1 week. I had just gave birth and was home watching her child and my newborn during committment. It was awful.

She wanted her car and freedom again. Her dad obliged because he thought she had changes. She hadn't. Over the next several weeks her behavior worsened again. One night it exploded. She raises her fist and I warn her if she strikes me I will defend myself.

She moves in with her mom this time, because I was sick of dealing with her. Everyday it was something with her.

She had told people many things about me that simply wasnt true. As in: alcoholic, baby abuser, starved her, etc. After all I had done I no longer wanted anything to do with her, though I encouraged a relationship with her dad and her.

The only thing I stand by is she can not live in our house anymore. 

A year later and she is trying. I do not ever want to live with her again and I have told my partner I will move out if he wants her to come back.

Am I being petty? It has been a year ago that things boiled over. But I cannot get over everything we went thru with her.

Our oldest went looking for him and our youngest 1 year old followed so I took them up there and went back downstairs with our middle child. I start hearing the 1 year old getting fussy and look at the time and realize it’s about bedtime so I make her bottle, grab pjs and a diaper and head upstairs. When I get up there I realize my daughter is crying in her bedroom with the door shut, which is strange because she almost never cries at bedtime. She’s usually great about going to bed if she’s tired. I go ask my husband if he fed/changed her diaper and he said no and jokingly laughed and said “there wasn’t a bottle or diaper upstairs” as if those things are just supposed to be there without him retrieving them. I couldn’t believe not only that he would just put her in bed like that but then laugh about it. I went to grab her and realized that not only had he not changed or fed her but that she had peed and pooped in her diaper. Had I not been home who knows if he would have let her cry herself to sleep like that? It makes me sick to my stomach to even think about it. I’ve questioned his parenting in the past but this blew me away. If he can’t manage to even meet the basic needs of our very young child how can I trust him to be a good father?

We had already been discussing separation for a separate issue. He has struggled with a drinking issue for a while and had gotten sober around the time we got married and had our first child but has struggled to maintain his sobriety and I can’t continue in that cycle with him. He’s been lying about staying sober and use to be pretty emotionally abusive so I told him if he can’t stay sober we can’t work on our marriage that needs quite a bit of work if we are going to stay together.

But after last night I just can’t imagine ever trusting him again. Am I right in telling him that he absolutely has to move out now?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d8ciqg/my_30f_husband_30m_put_our_one_year_old_to_bed_in/,relationship_advice,9116,449,0.0

I posted this about a month ago and got some good advice. Thanks because this was and still is a weird situation. 

So I told my gf that: 

- There’s no scientific evidence that semen is of any benefit as a skincare product 

- Egg white is probably better 

- It’s controlling and a bit psycho to constantly ask me to jizz in a cup for her. 

She didn’t believe me at all and said that her friend (who’s a “skincare expert”) assured her that it’s beneficial. We argued and she cried, saying that I’m ruining her skincare routine and that I don’t care about her beauty. We kinda made up (yes I’m stupid) and decided to drop the subject. 

I thought she was over it. 

A week later she went and bought a mason jar. I thought she was making smoothies but she straight up told me not to masturbate for at least a month. Along with a bunch of other rules. Long story short, I told her that she’s crazy and needs to stop this. 

She said that if I refuse to help her out, she will have to ask my brother. So yeah, I told her she’s free to do what she wants since the relationship was over.

ThrorRa-momslover,2019-09-23 16:33:27+00:00,Update : My mother wants to introduce me to her lover of 12 years 2 months after my father's death.,"So I talked to my mother and what so many of you told me was true.

What happened was this :

My father was in fact abusing her. Not only financially but every fucking kind of abuse in the books.

It started shortly after their first anniversary when my mom made an off hand comment about one of his sisters and he slapped her across the face and choked her. He promised that he would never do that again. My mom believed him.

But it got more violent. It got a bit better once we were born but then got worse again.
When my mother met her boyfriend she tried to leave my father and he threatened to kill us and then her if she ever dared to leave him .
A year later my mom tried again and my father told her to go ahead but that he would take everything from her. He apparently had a friend that was a lawyer and a lot of influence on the community as he was an avid church goer. So if she left him then and there he would have taken everything from her. He told her as long as neither we nor the community knew what she was doing he didn't care. He wanted his dinner on the table everynight and his clothes ironed and he didn't care what she did with her life.

During that time my father also had some relationships of Sexual nature with some girls he mentored.

I was left speachless. I asked her why she never talked to me about that and she said she was terrified of my father.

So at the end of the day I want her to finally be happy. I told her that it would be nice if we could go to a few therapy sessions and that she needs to visit therapy for her years of abuse.


She agreed and we are having lunch with her boyfriend on Friday. I am really nervous but I think I'll make it trough. We won't tell my siblings yet because they need more time.

Concerts, baseball games, driving an hour to see family. Every day of every weekend. It’s exhausting for me.  All my time to do anything I want to do for hobbies have been totally eclipsed by non stop plans.

We recently both got big promotions about 8 months apart which nearly doubled our income so now we have quite a bit of disposable income to finance these activities.

She wanted to go apple picking on Sunday after we spent the morning on Saturday at a JV football game and then the rest of the afternoon at her brothers house. Then we had to make it to see a baseball game in the city 1.5 hours away and didn’t get home until 1am.  We also have just gotten back from our week long vacation last week.

I told her I needed a day to just relax and get some stuff done around the house. I told her we can go next weekend.

She got angry and stated she has been looking forward to this for a while told me to stop being lazy so I went.  

I was upset she didn’t listen to me and she could tell I was upset after and kept prying into why I seemed upset. I told her it’s because I tell her I’m stressed and overwhelmed and she didn’t care about it when I brought it up. 

She blew up on me said I was just lazy and wanted to sit on the couch and watch football all day, and hasn’t talked to me since.

We were out drinking with some friends (early-mid 20’s m&amp;f) and had a pretty late night. At about 4am, stuff got hot and heavy and we were a bit tired so we decided to head back to the hotel. Shortly after we got back we started to have sex. It was good at first, but after a minute it started to hurt. Like, more than just a mild discomfort or anything. It really hurt. I told him to stop, please stop because it hurts. He was on top, and he held my arm down so I couldn’t move and kept going. He said something but it was quiet so I couldn’t hear, that’s when I started to get a little panicked. So I told him again that it hurts and I want him to stop but again, he kept going. He got faster and was very rough and it started to hurt more. I told him one more time that I wanted him to stop. But about a minute later, he finished and rolled over and started ignoring me. I laid in bed and tried not to cry until I was sure that he was asleep (or almost, at least). Then I put my clothes back on and took my wallet and left. Luckily I had put my phone back in my wallet when we came back. I called one of the friends we were with and now I’m back at her flat, so I have a place to stay until I figure this out. It’s been a few hours and I haven’t slept yet (it’s 10:45am as I type this). 


I just can’t stop thinking about what happened. I feel bad. Violated. I can’t really put it into words. I’m angry, upset that he didn’t stop when I told him to and that he broke my trust like that. My body still hurts and I have a bruise on my arm from where he held me down. I told our friend what happened (in less details, she just knows we were having sex and I told him to stop and he held me down and kept going until he came, he went to sleep and I left). She immediately said that he raped me, I need to call the police. But I don’t know. I don’t know what to do or how to feel or if it really was... You know. 


He’s never done anything like this before and it just felt like a completely different side of him and I just really hate it. I told him no and he kept going and that doesn’t feel right to me. 


I just kind of need another perspective on this, I guess, and I don’t really want to talk about it with anyone in my real life. Am I overreacting to it? Is my friend being dramatic by calling it rape? What do I even do next?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d84hw1/i_21f_started_feeling_pain_during_sex_and_told_my/,relationship_advice,1135,55,0.0
easy0lucky0free,2019-09-23 07:42:44+00:00,My boyfriend's mom has hijacked our romantic vacation.,"tldr: My bfs mom offered us the use of their vacation home and then decided to come with us and has dominated the planning.

My (29f) boyfriend (28)'s parents own a condo in Maui. Theyve repeatedly told us we could use it whenever we want, so we saved up enough money for our tickets and planned our trip.

We told his parents the dates we would be there. A few days later, his mom (60) tells him that she has ALSO bought a ticket for the same time and she is coming with us. She wasnt planning to go until she found out we were going. She says they have decided to sell the condo and find a better one, and our romantic trip is apparently the ideal time for her to come look at different properties. She even told us to pack as little as possible so we could bring her stuff back with us.

 We didnt feel like we could say anything because 1) she is letting us stay at her condo for free, hence making this trip possible, and 2) she had already bought her ticket before she told us.

We arrived in Maui two days ago and we still have another week ahead of us. So far in the last two days she has completely planned our schedule. She has picked out the places we eat, and what time we go places. She has basically elected herself our tourguide. The plus to this is that she pays for everything she suggests, so we have spent virtually no money on food. She is planning stuff out for the rest of the week with no desire for our input. 

I'm grateful to her for letting us stay here and for all the money she has spent on us, but I cant help but feel a little cheated out of my vacation. Ive been dealing with some illnesses and some very stressful life events and I was very much looking forward to a nice relaxing week on the beach that is a 5 minute walk from the condo. And instead every day ive been walking several miles in hot humid weather to get to places she wants to go but doesnt want to drive to, eating places she wants to eat.

When we are not out and about, we are back at the condo,sweaty and super uncomfortable becauase she insists on having all the doors open and never running the AC, even when its 90 degrees and 70% humidity. I will try to turn the ceiling fans up to get some relief and she'll almost immediately turn them off and say something like ""why is this so high? im cold!"" And she literally never stops talking, but not in a way that actually includes us in the conversation. More like we are her sounding board for her to bounce her thoughts off. She even talks through movies we try to watch.

We havent had any time to ourselves. We had planned a beach picnic tomorrow, instead we are driving with her to a nearby town to look at houses. I suggested we check out the beaches there and she shot me down, said we would go shopping and then come back to this beach. 

We cant even have sex until its late and she has gone to bed, and even then we have to be so quiet its like we are in high school. We have planned a date night at a fancy restaurant and she has been hinting at coming with us.

I'm so grateful for her generosity and I'm actually glad to be getting to spend more time with her but I just feel like this vacation isnt OURS anymore, its hers and we are just tagging along. I wanted to be able to rest and relax and enjoy my relationship but its been the opposite and i'm worried the rest of the trip will play the same unless we say something, but I'm afraid we would come off ungrateful if we did.

Am i being an asshole or is she overstepping??",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d83bb7/my_boyfriends_mom_has_hijacked_our_romantic/,relationship_advice,1016,177,0.0
universalnocturne,2019-09-23 05:44:38+00:00,"I [28F] had my tubes tied when I was 25, and I just lost my best friend [29M] possibly forever because of it. I don’t know what to do.","Using my side account because I don’t want my main account associated with this post. If I’m breaking any rules please feel free to take my post down, I’m just lost and can’t go to any of my friends with this.

When I was 25, I did exactly what the title said and got my tubes tied. Why I did it is because my family has a history of severe mental illness (including me) and I didn’t want to pass it to any children I might’ve had by accident. I don’t care about what other women do with their bodies personally but I couldn’t bring myself to do an abortion, so since I was having sex at the time, I wanted to make sure I wouldn’t have to do that.

I met my best friend Tyler about two months afterwards. We met online through games and got close pretty quickly, and we happened to live in the same city as well so we hung out together a lot. I would do just about anything for him and I knew he would do the same for me. Of course we weren’t dating at first since we both had partners on and off again, but many of our mutual friends wanted us to get together. And for us feelings came so naturally that he asked me to go on a date officially, and we actually started dating a month ago and it was amazing. It felt so effortless and wonderful to be with someone I trusted and loved so deeply even before we started dating. But since I’m nearly 30 I’ve gotten more serious about relationships and what I want from them, so before we committed to anything huge I just wanted to make sure we were on the same page of things.

I guess I should be upfront with it. Of course we’ve never discussed kids even being as close as we were because that’s just something we never ended up talking about. So I asked him how he felt about kids and he told me he wanted lots of them, five at least and said he wanted to get started on a family ASAP. He seemed so happy and genuinely excited that I felt like my chest was being crushed. I told him that I wasn’t able to have kids, that my tubes were tied when I was 25.

He just kind of went into shock. Then he started asking me questions like I was infertile before, why didn’t I tell him before, why did I get my tubes tied, why don’t I want biological children. I told him I wasn’t, that this was me telling him as soon as I was able, and that it was my choice based on family medical history. Truth be told I don’t want to adopt either since I don’t think I’d be a good or stable parent and I want kids to have a really caring environment, and I don’t think I can provide that for them.

He flipped out. He started saying that he trusted me and that Ive betrayed him and if there isnt a way to undo the process then we’re done. I told him I never expected him to compromise, just that I told him the facts about my situation and if they didnt line up with his ideals then we would have to part as much as I didn’t want to. It hurt so bad to hear him say these things to me because I love him so much and I would never do anything to willingly hurt him.

Eventually he left and went back to his house and hasn’t answered any of my texts or calls. I’ve left him alone for now because I feel like at this point I just have to give him space, but I don’t know if theres anything left with this. I want to save this so bad because hes my best friend and soulmate and I feel like I wont be able to get this kind of connection as I get older. Especially since we’ve known each other for almost three years now and I want him to be part of my life forever, I’ve never had such a deep connection with somebody and I feel like my chest is being torn apart.

I just dont know what I should do or say or if im doing anything correctly. I feel like it would have been crueller to lie to him but like I said I would never want to hurt him on purpose, which apparently he doesnt feel the same way. Any advice at all is appreciated. I just dont know what to do next.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d82bl9/i_28f_had_my_tubes_tied_when_i_was_25_and_i_just/,relationship_advice,1109,231,0.0

I’m just devastated. I feel lost. Every time I think about this I cry. I can’t think with any clarity right now, I’m too upset, so I really need advice. My husband and I have been married for eight years. We have two children together, a son who is eight and a daughter who is four. My husband travels a lot for work, to the same city. He’s usually gone for a week each month sometimes more. It’s hard because I miss him when he’s away but he loves his career so that’s how it’s been for a while now. I’ve worried about him being away that he may cheat, but I told myself to trust him. Yesterday morning I got a email from a woman who said she’s been seeing my husband for a couple years. She told me that if I would meet with her she’d like to talk to me. My curiosity got the best of me and I agreed. I met with her today at Starbucks. She was very soft spoken, and on the surface very sweet but honestly she came across as a little arrogant. She was very pretty and from another country, she had an accent. And her evidence was  damning. She showed me their recent texts where he tells her he loves her, calls her “beautiful” and “mine”, she showed me calls from his number on her call log, photos of gifts he’s given her, photos from a vacation they went on together which is where my husband had a “business trip”, and even a photo of them in bed together. I don’t think he lets her take photos because  his face wasn’t in it but I could clearly see the tattoos on his chest. She told me that he bought her a condo and he stays with her. She said she has a son who literally calls him dad. She even told me that the bracelet and ring she was wearing were from him. I tried not to but I cried when she was telling me all of this. She told me that she felt guilty and that’s why she decided to confess to me. And she drove five hours just to do it. I have been in the dark about this. Besides thoughts in the back of my mind, I had no real suspicions. I wouldn’t have known about the expensive gifts or condo because my husband thinks I am too dumb to understand money so he doesn’t include me in anything financial. I bend over backwards for him. I cook, I clean, I have sex with him whenever he wants it, I always try to be a good wife. I don’t feel like I deserve this. I have tried so hard to be perfect for him. I wish I wanted to leave him but I don’t, I would have nothing without him. I just don’t know what to do. I don’t even know if I have the strength to confront him. I haven’t and it’s been hours, I’m assuming he thinks everything is fine.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d815g0/i_f_30_met_with_a_woman_f_25_today_who_says_she/,relationship_advice,1064,159,0.0

throwrasisterwhat,2019-09-23 00:46:04+00:00,My older sister (28) blew up many relationships because of her wedding one year ago and now she came crying back to me,"My sister was a nightmare bridezilla.

She got married a year ago and everything building to her wedding, including her wedding day.

It all started 2 years ago when she appointed her maids of honor and left me out. Which hurt like a burnt asshole but I let it go because it was my day. The moh she appointed was in another city so she asked me to plan the engagement party. I did because she was still my sister.

I planned it. She wanted like a fairy tale themed thing. I gave her the plan and she wasn't happy because it looked too cheap. I told her I was on a budget and I did my best. She said that if I upped the fancyness she would pay for half and to just write up everything in an excel sheet. So I did. Formerly I would have only been spending 200 bucks. But after uping it (and checking multiple times with her) it came to a grand total of 1,3k.

The worst part is that she spent the whole party critizising  the dj, the apéritifs everything was too bad.
She said it was a train wreck. People were enjoying themselfs and even her fiance was happy.

My mom ended reimbursing me moths later and she refused to talk to me for 2 moths.

She then threw her Bachelorette party. We went to Mallorca. The plan was to go to the party mile and go to a male strip club they have there. Then go back to hotel and drink at the hotel bar and play some drinking games.

Well it was a fucking mess. My sister had a proper melt down because a braidsmaid had on a dress that was more expensive than hers. She threw a glass of white  wine on her and screeched. Of course that bridesmaid noped the fuck out and we tried to make the evening better but the atmosphere was damped.

My sister literally said to me: I guess I have no options but replace braidsmaid with you.

I did it because my parents begged me to. She had me stand in the back in everything because my boobs were""upstaging her"".

At her wedding she was no better. She screamed at the florist because the sunflowers were not yellow enough, she screamed at her make up artists because he didn't put extra glitter on her allready loaded eyelid.

She had another fit at her wedding because her wedding cake wasn't delicious enough. She threw the whole thing at the ground.
She had a fight with her maid of honor because she told my sister to calm down and then slapped the moh. She pulled a waiter by the collar to scream at him because he brought her mil the wrong drink. It was a mess.

After the wedding she texted in the group hat that we ruined her wedding.

Well to say the least she lost every friend she had. And the woman literaly couldn't figure out why.

After her honey moon she texted me and said she forgave me and that we should meet up for coffee. I told her I didn't want to talk. She blew up.

One year later she came to my parents place and cried me a river about how she regrets how she was behaving. About how she didn't know why she did what she did. And that she misses me.

I was really taken aback and left. I don't know if I want her back. Specially now that I am getting married myself.

So, I'm going to this therapist since I'm 18 (now I'm 21) and he helped me through a lot of stuff.

Some background info: I was raped when I was 14 by an 18 old guy, who made me drunk and was using me. I was to naive and without any sexual experience, I thought that's it's, that is sex.

I realize what he did to me when I had sex with my first boyfriend. Because I could tell, no and no pressure were made. (I had always problems with saying no, I didn't wanted to impolite)

My first psychologist (Female) was the first professional person, who told me: ""This was rape""

Nearly after I went to my therapist. (Male)
To the issue now:
In one of the last sessions we were talking about this story again (happened from time to time) and he told me: ""If you make him 100% perpetrator (hope its the right word) you make yourself a 100% victim"" 
I questioned myself after and this isn't the only weird thing he said. 
""You liked him,right? Maybe you gave him signals"" ""You didn't look like 14"" and the one that triggered me the most ""Why were you drinking so young?"" I was drinking and drunk, because he knew I was not used to alcohol and handed me the drinks with a lot of pressure. And why I'm in therapy: I'm having a hard time to say ""no"".

I think it's not ok to search for my fault in this situation. And now my depression and anxiety got worse.

She stuck her finger up my butt without warning and it immediately made me squirm in pain and it was also dry. But I have IBS and I get very self conscious about what’s in my digestive tract 24/7. I wish she wouldn’t have but oh well it happened. Problem is when I asked her to take it out cause it hurt she did, and I had an accident on her bed sheets. It was like a ripping pain and then a vacuum suction out and some fecal matter came out.

She screamed bloody murder that I “pooped on her bed what the fuck!!!” And then she ran off to the bathroom to wash her fingers and was trying to find bleach. She was just freaking out. 

She asked me to leave and I did. I tried apologizing but she would have none of it.

This morning I sent a text offering to pay for professional cleaning of her bed sheets and mattress (Idk the extent of damage), but her response was “never fuckin talk to me again you gross dick”.

What the hell do I do now? How do I move forward from here?","Throwaway for this. Just happened so sorry if I'm flustered. Please help I feel so lost.  
I'll put a TLDR at bottom, although it's basically the title.  


My gf &amp; I have been together roughly 2 years. We moved to another state 8 hours away from home last September. Everything has been going great. Minor fights here and there, but always quick to realize where we went wrong and make up. So deeply in love, I really thought I could spend my life with this girl.  


She quit her job on Tuesday as it was causing her a ton of stress. I supported it fully because I could see the damage it was doing to her. She discussed finding a part time job in the mean time as there are no shortage of hourly wage jobs in the area. She also coaches figure skating and makes decent money doing that; we also have okay savings so we were not worried. I make pretty good money at my job, but I'm by no means wealthy or upper class kinda salary.   


We've had a few fights about money when I ask her to pay for a more-than-fair amount for groceries (e.g. I paid $100 this week and asked her to pay $20 for some snacks). She gets really upset about it and we had a big fight. Later that night, we sit down and have a calm discussion, in which I then get this information from her. I'll do my best to tell it as she did below:  


Her previous boyfriends were all boneheads and I'm the first person she's dated who is on the same level as her intellectually. And what she misses about her past relationships is that they put everything in their lives behind her. She was always the center of attention because they just sort of worked their 9-5 and didn't have any outside interests or aspirations, and instead focused all of their attention and energy on her. So she wants that again, instead of what I have given her which is challenging her to be better and having my own projects and goals. She has only been 'pretending to be ambitious with goals and side projects because she thought that's what she wanted.'  
ADDITIONALLY, she loves her new lifestyle of not working all day and only coaching figure skating a few hours in the afternoon. Her ideal lifestyle is to be a Beverly Hills housewife, and have a man be the breadwinner and take care of her and all her needs. While providing all of his attention and focus on her.   


Friends, I'm not sure I can continue this relationship after hearing this conversation. I'm just dumfounded I guess and I'm feeling really lost and unsure of the future. I loved this girl to my core just yesterday and now everything hurts.  


So, first, am I crazy for thinking this is a deal breaker? Second, if you advise to leave the relationship, do you have any advice on how? Or how to fix this maybe? Our lease ends this month and we have an unofficial understanding with our landlord to renew, but I'm seriously reconsidering now because of this. She can't afford this place on her own either, I don't want to seem like an asshole leaving her stranded.  


TLDR; Gf said everything in title, which is directly contrast to everything I had thought I knew about her. Not sure how to proceed in the relationship, and if leaving, how to proceed logistically since we live 8 hours from home town and she cannot afford rent in our apartment alone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d74x7g/my_22m_gf_22f_recently_quit_her_job_just_told_me/,relationship_advice,7280,1510,0.0

Last night was a hell of a night but some of you wanted and update. 

I came home from a friends house and he was playing on his Xbox, I asked him to finish one last game and stop for a bit so I could have a discussion with him. After about 6 games later he came in to talk...

I again brought up the whole ‘him paying for ex’s food and not mine’ he sighed and said it wasn’t as deep as I was trying to make it. It then boiled down to him screaming that I make way more money than him so I shouldn’t make it into a big deal then stormed into his gaming room.

Around 1am I get a call from the ex... she says that she’s engaged and has absolutely NO interest in my bf and she didn’t know how him paying for her food was an issue, after explaining that he has yet out of 2 years paid for a meal for me (without me at least paying him back) it didn’t seem right. She agreed and said she’d talk to him and make sure there’s no trying to ‘win her over’ shit going on. 

About 30 minutes later bf comes out of gaming room and profusely starts apologizing and crying that he didn’t know I felt this way and that he now see’s what he’s done wasn’t okay and that he agrees I deserve to be spoiled. I comforted him but told him I needed time to think about all of this. 

This has been a wild couple of days and I have a lot of serious thinking to do. Thank you all for the advice.

3 month ago, I found out my wife was cheating on me. I had to find out the hard way, by being alerted by suspicious behavior and putting small pieces of evidence together. 

To fully understand my question, I have to go in detail here: We were always a very close couple, spent most of our time together and generally enjoyed each other company. We were not only lovers, but also best friends. When travelling, we sometimes spent several months together 24h/day without being uncomfortable. 

A few month ago, my wife suddenly changed, saying that she needs timeouts from busy family life and wants to be alone. She told me, she would go for long walks or meet distant friends. I was completely fine with that at first. Suspicion began to raise slowly, as her stories became more and more implausible. I finally confronted her with some solid proofs of her lies and she confessed the affair a day later. She also admitted, that many of her “timeouts” were just an excuse to meet the other guy. My wife promised to end the affair immediately. I believed her and as I still love her, I decided, that I was willing to forgive her. 

Since then we didn’t really move forward. She agreed to marriage counseling, but stays distant, says that she wants to be alone, is unsure about her feelings for me and needs time to find out if she still wants to be with me. If I make a move towards her (e.g. ask her out for dinner) she mostly considers this as pressure. So, for the moment I have no other option than to stay calm and give her time.

I can handle the uncertain future fairly good, but I am struggling to trust her again. She still goes for long walks regularly and sometimes this triggers me quite hard. While she is away, I often feel miserable, thinking how she might be cheating again. I find myself seeking for proof of my suspicion, like I found the last time. 

I know that trust cannot be build up by control and controlling behavior will not help her feelings for me to return, so mostly I don’t tell her anymore, when I feel the urge to control her.

I talked to her about my bad feelings at first and suggested to turn on the location tracking feature of her phone during her walks. Just for a limited time, until I feel better. We had a long discussion about it, but in the end, she did not agree, as she doesn’t want to be controlled and doesn’t think it is helpful to regain trust.

My trust slightly improved over the last few weeks. We made some very small progress in our relationship and I am learning to deal with “trigger moments”.

Until two days ago… I don’t know what exactly was the cause, but I felt like seeing warning signals again that evening. She told me, that she was on the phone with a friend while she was away.

I didn’t say anything that evening, but spoke to her the next day. I explained very calmly, that I felt uncomfortable that evening and that she could help me very much, if she would show me the call list of her phone to prove, that she was really on the phone with her friend.

She got very angry, telling me, she won’t let me see it, as it would be an invasion into her privacy and I should work on my controlling behavior. 

Am I right in thinking, that either she is lying to me again or not wanting to work on our relationship at all (in making a step towards me)?

Or is she right in saying that control should never be an option and there have to be other ways to reestablish trust?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d6uqef/i_41m_am_trying_to_reconcile_with_my_cheating/,relationship_advice,1248,465,0.0

I’ve turned a blind eye to suspicious things he’s done. But please don’t judge me for that, he’s a very good manipulator. He made me feel so special, I just didn’t want to throw away what I thought was a good thing. He payed for my condo, is always giving me jewelry and flowers, takes me on trips. He promises me that he will marry me one day. I only see him a few days a week. The rare times I have questioned why he didn’t come around more he told me he’s busy with work. I never pressed him too much about anything, I always got the vibe he expected me to be submissive to him. When I found out I was pregnant, he was “happy” but I hoped he would be more involved then he was. He would call me to see how I was but he started to seeing me less. He wasn’t even there when I gave birth. He lied his way out of it and sent flowers and gifts for the baby to my apartment. My daughter is four months old now and he’s seeing more again. Probably because my body is completely back to how it was before. He has almost no interest in our daughter, all he does is give me money to take care of her. But this morning, I got a dm on my Instagram from a woman. She asked me about him and then told me she was his wife. She wanted to meet me at a coffee shop so I did. She was in tears the whole time we talked. They have been married eight years and have two children together. She put a lot of blame on me and told me she wanted me to never see him again so she can save her marriage. I was so stunned, I barely spoke. I just told her I was sorry that this is happening to her and that I didn’t know. She asked me if the necklace I was wearing was from him. I nodded and she tried to rip it off of my neck. I just didn’t want to stay anymore, and I left. This was a few hours ago. I have no idea what I am supposed to do now. I feel hopeless. I can’t say I am too surprised but I am hurt and I feel used. I haven’t confronted him about it. But I will, I just don’t know what to say. I don’t know what my future looks like at all now. All I can do is cry.

First of all let me start out by saying that I am shocked by my father's death but I don't really Mourn him. We hadn't talked in almost 10 years since I came out as gay. He cut me off. He didn't come to my graduation and neither did he show up to my wedding mMy mom on the other hand never turned her back and I have a great relationship with her, even if I resented her for letting dad treat me that way.

Now to the situation.

My father died 2 months ago from an aneurysm. It was out of the blue and my family was destroyed. My brother and sister are still very much in the grieving phase and are seing a counselor.

A few days ago my mom shows up at our appartement (my husband and mines). She broke the news to me that she wanted me to meet somone very special to her. Basically she had been seeing this guy for 12 (TWELVE!!) years and now that she is ""free"" she wants to finally start living her truth and start being happy.

I get it dad was an asshole and had an iron fist on all finaciall issues in our lifes, while she was a stay at home mom.

But she could have called me if she wanted out? It just strikes me as my mother being a coward.

I don't know if I should tell her sure let's invite him. What would you do in this situation?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d6is97/my_father_62_passed_away_2_months_ago_and_my/,relationship_advice,3174,268,0.0
textualhealing123,2019-09-19 13:23:00+00:00,"I (32M) helped 10,000+ Redditors get over their breakups and now my girlfriend (30F) wants to breakup with me because of it","Apologies for the length in advance, I’m going to give some background so that the context is clear here

A little over a year ago, I went through a rough breakup and it hit me hard. Without going into the gory details, I was blindsided and had my heart ripped out and stomped on. Friends and family were sympathetic and supportive, but after the novelty of it wore off (for them), they got tired of me yapping about my breakup. As a result, I felt super isolated and alone. It occurred to me that there should be an online Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) style meeting where I could talk to other people experiencing the same thing as me. Being a software developer, I went to r/breakups and offered to build an “online AA for breakups” if enough people wanted it. To my surprise, almost 2000 people replied saying that they wanted it and my post got pinned. So, I built this platform in my free time after work and opened it up to everyone on r/breakups. 

Eventually, I felt ready to start dating again and I met a Maya (30F). We hit it off immediately and by date #4 we were exclusive. We connected on multiple levels and things got serious rather quickly. 

As more and more people began using the breakup recovery project I ended up devoting increasing amounts of my free time to maintaining, improving and expanding it. It was cool to see people use something I made and it was helping a crap ton of people. Basically my life became a loop of working my day job (which I hated), working on the platform (loved) and spending time with Maya (loved). Maya was super supportive and on many occasions she would tell her friends how proud she was of me/my project. Life was good!

Fast forward to this month. Maya went on a holiday with her family. I was invited but couldn’t go. Throughout the trip we were in touch over text/calls as per normal. However when she came back I immediately sensed something was off. I ask her about it but she assured me nothing was up. I chalked it down to jet lag and let it go. Then, three days ago, I come back home from work and she drops a bomb on me.

**The Ultimatum:** She wants me to give up my project and focus on my day job. If I do this, she would like to get engaged. If I don’t, she will reluctantly breakup with me. 

It was a long conversation and my mind is still reeling but I’ll try my best to summarize her reasons:

* She’s worried the time I’m spending on this project will negatively impact my career progression and/or I might quit my stable job to work on it fulltime. “You are 32 years old, not a 22 year old college grad. Think about our future”

* I am not prioritizing her. “You spend more time talking to broken hearted girls on the internet than you spend talking to me” (I spend most of my time writing code which is very different, but she wasn’t having it)

* Her younger sister Ella (27F) has been dating someone for 5 years and wants to get married ASAP. In Maya’s culture, if the younger sister gets married before the older sister, people assume that there is something wrong with the older sister. So Maya would be put in a difficult position if I don’t end up marrying her. Ella and her mother have been putting a lot of emotional pressure on Maya apparently. 

* She never previously brought this up because she thought this project would just fade away but now it’s become clear to her that I’m taking it seriously. She says it wasn’t a big part of my life when we met and that she “didn’t sign up for this”.

I was so taken aback by all of this I reached out to my mom for advice. She categorically told me that giving up Maya was not worth it and that she would be deeply disappointed in me if I let Maya go. In retrospect, this isn’t surprising given that my parent’s immigrated to America and my dad fell seriously ill (brain cancer) when my brother and I were very young. So my mom’s been through a lot and we struggled financially throughout my childhood. As a result, my mom’s default is to seek/suggest the path of minimal risk in any situation. She has constantly tried to steer me clear of anything even remotely unconventional because in her world, stability is the ultimate achievement. My elder brother (35M), who is super successful in his own right, also sided with my mom on this. They both feel it is time for me to ""settle down"" and build a career/family.

I’m not sure what to do here. On one had I genuinely love her and want to spend the rest of my life with her. Up until this point, we have had literally 0 fights and everything has been great. It’s clear she loves me too and wants to spend the rest of her life with me (she proposed getting engaged). She’s also not wrong – I have been spending a lot of time on this project and have not been as focused on my career as much as I could have. I do find myself working on weekends when everyone else is out having fun, which is unfair to her. If I just stay the course, I know me and her can have a good comfortable life because my job pays well. Maybe she, my mother and brother have a point about taking unnecessary risks. 

On the other hand, I’m so pissed off that she basically ambushed me with this ultimatum and isn’t being supportive of something that I care deeply about. This career that she wants me to pursue is basically meaningless to me – it’s a paycheck, I’m not inspired by the work I do at all. It’s like every morning I’m part of some late-stage-capitalism dystopia where I ride the train to work like a zombie and work on something that bores the heck out of me. I’ve found meaning and purpose in this project that I can’t put a dollar sign on.  It feels like I’m being forced to make a major life decision because of her sister’s wishes and I don’t know if I can trust her to be supportive of my dreams/goals in the future. Or am I just being selfish?

**TL;DR:** My girlfriend wants me to me to choose between her and a project that I care a lot about. Follow my dream girl or follow my dreams?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d6dzey/i_32m_helped_10000_redditors_get_over_their/,relationship_advice,5749,985,0.0

original post

Its been 2 weeks since I posted. I ended up asking him straight up if I indeed saw them kiss. I didn't accuse him of anything. He denied it, ofcourse he did. His reaction seemed genuine, and I decided to trust him, but I wanted to get to know the girl a little bit better, and I asked him if he could tone down the workouts with her because well, it made me uncomfortable. He agreed, though kinda reluctantly. It all went too easy. Fast forward to Friday, and he breaks up with me. I ask him if it has anything to do with the girl, and he confesses that they're getting together. He claims he never did anything with her while he was with me, loool right. I left to stay at my mom's house for a few days and I came back today, he can sleep on the couch. I know he had the girl over because there's clothes  in the washer that aren't mine. I had to change the sheets because it simply disgusts me that he has the nerve to bring her over this fast already. Who knows probably wasn't the first time either. I'm just ahhh. I'm angry but sad, and hurt and I don't know. I guess he got himself a nice upgrade to a prettier and younger version. Atleast he's not bothering me.

She has been depressed for years, we have super religious parents who said that being gay “won’t work in this house”. How can I show support/help her without making her feel like she has to reveal anything to me?","I’ll give you guys a bit of a background here. My sister has always been interested in “male stuff.”  Hanging out with my brother and I all the time growing up probably influenced that. However, she always dressed cutesy, was obsessed with Bieber, did a lot of stuff that you’d “expect” from a girl. Most of that was my parents, though. As she has gotten older, her style has changed, she has many LGBTQ+ friends (this is not an assumption this is a fact). Her closest “friend” is Mary (fake name), who I’m pretty sure is her girlfriend. They spend the night with each other doing “sleepovers” 3-4 nights a week, 5-6 nights during this past summer. They always cuddle and are very loving toward each other. Today was when I went from 75% sure to 90% sure that she is gay: my brother’s friend, who is friends with siblings of my sister’s friends, accidentally revealed in front of him that my sister is gay and backtracked and claimed to be joking, as they know that he is a friend of my brother.

My sister has acted quite sad and depressed for 2-3 years now. My parents are very religious (mostly my mom), and my sister even goes to a Christian camp every summer which I think she actually enjoys. In fact, I think she is in a Christian, but is conflicted about her orientation in relation to her beliefs. 

I feel as though that, if she were to come out, my father would be supportive, but my mother would not. My sister was willing to tell her friends that she is gay but not her own brothers who she knows she can fully trust?

I know I made a lot of predictions as to what is actually happening in the situation, but it’s been stuck in my head. My sister never leaves her room, is gaining a lot of weight, and has the pressure of her sexuality on her mind. Not to mention that her friends aren’t that great.

lolusher,2019-09-17 04:35:17+00:00,I'm out $600 after my(29m) best friend(31m) and his wife(29f) made me the door mat at their wedding.,"Groom and I had been friends since middle school and best friends since high school. I'm one of the only people he talks to about his emotions, which is particularly important because I've been his go-to for advice, especially in relationships. In fact, since knowing him, I've talked him through each of his break ups. We've mutually called each other brothers, he helped me move, I helped him plan and throw his mom's 60th birthday party just last year. I'm close with his family, his mom actively asks about me. I've also been close to each of his significant others, save for his now wife.

A month after his engagement, 6 of the 7 Groomsman Invitational Boxes went out. We have a very tight knit group of friends that have been together since high school, supplemented by college and work friends. Of the original high school group, I was the only one not asked to be a groomsman. This obviously stung, but I maintained a jovial demeanor towards everyone while acid flowed in my veins. It triggered my depression for a solid month where I questioned so much (do any of my friends even care about me? am i not groomsman material? is it because they thought i was too fat?) until the Groom and I had a talk.

He said it was a very hard decision choosing groomsmen, which I'm sure it was. He told me that I was in the original roster of groomsmen (only 6 out of 7 had received invitations) but that the Bride would not sign off on my involvement. Apparently, I had said something off-color about their relationship as it was beginning and she held it against me ever since. She'd apparently never brought it up until now, years later, and never gave me any indication of being uncomfortable with me (her family even loves me). I'm generally a very positive, well-received person, so this was news to me. He said it was tearing him up inside, and I believed him at the time, and he asked me to try and talk to her, see if we could make amends. He said that he'd let her know that I knew about how she felt towards me and that I'd be reaching out to talk about it. So I messaged the Bride through text and DM, saying (paraphrased), ""Hey! I'm so sorry if anything I've said has upset you. Can we meet sometime and talk? I'd love to clear it up, or hear your side at least."" The Bride leaves me on read, and a month later, the final Groomsmen Invitation Box goes out to another friend.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, the Bridge, Groom, and I are hanging out at a mutual friends birthday. Groom and I are talking, and I'd since been able to process the reality of not being involved in my best friends wedding, so I ask how he's doing, and how all the prep is going. The conversation leads us here...

Groom: Hey man, I wanted to know if you could help me out with something?

Me: Sure. What's up?

Groom: I was wondering if you would want to usher for me? It's no big deal if you can't, but I want you to be there for me if you can, you know? Like, be a part of the wedding.""

Me (very touched): Yeah! Of course I can, dude. Anything for you two.

Groom: Thank you so much. You know, we also have the rehearsal dinner next week. I know it's late notice, but if you can make it...

Me: I'll have to see if I can leave work early, but I'm already there, man. Thanks for thinking of me!

A week goes by with no updates or details on ushering or the rehearsal dinner, so I shoot him a text saying, ""Hey man! Big day's this weekend. Just wanted to reach out and see if you still needed help with ushering, or if you'd still like me at the dinner. I got the time off with my boss, so I can definitely make it. Just let me know."" He returns my text a few hours later with a call saying (paraphrased), ""Yeah man, we would still like you to usher. I'll text you details later today, but we actually don't need any help at the rehearsal dinner, we kind of want it to just be the bridal party and stuff, but yeah. Thanks for helping us out!"" I'm a little put out, but I persevere. At least he asked me to be an usher. That's something, right?

Morning of the wedding comes around and I'd still not received any details on what ushering is going to be like, or what time I should show up to the reception to start helping. Then Bride messages me asking for a favor. These messages were juxtaposed perfectly against the unanswered messages I had previously sent the bride to olive-branch our relationship. Bride says they forgot about the appetizers &amp; need someone to pick them up. Can I do this for a bride, on her wedding day? Sure. Oh, one more thing, the order hasn't been paid, but they'll give me money at the ceremony, or pay me back at the reception. **Sure.**

At this point I should have stopped and asked myself, ""Why am I helping so much? Why didn't I ask for their money up front? Should being a good friend really cost you so much emotionally, physically, or monetarily? Why would they ask their friend with the smallest car to pick up 15 boxes of appetizers?"" Hindsight. 20/20. With the ceremony ended, my group of friends who weren't in the wedding party spend the hour and a half before the reception pre-gaming while I go pick up the appetizers in my very small car. Thank God I played as much Tetris as I have, because fitting all that in my car in such a way that they wouldn't otherwise topple and ruin the wedding was an all-time high score achievement. I text the Bride to let her know we've got everything together and I'd see them at the reception. Once again, left on read.

I get to the reception venue expecting a bustling crew of event organizers and family to receive me and help bring the food in. I find no leadership at the venue, no planners, no family who weren't already seated at their tables and otherwise willing to help the newlyweds get things ready. The venue does have staff, but they are all preoccupied with in-venue needs. So I have to carry all the appetizers inside by myself.

Since guests were already seating themselves, I immediately moved from placing the last appetizer box in the back to working usher duties at the front. It was a fucking mess. At one point, I was so down about the situation that I literally googled, ""is it an insult if someone asks you to usher their wedding?"" To start, the place cards were in no discernible order. They were also written in intricate cursive that was sometimes unclear. I should mention, too, that because of the cultural heritages of our newlyweds, we had some very interesting, hard to spell, and sure as shit hard-to-read-in-cursive names. We weren't given a table map, or a master list, or any direction at all. The best part is, I say ""we"" because at this point I met my ushering-peers; they were the Grooms youngest adult cousins, a pair of sisters aged 18 and 19 (I'm 29), and they were really good at finding names and seating people. When I asked why they were so good, they said, ""they always make us do this because no one else wants to. We did this at the wedding last year.""

After finding out that, to the Groom, I was about as equal as the lowest-rung of his family, my group of not-in-the-wedding-party friends shows up and, when seating them, I realize I am not seated with them. Odd. At least I'm seated the table next to them. They ask me to stay for a drink, but I can't because I'm still ushering. As I step back behind the name card table, I take a look out the door to my left and see the groomsmen laughing and taking a selfie. To my right, I see all of my other friends at a table without me, taking a shot. I look down at the random, nonsensically ordered name cards and I wonder, how did I get here?

The wedding proper begins, and luckily the rest of my table shows up and I actually have friends seated with me. I'm sure it's true of other weddings, but it seems like the bride and groom don't really engage or reply when I walk up to them with my hugs and congratulations. I can understand this. Maybe they're burned out. Maybe they're trying to hold back things from boiling to the surface.

Now the last song is playing, and the lights are on, and everyone's getting ready to go home and the Groom approaches me.

Groom: Hey, thanks again for your help. I was wondering if I could borrow you again?

Me: What's up?

Groom: Did you drive here? We have stuff we need to get back to the hotel... it could really help us out.

Me (internally): WHERE ARE YOUR GROOMSMEN, BRIDESMAIDS, FAMILY, OR LITERALLY ANYONE ELSE THAT HAVE GOTTEN TO SIT BACK AND RELAX

Me: ... how far is the hotel?

Groom: 10 minutes away.

Me (for a Groom, my best friend, on his wedding day: .... Sure.

Get to hotel, unpack everything, it's 12:30am, I'm hungry. Groom says to stick around, we'll hang out, drink more. He goes to get changed, I say I'm gonna grab food &amp; come back. Groom asks for food for he &amp; Bride. I say sure. Bride's cousin overhears &amp; asks me to buy her food too. Sure. Then she asks the room at large who'd like food. Now I'm buying food for almost the whole after party. Cousin says she'll venmo me when I get back, &amp; she'll pay for everyone elses stuff. **Sure.**

Come back, cousin is passed out. Drunken zombies grab whatever food they see. Groom walks up to me, burger in hand, &amp; says he's actually really tired so he's gonna go pass out, but thanks for the food and help, and then leaves. I grab my food, take the elevator to the first floor hotel cafeteria, &amp; eat alone, upset, in silence. At this point, I'm out $500 for the appetizers, $80 for the late night food run, and am pretty sure that I never really had a best friend to begin with. I feel used, humiliated, upset, and incredulous. I went from, ""being a groomsmen,"" to being a guest, to being an usher, to being an unpaid wedding coordinator. This was the first wedding in my close knit friends circle and it turned out nothing like how I thought it would. I've never worked so hard for such little gratitude and I'm left wondering how I could have been such a chump, and how many other times I'd been taken advantage of for being helpful.

The advice I'm hoping for is, how can I go about expressing how terrible a time I had at his wedding without insulting him, if I should do that at all, how can I develop myself to not be put in situations like this, and when would it be appropriate to ask for the appetizer money back? Also, I feel like the missing puzzle piece is the Bride's side of the story, but she still hasn't given me any indication of what I did to her. I know she read my texts about wanting to clear the air, she had to have when she asked me to get the appetizers. How can I start a dialogue with her and sort this out if she won't even acknowledge it? Should I just step away from this relationship all together (after getting back my money)?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d5c1qx/im_out_600_after_my29m_best_friend31m_and_his/,relationship_advice,28896,4390,0.0
ThrowRATTATA,2019-09-16 14:10:16+00:00,I (F) need advice on how to best deal with a follower of mine (30M) who has autism and continues to spend large amount of money on me.,"A few quick notes - I am an artist with a pretty large following on Instagram. I often get fan mail and so, have a POBox publicly available. Being an artist is my full time gig and I often sell art that goes for $200-$300, to give you a range of what I usually make. This may end up being long, but there's quite a few details I want to explain.  


About a year ago, I received a message on Instagram from one of my followers (Ill call him Jake) asking me to follow him back on instagram. Jake had a basic, public account where he just posted pictures about a game he liked. I refused but thanked him for following me. I explained that I just don't follow accounts and that I was sorry. He wrote me back about 5 paragraphs worth of text basically begging me to follow him and explaining that he had Aspergers and that it would mean the world to him if I followed him back. I'll be honest, it tugged at my heartstrings. I thought it over for a bit, and decided it was no big deal to follow him, so I did. He was extremely happy - I got about 3 or 4 more paragraphs from him.  


He wrote that he had multiple instagram accounts - about 20 - and that he was going to like all of my posts and follow me with each one over the course of a week as thanks. I told him he did not have to do that, but he did it anyway. Over the next few months he would write me a few paragraphs asking about random things and I would write back. The conversations were friendly enough.  


During this time, I set up a second Instagram page where I would be selling my artwork and various other things. Jake found it, followed it, and messaged me that he was interested in buying some of my artwork. I sell my stuff through auctions, so he wanted to know how to participate. I explained it to him.  A few days later I hosted a new auction. Usually the pieces start below $100 and are gradually bidded up over time. Jake immediately bidded $400 on the piece. I messaged him explaining that he should probably start closer to the current bid, but he refused and said that he really wanted the work. I sold it to him, he paid, I didn't really think much of it.  


Over the next few months, this would continue to happen. I would post something for sale, he would immediately buy it. During this time, he got my email address from an order he placed with me. He began sending me emails from 10 separate email accounts - always the same email, just copied and pasted - that were up to two full pages long of size 10 font text. They were always very random - he would ask me what my favorite food was, he would ask if I know any of my followers in real life, if I did, what were their names and email addresses, what was my birthday, did I like certain music... it would go on and on. In the beginning, I would answer non-revealing questions just to be nice. But I couldn't keep replying to 2 page long emails every day. I eventually just quit responding.   


Jake continued to buy things from me for prices way above what I wanted for the items. When I quit responding to his emails, he began copying and pasting them into Instagram messenger and sending them to me. When I quit replying there, he started printing the emails out (sometimes up to 5 pages of text) and mailing them to my POBox with express next-day shipping - usually costing about $40 per package according to the labels on them. He also started mailing me gifts he bought for me as well.  


This got me really freaked out, and I sent him a very short and concise email. I told him I do not want him emailing and messaging me so much. I have a business to run, and I cannot keep replying to all of his questions. I also stated that while I appreciated the gifts, I felt uncomfortable with how much money he was spending on me, and to please spend it on himself in some way instead and that would make me much happier.  


For a few weeks, this worked. Everything quit. He quit buying things too. I figured he moved on.  


My ""birthday"" came - I had given him a fake date early on when he had asked me about it. I got 20+ emails all with a dozen or so paragraphs wishing me happy birthday and, once again, a ton of questions that had nothing to do with it. Begging me to follow his youtube account. Asking about places Id been or wanted to go, favorite drinks, just on and on. He also told me about his caretaker taking him to see a movie, his own age, and a bit about his family in this email (non of which I had asked about). He doesn't work. His father died early after he was born, and his mom was very elderly (I think he said 80+). His mom gives him allowance every month and that sometimes he asks her for more money to buy my artwork. When he would buy my stuff, he paid with a paypal account that was under a woman's name, so I guess that's where the money was coming from.  


I again, reiterated that I wish he wouldn't spend so much money on me.  


Now, present time, he is still spending up to $1000 on my art every month. He also just mailed me a package of ""his favorite snack"" that he bought for me to try. Again, express shipped.  


And now I'm here to ask for advice. I've tried treating him like I would a normal person. I've tried to completely ignore him but I have to talk to him when he buys my stuff. I've tried being nice to him, asking him to stop multiple times. I can't block him because he has multiple accounts and has bragged to me before about how he has even more than I know about. I can't hide my POBox address from him, plus he already has it. I'm just at a loss at this point. My mom told me to tell him I was married and that my husband was starting to get jealous, but he has never acted like he was romantically attracted to me at all, his questions are always very tame, and that wouldn't stop him anyway, I don't think. At this point, I only communicate with him when he buys my stuff, but I still feel extremely guilty about him spending so much of what I assume is his mom's money.  


Sorry for the long story. Any advice is appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d516pv/i_f_need_advice_on_how_to_best_deal_with_a/,relationship_advice,1398,208,0.0

I’m disgusted.  It was her ex, whom I’ve always felt inferior too like she just hadn’t gotten over him even after over a year.

I’m distraught.  I don’t even have anyone else in my life rn.  My two best friends cut me off over something stupid a few weeks ago, i just moved into Uni and i have only really “clicked” with one guy friend.  My family and I don’t even get along nor communicate much.  I lost my confidant, my support system, and my best friend all in one night.

She’s REALLY sorry.  I saw her crying when she didn’t know I could see her and she was hitting the steering wheel over and over again.  I feel bad but like the lying and deception isn’t new.  I had to do it.  I told her we’re over, but she’s welcome to try to win me back or whatever idc.

But FUCK this sucks.  I have mental health issues and so my coping skills are practically nil and I just don’t know how to cope with this.  I can’t eat.  I can’t sleep and I have class in the morning.  I keep picturing the texts and visualizing him “pounding” her and I’m just disgusted.  I’m just obsessing over it and it’s 4 am in the fucking morning.

Part of me just wants to let it slide if she does show effort at getting me back.  I know in a while I’ll be ok but I just don’t know how to get from part a to part b.

tealocks,2019-09-16 04:05:11+00:00,Am I (19F) being unreasonable for asking my roommate (19F) not to walk around naked while my boyfriend is around?,"I recently moved in with new roommates, the one important for this post we will call Kara. Kara is in an open relationship with her girlfriend and regularly has sex with both genders. Kara is very comfortable with her body and will walk around our apartment naked, sometimes hanging out in common areas for hours.

As a woman, I don’t care when she does this if it’s just my roommates and I. Our apartment is very body/sex positive. I asked Kara if she had any encounters with our other roommates boyfriend and she laughed and said that he has seen her naked several times, but it just made things a bit awkward for awhile. We then had a DETAILED discussion about my boyfriend, and I said that I thought it would make both of us uncomfortable if he saw her naked. I later talked to my bf about this privately and he said that he is so desensitized to human bodies as a pre-med major, but we both agreed that it would be better if he didn’t see her naked. On another occasion, Kara and I were talking about fetishes/kinks and she encouraged me to take an online BDSM test. Upon seeing my results, she said that she was surprised by my percentages and then mentioned that she ranked 100% in five categories, one of them being exhibitionism. I remember not being surprised by this but not really thinking much of it.

This weekend, I come back to my apartment with my drunk bf and begin making him something in our kitchen. My roommates were still awake, one of them wearing an oversized t-shirt and underwear to talk to us which I was fine with. Kara announced from the bathroom that she had just showered, was naked, and coming out to talk to us. I say my boyfriend is in the kitchen, she says “I mean, I don’t care if he sees me naked,” and begins walking into the hallway. I stop her halfway to the kitchen and ask her to please put something on before coming to talk to us. Kara then walks into the kitchen wearing a short towel but is still naked underneath and stood talking with us for about 40 mins. The entire time she was talking to us, she was fidgeting with the towel, a few times unwrapping and rewrapping the towel around herself, exposing her breasts and genitals. My boyfriend was drunk enough that he didn’t notice any of the times she did this.

I haven’t brought up the conversation we previously had because I feel like she should have remembered my blatant discomfort and strong stance. Previously, she argued that bodies are just bodies, it isn’t her fault if people sexualize the way that she looks. She is paying to live in our apartment too, she should be able to feel comfortable and she won’t stop walking around naked.

My argument - I agree that bodies are bodies. I don’t know why it makes me uncomfortable, especially because I’m fine with my boyfriend watching porn. I trust my boyfriend completely and know that nothing would happen between the two of them, but for some reason, the idea of him seeing Kara naked is disgusting to me and makes me upset.

I know that because I have such a visceral reaction to this I may not be considering both sides of this situation. At the end of the day, I would prefer to be friends with my roommate as we’re both on the lease for a year and will be seeing each other regularly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d4vi1o/am_i_19f_being_unreasonable_for_asking_my/,relationship_advice,1278,293,0.0

It was all really good advice, but the very best out of it all was the suggestion that I come clean to Sam. I did that, and he reacted in a surprisingly calm manner. I asked him how he’s taking it so well and he told me he’s experienced something similar before. 

His cousin had come out as gay a few years back, and he told me how his own grandparents reacted very poorly to his cousins revelation. He told me they absolutely refused to acknowledge the fact that he was gay and said some pretty hurtful stuff along the lines of how his homosexuality would embarrass them in front of all their family and friends etc. They wouldn’t allow the cousin to bring his boyfriend to family gatherings, and threatened to cut him out out of their inheritance unless he “got his head straight”. 

He then showed me pictures of his grandparents laughing along with his cousins husband, pictures of them at his cousins wedding etc. He told me they eventually grew out of it and as they go to know him they really bonded with the guy. 

Sam joked that he wouldn’t give my grandparents a choice and that within a month they’d be in love with him. 

Well I think it’s working. Sam and I have dinner at my grandparents house every night, and each night I notice them more and more at ease and more avidly taking part in our conversations. Sam and my grandpa are both WW2 enthusiasts, and my grandpa absolutely loves having discussions on the subject with Sam. 

I decided to update this post because last night something very special happened. I got there before Sam, and I could _see the disappointment on their faces when they thought I had come alone_. They asked where Sam was, when he was coming etc. Then they said we wouldn’t start eating until he arrived.

ThrowRA-marriage,2019-09-15 04:36:11+00:00,My [29F] husband [27M] confessed to me that he very nearly committed murder when he was a kid,"We've been married six years. We have a four year old girl and one year old twins. My husband's never been anything but kind and loving to me and our babies.

Only a few days ago we were doing some cleaning, as we have guest staying for a little while. In one of his many containers of junk I found a box of rifle ammunition. We don't keep guns in the house. I'm not rabidly anti-gun or anything, but I don't like them and we've never even discussed having them around. 

I questioned him and he kind of froze up, because there really was no good explanation. He doesn't own any guns. He never goes hunting or anything or target shooting. He kind of sputtered and told me it was a 'joke' gift from a friend. It was obvious bullshit, but I didn't push it.

I really had a sinking feeling about the bullets. I asked him again that night, and he snapped at me and told me to forget about it.

Over the next few days, he got a bit cold and distant and short with me. Finally I confronted him about it again, knowing it was about the bullets. He yelled at me. He never yells at me. We actually had a big fight, and it was clear something was *seriously* wrong. 

Finally, he told me the truth. I got the sense he'd wanted to tell *someone* for a while from the way it just poured out once he admitted it. 

He admitted to me that when he was 17-18, he and his best friend planned to shoot up their high school. It was clear this wasn't idle fantasizing, but that they made thorough, detailed plans on how to murder as many of their classmates as possible. They acquired guns (legally, as it was, since his friend had just turned 18). They never got around to building the bombs they wanted, but he said they fully intended to, and had the schematics all worked out. 

In short, they planned to bomb the school, gun down as many survivors as possible, and then kill themselves. 

A few weeks ahead of 'the Day', his friend got paranoid her parents were onto her. They got cold feet. They panicked, burned all of the journals and detailed plans they'd worked out. They destroyed all evidence. He said his friend sold off the guns over the next few years after graduation. Except, he said, he kept one box of the ammunition they'd collected, as a 'memento' of his 'friendship' which ended pretty soon after that.  

I was in shock. Utter shock. I wanted him to tell me he was joking. He said he wasn't. It had been weighing on him for the past ten years, and he wanted to get it off of his chest, he said.  I didn't know what to say. The thought that he could ever be capable of something like this is utterly horrifying. It made me sick to think about. He begged me not to think about it too much, and that it was a long time ago, and he was a stupid kid, and he was glad he could 'trust' me with this. He says he would never in a million years consider doing anything like that now, and he doesn't know what possessed him in those days. I told him I agreed it was a 'long time ago'.

But I'm not over it. I don't know that I ever can be. I'm having a hard time looking at him, even, and I can see that he knows it's still gnawing at me. I don't know what to do. When I see him holding one of our kids I get this pit in my stomach. I still love him. He's been nothing but good to me all our relationship. 

But part of me wonders if everything since then has been some kind of mask. If he's capable of planning something like that for so long, what does that say about him? Is the sort of thing someone can really come to regret? 

TL;DR: my husband admitted he almost committed a school shooting when he was younger. Is this something I can get past? Should I even try?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d4fz64/my_29f_husband_27m_confessed_to_me_that_he_very/,relationship_advice,1198,467,0.0

I love and trust her more than ANYTHING in the world. Shortly after hs she decided to go to college and I decided not to so I could pursue starting a business like I dreamed of. Long story short, I was lucky enough to be successful quickly and sold my first startup 2 years after graduating for a very large amount of money. We decided together that she would drop out of college and work for me as an employee on my second company and we would live together. Not too long after that I proposed, she said yes, and then the happy side of the story ends. Now I hate to admit it, but I absolutely worship money. I know people say it’s not a good thing to do, but I grew up watching my single mom struggle to put food on the table for me and my siblings. Often going nights hungry because she had to feed a family with $20 and wanted to leave enough for us. It was engrained in my mind that I needed to make money so I could support my mother and younger siblings so they don’t have to live under those conditions anymore. So when I proposed a prenup to my girlfriend she was livid. She couldn’t believe that I didn’t trust her or have any faith in our relationship, and felt outright disrespected that I would even entertain the idea. She left me with an ultimatum of no prenup or no relationship at all. I’m completely conflicted. She’s the love of my life and I genuinely do trust her with every bone in my body, but I can’t jeopardize the stability of the financial freedom I’m providing for my mom and my younger siblings (4 of them oldest being 15 youngest is 6).

NoHateNeeded,2019-09-13 14:55:32+00:00,My girlfriend [21/F] is thinking of breaking up with me [22/M] after I got in a fight with her dad at Olive Garden.,"Last night was my first time meeting my girlfriend's parents. It was meant to just be a simple night of us eating and getting to know each other, but her dad being a petty asshole ruined it. We met outside in the parking lot and he actually seemed nice and welcoming. Things were going good, but trouble came when it was time to order. We were obviously doing the soup, salad, and breadsticks appetizer and when my girlfriend asked me what type of soup I was going to get, her dad suddenly buts in and tells us that we're all getting Zuppa Toscana. I wanted Chicken Gnocchi, but her dad very sternly said ""You're getting Zuppa Toscana."" At first I thought it was a matter of price, but then I looked at the menu and saw that all soups were the same price. I couldn't think of any legitimate reason for her dad all wanting us to get just one soup, other than him being a controlling asshole.

Our waiter arrived and took our order and the dad ordered four Zuppas for us, but I raised my hand and politely asked the waiter to change mine to Chicken Gnocchi. He obliged and left, which upset the dad. He was starting to raise his voice and tell me that I shouldn't have done that and when I asked why we all had to get one soup, he just said ""Because I said so."" And when our waiter was walking by, the dad stopped him and asked him to alter our order so that it was 4 Zuppas. That upset me and I just decided that I wasn't going to eat it. Not just to spite him, but because I genuinely don't like Zuppa Toscana. We got our soups and I just pushed it away and didn't eat it. Her dad was giving me a dirty look and he told me to eat my soup. I just ignored him and began playing on my phone. He kept telling me, I kept ignoring him, and it reached a point where he slammed his fist on the table and shouted ""EAT YOUR GODDAMN SOUP!"" I simply said ""Fuck you"" to him and I got up and walked out. Me and my girlfriend fought in the parking lot and she told me that she doesn't know why he's acting like that, but she was urging me to stay and just appease him, but I told her no and when her dad came out, I just flipped him off and drove away.

My girlfriend called me and told me that she's seriously thinking of breaking up with me over that incident. I told her that it was all her dad's fault and that I shouldn't be punished for what he did. He was being irrational and I was standing my ground. How do I convince my girlfriend that I'm right and don't deserve to be dumped?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d3qf65/my_girlfriend_21f_is_thinking_of_breaking_up_with/,relationship_advice,1886,572,0.0

She swears its not me and that its not due to bad performance etc... she just doesnt want to.

We have done some reading and been to a councillor but it always ends up along the ""learning to be nicer to her so she'll get in the mood"" lines which is rubbish for our situation. No matter how happy, relaxed, rested, etc she is, the idea of sex is an instant agitation to her and she gets mad.

Essentially...
- if I try to get her in the mood, she gets pissed.
- if I am super nice and thoughtful etc, she is happy but nothing happens.
- if i do nothing, nothing happens.

Recently Ive stopped asking... and the fighting has stopped and she's happy... but Im dying inside.

Is our relationship over and we just need to cut the cord? Or is it normal and do i need to just come to terms with my sex life being over? I dont want an affair etc, I want my wife to want a physical relationship with me... is that too much to ask?

ThrowRAmeistri,2019-09-11 17:30:06+00:00,I (F25) found out my fiance (M27) is with me for money/family business,"To preface. My family owns a business that is very well known in our sector and makes loads of profit. Thus I am a trustfund baby. I try to not be spoiled and have always worked myself.
I met my fiance Mark when I was 20 and working as a waitress.

We began dating a few moths later and he proposed to me last year.

Now mark is not poor. He is upper middle class. And while he doesn't struggle in life he didn't have to much to spend and lived very frugal. I thought he was an honest man because he always wanted to pay for his own things, reject expensive family holidays when we were still dating and he would cook for me instead of going with me dining outside. What I want to say is that I never had the impression that Mark was trying to take advantage of me or my family.

In the beginning my family was a little sketched out and brought up the  ""gold digger"" argument and I stood up for him and fought with my dad. They came to love and accept him. When Mark graduated Dad hired him and now he is in a high earning position.

Sunday I was supossed to work in the evening and I was going to stay with my sister. But I got a fever and was basically just non functioning so I stayed home. Instead of staying in our bedroom I made my way to the guestroom that is better ventilated, has a mini fridge and it's own bathroom (I didn't want to stand up at all and walk arround so I just bunkered all my stuff there and closed the door).

Mark came home when I was fast asleep and I was woken up by loud voices in our garden. I pushed the curtains a bit to the side and mark Was there with a few friends. Just as I wanted to say hello I noticed that they were talking about me.

His friend kept laughing and calling Mark ""the man!"". Then they started laughing about me being willing to not sign a prenub. Then one of the girls that was there said something along the lines of ""Jesus you about to make some bank mark!"". Mark laughed and said ""yeah just 3 more years and I am free"".

At this moment I felt sick to my stomach and wanted to throw up. I kept hearing them calling me trust fund Barbie and stupid and so on. I didn't know what to do so I just lied petrified in my bed and waited till the people left and mark went to bed. I texted my sister and snuck out to her place in the middle of the night and just passed out without telling her anything.

I haven't returned home and just told Mark that I was sick and didn't want to make him sick.y
My sister has been really worried but I just feel so ashamed about everything. My family was right mark is a gold digger and I fell for it. Even if I tell my family what happened I have no proof. My father can't fire him just because he is a dick. As far as I know he is  excellent at what he does and he has no legal foot to fire him I think.

throwRa-56647,2019-09-10 22:54:12+00:00,Should I tell my dying husband I'm pregnant?,"(Sorry I posted this like an hour ago and then got super paranoid my older son was going to see it so I deleted it, but I just low-key found out he doesn't even go on Reddit anymore so I'm going to try this again. Thank you to the couple of people who responded before I took it down, I've saved all your replies.)

Hey this is really shitty but I'm 39F and mother of two teens, and married to a (40M) guy I'll call Steve. Sorry if this is all a mess, it's a bit of a messed up story

The marriage was basically one of convenience. Steve and I are both divorced and have been friends for decades. This past spring Steve found out he has a rare cancer and the doctors gave him 6ish months to live.

Three years ago Steve sought out the daughter her had before his marriage from a one night stand in his 20s. When he found her he discovered his daughter (10 years old, I'll call her Sara), was being horrifically abused by her mother, who had had some kind of mental break I guess. Anyway he spent a year fighting for custody of this child he hadn't seen since she was a baby, and he eventually got it, then spent 2ish years working with her and getting her to heal and trust him and SURPRISE! he's fucking dying.

Anyway the marriage thing was mostly about Sara. We were advised that is getting married would be the quickest/easiest way to make sure I get custody of Sara when Steve passes, in case Sara's mother decides to try for custody again.

And as a side note I 100% do want custody of Sara, no question, I love her very very much. She's already like a sister to my two kids and similar in age. That girl has gone from not owning a fucking pair of shoes to being a funny, smart, all around great kid.

Anyway we got married on paper (no wedding), and Steve and Sara moved into my house. All the kids knew what was happening and were surprisingly cool with it.

Yeah so, stuff happened between me and Steve. He confessed he had been in love with me for a long time, and I just kind of said it all back to him even though I'm not 100% sure of my feelings. It all just happened fast idk. Maybe that was wrong of me but I wanted his time left to be happy and I do care for him a lot

In the last few weeks Steve has gone downhill very quickly. He is still mostly at home except for a few short hospital stays. There are nurses that come every day and he is on strong pain medicine, so sometimes he's himself but a lot of times really out of it. He's basically just here dying right in front of my fucking eyes and it sucks.

And I just found out this week that I'm pregnant. I'm not sure that I want to keep the baby. I'm old as dirt with now 3 teenage kids to think of. I'm strongly considering not telling Steve at all, but it feels very wrong.

Telling him also feels wrong. He's more upset about leaving Sara than he is about dying, so finding out he's leaving another kid behind will probably only hurt him.

Having an abortion feels wrong. Keeping the kid feels wrong. Nothing about this is okay and I really just want a cigarette and a bottle of wine.

vghelpthrowaway,2019-09-10 20:21:54+00:00,UPDATE: My [20] fiance's [27m] behavior while online gaming is destroying our relationship,"I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cu4pbd/my_20_fiances_27m_behavior_while_online_gaming_is/) a few weeks ago as I felt my fiance's behavior around video games had started to spiral out of control. A lot of the comments mentioned red flags like age difference, his other 'vices' like drinking and drugs, the fact that he might get violent with me, etc.. 

I spent a few days thinking about what others had said, and ended up reaching out to my cousin who I am quite close with and telling her a watered-down version of events. She expressed some concern and agreed that I should speak with fiance's brother. Fiance continued acting the same (no surprises there)in terms of gaming, with the yelling and late nights. That Sunday (several days after posting here) he became very upset because I went out to lunch with a few girls from school and he called me 4 times because he wanted me to pick up a takeout pizza and a case of beers and was upset and yelling at me, accusing me of being selfish because I didn't leave my girls lunch to get them. I got them on the way home and was met with accussations of being selfish and even cheating because I was 'late' and the beer was the wrong kind. I just shut down and went into the bathroom and cried for a while. I knew that something really needed to change.

The next day fiance left for work and I left for school just as usual. I called fiance's brother during my break between school and work and I basically told him that I had noticed some concerning behavior around the video games and that I was worried that it might spiral like the drugs and alcohol had. Fiance's brother pretty much agreed and stated he thinks fiance has an 'addictive personality' and might need some kind of professional help for this. Then, to my shock, he told me that fiance was *at his house* and asked if I wanted to speak with him. I was extremely taken aback because fiance was meant to be at work. I hung up with fiance's brother and called fiance's workplace. I was extremely nervous and felt like I was doing something sneaky and horrible, but I needed to know what was going on. I spoke with his manager and learned that he had QUIT his job weeks ago!! He told his manager his dad had a medical emergency and he had to move across the state to take care of him. WTF! So I guess he would just leave the house and fake going to work on the days he said he was working. After work I went home and fiance was gaming. I told him that we needed to talk and he tried to shut me down because he was in the middle of a match. He finally agreed to mute the game so he could hear me. I was literally shaking at this point and told him that I was worried about his gaming destroying the relationship. I said that I was seeing a pattern with the pills, the drinking, and the gaming. I said that I was worried about going through with the marriage when he treats me like a servant and is so disrespectful towards me and our apartment. At this point he unmuted the game and started ignoring me again. So I did something stupid and stood in front of the TV and said that I knew about him quitting his job to game all day. He FLIPPED OUT. He got violent and pushed me away from the TV. There was a lot of hitting and kicking (hit me with the controller). I got outside and was standing in the wet pavement with socks on for an hour or so as he locked the door behind me. He eventually came and apologized. He offered to get uber eats and watch a movie. I literally felt sick. I locked myself in the bathroom and just cried and looked at my county's domestic violence help page. He literally just kept gaming until I went to sleep.

The next day I couldn't go to school because I had a bad black eye, it was not something I could explain away. I wanted to just disappear. I got on the bus and went to the women's center. My cousin met me there and she was speechless at how bad I looked. I was very adament that I don't want to press charges or anything, I just needed help with the next steps of getting away. The social worker there was so nice and helpful, and didn't judge me at all. She helped me figure out how to get my stuff out of the apartment (cousin's husband and his friend went) and sat with my while I drafted and sent fiance a text stating that I cannot be with or marry someone who treats me this way. He called me nearly 20 times during the time I was at the center. I didn't answer the phone and the social worker encouraged me to block his number. For the short term I am staying with my cousin and her husband and I'm working on finding an apartment. Next month I'm meeting with a counselor who treats people who have escaped domestic violence through the center. I still feel hurt, sad, confused, and like I'm living in a nightmare. But for the past week or so I haven't been screamed at, sworn at, or had any of my things broken. I've also gone to bed before 11 every night. Someone on here sent me a PM saying that they thought fiance's behavior would escalate to him hurting or even killing me and they were right, so I'm just glad I was able to get away when I did. 

I don't expect this to get a ton of attention but pretty much no one in my real life knows how bad it was and I just wanted to put this out here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d2ds6u/update_my_20_fiances_27m_behavior_while_online/,relationship_advice,18398,839,0.0
ThrowRA-9374,2019-09-10 16:45:50+00:00,I (24M) rejected a woman after she told me she's transgender,"I met a girl on Tinder and we went on a couple of dates. I really liked her and we had a lot of chemistry. She didn't want to go beyond making out but I was ok with that, no problem.  
At the fourth date we ended up back at my place and we started fooling around. She refused to take off her skirt due to being insecure and I didn't push her.  
However after a while, when I finally asked her what's wrong, she confessed she's a pre-op transgender woman.  
Honestly I was shocked: I'd say I'm usually pretty open-minded but I felt deceived and I was not prepared at all for it.  
I told her I was sorry for it but, while I still liked her, I didn't feel attracted to her anymore and I could not rationally explain why.  
She than explained to me that she deserves a chance and saying upfront to be trans would put off most guys. After that she left crying,

First of all, I would like to thank everyone for the support, it was really appreciated and it's what let me have the courage to go to the police so I am very grateful. 

I have received some pretty messed up private messages, and I wanted to let you guys know because I don't know how to feel about them, for instance this one: Date Rapist Here: Hey I just wanted to let you know you really should keep your fucking mouth closed. I knew a person who didn't and things didn't end well for them. ;) 

(I can provide screenshots if necessary) 

As for how it unfolded: I gave my boyfriend my phone to text S if he wanted, he texted him from his phone as well as from mine. He made it seem like nothing had happened at first on his phone while texting him from mine that I was very upset about what had happened, that I needed an explanation and that I was telling my bf everything. His answer was ""How could you not know I have always liked you? I thought you liked me too."" ""I am sorry I went too far but you gave me all these signs"" ""Anyway,\*bf\* doesn't need to know, let's keep it between us, he wouldn't believe you anyway"" and the worst one ""this could still happen if you want, we'll make it our secret."" Needless to say my boyfriend was pissed. He then sent a message saying ""what about the drink you got me at the end, I saw you put something in it."" He then called many times but we didn't answer and he ended up saying ""you're crazy, you're imagining things, what the hell is wrong with you?"" then several other messages calling me names that we didn't answer. 

My boyfriend called him and told him that I had told him everything, that he should beat him up and that he would if he ever showed his face again. He also talked to our other friends but not in details, just saying how he acted weird towards me. I don't know what is going to come of that. 

Honestly, I just don't want to see him again now. The police has my report and I hope he never tries that again but I can't do much more.

Wife has a older sister who has had trouble after trouble throughout her years getting pregnant. 

My wife dropped a massive bombshell on me 2 weeks ago out of nowhere about how she is volunteering to be a surrogate for her sister.

She asked for my opinion and i'm 100% against it. My wife told me that she's still going through with it weather i like it or not and that i'm either with her or against her.

I'm crushed, we are a family now. We have a 3 year old to look after and we both work fulltime.

My wife told me that she will be quiting her job once the process begins and expects me to not only look after her but also our son and at the same time she expects me to also be the sole breadwinner.

I have tried multiple times to reason with her but to no avail. She keeps ignoring me and continues to plan the surrogacy with her sister and brother in law.

I HAVE had it. I'm done. I have endured this bullshit for 2 weeks now and finally asked her for a divorce and she did not take it well. She called me an asshole, a piece of shit who betrayed her and etc. 

I'm currently staying at a friends house and don't really know what to do besides making sure to be there for my baby boy.

She’s still young so she still is fertile however both of her past pregnancies were complicated and very dangerous. So her doctor told her to absolutely not get pregnant as it will just be even more risky now that she’s older. She told me all of this this morning, and then she asked me to be her surrogate. She said all I have do is carry her egg and have it fertilized by her husband. I told her I can’t do that. For one, I’m trying to get my nursing degree and I don’t want anything to slow me down. And I already have a two year old with my boyfriend, and remembering what it was like to be pregnant there’s no way I want to go through it again so soon. I’m also worried because a lot of the bonding mothers do with their babies is while it’s still in the womb. I don’t want to feel attached maternally to a baby that won’t be mine. I gave her my reasons and she just rolled her eyes and told me “it would be a small sacrifice for you to do this for me”. She told me all she wants is another baby and that I shouldn’t deprive her of it when I can help her so easily. I tried to reason with her but she literally told me “if you don’t do this to me then I don’t want a relationship with you anymore”. I asked her if she was serious and she told me “yes” and left.

Don't be like me.  If you're a ""strong silent type"" like me, or even totally different, it's critical to show your love in a way that resonates with your partner.  It doesn't matter how much you feel it, if you don't express it right, it's not being received.  That intensely strong connection you might feel could go away when your partner doesn't feel it for a long time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d1t4vm/learn_the_love_languages_before_its_too_late/,relationship_advice,1163,102,0.0
pumpkinpiethighhigh,2019-09-09 12:17:17+00:00,My tween daughter's birthday trip has gotten hijacked and I'd appreciate some outside perspective,"My tween daughter is part of a friends group. I, her mother, am friends with the mothers of her friends group. This can make tween drama pretty complicated. Anyways, she's had a hard year, so my husband and I told her that we'd take her to Universal for fall break (her birthday falls in the middle of it) and that she can bring a friend. She chose her Friend A, and I made sure A's parents had zero plans during fall break before extending the invitation. At first they said A could go, then that they'd also go since it's so far away... Now it has all changed. Now A and her younger sister B have invited a mutual friend of all of the girls and they are doing a Universal/Disney trip over Fall break. The whole point was for my daughter to have a friend ride down, stay with us on property, you know, the works. They'd bond, have fun, it was going to be great. Now I feel like she'd be a side attraction that would just meet up with the other group of 3 that will be staying with each other. I feel offended and feel that my friend, A's Mom, has hijacked what was supposed to be a special trip. 
Before I end this I want to say that I want to know if I'm just being ridiculous or not. While it might sound petty, this age is savage and girls can be unkind. There has been a lot of drama between the girls and I'm just worried about my daughter getting her feelings hurt. I'm not sure how to navigate this situation.

Recently while we were hanging out he wound up telling me that one of his turn ons is being called 'senpai' in the sack (hes an ultra weeb).  And well Im not objecting to it at all cause its perfectly normal and everything. Everyones got some weird kinks, including me. 

The thing is even in a non sexual enviroment I can not say the word Senpai without cracking the fuck up, much less while Im getting funky.  I dont know how to get over this or address it in a way that wont hurt his feelings. Do you guys have any advice on either not laughing my ass off in the middle of sex or on how to tell him politely that I cant call him that because it feels awkward?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d1mch5/guy_ive_been_seeing_wants_me_to_call_him_senpai/,relationship_advice,1323,196,0.0

After reading everyone's advice and telling my boyfriend, we went to the police station. We spent most of the night there.  I told them about what I saw and that he wouldn't let me go easily when I wanted to leave. They asked me lots of questions: if I am sure, what the glass looked like, what the pill looked like,  how drunk I was, how drunk he was, if I had ever liked him etc. It was very uncomfortable but they had to get all the information. 

The police suggested that they take my report to have a file ready but said they can't arrest him or go to his place or check anything as it's too late. They did say it would be a good idea to try to message him and get information from him that would be proof of what he did, screenshots and all. I am not sure if I can do that, he has sent me a message asking how I was that I showed my boyfriend but I haven't answered him yet. I am guessing he's going to start thinking something is up since he has texted my bf who hasn't answered him either. 

After coming back from the police, we just decided to get some rest and talk about this today. We haven't yet, we were both exhausted and there was a lot of crying on my part. So that's it for now. I don't want to have to talk to him or face him but I will have to anyway.

My son has been learning how to write and I have been spending more time trying to teach him. He is left handed and up until this point, I never once considered it to be an issue. A few weeks ago, my husband proposed that he should be the one to teach our child how to write and even suggested that it would be a bonding experience for both of them. In fact, he made it clear that during this time, I should go out and enjoy myself since I don't go out that often. I thought everything was fine until I started to notice that over time, my son didn't want to practice writing anymore and would even start to throw full blown tantrums if I even suggested that we should start practicing again, which is unlike him. 

This morning, I managed to get him to open up to me and he told me that his dad would yell at him for being left handed, calling it bad and dirty, and would even pin his left arm behind his back really hard so he would be forced to use his right hand. I am devastated that this was happening right under my nose and I don't know what to do. I don't know how this was able to be hidden from me for so long and I've never even heard of being shamed for being left handed. He has clearly been negatively affected and I have yet to confront my SO about this but I don't know how to proceed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d1bbaj/my_29f_husband_31m_has_been_abusing_our_son_5m/,relationship_advice,1480,361,0.0
blastabeatbabe,2019-09-07 21:27:58+00:00,"My boyfriend thinks he's texting a girl he met on craigslist, but he's really talking to me (his soon to be EX girlfriend)","Ok so this all started when I wrongly invaded his privacy and snooped his phone. I'm a pretty good detective cause I found a bunch of BDSM friend finder emails. As well as a confirmation email for craigslist. I looked at the website for the friend finder. Found nothing really you have to pay for most features. Nothing in the site's inbox. So I go check craigslist  and view his post stating he was a ""shy 26 M looking for a lady Dom to put him in his place"" I was shocked to say the least. We honestly have (had) above average sex life. Meaning he bought a strap on for me to use on him. I did the ""dom"" thing almost every weekend with him. I always asked if there was something new he wanted to try. Always met with the truth and same from me. He pleased me as well. Win-win I thought. So I made a new email and msged him. My cover story, is ""I'm a 25 F looking for a sub boy to play with discreetly"" I said hey my name is Brandi ( thought of the most non good girl name I could think of) no offense to those women named that. But yea that I would love to meet him, I'd buy the hotel room and provide any treats he wanted (beer) he msges back a few days later while he's at my place. I didn't realize till he went home and I just randomly checked that email. He agreed to meet her (me) I never msged or looked at the email again until recently. I mentioned it to him while we were drinking that I found the accounts. He brushed it off that he was probably drunk. I'm a forgiving person and I decided it didnt bother me that much. So fast forward to today. I'm at home and nagging thoughts consume me to check my fake email. Sure enough a few weeks ago he msges her (me) that if she's still intrested to call him and gave his cell # so I promptly download a free texting app and get a new #. I txt him saying "" Hey its Brandi you emailed me your # a while ago just wondering If your still interested to meet up and have some fun"" he replies 5 mins later saying hes down. He just left my house to drop clothes off at his house and I'm meeting him there to sleep overnight. So for this long rant/story but my question is how do I approach this. How do I out him in a niceish way. I know not to blow up and lose my cool but sitting here and knowing he's not ""txting his mom"" when I ask who he's talking to. KNOWING it's me! And we've made plans to meet tomorrow. I sent him a picture of an average girl his type (face shot) I found on Instagram. I feel I'm getting too deep. And I'm crushed that I have to end my relationship and how he's playing it all off like he's checking the weather. Should I just show him the texts next time he msges her (me)  I know the answer seems like common sense but i just need a push.

spicyanon179,2019-09-07 17:32:50+00:00,My husband pretends our baby doesn’t exist.,"So my husband and I have been married 2 years and he always wanted kids. I have too so I thought we were a match in heaven, despite knowing he was a little more traditional in wanting me to stay home and he be the bread winner. 

So we got pregnant. Or at least I did and he helped.

I had my baby 2 months ago, and since then he hasn’t done anything. Hasn’t gotten up with a feeding, hasn’t changed a diaper, essentially pretends the baby doesn’t exist except to play good daddy on Instagram 

He’s extremely negligent the times he does interact with our infant. He’s left them screaming exactly where I left, laying in a dirty diaper. 

We’ve talked about it multiple times, and he always goes “You agreed to be the main provider for the kid, while I worked.”

After 2 months of this, I got sick of it and have been staying with my parents, thinking about divorce because he won’t help me with the kid he also wanted, and I already feel like a single parent. I don’t want to be married to a man who lets his 2 month old infant scream in their own shit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d0yy9e/my_husband_pretends_our_baby_doesnt_exist/,relationship_advice,1098,229,0.0

I have been with my boyfriend for 3 years now and started hanging out with his friends, all guys, a few months after we started going out. There is usually at least 4 of us at one of our places, drinks, snacks and music every friday evening. My boyfriend is out of town for the weekend and the guys invited me anyway. We were at the friend in question's place, let's call him S. S has always been very nice to me, a bit flirty in the beginning but I just brushed it off and it didn't last long anyway. He plays guitar and I play instruments as well so we always show each other our compositions. 

So yesterday when I went to his place, there was another friend and everything seemed fine, we were drinking and hanging out until around 1 am when other friend says he's heading home as he works on saturdays. Not wanting to make anything awkward and as everyone was a bit buzzed, I say I should leave too to talk to my boyfriend and let him know I'm home okay. S says I should stay a bit more as he wants to show me the last piece he wrote, I agree and sit back on the couch. S brings his guitar then asks if I want something else to drink, I tell him I am okay and he insists he has an amazing whisky that I need to try, he then goes to the kitchen to bring it. In the mean time, I start heading for the toilet and catch a glimpse of him dropping something in my drink, it dissolves and he smells the glass, I quickly close the toilet door before he could notice me. Now I was tipsy but still very aware of my surroundings, and I am 100 percent sure of what I saw. He brought the two glasses and kept watching me, not knowing what to do I ""accidently"" dropped it, apologized profusely and said I should really head home and l started heading for the door. S grabs my arm and is very insistant I should stay, he keeps telling me I should spend the night, how my boyfriend doesn't need to know, that I am really hot and how horny he is. I push him and run to the door then call an uber and head home.

I don't know what to do from here, I couldn't sleep all night and I keep imagining worse case scenarios. I don't know if I should tell my boyfriend or if he would even believe me and how he would react, I haven't heard from S yet and I don't know if I can even look him in the eyes. All I know is I am not going to be able to act normally and I am sure my boyfriend will know something is wrong.

UncertaintyOfFuture,2019-09-06 17:28:50+00:00,How do I get them all to back off?,"My wife Sarah died 6 years ago when we were 29.  We'd been together 6 years, married for 1.  She died in a car accident on a ""girl's day out"" with her sister and 2 friends. Her sister and one friend survived. Sarah and one friend died.

Initially people understood my grief. Most were also grieving. After about 2 years people started to suggest I should be trying to ""move on"" and see other women.  After a while all my family and friends (with one exception) are saying it. Even my wife's parents are suggesting it. I never thought that would happen.

I know they are all doing it out of love but they don't understand how I feel. I have tried to explain it but it's not sinking in. I will NEVER get over losing Sarah.

I went for several grief counselling sessions 3 months after I lost her and again after 2 years. I understand that it's normal for the grief to ease and for the person to eventually move on. I just don't think that will happen to me.

I've improved. When it first happened I couldn't function. I thought the pain would kill me. I don't know how I got through the funeral. The idea of burying her, of putting her in the ground, on her own, was unbearable. I wanted to be buried with her. I just wanted to die with her. I didn't do anything but cry.

After about 7 months and the end of the first grief counselling sessions I got to a point where I could live through my days, do my job, eat, keep myself clean. That was all I could do.

After about 2 years I started to go out for basic social things. Family events, drinks with friends or colleagues etc.

That's when the suggestions started. People were trying to set me up or saying I should date. The number of people saying it and the forcefullness has increased. Some seem to have taken it on as a challenge. 

How do I get them to understand? I'll never get over Sarah. She was perfect for me. She was so funny and bright and loving and we matched in every way. I can't describe how happy we were together.

I have accepted that she has been stolen from me but I know I will never meet anyone I can love like that. It wouldn't be fair on another person to even try. I'd always have Sarah on my mind.

I've talked to plenty of women when I've been out with friends. I've had about 15 women ask me out over the last few years. They have been mostly attractive, funny, warm women but I only want Sarah.

They are never going to be Sarah, so I don't want to try. Nobody seems to get it. The only person who doesn't do it is Sarah's sister. She comes over 2 or 3 times each week. She was driving the car and survived the accident. I think she is too consumed with guilt to be trying to set me up with someone. The accident wasn't her fault but she still tortures herself and I have to set her straight. She is the only person not trying to persuade me to see other people. 

How do I get them to stop trying? How do I explain it without being too harsh with them all? I know they mean well but I need them to stop.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d0jqo7/how_do_i_get_them_all_to_back_off/,relationship_advice,1105,192,0.0
FatAshley,2019-09-06 16:18:24+00:00,My [25/F] friend [25/F] is angry I lost weight before her wedding.,"Hannah and I went to the same high school and became closer in college. We kept in touch even when I left for further schooling and she moved back to our hometown, We hadn’t seen each other in person in about a year and a half, though we talk via FaceTime and text. A year ago she got engaged, and asked me to be a bridesmaid. 

&amp;nbsp;

I’ve been tall and fat my whole life. But over the past year I started going to a boutique gym in my area, fell in love with it, and went from a US 16 to a US 4. It was just something that finally clicked with me.

&amp;nbsp;

The wedding is in 2 months and the bridal shower is this weekend, so I took my summer vacation this week/next week. Hannah, myself, and her four other bridesmaids met up for dinner/drinks at another bridesmaid’s house yesterday, and they were pretty shocked at my weight loss. I could tell Hannah wasn't thrilled from the get-go, so I tried to keep the conversation off of me and on her. The only thing she had to say was “Yeah, you do look different.”

&amp;nbsp;

Later in the evening after a few drinks were had Hannah still looked unhappy, and was messing with her phone, apparently on the website where we had gotten our dresses. Out of nowhere she started talking about the bridesmaid dresses and saying snarky things like “Yours better be ready in time” and “You’re gonna have to pay for alterations, I’m not taking care of this.” I tried to reassure her that wouldn’t be a problem (and we were always expected to pay), but it seemed like she just wanted to be angry.

&amp;nbsp;

My phone was dying, so I went outside to get my charger. When I walked back toward the house I could overhear Hannah continuing to trash-talk me. She griped about the wedding party, how I obviously planned some sort of “big reveal” around her wedding, and how I was going to look weird and “out of balance” next to her fiancés plus-sized cousin, who I’m paired up with. The thing that stings the most is that Hannah said “Ashley’s supposed to be the fat one.” I stood there for a minute, took some time to cool off, and then walked back in and left the gathering pretty quickly. At this point I’m not sure what I want to do. I’ve texted Ashley confirmation from the shop that my dress will be ready in time, and she hasn’t answered. But I’m not really sure if I want to go to the bridal shower tomorrow, or at all, or if I should drop out of the wedding entirely.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:** Bride is angry that I lost weight before her wedding and has been rude to me/behind my back about it.

WhatUsrNameIsnttaken,2019-09-06 13:32:59+00:00,I don't want my twin sister in my wedding party and my mom can't handle it.,"My twin sister and I have had a horrible relationship for the last 23 years of our life. The kind of relationship that people said ""oh you'll get over when you're older"". Except I'm not over it. She physically and verbally abused me my entire life and continues to do so over trivial things now. 

When I was 18 I ended up moving 44 hours away from my family, but it was to get away from her. She's ruined most of my friendships and I just couldn't handle her anymore. After moving, her and I have been for the most part NC. When we do talk it's always for her to start a fight. Either making me feel bad for not coming home for a holiday, or just something. 

Most of my family understands our relationship but my mom, as she has for my entire life continues to be oblivious to it. ""Oh it's not that bad"" or ""All siblings fight"". She's the kind of  mom you see in those movies saying ""my baby would never do that"", as the child is getting hauled away for murder ... Yep that would be her.  I've been in therapy for the last 5 year to try and get over our relationship.

 But aside from the whole woe is me...

Two months ago I got engaged to the most amazing person. And as one would, I called my parents, then called my older sister and finally I called my twin. Hoping that she would be happy for me, or idk just something..... Welp, she was not. She told me how selfish I was for getting engaged to a man who lived so far away and how she already knows I'm never going to come back home. How selfish that is to my mother and went on like that until I hung up about 30 minutes later. She told me that I should be ashamed for asking guests and my family to come to my wedding so far away. Which I had already planned to offer at least half the cost of plane tickets. Even more for my family.. but whatever. 


This month we have begun to plan the first details of the wedding. The guest maximum for the ceremony would be 100 and I think that's even more than I was thinking originally. As I'm really just wanting it to be close friends and family. We were planning to invite more people to the reception (is that normal? I've never been to a wedding before), people with kids and friends that I'm not as close to. 

We have decided that at most each of us would have 4 bridesmaids/groomsmen. I'm still trying to figure out who will be it as well. However, already I know that the last person I want to be my MOH is my sister. I don't really even want her being in my bridal party. That decision has all but crushed my mother. She's really really upset about it. Calling me names and telling me how selfish I am for not being able to let go of our childhood. 

I hate to see her upset. However I know that having my sister in one of those roles will for sure lead to fights and I really don't want to be judged for every decision I make. 

Would it ruin my relationship with my sister forever if I don't have her in my wedding? I would like to have some sort of relationship one day. What can I do and how would I even tell her that she's not in the party without causing a fight",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d0gq07/i_dont_want_my_twin_sister_in_my_wedding_party/,relationship_advice,3648,451,0.0

We finally got our own place on December 2018 and things were looking up for us. These 5 years were so magical and I always told myself that through all of our trials in life, that I would marry her again. 

This past Tuesday, my lead told us that we can VTO  (Volunteer Time Off. I work night shift) So my co worker gave me a ride home. (My wife and I share a car). When he dropped me off, I noticed that our car wasn't parked in our parking spot. I thought that she parked somewhere else. 

As soon as I went inside, I went to our bedroom so that I can kiss her and surprise her and let her know that I am home. The plan was to make her breakfast before she woke up to go to work. 

She wasn't in the room. She wasn't home. So I called her and asked her where she was. When she answered, she sound like she just woke up. 

My heart broke because I had a feeling of what was going on. She made an excuse that she was at the store to get balloons for co-worker's birthday. I gave her the benefit of the doubt. 

So I was in bed and she finally got home after 30 minutes of waiting. She sat on the bed and I asked her if she was okay. She wouldn't answer and began to cry. Then after 5 minutes of asking of what's going on, she told me that she cheated on me. She said that she went out and talked to someone, got drunk and it just happened. 

I am sad. I honestly thought this would never happen to me. I don't know what to do. We had a long talk about our marriage and what we would do. We agreed that we would try to work it out, but at this time, 9/6 at 0545, I am strongly considering in divorcing her. I can't even look at her anymore. The thought of hugging her, kissing her, touching her makes me sick to my stomach. She wants to work it out, but my heart isn't in it anymore. 

What should I do? Am I overreacting?  I honestly thought of killing myself. I am so sad. She was my everything.

WifeAdvice1980,2019-09-06 04:48:50+00:00,"My [30M] wife [29F] more or less abandoned me and the kids, with nothing more then a note. I don't know what to do.","Me \[30M\] and my wife \[29F\] have been married 5 years and have been together for 8 years. We met through an internship in university (she came from Korea, i came from Canada), we ended up both doing a long distance relationship thing for a year before we both ended up moving to Toronto for jobs as developers. 

To make things complicated her family has never really approved of me. I know very basic Korean that she taught me, but her family up until now has cut contact with me (they didn't come to the wedding, nor have they seen their grand daugthers). However she has always been extremely independent, and despises the idea that her family can control any part of her life, so she asked me to marry her (i was fine with that) only after living together for 8 months. 

Two years ago she gave birth to a pair of wonderful baby girls. However it became very obvious something was extremely wrong, she became a whole different kind of person after the birth. She became extremely protective and borderline paranoid of anyone other than me or her looking after her kids. 

Apparently the idea of her becoming a stay at home mom was insulting to her and she told me over and over that i needed to become a stay at home dad. Since she was the bread winner it was fine for me. About 6 months ago she was diagnosed with postpartum depression, and was given medication that made her much better (no more bizarre mood swings, or picking fights for no reason). 

Last weekend was the first time i have had some time off from the kids, i was going to my friends bachelor party at his cottage for the weekend and my wife was going to look after the kids. 

On Sunday morning i got a phone call from my sister who told me:

* My wife dropped the kids off with her as there was some emergency at the office on Saturday.
* She didn't come back to get them and it was now Sunday
* Her phone wasn't responding to her messages/calls. 

I freaked out and rushed home, only to find pretty much all her stuff gone. She left me a single page note that was basically told me that she was going back home to be with her family, and she was ""cutting ties"" with me as she couldn't be the person ""i wanted her to be"", and asked that i respect her decision. She also closed our joint bank accounts saying i had ""no right"" to that money as she earned it. 

I talked to one of her friends from work and she said she told me she put in her two weeks notice over a month ago so this has been planned for awhile.

I am pretty much a confused mess, my family is helping out, but its complicated. I talked to her parents and they basically refused to talk to me, and demanded that i leave her or them alone. I brought up their grand-children and her father told me point blank they aren't his.

What am i supposed to be doing. I don't really understand.

We were all at a mutual friend's housewarming party and things were pretty chill, we were all drinking.

The girl was on the patio talking with some other girls, they were all talking about how it's hard to find a guy on their level who has a good job, decent looks, no kids, sweet, etc. Me and Jake were walking out to the patio and overheard them, so we decided to try to flirt with them a little, nothing serious. They seemed to like it and everyone was having a good time.

At one point Jake asks Megan what a ""guy on her level"" means and she says he doesn't have to make as much money as her (she has a finance degree and is finishing her MBA), but it would just be nice if he could support himself and didn't have kids or whatever, while also being attractive and nice. 

Well Jake decides to be an asshole and say ""well you shouldn't be such a gold digger. Besides, real men don't care about a woman's money or how much you make or your degree or whatever, we just want a hot girl to have sex with.""

I was embarrassed that he made everyone uncomfortable, and I was also a little drunk, so something possessed me to say ""don't listen to him, he's just mad that he's pushing 30 working in a grocery store and has two broke baby mamas he pays child support to... because he chose looks instead of the whole package.""

By that time there were like 10 people on the patio and everyone fell out laughing at what I said. He got mad and tried to fight me, but the host and my roommate (Jake's friend) pulled him off of me and sent him back to his place in an Uber. 

Megan thanked me later that night for sticking up for her. But my roommate, who is my friend, told me that I was being an asshole and didn't have to call Jake out like that. But granted, the guy is kind of a loser. All he does is talk shit about women and he never puts any effort into bettering his own life. 

At the same time, I'm wondering if what I said was out of place and wrong, even if it was true. AITA?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d0bhfm/i_24m_embarrassed_a_friend_of_a_friend_29m_after/,relationship_advice,1307,378,0.0

I found out our baby’s gender today, and I had to beg my husband to come to my ultrasound. He didn’t want to but he gave in and said he would come. I knew he wanted a son so I worried he’d be upset but I didn’t think something like this would happen. As soon as the doctor said it was a girl, my husband’s whole demeanor changed. And he just went silent. And then he made me leave my appointment early. I tried to object but he grabbed my arm really hard and told me that we’re going home. In the car, he was very agitated and I asked him what was wrong. He told me he wants me to have an abortion. I asked him why and he told me he doesn’t want a girl so I’ll get an abortion and we’ll try again for a boy. I told him I’m not going to do that and he said “yeah okay we’ll see”. I told him he can’t force me and he told me “you have two options honey you can have your girl and get pregnant again right after and pray that it’s a boy or you can do it the easy way and get an abortion right now”. I just started to cry and he shushed me and kept squeezing my thigh painfully tight. He’s been in a bad mood all night but we haven’t talked anymore about it. I know this all sounds crazy and I know that it is but I’m just lost on what to do. I don’t know why he would put me in this position. I can only hope that he calms down and lets it go, but I don’t think that will happen. My friends would never understand and I just can’t bring myself to talk to my father or my brothers about this.

night-gaunts,2019-09-06 01:20:58+00:00,My boyfriend expressed his rape fantasies after sleeping with me for the first time.,"Long time anon lurker, first time poster. I'm so utterly dumbfounded that I have no idea who to turn to.

Up until last night, I (21F) was a virgin. A late bloomer, I guess; I never had the time nor confidence to fool with it. I met my boyfriend (22M) seven months ago after signing up to my university's sign language society. We settled into a relationship about two months following that, so it was probably a little hasty in hindsight.

Things had been fine, and I'f been rendered utterly smitten. He's charming, well-kempt, and has been nothing short of understanding of my inexperience.

Last night, however, things took a really sharp turn. An evening spent on the wine had made us both a little comfortable and we went to bed together. I was initially happy to do so as everything leading up to that point had me convinced that he'd be gentle and thoughtful about it, but he wasn't. I was manhandled, pushed down, and he would insult me occasionally throughout the whole ordeal. I was tipsy and hurting, and at one point he even kept me held to the sheets by my neck when I tried to sit up. When he'd done, he left me until I'd almost fallen asleep, before rejoining me in bed. It hurt throughout the night, and I'm still really sore almost a full day later.

When I sobered up this morning, I asked him what went so wrong when he joined me in the dorm kitchen to get some water. He played it as though everything was fine, but I told him that I didn't feel fine. It's hard to pin how the conversation led, but he basically told me that one of his deepest fantasies was - in his words - ""defloration and conquest."" I was undeniably disturbed and basically blurted out the term rape fantasy. He got irate over this and described it as consensual non-consent. I became upset and removed myself from the kitchen when I heard my flatmate's door open, and I'm not sure what he did with himself following that.

I've not left my room since, and I've had an absolute flurry of messages from him that I can't bring myself to open. I feel dirty, and hurt, and stupid, and can't help but feel like I've been groomed as an object of this fucked fantasy of his.

I don't know where to go from here, or who to turn to. I'm desperately tempted to ghost him and just be done with it, but we each attend the same campus and its sign language class, of which I will likely quit.

I don't know if I'm overreacting and being too hard on him. I don't know if this is something I should raise, and if so, who to? I'm feeling god awfully irrational at this moment and wasn't sure where to express this, so here I am.

Any advice would be hugely appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d09tnc/my_boyfriend_expressed_his_rape_fantasies_after/,relationship_advice,2132,789,0.0
Thr0wthisthingaway,2019-09-05 14:30:35+00:00,UPDATE #2: 41M Questioning Sexuality After Making a New Friend,"Original  [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/csi07o/41m_questioning_sexuality_after_making_a_new/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)  
First update [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cxzlcz/update_41m_questioning_sexuality_after_making_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

Leading up to Monday, we texted like normal, he convinced me to download Snapchat, which I had heard about but sort of wrote off as an app where teens and twenty-somethings exchange dirty pictures or where cheating spouses go to because the chats don't stick around. I bit and we had been snapping goofy pictures using the filters, things we bumped into throughout the day, this guy is seriously hilarious. He has this goofball sense of humor and knows how to bring light to any little interaction he comes across.

Anyway, so Monday rolls around, I'm excited to hangout and nervous all at the same time. I knew he'd have other friends there, all of which I'd never met before and that wasn't helping the nerves. I get over there around 2. He has one friend already there and is expecting more. They trickle in and I'm doing my best to mingle with all the new faces, everyone is super friendly and made me feel like one of the boys. We cut up after the game, played some pool, James had been a bit distant from me that night, but it was understandable that he was manning the grill, and entertaining 8-10 people, he couldn't be everywhere at once. I was going to try to hang out until everyone cleared out so I could talk to him about the kiss, which is exactly what I did. I did my best to not elongate conversations so as to give off the ""the nights winding down"" vibe. After some time everyone left with the exception of one friend who was sleeping off the booze on his couch.

I asked James if we could talk outside. We walk outside and the conversation went something like this: ""I know I kissed you the other day, and I don't know if that was something I should have done, it just sort of felt like the right thing to do in the moment. I've just been thinking about our friendship a lot and I think I may be confused about what we are or where we're heading."" I was absolutely out there now. No turning back, I basically just told him I had developed feelings for him and wanted to know where he stood with me. He didn't even hesitate to respond that he'd been wondering the same thing, why I haven't brought it up before now. Obviously I told him I had never been bisexual or gay before, but the texting all the time, the flirting, the KISS! He reassured me our friendship had a no-walls, open door, open communication thing. I could come to him with whatever was on my mind and I just teared up. It wasn't crying, just tearing up but it was so many emotions all at once. I gave him a hug and told him I appreciated that, we sat down and I explained to him how confused I've been these last couple weeks. How this is all new to me, he is such a good listener. I sort of just rattled off everything that's been on my mind regarding us, my confusion in sexuality, my fears. He is an active listener so he had a sentiment or an answer for most of the things I said, they were all comforting. He told me he has feelings for me, that he wasn't sure if he came on too strong. He is not openly gay, he has been bisexual since his teen years and he explained it that as he's gotten older he's hiding it less and cares less of what people think. Not all of his friends know, and the ones that do know don't care. A few of the guys from the party knew he was bi.  
I don't know what I would call the gut feeling I had, but explaining everything, talking about it, airing it out WITH him was like when you're reading a good book late at night in bed, the story's been confusing, you need answers which you think are coming any minute but flipping the page and a new chapter starting. Do you keep reading now or do you save it for tomorrow? I felt like we had gotten enough out in the air that we are on the same page. I have feelings for him, he has feelings for me, this is new for me, this is nothing new for him. He explained that nothing has to change in our friendship, if we wanted to get physical we could but I shouldn't be pressured. I wanted to kiss him, not like the first one where it was just a slight slip of my tongue and a lip press. I turned to him and put my hand on his knee and leaned in, he gently grabbed the back of my head, we kissed. Full on made out for what seemed like ever. It was the most satisfying kiss I've ever had. This where the physical stuff ends for me. (for now, anyway) I'm not ready for anything further than kissing at the moment.

By this time it was nearly 3 in the morning and I had to go. He walked me to my car and we made out a second time before I got in. He told me to get home safe and I did. I texted him to let him know I got home safe and hopped in the shower. I was so emotionally charged that I couldn't get to sleep until around 5 AM. I ended up calling out of work Tuesday. James and I have plans to hangout again this weekend. He wants to go out for food and a place called Topgolf with me and some of his friends from the party, I've never golfed before so this should be interesting.. lol. I'm really looking forward to it and I'm just taking things day to day at this point. I know where we stand and I'm happy.

Thank you for all of your support. I have hundreds of inbox messages with encouraging words, people who are confused about their sexuality etc. I just want you all to know that nobody should be afraid to be who they are. You only get one go around this earth and it would be a shame to waste it hiding from what you truly are, based on other peoples accord. I am learning this myself and I'm telling you, it's liberating.

If anything big happens in the meantime I will post it, otherwise the next one will be after the weekend plans.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d01kfn/update_2_41m_questioning_sexuality_after_making_a/,relationship_advice,2348,153,0.0
thatsnotmyname47,2019-09-05 14:26:55+00:00,Boyfriend doesn’t want me to be a teacher because he thinks I’ll cheat on him.

I personally think that’s ridiculous because that can happen in ANY workplace and does. I’m also someone to be trusted and should never matter where I work. 

But I easily let almost anyone influence me and now I’m thinking I shouldn’t be a teacher because of his insecure comment and any doubts that have been sprinkling through my mind about my capabilities to be a teacher.

OppositeLeopard,2019-09-05 05:17:35+00:00,Final update : I divorced my husband because of my MIL and now he wants back in.,"So I thought of giving you the last update as you helped me trough this.

I didn't not have enough evidence to request an ex parte aka emergency child custody. So my lawyer and I had to work on steps to prevent child abduction. We got a custody decree that included provisions including passports, travel restrictions etc.

We also had to be very wary of the signs. He in fact quit his job and on a realtors page I saw that he was putting on sale his mother's house. That and my daughters words was all we needed to notify law enforcement for them to keep an eye out.

I couldn't prevent my daughter from seeing her father. We tried to continue business as usual without my daughter feeling something was up. 

 I got a call from the police department regarding the passport situation. My daughter's passport had expired very recently (5 years validity). My ex husband had tried to recuest a passport for my daughter without my knowledge. Wich was stupid because even without the decree I had to be present or submit  a notarized document of me stating that he could recuest the passport.

After that things went actually very fast. He was investigated because he violated the decree and it was found out that MIL had bought 3 tickets with no return date to Mexico. I could request an ex parte. After a shit ton of documents I submitted it. In most cases the judge will evaluate behind closed doors. We had the hearing yesterday (it takes usually 10 to 20 days) wich was very good for me. Atm I have sole custody for my daughter. This is all temporary. My ex has visitation rights if I was present but he can't take her anywhere. This is once the investigation of him is closed. 

I was cursed out by my ex and ex MIL and they said they will try to Contest this but they have no leg to stand on.

My daughter will continue in therapy. Specially after this. I will not prohibit him from seeing her but he needs help.

This was really scary and a very intense 2 weeks. I don't think that I will update again but I wanted to thank you all for your Tipps and support. I am really thankful as I am finally not anxious the whole time!

FuzzyTart,2019-09-04 22:58:19+00:00,[FINAL UPDATE] I [29M] Caught My Wife [27F] Letting Our Male Neighbor Rub Lotion On Her Pregnant Stomach,"Don't know if anyone will remember my original posts, as they were deleted and I have yet to be informed of why even after messaging the mod team. Don't know if this will be deleted either. If anyone wants, they can use removeddit to see the posts if they aren't visible from my profile.

I'm still getting messages on a regular basis for an update, so this is the final one.

Extremely long story made slightly less long, a week after my last update my soon-to-be-ex wife had our child, which I was at the hospital for. I'm the father. The first few weeks after my last update were extremely difficult, with family/friends on both sides adding to the drama. Thankfully, I've had an overwhelming amount of support from not only from the vast majority of people I know in my personal life but from all of you as well. My wife and I agreed to sit down and discuss things after she was discharged, in my friend's basement with my friend upstairs in case I needed the support. 

She came over, and we basically said everything we needed to say. I exploded and said a lot of mean shit. Most of which I regret, some I don't. She spent the whole time apologizing and begging me to take her back and give ""our family"" a chance to survive everything that happened. Went on for about an hour like this until I accepted that there was nothing left to say and I have zero romantic love for her anymore, and she accepted that we need to focus on our daughter above all else. We're agreeing to figure out a custody split amicably, and to eventually co-parent more actively together when wounds heal, but our marriage is over. She has the potential to be a wonderful mother, but she failed me as a wife, and my sole focus right now is how to get myself mentally to where I need to be to be the best father possible. We plan to eventually sell the home, but right now I'm staying in an apartment.

Sally is leaving cocksucker. He's apparently staying with his mother, and still refused to speak to Sally directly. According to her, the last thing that was passed along to her is that he understands what he did, he's sorry he hurt her, he loves her and won't contest a divorce. She's struggling to handle everything and lacks a support system, so we're developing a friendship, mostly two wounded people leaning on each other, and I'm doing my best. She plans to start therapy too. And no, I don't plan to be anything more than platonic friends with Sally. Lovely woman, but no.

I still haven't fully processed my new role as a parent. I think mentally I already convinced myself my child wouldn't be mine in case it ended up that way. I plan to take classes and spend more time with my daughter doing early bonding, I'm terrified but very happy. I know there's a lot left to do, and a lot of hurting left to go through, but I'm stable, and a dad. That's what matters most.

Tl;Dr: Leaving Wife. Moved out. I'm a new dad. Lots of learning and healing left to do, but cautiously as optimistic as I can be.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/czs8zz/final_update_i_29m_caught_my_wife_27f_letting_our/,relationship_advice,3249,231,0.0
MyBoyfriendIsNiceFR,2019-09-04 20:32:12+00:00,"UPDATE: My childhood ""friend"" went through my boyfriend's phone and found pictures of him having sex with me while I was sleeping. She told everyone and now he's being ostracized from our friends. Except it was my idea for him to do it in the first place [NSFW]","[Link to Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cxr0sp/my_childhood_friend_went_through_my_boyfriends/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

So a couple things have happened in the last few days, and I figured you guys would like to hear what the police finally settled on.

First, I'd like to clear up something first - the theft and distribution of this media was, in **no way, shape, or form**, the fault of my partner. He is just as much a victim of a crime as I am, if not more. This has been an emotionally tumultuous time for him. He is my partner and my foremost concern here is him. 

It's honestly absolutely terrible that so many people blamed him for this situation.

I spoke to a lawyer...and my Dad. The lawyer is my father's friend who is giving me advice for free. If this goes to court, he'll be representing us.

Anyways. Monday, I got a call from a very polite female officer, asking if both my boyfriend and myself could come in to the station to make a criminal report. The first officer to phone me was mistaken - while this does fall under revenge porn, it doesn't fit ""sexploitation"". She would have had to actually coerce him into sex acts for that.

Unfortunately, in my state, this is only a misdemeanor crime. *Fortunately*, it's a charge for every imaged stolen/shared. It also matters that there are two victims.

The police spoke to the people whose names I provided, most of which confirmed that Sarah had shared the photos. They'll be taking her phone as evidence and they'll ensure that the media is one hundred percent destroyed.

That all made both me and John happy, but as a lot of people pointed out, this stuff could easily already be on the internet.

(All of this has been approved by my partner, before anyone asks)

So I turned around and submitted copyrights for *all of it*. I spent nearly a shitton of money copyrighting over a hundred images and videos. Then I paid for a domain name and ""made"" a website - all it says is ""UNDER CONSTRUCTION"". Then I registered John and myself on several different pornographic media hosting sites and posted ""CONTENT PENDING COPYRIGHTS"".

THEN. I posted on Facebook.

""Recently, someone I consider a friend broke into John's phone and stole images. She then proceeded to share these images amongst some of my closest friends.

Not only am I disappointed, hurt, and betrayed, but this person placed John in a very disturbing position - one where he had to defend himself from sexual assault accusations. This person DID NOT come to me with these concerns, deciding that she would rather gossip with others under the guise of ""concern"".

Had I ACTUALLY been assaulted, this person would have been spreading horrible moments of my life to others, taking away my voice as a victim. How horrific, how absolutely *monstrous* does a person have to be to do something like that?

In actuality, this person stole intimate videos that were, in no way, intended for her. ""Stolen"" is the best word for this media because, well...

Most of you know me as an entrepreneur; I own a small business, I pick up freelance jobs, I dabble in several money making ventures. None of this is a consistent income, so John and I have been brainstorming on how I could possibly generate a passive income. 

So we started making pornographic media of a relatively popular kink. We had generated enough content to finally build an online following, and then our content was stolen and John's name was dragged through the dirt.

Shame on all of you who has participated in this shit flinging and pot stirring. 

Because of this person and ALL who participated, I have had to out John and myself as sex workers. I've had to speak to the police, a lawyer, my goddamn DAD. Shame on all of you.

From this point on, any person sharing these COPYRIGHTED images and videos will personally hear from my lawyer.

If anyone has legitimate concerns about my relationship, come to my goddamn face instead of spreading bullshit behind my back.

Thank you.""

Since then, I've been receiving non-stop calls and messages from people apologizing, asking questions, and, unsurprisingly, people are arguing about my expectation of privacy on Facebook.

Sarah tried to call but I hit ignore and texted her, ""You may contact my lawyer,"" and then gave her the number. She hasn't responded.

All in all, I'd say that things are looking up. Sarah is, rightfully, being charged with a crime or twelve. John's name is clear legally. Important people in my life know that I'm not being abused. 

People are reaching out to John to either apologize for misjudging the situation or to congratulate him on being a porn star.

So that's good, I guess.

I want to thank everyone who gave me good advice and urged me to go to the police and speak to a lawyer.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/czqc2i/update_my_childhood_friend_went_through_my/,relationship_advice,35385,2016,0.0

tmkbld,2019-09-04 16:13:48+00:00,UPDATE: Leaving my fiance who doesnt want me to go on a work trip. I have had enough of his abuse!," I plan on leaving him, I just need to get things in order first because we have a 6 month old daughter together. PLEASE do not shame me for having a baby with this man.  She is the best thing in my life and not a mistake.  He, of course, has had moments that have made me fall in love with him and he is not always a bad person which is why I have stayed for so long.

I am writing out all of the reasons why I am leaving him so that when I have doubts (it’s happened before and I’ve gone back) I can look at this and remember how upset he has made me feel. Right now, I feel so angry and hurt.  He is currently mad at me because I fell asleep with her last night and didn’t hang out with him, on accident.

A few years ago he had sex with me and recorded it while I was passed out drunk in our home.  He gave me chlamydia when we first started dating.  He has asked me to send pictures to prove where I am and who I am with many times.  He has checked my underwear.  He accuses me of cheating.  He does not like when I work-out or dress nice if it’s not just for him.  He gets mad if I don’t have sex with him almost every day.  He didn’t help me build any of the furniture for our daughter’s nursery.  He didn’t come to my first ultrasound.  He let his meth-head mother stay in our home and cuss me out.  He does not appreciate anything I do.  He punched a hole in the wall last time I told him I was leaving him.  He does not want me to go on a company trip as I posted before because he thinks I will cheat.  He hates my family and says I cannot bring my daughter around them until they show him “the respect he deserves”.  He points out EVERY SINGLE little thing I do wrong.  I am a good woman and a good girlfriend. I don’t deserve this.

It breaks my heart to say that I am growing to hate him. I need to figure my life out so I can get my daughter and I out.

I found out, through this sub, my boyfriend has been cheating on me for months. 

Back to the beginning. We’ve been dating for a while &amp; met through work/friends. I mean, this man is good. Or i thought.  I mean, he pursued this relationship with me. We basically only got set up because everybody knew he had a thing for me. But I genuinely liked him after i went on several dates with him. We did the entire sha-BANG. Met his family, he met mine. Everybody loved him. I loved him. I genuinely had no guards up regarding cheating, it never would have crossed my mind in a million years.  I mean things were good. REALLY good. During our relationship he always expressed to me that he missed a job opportunity before we met that he really wish he had. I supported him! For fucks sake I told him to pursue &amp; apply to any job that he wanted. He got offers right away— one from the his “dream job”.  This dream job is also two states away on a remote little island. We spoke a lot about me moving with him, he brought this up.  He wanted me to come and I don’t know moving for a guy... i got cold feet &amp; didn’t really plan but we agreed that we would stay together.   He begged me to stay together. I loved him I was willing to try. I remember having conversations with him regarding long distance and he would always tell me I’m crazy if i didn’t think WE would work it out. 


The past three months i felt him pulling away completely. I thought it was distance. I thought the insecurity was getting to me &amp; i was really actually just in my head about things- certain people, him not having time, refusing to call me at nights... But he was still checking in, still asking about family(even said he was sad he wouldn’t be able to come to my grandmothers wedding this upcoming saturday)... He was still telling me he loved me even when I couldn’t muster anything...



A friend sent me an anonymous post from this sub. It’s clearly him. The time he was posting, the questions he was asking. I guarantee there is not two guys that both got a job around the same time, same age, at the exact job, with the same dog. The dog that i took care of for a month when he was out of town 4 months ago&amp; took to the vet when he was sick. The dog i laid in bed with &amp; have been sending treats to. The post basically is him asking for advice regarding a girl that he apparently had followed on instagram months before even moving. How he was immediately attracted to her, how they went on a date &amp; kissed &amp; how he really likes her &amp; cant stop thinking about her. 


I didn’t confront him. I didn’t know. The kicker is I had come to visit him. I traveled on two planes, rented a car, drove two hours for him to refuse to see me. I’m at a complete loss. I feel like I dated a complete stranger. I didn’t realize people flipped switches so easily. Now i’m writing for... closure? On the same subreddit that shattered my reality in an instant. Anyways... waiting to board my flight home to restart my life. 

I’m shocked, I’m disappointed, I’m embarrassed, I’m hurt. I wish people just broke up with people. I don’t understand why he kept me around in his life in a big part. I mean with our fams involved &amp; shit. I respect &amp; love him so much &amp; I don’t understand how u could disrespect me so much. I mean... Is it not easier to dump somebody than to go through a messy breakup?

MonkeysOnAcid,2019-09-04 08:05:36+00:00,I (M28) broke up with my ex-fiancée (F27) of 4 years 2 weeks ago after catching her in a huge lie and then finding out 3 days ago that she commited suicide because i wouldn't take her back. I am in need of some serious advice as i'm being blamed for everything.,"Hey guys,

I need some serious advice as i'm pretty much being cornered by basically everyone and i really don't know what else to do as my mental state is declining and i'm left wondering if it's really all my fault?

A little background: 

Me and my ex-fiancée had been together for almost 6 years and engaged for 4 out of those 6 years. I was introduced to her by a close friend at a party and we just clicked. She was attractive, had a great personality and had similar hobbies as me which made it perfect.

Back in April of this year i started noticing little changes in her, she started wearing more revealing clothes to work, started putting more make-up and etc. Tbh i had no problem with any of that stuff, it's her body she can wear whatever and put how ever much make-up she wanted but what made things worse were when she started coming home late from work or how instead of spending the weekend off with me (we both had weekends off from work) she instead was always going out. I once had asked her why she never invited me to come with her to which she replied that it's only girls night out and that her other friends would not be happy if i tagged along as they were not bringing their own bf with them.

It all came crashing down when me and her had a huge fight in June because she decided that instead of going on a date with me she told me how she already had made plans with her friends and that it was rude of her to cancel and that was it. I blew up at her and we had huge fight which resulted in her packing her bags and leaving. I didn't hear from her for almost a week, none of her friends knew where she was and heck none of her folks even knew what was going on until she finally contacted and wanted to talk.

Imagine my surprise when she confessed that there was another guy involved and how all this time she has been hanging out with him when all this time she was lying to me about hanging with her friends. I fucking blew up, i wanted nothing to do with her and was going to break up with her until she got on her knees and begged me to give her a chance which my dumbass self did but only after she revealed everything to me and she did. It made me fucking sick to my stomach but in the end i forgave her and told her to delete all the contact info of the other guy and that i expect her to have no contact with him going forward which she promised and things kinda went back to before.

Heck, we were even spending more time together but that feeling, that trust wasn't there anymore.

Everything was kinda OK until 2 weeks ago a friend of mine who was visiting another city for 3 hours from where i lived sent me a picture with the message ""Sorry bro"" that broke my already broken heart into billion of little pieces. The picture was of my ex-fiancée at a mall 3 hours away from where we lived holding hands with some stranger who i didn't know. I fucking broke down, i was heartbroken. She was a bitch, a piece of shit especially since i thought she was at work while in reality she was 3 hours away holding hands with her lover.

When i got home from work i waited for her and right away confronted her which she denied and called me a psycho for not believing her and that I'm a piece of shit for not trusting her until i showed her the picture that my friend sent me. Her face told me everything and when the waterworks started i knew that i had made a huge mistake in taking her back so i ended it.
She cried and fucking begged me to think it over and not to throw away everythink that we have together which made me fucking angry and i'm not going to lie but i fucking slapped her. I was not proud, i'm still not but she saying shit like not to throw away everthing when it was her who threwaway everything pissed me off.

I told her to pack her shit and leave, called her parents and mine and told them everything, her parents came to help her and i told them to basically fuck off after they told me to think it over and to make the right decision before actually ending it. She begged me not to end things but i did, had to for my own piece of mind.

I did not hear from her or her parents until 3 days ago when my parents called me to let know that ex-fiancée had comitted suicide. Her parents found her hanging and she had left a letter apologising to everyone including my parents and me and how she is sorry from tye bottom of heart for what she did to me and that she can't live without me and because of that she ended it.

I am at a fucking lose, ex-fiancée friends and family are blaming me and my own mother told me that it was my fault, she told me that i should have forgiven her because since i'm clearly worth comitting suicide over. 

I am fucking disgusted, i have currently taken some time off from work and have not a single clue what to do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/czhvrp/i_m28_broke_up_with_my_exfiancée_f27_of_4_years_2/,relationship_advice,62460,10182,0.0
skaarlthetaco,2019-09-03 22:38:44+00:00,My mom is cheating on my dad behind his back,"Hey guys,  I (13M) need help. Starting from Nov 2018, my mom had been texting her old friend(?) in Vietnam and we thought it was fine. But during July, my sister told me that she saw my mom sending hearts to that guy (call him orange) and calling him cute names. My dad didn't know then.

My mom downloaded Zalo on her working PC and texted orange in there too. Now from July to now, we have been watching mom closely and she had sent him more than just cute pictures. While in Vietnam this July, my mom had constantly visited his massage place and even went to Cambodia with him. Now for some dumb reasons, my grandmother hates my dad so whenever my parents fight, she would edge my mom to divorce him. And she approves my mom with orange

I told my dad a week ago about this, and every single night, he had been asking my mom questions if this was true. She denied it at first, but slowly gave in. However, she told my dad that she would stop texting him. She didn't, and she changed orange's contact. My dad refrained me from showing him evidence because if my mom found out, she would hide more information from us.

Now my dad's mind is saying to let things keep on going like nothing happened, I think, that if things went on normally, she would push the matter even more. My dad is a very strong guy...but

Today I saw him cry

Should I be worried?,"Context here: we’ve been dating two years now, living together for about 6 months. I was away this weekend, and Saturday night my girlfriend went out with her guy friend, got pretty drunk, and stayed out late.  She has been friends with him for several years and has known him longer than we’ve been dating, but never seemed like anything.

I didn’t know anything she was doing that Saturday night until I came home Sunday afternoon. My text to her the previous night was unanswered to until 8:30AM.  When I got home, she was clearly hungover and I asked about her night.

It was then that she said she went out with her friend and that he crashed on our couch because he lives far away (google maps has it at about 30 mins drive).  I also saw she was in the process of washing the bedsheets we sleep with.

I thought to myself it was a little weird, but shrugged it off because I trust her and she offered up that detail.

My gut only really started to feel something was off when later that night, when we were intimate in bed, she makes a comment about the way I kiss.  We’ve been together for two years, mind you, so why she’s only now making a remark about this made me feel like there was some other context behind it.  If she made this comment on a normal day, I wouldn’t think twice. But because of when it occurred, it set me on edge.

shaky2236,2019-09-03 10:14:48+00:00,"I (30M) won on a scratchcard, my brother (25M) has said that if i dont give him money he will turn his back on the family forever.","Hi,

Just to be clear from the go, im not after advice on whether i should give him money or not. He isnt getting any. But id like advice on any way to try and solve the issue.

I won on a scratch card recently, not enough to live on forever but a tidy amount. I payed off all my debt, my parents debt (they are due retirement and couldnt due to the debts they had aquired).

The problem was that i gave my step brother (ill call him Phil), and his wife, both of which im really close to. My biological brother (mike) found out about this and said he deserved money more than my step brother as he was ""real family"".

At 18 mike left home and moved about 100 miles away, got into a bad crowd and hardcore drugs, had numerous run ins with police and constantly needed money from the parents, causing them to go into greater debt to bail him out. The only time he would contact home was for money. Even at Christmas, he was in the area for 2 weeks (about 5 mile away from home) but didnt even come to see my parents once who were really excited to see him. He went out with friends to get wasted and ""forgot"" to see the family. 

He has forgotten his dads (my step dad) birthday every year. Never calls home, never answers whenever they call or text, unless he wants something, usually money. When i got married, he last min couldnt come to the wedding for an apparent emergency, which turned out to be a festival that he went to instead. We got married abroad and had already payed for his flight and hotel which we couldnt cancel due to being 2 days before. He didnt even contact me when my child was born to say congratulations or anything. she's now 4 and has never met him, i dont have facebook or anything so i dont even know if he knows what she looks like.

When he found out that id won money (i have no idea who told him) he instantly called asking for 28 grand to bail him out of his loans, car payments and of course drug money that he owed. I refused and explained that i had just enough left to put a deposit down on a house and that id given most of the money away, leaving just enough for myself.

When he found out that phil recieved a 5 figure sum from me, he lost his mind and litterally started screaming at me for picking him over my ""real"" brother. Phil and his wife have always been like brother and sister to me. They were there for me when my marriage broke down, helped me get on my feet again by putting down a depsoit on a rented property for me and i wanted to do good by them to show my appreciation. Theyre good people.

Anyways, after a big argument with Mike, explaining that he owed me over 5k already, every shitty thing that he did to the family and why he deserved nothing, he said that he was leaving the family forever. No one has heard from him since.

My parents are obviously devastated, they still love him but they understand and agree with my decision. Theyre good people who have never had much and are great parents. I honestly believe that if i gave him any money, he would spend it on herion. He threatened me with court but im guessing realised that he wouldnt win and dropped it. Now i just get the occasional one word texts from him saying ""C*nt"" or ""die.""

For my parent's sake, id love to be able to sort something out. He can hate me forever, thats fine, but his dad has done nothing wrong and doesnt deserve to be abandoned. 

Id happily just cut all ties but it wouldnt be fair on my parents. Any advice on how to handle the situation would be great.

TL:DR - i won some money, helped family members out of debt and my heroin addict brother has cut all ties with the family because i didnt give any to him.

So a lot has happened after mom and sister left and we took the money that was menat for my sister's car down payment for the restoration.

My grandma called me and asked what was happening. 

I explained to my grandma what happened and tried explaining who Stan Lee was. Surprisingly she understood just perfectly. I was relieved. For a moment I thought that my dad and I would get shit from everyone.
My sister started giving me shit about telling our grandma and being a ""snitch"". I told her that she asked me and I just told the truth.

But what took the cake was that my sister apparently ranted in her friend group chat about me and how she couldn't understand my behavior. She again ridiculed my hobby and so on. One of the dudes was really pissed and they had a big argument in the gc. The dude was so mad that he posted the screenshots in his insta story and they spread like wildfire. She is now being ostracized by our community with a few exceptions.

My mom and sister came back in the morning. They didn't talk much to us . My mom  came in my room and asked if we found somone that restored the picture. We had a short dry conversation till she asked me why I was making such a big deal about it. And I shut her up like you guys told me to. I started by explain who Stan Lee was, how long the painting took me, how much it meant to me, equated it to the monetary value and ended it with ""it is not only about the autograph. It's about the disrespect you both showed me and how little you seemed to care about me. You said that it was not worth it to destroy family over materialistic things but your daughter destroyed my most valuable possention because I didn't lend her my jacket ""

Ya'll my mom cried. She apologized profusely. She said she just didn't know how to deal with it and just wanted the tension to be over and as I was more cool headed than my sister she selfishly expected me to be the bigger person.

throwaway2782826,2019-09-02 14:22:18+00:00,I (21 M) am unsure whether to breakup with my girlfriend (21 F) over marriage concerns,"I’ll try and keep this short, or as short as is possible with these kind of things.

So me and my girlfriend have been dating for ~ 2 years now, we complement each other well and are very loved up. Our relationship has had its peaks and troughs, as is normal with any, but there’s always been this wholesome, unfettering love through thick and thin. 

We’ve always talked about longevity and our future in a sort of daydreamy way. However, recently it’s become more of a serious conversation and it’s quickly transpired that it’s very unlikely that we will be “together forever”.

The crux of the issue is that we are different religions. I’m not a religious person really so I don’t really care, but she feels her religion is a strong part of her identity (although she is not that religious herself) and has made it clear that she wants to raise her kids as such (and will not compromise on this). 

The problem with this is that my parents are very religious and my relationship would never be the same with them if I did raise my kids like that. It would ruin them, to be frank. The only people I love more than my girlfriend are my parents (and my brother), so estranging myself from them isn’t something I’d consider really.

She recognises all this, and accepts that it’s highly unlikely we will be together forever— i.e. it’s not impossible but it is extremely improbable. 

The issue I’m having is that despite the fact that we are so young (with marriage being at least 5+ years away), I don’t know how I could stay with someone that I was probably only going to be with temporarily? Her viewpoint is that we should value the time we have together, as much as it may be, and make the most of it, together - even if we only have a couple of years she has made it clear she’d much rather take that over nothing since she loves me so much.


I, on the other hand, am really having trouble reconciling/justifying a temporary relationship in my mind. I wish I thought like her, I really do, since it would make things so much easier. 

Realistically, at 21, marriage talk is so early, but most couples will assume there is a decent ish chance they will stay together forever, rather than thinking eh I expect this to last a couple more years then we’ll probably break up. 




TL:DR

Boy and girl have religious differences meaning marriage is likely impossible. Girl wants to stay with boy for as long as she can despite this, boy not sure if he can stay if relationship is likely only temporary.

Through doing this, I sadly found out that Allie was telling the truth. Every single person in my friend group except for 2 said that my scars would make them uncomfortable at the beach (keeping in mind, I never said I'd go to the beach), and they'd rather I didn't come.

I told them all how much it hurt that they'd say this to me, and how upset I was that I was basically being abandoned by my friends, and that I didn't want to associate with them anymore because of how hurt I felt, and those messages were met with either no reply, or simply ""I'm sorry, I don't know what you want me to do about that.""

As for the 2 friends who weren't uncomfortable, they both confided in me that they have also struggled with self-harm in the past and were disgusted by the behaviour of the others in the group. One of people has chosen to stay with the group, and the other has told me that she'd like to remain friends, but still hang out with those people on occasion

So in conclusion, I lost 9 friends, I feel like shit, and I don't know if my self esteem will ever make a recovery from this.

ToBeAGoodFriend,2019-09-01 23:40:02+00:00,My (25F) best friend (25F) slept with an old crush at her bachelorette party and acts like nothing happened,"I’m torn between doing “the right thing” which would likely ruin a 20 year friendship or closing my eyes and looking the other way. Hear me out. 

Let’s call her Jane. Jane and I have been friends and neighbors since we were 5. We went to college together and had a typical “wild streak” during those years, filled with lots of debauchery. We never did any drugs, though. That was our hard line in the sand. After graduating, we both got well paying jobs and essentially got our lives together. I am not married and still happily single, but Jane is engaged to be married to a great guy, let’s call him Robert. Our families love him and over time, he also became my good friend. They’re getting married in a beautiful destination wedding in September. I couldn’t be more excited for them and Jane has been planning this event for close to a year. 

This weekend we had her bachelorette party which consisted of going to our country club with 8 other girl friends. The plan was to just swim, tan, BBQ, play volleyball, watch movies, drink cocktails, and reminisce. On Saturday morning, Jane comes to breakfast and tells us that she has a surprise for us. Okay, shouldn’t be the other way around? Lol. Anyway, around noon, 6 dudes in swimming attire roll in. We were like, “um, isn’t this supposed to be a girls weekend?” to which Jane replied, “yeah but I figured you girls need some company”. We all laughed, however none of us ever even hinted at needing men. Turns out, this was just her cover and ruse to get guys in without making it obvious it was for her. We spent the day by the pool, playing volleyball and drinking. Now, most of the girls there were single so we got a little touchy feely with the guys. To our surprise, at some point towards the evening, I see Jane making out with a dude in the pool. I just brushed it off and went about my business. Another friend Karen walked up to me asking why is [name of guy] here. Initially I didn’t know who she was referring to but then it clicked. I knew that dude looked familiar but couldn’t put my finger on where from. Turns out, he was Jane’s HUGE CRUSH in college. Classic football star, philanderer, handsome and charming guy. We both realized that the whole reason why she had invited these guys over was that she could casually spend time with her old crush. 

At that point I figured the party was taking a turn we weren’t comfortable with so I walked up to Jane, pulled her to the side and essentially reminded her that she’s getting married next month. She laughed me off, asking me to not ruin her party. I wasn’t about to argue with her so I dropped it. They made out the whole night, in front of everyone else. Jane was sitting on his lap, kissing, petting, doing all sorts of inappropriate things. Another girl even tried to say that our party days should be behind us, we’re grown ups now, not teenagers fucking in bushes. Nope, nothing could swing Jane. Around 2am, everyone went to the rooms. As expected, Jane and that guy spent the night in the same bedroom and I assume they were not playing board games. This morning, we all had breakfast, then the guys left, we checked out, and came back home. I talked to Jane earlier and she is back into the full wedding prep mode, talking about flowers and menus. 

Me and the girls discussed about whether we should have a serious talk with Jane. We’ve all seen other friends of ours getting married to the wrong people, being miserable, and getting divorced before they hit their 30s. I don’t want this to happen to her. We’re pretty much 50/50 on whether we should just forget what happened and never mention it again or have the talk with her. We all saw that she and that guy had some weird chemistry and seemed very comfortable with each other. I’m not sure if that was their first time together since college. I’m thinking that she might still have a thing for that dude but I am not sure how to bring it up with her without sounding harsh. What do we do?

Her father was ten years older than me. I didn’t even know I was pregnant until I was already six months. I grew up in a Latin American country, and abortion is really taboo and very illegal so late.

Figured I would post an update because so many people replied. It opened my eyes. 

I decided to break up with her. I made it very clear that the pregnancy had nothing to do with it, and that this had already been on my mind for a while.  Obviously she was broken. She only cried when I told her, I felt so horrible and still do. She begged and pleaded with me which only made things worse, it was painful. She wanted to go do couples therapy but I couldn't do it. I simply don't see a future with her, despite how much love I have for her. 

Regarding the pregnancy.. I told her that I didn't want to be a dad right now, but that I would support her choice. She told me she wants to have the kid, and I told her I didn't want to be involved. It's not set in stone yet (I think), but she's having the baby and I'll pay child support but wont be involved in any other way. She has asked me to come to the doctor appointments, and I told her I wasn't sure because that's the truth. I don't want to give her any false hope, though she says she understands we're done, but I don't believe her because she is also still texting me. I know this break up is super tough on her, and it's frustrating because I want to be there for her but I'm the one who fucked this all up. I'm not proud of myself.

Problemoftheyear,2019-09-01 15:31:17+00:00,[F23] Found out that my [M29] boyfriend only settled for me and is not really attracted to me.,"Saw his text messages open and I did pry and when I catched a glimpse of ""break up with her"" (his friend wrote that), I couldn't help but read the entire conversation.

My boyfriend, who is 29, and has been with me for a year, is my first relationship and I'm his first as well. The difference between us, he's been looking for a girlfriend all through his 20s, while I wasn't too bothered/didn't care for guys much. (Busy with college, not much interest, not much need). 

He literally wrote to his friend that he trapped in the relationship. That he wishes he could just hook up and flirt with other girls but he also wrote he always gets rejected and has no chance.

Then he wrote how he would like to be with ""hot girls"" or even just date a hot girl and how he feels like he settled for an average girl.

I am insanely mad.

Honestly, being realistic, I'm a bit above average (My face is about 70th percentile realistically speaking and my body is quite fit/skinny), whereas, as sexy as I find him, is a bit unconventional looking/overweight. Probably average guy by US standards, but he is, (Not in my eyes!), not someone who should complain.

Although, I do believe everyone has the right to be with who they are attracted to. I like chunky guys, others do not. So I don't get why he is with me when I'm not attractive to him and I'm just straight up disappointed.

Besides, his need for hook ups - I don't get it. I'm more enthusiastic about sex than he is, I initiate it, and I would have it more often if he were willing to. 

What made me lose my sh*t is that he thinks he only ""settled"" for me.

I get the impression he's only with me so he won't die alone.

Two nights ago we went to a wedding rehearsal party, a cocktail party. We showed up a little late and everyone was drunk by the time we got there. I was a little over served and woke up the next day at home pretty hungover. At no point in that night did I think I was away from my wife longer than a piss break.

Fast forward to the next day we are at the wedding reception and find our table. My wife sits on the farthest end and I'm next to this man. We are all getting to know each other and its and outdoor wedding where it starts drizzling. They have umbrellas they put up but my wife's seat is on the fringe and she's getting rained on. I asked her 5 times to change seats and she wouldn't. On the sixth time she gives in and switches me now sitting next to this guy. I realize she's now not the same and drinking her wine faster. Then she tells me. 

This dirtbag, who had been talking to me about my kid all night sharing stories of his own 3yr old, grabbed my wife's ass and deeply pressed his hand as if to grab her vagina from behind. Last night at the party.

I'm furious .ready to make a scene, but it's her friends wedding so I dont. I feel like a coward but i dont. We get up from the table to talk about it and end up leaving before the food comes.

She cries the whole cab ride home. So what do we do now? Apparently this guy is the brides employee, high level high paying workplace. Do we tell the bride and get this guy in trouble at work? Is that too revengeful? Was he too drunk to even remember what he did?
How do I get my wife to tell me when things like this happen the moment it happens?
 How do I heal this divide where I dont feel I can touch her without it reminding her of this guy or me of what happened.

Last night my partner (29M) and I (27F) went out for a few drinks in this bar that was playing loads of songs we were listening to like 10 years ago, and it got us talking about our teenage years.

We got home and I suggested we set up the speaker with Spotify and take it turns to each add one track at a time that was important to us to a playlist, and talk each other through why it was significant as the song played.

We've been together three years and we do have an amazing relationship, but we sat up for hours last night and learned so much about each other that we didn't know. We laughed, we cried, we were totally vulnerable around each other and it was fantastic. We found that some songs were important to both of us and had vastly different reasons as to why, and we'd have never known otherwise. Songs that one of us had previously hated suddenly had a totally different meaning because it was important to one of us and had incredible memories attached to it.

Okay so I am a huge Marvel nerd. The kind of nerd that Cosplays, goes to cons and draws her own stuff. Mostly fanservice.

My sister ridicules my hobby saying that it's pathetic and ""retarded"". She claims I am delusional as a grown woman playing dress up.

Besides that we have a good relationship. We are not friends but sisters if that makes sense.

So 3 years ago I managed to safe up enough to go to a con in the USA and meet the real Stan Lee! He signed one of my own pictures I did of the big 3 and complimented it. It's was one of the best days of my life.
Since then the signed picture has always been on my wall.

Flash forward. A few weeks ago my sister asks for my jacket and I tell her no. Reason being that she was a bitch to me the whole week. She pouted and I left the house.

When I come back is see my fucking Stan Lee autograph ripped up on the flor! I fucking lost it. Then my sister came in and started teasing me (look at that  grown ass woman crying over a piece of paper). When she saw that I was for real distressed she started saying that it was just a piece of paper that I can get a new one.

I pushed her out of my room and have been extremely short with her since. She tries to engage in conversation but I shoot her down. She tries to bribe me with movie tickets and I tell her to go with her boyfriend etc. She hasn't apologized for it. She just says that I should be over it by now.

My mom says the same. She says a materialistic things shouldn't come In between family and that I should simply let it go. My dad is also really mad at sister and by extention mom. He is as big on Marvel as me and he was livid when he found out. This whole ordeal is literally splitting our family apart.

My mother and sister think i am being unfair by not letting go and I think they both disrespected me. Mom is mad at dad for not ""talking sense into me and taking my side"" and dad is mad at mom for ""failing to punish my sister and spoiling her""

pickleshut,2019-08-30 12:08:40+00:00,(Update to) I [32M] was going to propose to my girlfriend [30F] until she told me she's pregnant,"I was thinking I'd edit the original post, but I decided I'd rather spend the night focused on my fiance than on reddit. Since the original post really blew up I don't think too many people would see an edit, so I'm making a new post instead.

I took my lunch break early to be with my girlfriend at the OBGYN visit. The IUD was removed without any problems (it had shifted around which likely caused it to fail), and the pregnancy is not eptopic. However, a miscarriage is much more likely, and if the baby is carried to term, there's a higher chance for complications and defects. It's far from a guarantee but it's a lot more risky than if it was any other birth control method that failed. I ended up taking the rest of the afternoon off so we could talk through everything together. Eventually we decided we should get out of the house so we put some leftovers in my lunch bag and went to the park.

Normally there is nothing special about eating day-old hoagies in a park, but it really helped us relax. We sat on a blanket at the spot we first met and talked about a lot of things. Eventually the sun began to set and I decided it was time. I started to say I had been planning to do this for awhile and it wasn't because she was pregnant but she started tearing up and cut me off. She told me she understood so I skipped the rest of my fluff and asked her to marry me. She said yes, and we spent the next few minutes crying, hugging, and kissing. After we got our emotions under control she told me she'd seen my post (I knew she used reddit but I didn't realize she lurked here) and had been expecting it all evening. She said she would have preferred I proposed at our anniversary dinner (can't argue with that) but this was still about as lovely as she could have hoped for.

Although the shadow of a potentially stormy pregnancy is looming above us, I am still very happy and feel lucky to be with her. We're going to visit our parents this weekend to break the news and get through the mountain of questions they're sure to have. We're not thinking about a wedding ceremony yet, but we'll definitely be getting our marriage license in the next few months like someone suggested.

We decided on having a relatively small wedding which is in two days. Everything was going great. He seems absolutely perfect and we are very much in love.

I am a virgin and so is he, he wanted to save it for marriage and I wasn't fussed so I agreed to saving it. He has told me earlier that in his family the father checks the virginity of the bride the night before the wedding. I laughed this off as it seriously sounds like a massive joke. No turns out he was dead serious. He wants me, the night before to open my legs up in a small ceremony type thing so his dad can check me while him, his brothers and uncle can watch so that they know I am still 'pure'.

I told him fat chance I am going to do that and he was begging to me to go through with it and how important it is for him. He said he knew it was slightly embarrassing for me but his mom did and it will prove how much I love him and that I have nothing to hide anyway as I am still a virgin. I left and he was crying, it was very dramatic tbh.

I want to call off the whole wedding because of this and never talk to him again. But at the same time its only one thing and other then that we are genuinely perfect for each other and I dont want to spend my life with anyone else and it is very important to him and his family.

CoCoOhNoThrowaway,2019-08-29 13:38:01+00:00,Update: Best friend (33F) wanted me to lose weight for her wedding...,"So wow that post blew up.. I ended up deleting it because my friend lost business over it. She had told a few of her close clients her plan. When it blew up and ended up on FB via different news outlets.. they were able to put two and two together. They decided they didn’t want her to be their PT any longer.. That was never ever my intention. Although I feel bad, play stupid games, win stupid prizes... Anyways- her and I talked in length. She admitted her true motivation was having before (my wedding photos) and after pictures (her wedding) of a “normal Mom transformed into a fit Mom”. She was also planning on having crop top dresses. After 3 pregnancies my abs are quite separated, and she wanted to “help”. She realized her motivations were selfish. She knew I would decline, so she had hoped presented this way I would do it for her... But yea, her concern was never my health. She admitted that multiple times.

To address a few things: 
* $2,500 plane tickets were for a family of 5. 
*I’ve also never hinted at wanting to lose weight. She knows I’m very comfortable with who I am. 
*Also my doctor is very happy with where I stand. I received many very strange messages and comments telling me my doctor is lying to me... I can assure you, my doctor would make a lot more money telling me I was fat and needing to run extra tests.. So he’s not going to lie about my health. That’s about the exact opposite of what a doctor does.. 
*My husband is not a sexist pig for saying he wanted to show me off at a nude beach. He’s my biggest supporter. He just meant that I don’t need to hide and I’m beautiful the way I am.
* The fiancé wasn’t behind this.. but he’s pissed that I wouldn’t just do it for her... He literally said “Tell her anything over a size 4 is disgusting” in the background when I spoke to her. So good luck with your winner there...

After we spoke, I have decided that just I’m going to go to the wedding, and not be in the wedding. My family will stay home. She feels terrible, but we’ve been friends for almost 30 years. I’m also not going to fly out for her showers and bachelorette, which I would have done otherwise. This really put our friendship in perspective for me. She had stepped back a little since she got serious with her fiancé, and I didn’t realize the extent of it. He has some strong views on hating anyone over a size 4, and I realized she’s slowly picked these up as well. I have no idea what the friendship holds after this, but I still want to be there to cheer her on for the wedding.. but I don’t have to be immersed in every aspect.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cx11pk/update_best_friend_33f_wanted_me_to_lose_weight/,relationship_advice,1755,249,0.0
pickleshut,2019-08-29 11:49:25+00:00,I [32M] was going to propose to my girlfriend [30F] until she told me she's pregnant,"A few days ago, my girlfriend and I celebrated our 3rd anniversary. I was planning on proposing at dinner (had the ring and everything), but the day before she told me she's pregnant. It seems her IUD failed, which is unfortunate, but we are at a position in our lives where we can handle a child, and I'm ready to support her through pregnancy and become a father.

We had discussed the possibility of kids in the past, and after discussing this recent revelation we'd be happy to bring this child into the world. I just don't know when I should propose, I'm worried it would seem like a shotgun marriage. Should I try and explain I've been planning on this for months already and that it's not spur of the moment, or should I wait a bit longer? I absolutely intend to marry her, but this could not have been worse timing, it feels like everything has become much more complicated now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cwzsvp/i_32m_was_going_to_propose_to_my_girlfriend_30f/,relationship_advice,7198,816,0.0
TheSunIsFallingAgain,2019-08-29 04:55:17+00:00,"I [M] am in an interracial relationship of 7 years. I’m white, she’s black. Race/ism is destroying our relationship...","My girlfriend and I have been together for 7 years. We have had an amazing relationship thus far and I couldn’t ask for a better woman and mother. However, there is one dark cloud hanging over us that may be enough to end what we’ve built. 

You see, my girlfriend is very active in black rights; mainly via social media. Now, before you read on, I am too! We aren’t out on the streets marching, but we both believe in equality for everyone. The problem is, she spends so much time concentrating on injustice in the black community and white privilege, that she then projects her feelings on to me. 

For the first two years of our relationship, we would have open debates about all types of different social injustices. Now, don’t get me wrong, during that time, I was very defensive. I never wanted to be coined a “racist” for any reason. Through my defensiveness, we had many fights. 

Over the years, I have grown, and so has she. I’ve learned to listen and then respond. This had helped a lot for a long time. We both began to be on the same page. But, lately, it’s like a fire has been lit under her. Now, it seems as if everyday I’m being reminded of my “white privilege”. I’m being reminded of how difficult it is for her in her everyday life. I’m berated at night for being white. If I try to engage in dialogue, I’m dismissed or labeled “racist” for entering my two cents. If I stay silent and listen, I’m “pouting and seething”. I can’t win for losing. 

What bothers me is that I work full time to take care of us and our daughter. We live in a nice place, we have nice things, we go out for fancy dinners, we go on vacations, when she asks for something, she gets it. I’m currently paying for her student loans for a degree that she hasn’t utilized quite yet. Currently, she stays home and raises our daughter. She’s a phenomenal mother. Our daughter is unbelievably advanced for her age. And I credit that ALL to her. But I receive no appreciation for what I’ve done and where I’ve gotten us to. We’ve been through dirt poor and now, comfortable together. 

In our 7 years of being together, I’ve seen one moment of someone being racist towards her and that was an estranged family member of mine who has now been ousted. We have experienced far more flack for being an interracial couple over the years. 

Anyhow, tonight was one of those nights where things boiled to a head. She talked about racism and white privilege for about three hours. At one point she even said “I know I’m a bit racist, but it doesn’t matter because I’m not part of the majority and therefore, I can’t affect someone’s life”. This comment forced me to look up from what I was doing, but ultimately, I didn’t say anything because I knew where this would go. After about another hour, she was becoming a bit more hostile. I managed to stay silent and just listen to what she had to say. Then, she said I was pouting because I wouldn’t say anything. And that I don’t know what it’s like to be like her and that I’ve never experienced anything like she has before. And you know what? I KNOW that. But what ultimately happens in our relationship is that ALL of my problems are dismissed because I’m white and NOT black. I can’t be stressed. I can’t be worried. I can’t be angry. Because I’m white...I’m the privileged one. 

Where do I go from here? I can’t handle this every day. I’m NOT the one she should be fighting against but it always ends up that way. She ended her monologue tonight with “well, if we don’t make it together, you’ll know why”. What the hell should I be doing?! Any advice is welcome; especially from other interracial couples. 

P.s. this is a burner account because she knows my main accounts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cww8no/i_m_am_in_an_interracial_relationship_of_7_years/,relationship_advice,3412,699,0.0
throwawaste0,2019-08-29 03:24:16+00:00,Dads friend creeping me out,"My dads really good friend from college who is basically considered part of our family is visiting my dad for this week, came on Monday and leaves Monday. My dad has been super excited to see him for a really long time and my mom was pretty excited to see him also. I (17F) have not really talked to him or seen him much, but my dad has said all good things about him. 


Anyways, we went to the beach on Monday afternoon, I saw him (49M) staring at me and it made me feel uncomfortable, so I told my parents I was done swimming and changed back into normal clothes. The next day, I saw him in my room after I got home from school and asked him what he was doing, he said he lost something in my room, but after he left I saw a few of my panties on the ground out of my laundry basket for some reason... Finally, I was changing my clothes before we went out to dinner and he knocks once and then barges in saying something about my dad needing me, I screeched, I was completely naked and extremely embarrassed while he looked me up and down and then walked out slowly like nothing happened. Also every time he speaks to me he licks his lips the whole conversation.

throwawway747383,2019-08-29 01:10:14+00:00,Update: I [28M] think my wife [26F] of 2 years masturbated to my best friend [28M].,"Thank you all for the advice. This is not an exciting update and as it turns out things were even shittier than I imagined. Earlier today my wife and I had a moment alone and I brought up the situation again. At first she told me who she thinks about while masturbating is not my business, but when I asked specifically about my friend she didn't deny thinking about him. I pressed on and asked her how she would feel if our roles were reversed and eventually she admitted she was thinking about their interaction in the pool, but that there wasn't anything wrong with it.

But then to take the heat off of her she started blaming him. She said that earlier when we were all playing volleyball and they were both on the same side of the net he grabbed her butt under the water. And that when he threw her out of the water he very stealthily placed a finger you know where. That's when she had to leave the pool. I got really really really fucking pissed and asked her if what she was saying was true. I know this guy from childhood and we both know his girlfriend from high school. Now, my wife doesn't usually take that kind of crap, so the fact she didn't punch him in the face right then and there speaks volumes. I got the vibe there's been some shit going on behind my back for a while.

I stormed out of our bedroom to comfront my ""friend"" and he was sitting on the porch with his girlfriend (of 6 years, mind you). I asked him point blank if he grabbed her butt earlier. He acted sort of surprised (everyone in the house knew something was up, so I think he knew it was coming) and denied it, but you can just tell when someone's full of shit. He definitely did it. But the weirdest part is that HIS GIRLFRIEND didn't bat an eye. It's hard to explain, and English is not my first language, but I got the vibe there's some shady shit going on between the three of them. So I grabbed my things in silence, left, and now I'm sitting on the bus station. I have no fucking clue what's going on and I'm not sure I wanna now. I also don't get what the fuck was my wife's end game and why she would tell on him/them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cwtvew/update_i_28m_think_my_wife_26f_of_2_years/,relationship_advice,12930,1145,0.0

We pay equal rent and both co-signed the lease.

The day after bringing home a girl, my roommate confronts me that if I chose to have sex, I cannot have it in the apartment. I should do that at her place instead.

For clarification, this girl and I got physical entirely in within the confines of my locked bedroom. He saw nothing.

He says he doesn’t approve of my lifestyle and if I continue to have premarital sex I should move out or be sure it’s never in “this home”.

unifarahbee3,2019-08-28 16:19:22+00:00,[UPDATE] I(28m) wrongly accused my girlfriend (24F) of cheating. I don't know where to go from here.,"So, my last post (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cw31od/i_28m_wrongly_accused_my_gf_24f_of_cheating_dont/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) got a lot of responses and I decided to do a prompt update as a lot has changed in just the last day and I wanted to update anyone who was interested and/or concerned for my girlfriend. 

I read your responses and decided to make a big apology to my girlfriend for how I behaved. However, before I got chance, she arrived at the house. 
I'll hold my hands up and say that this isn't the first time I've jumped to conclusions and pretty much since we got together, I've had a habit of winding myself up and then checking her phone/accounts. I know it's wrong, but I always felt if I found something I'd be justified which is so messed up, I know. 

My ex did cheat on me. Well, she had an affair and left me for the other dude. I guess I projected this onto my current girlfriend. My girlfriend never, ever has given me any reason to doubt her and treats me better than I've ever been treated before. She's down to earth, honest, open, funny, kind, beautiful and she gives me to opportunity to share my thoughts and feelings with no judgement. 

I don't know why I assumed the worst of her, I really don't. 
To answer a common question - she has online banking app on her phone and it's the same passcode as her mobile so I could log on. Super super fucked up, I know. 

When she arrived at the house, she was calm but sad. She explained that she knew I'd always check her phone and that I'd be ""off"" with her anytime she went out with friends but that she always hoped over time, if she proved herself, I'd let go. When she found out that I'd done what I did, it hurt even more because she was trying to do something nice for me. 
She told me she loves me but she finds herself justifying every activity she does, over explaining herself and told me she has real, genuine anxiety whenever she's out with friends because she knows I'll be sat at home imagining scenarios of where she could be. She found herself withdrawing from friends. 

She told me we were over. Not because she doesn't love me, because she can't devote her life to someone who only sees the worst in her. She told me that I could have just spoke to her and she'd be honest but that she knows even if she did, I wouldn't believe her unless I could prove it and she's probably right. I don't know why, but I know in myself I would not fully believe her because I mean, of course she'd say that, right? Anyway... She left me. Packed up her things and went. 

I know her, she's a strong minded woman. It really is over and I've never felt worse. But she's right, I'm not ready to trust someone yet and even in our last moments, she gave me the confidence and motivation to get help and be better, even if she won't be there to see the change. I know she loves me and that fact alone makes it worth changing myself. 

I'm not going to try and win her back, because I can't promise I won't do it again. I'm heartbroken and hurt but she verbalised it in such a way, it really hit home. She calmly explained it to me in a way that only showed me her true love for me. 

I'm just so sorry for hurting her, I guess. 

But, thank you all for sharing your opinions and giving me some home truths. I appreciate it more than you know. 

This is it for now, hopefully this time next year I'll be a new man and be able to treat the next woman who loves me, the way my ex girlfriend deserved to be treated. 

**Tl;Dr** my gf left me. She made the right choice. I'm reflecting and moving forward.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cwn0yo/update_i28m_wrongly_accused_my_girlfriend_24f_of/,relationship_advice,5623,486,0.0

irdkirdcohwell,2019-08-28 06:23:33+00:00,Updated: My boyfriend just sent me a concerning text regarding our relationship... I’m not sure what to do..?,"[Original Post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cwdw1b/my_boyfriend_just_sent_me_a_concerning_text/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)




So first of all I would love to thank everyone for advising me during this time of, for lack of better words, Emotional Stress, I am completely overwhelmed by the amount of people who have helped relieve this tight feeling in my chest, help me calm down a bit. I greatly appreciate the people who were concerned enough to PM me and make sure I was alright. 

I wouldn’t feel right getting all this feedback and advice without updating all of you,  so here you go: 
 
Once my boyfriend got home we had a very long talk, it all started somewhat defensively, I tried my best to contain my emotions but that appears to be my downfall. 

I’m a very weak person in some senses, I have a lot of insecurities and self doubt. I have been in relationships where they’ve cheated, or they were just trying to use me, and once they realised I was not going to give them what they wanted they left me and started telling my friends they didn’t want to be with me in the first place. They just wanted me for my body. And I guess that has taken its toll on me. 

So when my boyfriend had confronted me today it was out of my own doing, I tend to be overprotective and possibly jealous whenever I see another woman talking to him, even if they’re just coworkers. 

So when he said that he had “found out some things” he learnt that I had asked some people if he had closed with a certain girl who I have reminded him numerous times that I don’t like her and I honestly think she’s a hoe. He was upset that I doubted my love for him that much, and go around him to ask people. Once he brought up those, my insecurities arose and it was like a damn had burst, all those emotions I had been trying to suppress just became too overwhelming. 

But to keep this short, we had a long talk discussing my insecurities. He made very clear that he loved me, and that he would never amuse other girls In that way. He used the phrase “a dog does not shit where it sleeps” kinda weird but it made sense. 

After a long talk, and after he pounded it into my head that he loved me, and wouldn’t throw our relationship away, we hugged it out and sealed it with a kiss, we continued to talk and laugh. 

I’m sorry if this was really long, I felt I owed an explication. Thank you to everyone who helped, and advise me.

User6073,2019-08-27 20:47:33+00:00,Update: My husband was sexually assaulted and I stood by his side,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ctm9av/my_39f_husband_45m_was_sexually_assaulted_by_our)


Tl;dr: My husband was raped, nobody believed him, he was telling the truth.


Nobody believed me and was calling me names because I believed my husband. This is my I told you so moment. 


I talked a bunch with my husband over the weekend about what happened and why he didn't want to report Lucy to the police. He had a couple reasons. She is a long time family friend and he doesn't want to ruin her life over what he thinks was a mistake. I don't like this AT ALL but he has a point and it won't undo anything. Also he is embarrassed and feels he must have done something to make her think it was ok so he blames himself. He was originally afraid it would get turned around on him but isn't as worried about that now. I told him last week that I supported whatever decision he wanted. He said he didn't want to go to the police but he decided to tell her parents just in case. 


Lucy's mom is a friend so I text her that we need to talk. She asked if everything is ok but I said we should just do it in person. We go to their house last night. In a very awkward conversation my husband tells her parents what happened. They both got very upset and started defending Lucy saying there is no way she did that. Her dad starts accusing my husband of taking advantage of her and blaming him for it all. Lucy isn't at home but her mom calls her on the phone and tells her that we are over there. I can hear Lucy crying and saying some things. Her dad takes the phone and goes to the other room. We sit in silence while we wait for him to come back. He comes back and it like he has been crying. He then apologizes to my husband for accusing him. He says he knows it much of been hard for us to come over. Lucy's mom starts crying now.  We talk for a bit and my husband says he only wants to protect himself and that he isn't going to the police and he only wants to make sure that it doesn't come back to bite him later.


Lucy gets home and her dad takes her into the other room. A bit later he comes out and asks my husband to go outside with him. Lucy comes out to the living room and we talk with her mom there. She goes into what happened that day and attempts to explain why she did it. It's not the best explanation but I didn't feel like hearing it and her didn't either based on her faces she was making. Lucy apologized to me but I told her she isn't welcome in our house. Her mom apologized but I told her it wasn't her fault. I went outside to get my husband and we went home. 


Everyone was so sure my husband cheated on me but I felt he was telling me the truth. I know you couldn't see his face or the way he reacted but I feel good that I trusted him and stood by him. I have been an emotional mess this week and he has done nothing but be loving and supportive to me and I would feel awful if I had taken it out on him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cwabmd/update_my_husband_was_sexually_assaulted_and_i/,relationship_advice,3003,323,0.0

iwantadollaror899728,2019-08-27 03:16:42+00:00,"UPDATE: I(F32) just found out that my husband(M36) has a full blown secret family because his ""other wife(F29) "" just knocked on my door.","Thank you guys for your help . I got legal advice today as well as cherry. We will be staying in touch trough the process and will seek therapy first for us individually and then for the kids so that they can work trough whats happening. As far as the situation with my husband, i have been adviced to keep my mouth shut so i will be taking the kids to a ""vacation"" till my lawyer writes up the divorce agreement and we have enough evidence that he lead a double life.

Thankfully cherry provided us with loads of evidence that he lives with her half the time and that the children are his.

Somone suggested hiring a PI to know if he hides more . And some of you suggested that his parents are alive and he is  telling us they died is just for convinience as there could have been another family that he is running away from . I do not know if this is plausible because we met when we were so young but i guess i can't put anything beside him anymore.

Some questions that were open the last time were for example how i never found out when he has two sets of social media accounts with the same name. The thing is, he has not two accounts with the same name . He has a double name, wich is very common, so one account is Jonas lastname and the other account is Henry lastname. Also he does not use his face as profile pictures. They are different pictures also.

The company housing situation is very confusing to me too but as far as I understand his company has to provide him with an appartment at his other place so that he doesn't have to pay double rent. I think its called company housing in the US .

And no, i do not want to fucking unite the families and stay married to the asshole. I know polyamory is a thing. It is not my thing. I love monogamy and besides ...polyamory requieres honesty and he has been fooling me for 6 years at least so... no thats not on the table. I would rather be a single mother than be together with a dishonest pig. I have my own job and I take care of my kids alone 6 moths of the year eitherways. So that is just ridicoulus from some of you to suggest that i should pick financiall stability before my hapiness.

WhiteRoller,2019-08-27 00:42:54+00:00,UPDATED: Do I need to get a new ring before I propose again?,"Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/chgt65/do_i_need_to_get_a_new_ring_before_i_propose_again/

Thanks to everyone who commented on the last post. Someone suggested I take the ring for a cleaning, and get an extra diamond or something added, instead of a new ring. I liked this suggestion and I was going to do it but I ended up taking a different route.

I ended up talking to my mom about it and what she thought. She said proposing with a new ring is a no-go because I already did that and she already has one. She said the ring should be the centrepiece. She also said I shouldn't propose empty handed because there needs to be a reminder of the day she said yes, instead of only a reminder of the rejected proposal.

So we ended up going shopping and I settled on a nice silver heart locket which she helped me pick out. It was very pretty and fairly inexpensive compared to the ring and I was really happy with it.

I sat on it for a while until the time felt right. We were watching TV on Sunday night and having some wine and everything was really chill and it just felt right. So when I went to top up our glasses I grabbed the locket and I proposed to her on the lounge sofa. She cried, and she said yes :) I cried too and it was really beautiful and special.

Just wanted to provide an update to let you guys know it all worked out :) thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cvwvq9/updated_do_i_need_to_get_a_new_ring_before_i/,relationship_advice,1640,211,0.0
JustRae83,2019-08-26 17:14:43+00:00,"My boyfriend says he needs 1 to 3 months to decide if he wants to marry me still, but already been asking for more time for years....I told him NO. I will not be on probation to see if I am good enough after 4.5 years, so I am moving out. Did I do the right thing?","I love my boyfriend VERY MUCH, we feel in love hard and fast. From day one he told me he was divorced and I said I wanted to get married someday and have children, is that something you want?. He said yes, he would get married again someday and have kids. So after 1.5 years, we moved in together and with his twin 3 year old boys who I AM IN LOVE WITH moved in too.

After a year of living together and being together 2.5 years, I brought up the possibility of getting married because I love him and his boys like they are my own, he said our communication was shitty still and we needed to work on that before he gave me a ring. I was like um ok..everyone has that but we can work on it more. I gave him the respect and time he needed cuz I care about him. Then, Fast forward another year at 3.5 years with not commitment and our lease almost up and I was like are you or are you not wanting to spend your life with me? I told you from day one that I waned that someday with you! He said I love you but its really important I get out of debt first babe, its really really important to me but I promise you it will happen before our lease is up. Lets sign this and this year it will happen, so because I loved him and those kids...I did it. AGAIN.

So 6 months into the one year (time frame)...still not commitment. I said to him, listen I want to marry you but I am 36 now and I cant wait around forever because I want kids of my own. We have been together A LONG TIME, IF YOU DON’T want to marry me, tell me so I can move on. He said he did, he loved me but is saving for the ring. 2 weeks before our lease was up (now together 4.5 years) he tells me, I need another 3 months just to make sure because our last year was SHIT and I don't want to get into another marriage like that, cuz it ended in divorce!

I didn’t think our relationship was horrible but…apparently he did. So I said to him, you always ask for more time! If you need more time that’s fine, but we need to separate, stop playing house and confusing these boys cuz we are not married. He told me if we don’t stay living together then we are over, I am not marring you without living together. I said WE HAVE BEEN LIVING TOGETHER! He said we need to resign even do month to month, he needs just 3 more months to make sure we are both putting in effort. Like I am on probation to see if I am good enough to marry. He tells me if I love him I would do that and I am telling him I have given you YEARS to decide this. What the hell would 3 more months do, you either know or you don't know. He Said I want to see effort. So am I suppose to just hope and pray I do my best to prove to him sam worth being with?! no....But part of me is like if that's what he needs, whatever. I don't know. I told him I can't wait around for ether, you should know by now. So I told him I am not resigning. I have not stoped crying.

Did I make the right choice. I want a guy who WANTS to be with me, not one that I have to give ultimatums to. But I keep thinking, what if I would have just given him 6 more months. His boys are 8 now and I have raised them as my own for almost 5 years, I am not just saying goodbye to my boyfriend but those kids as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cvr056/my_boyfriend_says_he_needs_1_to_3_months_to/,relationship_advice,1313,311,0.0
glogirl1896,2019-08-26 12:36:09+00:00,My [22F] boyfriend of 3 years [23M] and I just had a huge fight over a tampon.,"Yes. You read that correctly. The subject matter is... a tampon. To preface, I took a plan B recently and with that comes your period. So today I woke up at about 7 AM as I began my menstrual cycle. Going to skip the TMI, and simply say I had to run immediately to our bathroom (located in our room). Unfortunately there were no tampons in our bathroom they were downstairs. I asked my bf to please go get me one from downstairs and he refused. Just a straight up “no I’m sleeping and tired leave me alone” I tried to explain to him that it was an emergency and I REALLY needed his help in that moment as I was essentially stuck on the toilet and he just replied with “no use a towel or something and you go get it”. I started crying bc I’m a fairly emotional person and it really made me sad that he wouldn’t help me when I REALLY needed it. He is the reason I currently got my period anyways (plan B). Well I guess my crying upset him even more so he got up and said I “do too much” and tried to slam the bathroom door so he could ignore me. In the process he clipped my legs and as a result turned my whole body which turned the toilet seat, essentially breaking it off. I know all of this sounds bad, typing it out really shows me how disturbing his reaction was. I guess I’m just trying to be level headed and see if there are any opposing perspectives. Was I being too dramatic or am I justified in wanting to break up over this? His reaction in general tells me that he does not know how to conduct himself maturely and respectfully. But to play the devil’s advocate, he is a D1 college athlete so he is on a very tight schedule with long days resulting in him being tired most of the time. Sorry if this is rambling just looking for opinions before I move out and back home across the country.

I just felt like putting my update out into the void no matter what. 

So I talked to my boyfriend last Sunday. I told him that I understood that although he's doing a lot to get his own place, so we can eventually move in together, and start a life together, that it has almost been 2 years and I have never met a single member of his family. I spent a good deal of time explaining myself, and also making sure he understood that it was becoming a major issue with me, while making sure to remind him that he's such an amazing man and I love him so very much. 

He was very quiet while I spoke and he didn't look at me much. When I finished, he just wrapped his arms around me and apologized. He said that he's been so wrapped up in his job hunt that he's been selfish. He told me that he is very protective of his family and that he feels like, the next woman who meets his family, is the woman he's going to spend the rest of his life with. 

I felt my heart drop waiting for him to say I wasn't going to make the cut. But he asked me to forgive him and he asked if we could start small, like me meeting his brother, then other family members here and there. 

So a week passes, and today we went to breakfast with his brother. His brother is very shy and quiet, but I enjoyed talking with him, and as an only child, I adored seeing how much they look alike. 

In 2 weeks, I'm going to go out with him and his best friend for the first time. The boyfriend and I even discussed what kind of wedding we'd want down the road and we were both shocked that we both want the same thing. I am truly so very lucky. I have a wonderful man who treats me like a queen, and he truly cares about how I feel.

We started off as friends for about a year before becoming hook-up buddies and then exclusive BF/GF. Our friend groups are very heavily intertwined and we have frequent social outings. My girlfriend is a known partier and ""heavy"" drinker of the group and tends to get drunk often.

My girlfriend recently got a new job which sent her away to a week-long orientation session out of state. During this week, she and her new coworkers got really drunk and she slept with one of them. She told me while we were getting a catch-up dinner when we were both back in town. 

She did seem very apologetic and remorseful, but when I asked if she wanted to continue our relationship, she said she needed time to get her life together before answering that question. I walked away at that moment and drove home. I called a few of my best friends during that drive and cried.

After a couple hours have passed, I texted her to see if she wanted to continue as a couple and basically any answer outside of a 'yes', I would have to cut her out of my life because I can't see myself being friends with someone who can hurt me this much. Surprise, surprise, she couldn't give me a definitive yes.

I'm honestly pretty shocked. I don't feel sad, but I do feel angry and extreme disappointment in her.

I drove him to school everyday last week. I was mad of course, but I know him, if I just went up to him, asked him where he was going and grounded him, he wouldn’t tell me anything. 

So on Friday I drove him to school, he got out of car and went inside. I parked kind of far away, but if he came out the doors I could see him. Not even 10 minutes later he comes out with some guy, they get in a car and they were about to leave. I called him and told him to get his ass back to my car and honked. He came and sat in car without saying a word. 

We got home, he was sitting on couch, just picking on pillows. I was asking him who that guy was, where they were going etc. he wouldn’t say anything, then I told him he was grounded.he told me they were going to that boy’s house, then started yelling at me. He wasn’t mad about the grounding. Which is weird, he usually complains about it, but he didn’t even say a word this time.He was mad that I “spied” on him and made him look dumb in front of that guy. He went stomped up to his room and hasn’t talked to me all weekend.

I thought that I had a pretty happy marriage with ""Jonas"". We have been together for over 11 years now and married for 9. We have twins (f8).

Jonas works in a branch of business were he spents 3 months outside and 3 months at home. During this time he will visit us and we will visit him. It is I convinient but he earns really good. So good so that I needn't work if I didn't want to.

During all those years I have never suspected him if cheating. He was always ""super honest"" with me and would even tell me about attraction to other people he felt.

So this comes all of the blue for me. Jonas is away on a business trip for the weekend.
A woman knocked on my door. She introduces herself as ""cherry"". When I asked her what it was about she broke down crying. I took her in and after calming her she started to tell me this story about Jonas. Apparently she and Jonas have been together for over 6 years and have a little boy (3)together.

We were both fooled because he keeps his life there completely separate from our life here. He has 2 different sets of social media accounts. And as his parents sadly passed away in a car accident 15 years ago he didn't have to introcude either to them.

At first I was livid and screamed at her. Till I calmed down as she was just a victim.

Apparently chery found out my(our) husband has an apparemment that was paid for by the company (were he would take me if I visit) trough some bank statements. She searched his keys and went snooping. There is were she found out about us and decided she wanted to tell me the truth after thinking for over 3 months about it.

We both cried our eyes out together. Cursed out Jonas and now she is sleeping on my couch.

She is not legally married to Jonas as he sold her the ""I don't believe in marriage Spiel"". The only legal spouse he has is me. I know I have to divorce him but maybe I just need some extra advice and a little husband roasting. Also should I keep in touch with chery and should we introduce our kids?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cv4gf8/if32_just_found_out_that_my_husbandm36_has_a_full/,relationship_advice,12173,976,0.0

Shortly after I posted I confronted Cam about everything and that I was depressed and upset with his behavior. 

He said he would start to help out more around the house. He also said he would try to stop ranting about work so much and just be better overall.

I gave him like 2 weeks to get it together. Surprise surprise he didn’t change. 

I went to have lunch with an old friend and they asked me how things were going. I broke down and it was a realization moment for me I was wasting my time staying. Cam pushed me to the point where I didn’t love him and who he was anymore. I decided enough was enough and I needed to leave. 

While he was at work on a Monday I packed up me and the cats and called my mom. She is my hero. She came with her van and helped me load up as much stuff as possible. She is letting me and the cats stay with her and my dad for a little bit until I find the right apartment. 

I waited for Cam to come home and let him know I was leaving. He didn’t take it well. He said he was caught off guard and wasn’t expecting me to leave. He said he gave his life to me and that I ruined everything. Immediately after I broke up with him and drove to my parents I felt a sense of relief. 

For the past couple weeks I’ve been trying to tie up loose ends, like getting the rest of my stuff out and trying to get off the lease. I feel very good about the decision I’ve made. I’m starting to feel happy again and so are my cats. 

Cam has been a complete jerk, which is to be expected. I’m trying not to get wrapped up in what he has been texting me but it still hurts. He basically accused me of cheating on him. I think it’s easier for him to accept that as a reason than me not being in love with him anymore. 

Right now I’m just trying to find a good apartment to move to. I’m excited to live by myself again and be single for a while. I don’t think I will be ready to live with anyone again for a while. I have also started to do things that I love again like bike riding and going on hikes with my friends.

Turns out it really was something his grandparents said as many of you suggested. They said some things that made my son think that my boyfriend and I will make our own family and he'll be the fifth wheel and I will no longer love him. I reassured him and made sure he understood I will always love him and that he will only have more people love him, not less. Boyfriend and I agreed we needed to spend more time together with him and we've been doing that and he's warmed up to bf surprisingly quickly. So that's working out really well and my boyfriend has been really wonderful throughout this, I feel kind of ashamed for even considering breaking up with him. I've been told ""I told you so"" by my brother..

I have been putting off talking to his grandparents. But I will definitely talk to them before I let my son spend time with them again. I want to make it clear to them that it's not acceptable to say or insinuate things like that to my son but also want to reassure them that they will get to see him (so long as they don't put weird ideas in his head). I think I will see them by myself and lay it all out and then maybe have a little break before letting my son visit them...?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cutt5q/update_my27f_son6_doesnt_like_my_boyfriend_31m/,relationship_advice,9647,393,0.0

I didn’t plan on doing an update or making another post, but a bunch of people requested it so here it is. I’d also like to thank everyone who took the time to reply to the original post.

So right after posting the original today, I took some of the comments advice and I was going to text her and tell her what happened, I was mulling around trying to think of what to say when I got another text from her saying “if you’re done being weird, do you want to take (dogs name)? We can talk about what the heck happened” (we always walk her dog together so that’s what the offer was) I said yes and went over to her place.

Obviously the first question she asked once we started our walk was what happened and if I was alright and she also apologized, I said she didn’t do anything wrong and just came clean and told her the truth, I didn’t even want to look her in the eye so I was just looking forward until I heard her burst out laughing, she thought it was hilarious, she made jokes about how she didn’t know she was that good and that she was going to get her romper (what she was wearing when it happened) dry cleaned and send me the bill. I was relieved we could laugh about it together and that she wasn’t creeped out or anything. She knew I was inexperienced with girls and she’s the first girl I’ve ever been this good of friends with, but she asked if that was really my first kiss ever, she said that because I always played sports and everyone liked me and I was friends with everyone that I would have had it somewhere, but I told her that I’ve always been so insecure that I’ve never even tried to talk to girls like that before...she then asked if she could tell me something really personal, too which I of course said sure, and she told me that she is a virgin too, I knew she wasn’t a hoe or anything like that but I always thought that the guy she dated for a couple months last year that they would’ve done it, but I guess not. 

We had a really nice conversation, and I don’t know what came over me, but I asked if she wanted to go on like a real date sometime, like I come and bring flowers and we go to a nice restaurant and everything and she just smiled and said she’d like that. Then once we got back to her house she invited me in too say hello to her mom since I haven’t seen her parents in a while because they were on a trip, I went in and said hello and everything and she insisted I stay for dinner, so after a good home cooked meal, I sat there and listened to her parents talk about their vacation. I then said my goodbyes to her parents and brother since she was going out with friends for the night soon, she walked me out to her porch where she then asked me when I wanted to do that real date, I suggested Sunday and she said sure, and to get her at 6 ish, then she gave me a nice warm hug and a kiss on the cheek and just smiled, I said I better get going since her friends would be there soon and she once again told me to expect her dry cleaning bill and laughed.

So yea, I guess I got a date on Sunday, really ope I don’t fuck it up haha.

A lot went down in the last few hours. Less dick jokes this time round, because now I'm over the ""surprise floppy dong!"" aspect of it, it's turned out a lot more serious than I expected.

(for what it's worth, my girlfriend told me to still call her ""she"" at all times except when dressing male, so I'm still going with that for this update post)

I fell asleep not long after the post I made last night. Got up around 2. Headed downstairs to get my 2pm ""breakfast"", and GF was down there in her pyjamas, with a cup of tea and her phone. Good a time as any to address the elephant in the room, I thought.

It was awkward as hell. I started off with ""hey"", got a dead silence, and followed it up with something like ""sorry, I was looking for my uniform shirt yesterday, but that drawer's really none of my business, you can keep whatever you want in there, it's all good"".

Tried to keep it as non-specific as I could. If she didn't know I'd found it before, she definitely knew now.

She just sort of nodded in response to me. Then she apologised for not being in a talkative mood last night, and started telling me about her day. But it came off really strained. I could tell it was on her mind, and she kinda trailed off after a bit.

Eventually she told me to come upstairs with her. I thought she just wanted to talk somewhere more private (it's a shared kitchen, we're living in a family's spare room). But no, she went into our room and showed me everything.

She crossdresses. That's specifically how she referred to it, not trans or drag king or anything. She wears the dick (the packer, as the comments informed me last night), and the crop top she'd had it wrapped in flattens down her boobs. And it turns out she's been going through my drawers for a lot longer than I've been going through hers, because she got a shirt and some comfy tracksuit pants from my drawers and put them on. She has long hair, so she ties it up and hides it under a flat cap that she had in another drawer.

After she'd shown me all of this, basically in silence, she looked at herself in her mirror for a bit. Different angles and stuff. To me she still basically looked like herself, with a flatter chest and different clothes, but she seemed fascinated with how she looked now.

She kept glancing over at me to see my approval, and I smiled back. Tried to look as reassuring as possible. I noticed she'd been pretty shaky putting things on. When she was looking at herself in the mirror, I went over and put a hand on her shoulder supportively, which basically seemed like it was what pushed her over into starting to cry.

Then she broke the silence and just couldn't stop talking. She's been crossdressing secretly for the past couple of months, she was so worried about what I'd think. She insists she's not transgender, she just likes to crossdress sometimes, it makes her feel good and confident. Also insists it's not a sex thing. Just for fun.

I kept saying ""it's okay, it's okay, don't worry"", mostly because I didn't really know what to say. I ended up hugging her as she sobbed on the bed. She calmed down eventually, and told me ""thank you"", because she said she had no idea how I'd react.

She asked me how she looked (while still all red-eyed from crying). I just said ""you look great"" and smiled, and she hugged me again. ""You don't mind me wearing your clothes?"" ""Yeah, no worries!"" I guess she was always a lot more careful with my stuff than I was with hers in my rush yesterday. We didn't really talk much about it, I just asked a few simple questions like if she wanted me to refer to her with different pronouns when she was dressed like this (I know that's usually a trans thing but I thought I'd check anyway).

We didn't do much else after that. She eventually got on her phone again, I got on my laptop. The two of us hanging out together doing our own thing, just as we usually do, only with her in different clothes. I basically got my mind off it for a bit, and then I had to go to work again not long later. Wrote most of this on the bus to work.

I've been thinking back to when I said she looked great. She basically just looked like herself still. A few different clothing choices didn't transform her into a different person for me, and they definitely didn't transform her into a man. It was basically just the same as she always is, for me. But I realise it was a lot more significant for her, and I respect that. But also I don't want to pretend it's a mindblowing shift in appearance for me, too.

Also I was thinking... I think I'm glad she's not trans. Is that bad of me to say? I love and respect her but I realised when thinking about it last night, if I ever did see her as a man, things would be really different for me. I know I was going on about pegging in the last post, but ""girl with strapon"" and ""someone who straight-up looks like a man"" are really two different things for me, and I don't think I really have the wiring to have feelings for her as a man. But I'd do my best to be supportive anyway, because I don't want to stop her being the person she is. I'm really hoping the situation stays where it is and never comes between us. If it did... I'd have to let go of her as a girlfriend. Let her find somebody right for her.

TL;DR: I don't have a problem with her crossdressing, but mainly because she still just looks like a woman to me and I barely even register it as crossdressing. Should I tell her this? I think she'd take it badly after the emotional moments earlier.

I have to go into work now, so I won't be responding for a bit. Thank you for everyone who's offered support, in public or private.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cugm1i/update_i_29m_found_my_girlfriend_32f_has_a_soft/,relationship_advice,4016,444,0.0
Throwaway2058747,2019-08-23 16:32:01+00:00,I (19M) accidentally came while my friend (19F) was sitting in my lap. What do I do now?,"My friend and I have been friends for a while but have been good friends, like talking everyday and hanging out for a little over a year now, I’ve always had a crush on her but I didn’t want it to ruin our friendship. 

About a week ago I told her my true feelings for her and she reacted well, she said it was the sweetest thing anyone had ever told her and she said she teared up. Yesterday was the first time we’ve hung out since then, after getting some lunch we went back to her place and we’re just sitting there on her couch when she asks me if she can ask me a question, then proceeds to ask if I really meant what I said, I said of course I did and repeated that she’s the most beautiful girl I’ve seen in my life. Before I knew it we were kissing, I’m not the most experienced with girls and this was my first kiss, she then climbed onto my lap and like straddled me while kissing me. This was apparently all too much for me as I came in my jeans, I immediately got up and said I had to go and basically ran out of her house.

I’ve never been more embarrassed by anything in my life, she had to have known what happened since there was a huge wet spot on my jeans and possibly on her too...I really need to know what to do here, I don’t know if I can ever face her again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cug9uf/i_19m_accidentally_came_while_my_friend_19f_was/,relationship_advice,12319,534,0.0
gfs_floppy_dick,2019-08-23 05:31:00+00:00,I [29M] found my girlfriend [32F] has a soft strap-on dildo that she's been hiding from me. I think she knows I found it. What do I do?,"TL;DE: Looked in her clothes drawer. Expected to find a uniform shirt. Found a floppy dong.

We've been dating for four years, moved in together a few months ago.

We each keep our clothes in our own separate chests of drawers, which helps us to avoid mix-ups on clothing. We can usually almost fit each other's sizes, though her stuff tends to be tight on me and my stuff tends to be tentlike on her. We work the same job, on occasionally differing shifts, and while I've always realised her shirt is too tight to be the right one before accidentally wearing it into work, she has occasionally worn my tents on shift  without realising.

Anyway, this happened yesterday. I had to leave for work in a few minutes (she'd already been on shift for a few hours), and there was no sign of any of my uniform shirts. She hadn't been wearing it when I left, so I figured it might have been put away with her things.

I was going through the drawer she keeps her shirts in... and then suddenly I felt something weirdly squishy. I didn't even think, I just pulled it out. And there it was, wrapped up in a little crop top: The Dong. Three inches at most, Caucasian-coloured, and floppier than a disk.

I kinda stared for a bit. It was in a harness, so my first thought was to expect a talk about enhancing our love life with the joys of pegging. (Which would surprise me from her? She's barely a sexual person at all. But I'd consider it!) But this thing was _soft_. Fully flaccid. No way you'd be able to get that into my puckered behind, not without a LOT of uncomfortable shoving.

So I couldn't help wondering, what was this thing for? I think she'd have the same issues fitting it into herself, and the harness made me think she'd be wearing it. Does she just stroll around wearing it, acting cocky? Is she experiencing the joys of helicoptering? Honestly, I'd probably get a cock to helicopter with if I were a girl, so I _completely_ understand.

Eventually I stopped staring in wonderment and put the floppy thing away so I could find a damn shirt. Eventually had to take a dive into the dirty washing basket, which I'm not proud of. We overlapped by about an hour at work, but we work in different sections, so had no time for much more than ""hi""/""bye"" as we passed each other. Certainly no mention of floppydong.

Like a flaccid phallus to the face, a realisation hit me a couple of hours in. In my hurry, I hadn't wrapped the dick up in the crop top again. Nor had I buried it back under the mountains of clothes concealing it. It had simply lain bare on the surface, making it clear to every Dick, Tom and Harry that someone had made the dickscovery.

I felt like I'd committed a cardinal sin doing this. We never established that each other's drawers were off-limits, but ""de facto"" they were, and now I'd crossed a line by uncovering something she'd been keeping a secret.

It gets worse: every day when she gets home from work and I'm not around, she messages me about how her day was. Funny things, shitty customers, how hard or stressful the workload was today. Just anything. She's 100% consistent about it, and I always look forward to receiving it...

... but today, she sent just one message.

""got home""

That's all, folks.

She'd been really happy when I saw her on my way in and her way out. Something must have happened. Either her commute home really sucked, or she knows I've found her secret.

She was asleep when I got back (I was on the overnight shift). I'm here sorta panicking and writing this all out and making dick jokes.

I really never thought I'd be using this forum, but I need help here. I want her to know that this is okay, whether it's a sex toy or a helicoptering toy or whatever. I respect her privacy, and her use of this, and I want her to know that she doesn't have to hide things like this. But as I said, she's really not much of a sexual person. At least, she's rarely very sexual with me, and doesn't seem to enjoy sex too much. Which is fine! But if she owns something like this, maybe she's just deeply ashamed, and that'd be a lot to work through.

Part of me wants to pretend this never happened, pretend it just stayed hidden. Hell, maybe she actually doesn't know I found it, and that message was just some unrelated bad mood. But I don't think I can really just ignore the consequences now. Gotta face them.

wateroversoda,2019-08-23 00:16:52+00:00,"[UPDATE] My girlfriend's (26f) best friend (24f) made it seem like I (26m) cheated on her, I didn't, but now my gf is unsure about our relationship.","[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ct30sv/my_girlfriends_26f_best_friend_24f_made_it_seem/)

In my last post I talked about how my gf's best friend, Kate,  tried to make me look like a cheater by putting her underwear in my suitcase. Soon after this happened, my gf was reluctant to speak to me, but still remained in contact with me.

A lot of you have me ideas on gathering information to prove my innocence and potential precautions about Kate. After spending hours gathering information and reviewing the advice I got, I can now prove my innocence.

Here's the update and sorry if it's confusing. Also featuring my brother and my boss.

Before proving to my girlfriend I didn't cheat I gathered a bunch of evidence to add to my credibility. I gathered a list of potential dates, map timelines, work schedule (verified by my boss). Geo tag pictures, a list of questions to ask Kate later, etc.

Confrontation with my girlfriend:

When I confronted my girlfriend I was the most serious I've ever been. I was firm, and told my gf I needed no more than an hour to prove I was innocent. I also told her that if she didn't want to talk to me, I would respectfully walk away and she wouldn't have to see me again. She agreed to let me explain myself. I gave her access to texts, emails, social media, photos, call logs, back ups of every piece of information of my phone and computer.

Sure enough, I only needed about 15 minutes to prove I wasn't cheating. My gf looked at every piece of information I had and honestly, I only needed to show her the maps timeline for her to believe. The rest was overkill, but definitely added to my credibility. By the end of it she believed me.

I mentioned the possibility of her and Kate setting me up, like some of you mentioned. My gf apologized and said that the only reason that she packed her underwear in my luggage was because she had used the last bit of space in her luggage to pack her swimsuits. She also granted me the same courtesy and let me see her info to make sure. I also showed her the questions I was gonna ask Kate to make sure it wasn't something she would easily know.

Confrontation with Kate:

When we got to her house Kate's parents were working in the backyard. Keep that in mind for later.

When we spoke to Kate, she was surprised, but kept lying. Her bullshit story could have worked, but I had proof. She ended up telling my girlfriend we hooked up 50+ times, however they didn't match up with the map timeline and my brother was with me to verify. Kate didn't know my email, phone number, or social media so it could've ended there, but I wanted to really rub it in at this point.

I asked her extremely awkward questions about my penis and about the ""hookups."" If you have sex several times with someone, you remember their body. She got the brand of underwear I use wrong. I have a scar on my inner thigh and would only see it if I was having sex with someone. You can't miss it. She got it wrong.

I asked if I was circumsized (I am not), she got that wrong. I asked about my size. She said I was smaller than I really am and honestly I'm offended (jk). She also got the brand of condom I use wrong. The list was longer, but those are just some examples.

My boss and my brother helped me disproved her made up story and some dates were disproved by my gaming history. After her timeline fell short, she tried using some fake pictures as nudes of me. Obviously, my girlfriend knew it wasn't me. 

Near the end of the conversation, Kate's parents came in, we explained what was going. To my surprise they weren't mad and let me finish. By the end of it Kate was crying and she apologized. Honestly her crying was more than enough. She said she was jealous of my gf for having me, but I didn't care for her reason.

Kate's parents weren't having it either. Kate's mom stayed with her and her dad talked to outside. After we explained what happened, he apologized and told us it wasn't the first time Kate did this. Turns out she made a habit of trying to go after guys in relationships even after her parents encouraged her to date single men.
Kate's dad is the mvp for backing me up. My brother and my boss were also a big help.

Anyway, my girlfriend is no longer friends with Kate and cut all contact. She apologized profusely afterwards. TMI, but after all this drama I got the best bj of my life.

Even after all the drama, it hasn't stopped Kate from trying to come near Kate's apartment. We threatend to call the police. We'll see what happens. Hopefully I don't have to update again.

TL;DR: gf believes me and Kate is no longer welcomed in our lives.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cu645n/update_my_girlfriends_26f_best_friend_24f_made_it/,relationship_advice,4535,243,0.0

So I have just left my daughter with my mother and am going to my lawyer again.

I followed some advice you guys gave me and we sat down with my daughter to ""chit chat"".

We knew we couldn't promt any kind of responses my asking overly spesific questions as per her therapist.

So my mother asks my daughter (Lets call her Cat)

""cat what do you and daddy talk about?""

And cat just listed many toddler things like she talks about kindergarten, games etc. When I was kind of relieved that that comment my ex made yesterday may just be a one of, came the big bomb.

""he also shows me pictures of houses and tells me I can have now 2 rooms with loads of stuff!!""

I ask if her dad is buying a new house.

Nope. Turns out that nut wants to take my daughter out of the country. He shows her pictures of beach houses and even bought her allready a bag so she can put her stuff inside it. Wich explains why so many of her clothes have gone missing.

At first I thought that my ex maybe hadn't told me yet because it hadn't come trough. But no he told my daughter to keep this as a secret because momy would get sad if she knew that daddy was going away.

So I am fucking livid. And also sad because I will have to tell my daughter no. Once again I feel lost.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cu0na1/update_i_f30_divorced_my_ex_husband_m36_because/,relationship_advice,3429,204,0.0

I've read over 200 comments from you guys and it just validated my mind that my family is fucked up. 

I contacted my mom and confronted her about why she would defend my idiotic brother and she basically said he was young and stupid. I told her a few of your comments and that Katie could press charges and she broke down crying, saying he won't do it again.  Hell no he won't because I told her I decided to cut them off for good. Katie was actually relieved when I told her I was on her side and cut them off. Basically told me she was going to dump me for being an idiot who couldn't support his girlfriend of 3 years when she was basically being tortured for fun. I'm just glad she didn't and that we are getting through this together.


Thank you guys for every comment, even the ones calling me out for being an idiot trying to make Katie forgive my brother for the horrible things he did. When you're faced with this kind of dilemma and you've been close to your family for over 20 years you get blindsided.

So me and Katie cut them out starting today and we plan to move to the USA next year ( we always wanted to live there) and finally be far away from them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ctyi63/update_my_brother18_has_been_poisoning_my/,relationship_advice,2928,202,0.0
forestlesbian,2019-08-22 05:01:48+00:00,Is it weird that my gf (22f) “tucks me in” to bed every night? (21f),"We’ve lived together for over a year now, we just had our two year anniversary, and she’s the love of my life, I think she’s absolutely brilliant in all sense of the word. 

Our schedules are quite opposite, I wake up for work at 6:30am, she sleeps in until 1pm for her night shift. I always go to sleep first, I need more sleep than the average person anyway (about 10 hours a night) and I always have to be up early in the morning. She slips in to bed in the first hours of the morning - sometimes I’m already asleep before she gets back from work, but most of the time I’m just getting ready for bed as she gets home.

I’m not really sure how this came to be in our schedule, but every night that I get in to bed before she does, she comes to kiss me goodnight and tuck me in. I love it, I think it’s adorable and I’m kind of a clingy girlfriend so I enjoy it a lot! I’m just wondering if anyone else does this?

Recently we had a friend stay over (our place is too small to have many guests stay over so having someone stay the night is rare) and I went to bed early and left them to their Netflix, and my girlfriend said she’d come tuck me in soon. I got embarrassed about it, like it’s weird or something? I just don’t want people to find it strange or gross, I don’t know.

It’s even worse because he has cheated on me once before with her, but as far as I knew they haven’t been talking recently. I asked him about it and he tried to brush it off but I was being jealous and insecure and I couldn’t let it go. He walked away from me and told me “I can’t talk to you when you’re like this”. I just cried alone in the living room and than after a while he called for me to “come here”. I did and he pulled me onto his lap and told me to stop crying and he wiped my tears. He told me that he can’t control what she says, and told me that he only loves me. He told me, “she’s not like you, I couldn’t be with a girl like her”. I told him I was sorry and he nodded but than he just stopped smiling and freaked out. He flipped me onto my back on our bed and he put his hand around my throat and started choking me. He told me something like “just a warning though, nobody likes a jealous woman babe”. I tried to put my hand on his to move it but he whispered “don’t be stupid”. He just stared at me until I surrendered and then he eased his grip. He told me, “I don’t want you to talk to me like that again, okay?”. I told him yes and he let go of me. And then he told me gently to take my clothes off. I said “what?”. And he told me again to take them off but this time he tapped my throat with his finger and told me “I don’t like asking twice”. I just did what he said and I said sex with him. It wasn’t angry sex or anything, he wasn’t very rough. If anything he was more caring and passionate than usual. After that, he was nice to me the rest of the night and has been today. I just don’t see how he acts like everything is fine when I have bruises on my neck.

SpringBluejay,2019-08-21 18:44:21+00:00,My (20sF) boyfriend's (20sM) shitty driving caused a horrible accident. I can't feel anything for him now.,"This was probably a long time coming. He must have pulled it together enough just to get his license, because ever since then (he got it a few months ago) it's like he couldn't care less.

He speeds, he tailgates, he's reckless, he has run red lights and then slammed on the brakes in the middle of an intersection. He gets mad at people crossing the street, he zooms by bicycles narrowly missing them. I don't know if this is road rage or what, I don't drive so I don't know what it's like, but being a passenger when he's behind the wheel is terrifying. 

He magically somehow has never gotten a ticket or pulled over for any of this. Or if he has he's hidden it from me.

I've told him time and time again to slow down and drive more carefully. I told him it literally scares me. He'll do better for the rest of that trip, then it's back to the same. 

A couple months ago I decided I was no longer comfortable being in his car. He thought I was overreacting. He told me I don't know shit since I've never driven, so I can't talk. We more or less agreed to not mention his driving anymore because it was always an argument. I now feel unspeakably guilty about this. If I'd stood my ground more maybe I'd have been able to get through to him... but no I just shut up like he wanted.

So the accident... At a certain point this past month (being deliberately vague for anonymity reasons) he was speeding on the highway, lost control at a minor curve that should not have been a problem, and hit another car while swerving around. He managed to slow his car enough to hit the highway divider and stop, but the other car hit someone else and there was a chain reaction of crashes. The result was a huge pileup that involved a double-digit number of vehicles and spanned both sides of the highway because someone flipped over the divider. He was uninjured. Other people were badly injured, and several others died.

This all was pieced together by the cops from witness reports and inspecting the damage. It was estimated he was going at around 95 miles an hour when this happened.

I've simply shut down after that. I can't make myself feel anything for him like I used to. He basically indirectly caused people to die, because he could not be bothered to drive safely. Why. Why did he keep doing it. I cannot wrap my head around this lack of care.

He's noticed I've been distant and is upset. He's traumatized by the accident, he says, but a lot of the way he talks about it is still acting like he doesn't know how it happened. It's like he doesn't connect himself as the reason. He wants to talk about the horror of seeing dead people and burning wrecked cars and I don't want to hear it. This didn't have to happen. He's not innocent like those other people. He's upset about all the legal proceedings now (also being vague here). I don't know what he wants me to do about any of that.

I just feel like I warned him so many times. So did some of his friends. He didn't listen and I don't understand what he expects now. It would maybe be different if he was taking responsibility, but he isn't really. He even defended that he ""didn't know he was going too fast because he had his eyes on the road not the speedometer.""

I don't know what I should do. I don't know how to get my emotions for him back. Am I being unfair to react like this?

She was crying talking about all of this. She told me he was sweet and spoiled her at first but then he just started getting pissed off at the littlest things. She told me that he’s punched her, slapped her, choked her, beat her with a belt, she even said he forced himself on her a couple of times. This was all really hard to listen to, it was pretty horrific. Before I left she grabbed my hand and told me “he’s going to take all your pride and confidence away, trust me”. I know I should trust my husband and I love him more than anything, but I just feel unsure now. I know she has a reason to lie but still. I want to ask him about it when he comes home from work but I don’t know how. Everything is great in my life and I don’t want to ruin it. He wants me to have a baby soon and he has been really great to me the whole time I’ve known him.

OppositeLeopard,2019-08-21 03:07:59+00:00,I(F30) divorced my ex Husband (M36) because of my MIL(F60s) and suddenly he wants back in,"I will be rambling a little as I am very mad right now. Sorry for my bad English. It is not my first language 

My Ex and I were married for well over 5 years and together for 10 . His mother was a nightmare. She would spent her time belitteling me and tried humiliating me. I could take it as i loved my husband and didn't want to make him choose between her or me.

Ofcourse I would always tell him what she would be doing and he would always brush it off as her being ""a loving and over protecing mom ""

When she would say something racist ( I am Hispanic and they are white) he would laugh it off, when she would make a comment of me being a gold digger ( even tho I eared more than my Ex) he would just say ""Oh mom "" . He would also get mad at me if I ever stood up for myself.

But the straw that broke the camels back is when we had our daughter. My MIL would always try to parent her and say that i would do something wrong . 

My daughter has an irritable colon and she can not ingest any kind of fucking oils or artificial things. And guess what that looney of a Woman did?? 

She fed my 3 year old daughter essential oils to make her go to sleep . She was in the ICU. I had it and i confronted my husband who said "" she only did what she thought was best "".

I lost it . I went to my parents and drafted a divorce agreement . ( Thats the best course of action. I saw a post earlier describing a situation that is much more dangerous than mine involving allergens and an epipen. )

His face was like that Pikachu Meme when i served him . He didn't know why i was doing that because we were ""happy"".

So now a year has passed and my life was hell.  My Monster in law tried every dirty trick in the book to take my Daugther . To name a few :  


* She accused my brother of molesting her
* She accused me of neglect 
* She accused me of taking drugs and leaving them in reach of a toddler ( I take thyroxin for heavens sake !)
* She accused me of endangering my daughter by leaving random man in my house 
* the list goes on 

During this time the excuse of my ex was that i *broke his heart and i had to undertstand his mother. She only wants whats best for him.*

Luckily i got good representation and even got my daughter full time  minus some weekends or visitation . I could prove that my daughter was endangered by his mother.

So now to the advice part.

I knew that my ex needed to be permanently in my life because of my daughter. And i was learning to live with that . He was very cold with me because again.. i broke his heart .

Now 2 things have come together :  


* My ex BIL got married to an African American woman, so ofcourse my ex MIL flipped
* I started dating again 

my BIL is a great guy and he actually stood up for his wife ( !!! go figure it is possible). I stay in contact with him because we are friends and hewas a mediator and fought with his brother quite often .  
So my BIL actually stood up for his wife and my ex husband got his panties in a twist, my BIL basically opened his eyes how shitty he was being. And that their mom treated me the same way she treated his wife. And finally my dense ex started understanding.

They guy I am seeing is great . I have even met his parents and his mother is normal . She treats me like a human being and has invited me allready to many family functions and tries to make me and my daughter feel welcomed . My ex got wind from the situation trough a mutual friend and guess who is now flipping his shit?

He started bringing flowers and chocolate ( I don't even like chocolate!!!) to pick up our Daugther. He sends me cards and sms with hearts and who knows what . 

Yesterday was the ""best thing"". My daughter was at my mothers place and i was at home with my boyfriend. He appears infront of my door crying and clutching my engagement ring begging me to come back. 

I said no and that he should go away. He wouldn't and started demanding that i come out to talk to him. My boyfriend told him that he would call the police ,and in his pathetic fashion  he threatened to beat my boyfriend up. 

I closed the door and let him pound sand .

Today he picked up my daughter for a day trip and when they came back my daughter was asking if i loved my boyfriend more than her . 

Now I am at a loss to what to do. I allready told my daughter that it was imposible because my love for her is infinite and there is nothing bigger than infinite.

But now i know that my ex is trying to make my daughter hate me .I am at a loss because i won't use my daughter as amunition. But also....what the heel am i suposed to do??I will never return with that man but i can't take the father of my daughter. Do you guys have any advice?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ctawvv/if30_divorced_my_ex_husband_m36_because_of_my/,relationship_advice,4907,471,0.0
Next_Penalty,2019-08-20 21:37:55+00:00,Update: Woke up to my (20M) girlfriend (24F) on top of me and I don't know how to deal with it.,"Update after this post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cseu41/_/

Thanks for the guidance last time. It helps. Though the situation turned out a little different than expected. I did talk with her when she came home, and she was super anxious thinking she did something horrible. We talked it out. So apparently I've been the one initiating in the middle of the night. I start feeling her up (sometimes waking her up in the process..) and she takes the lead afterwards. Now she opened up to me about some bedroom issues I wasn't aware of. For the past few months I haven't been initiating much (like 9/10 times she is) and I never realized this was taking a toll on her mental. So when I was feeling her up in the middle of the night she was all for it and happy that I was taking the initiative, basically taking any sex she can get. Looking back I never really initiate because I'm kinda tired after the gym and my muscles are sore. But I go to the gym 6x a week and almost every evening she ends up coming onto me, and once it starts I'm into it but it hurts her I was never coming onto her. And it's definitely not a lack of attraction, I made that very clear and comforted her. We agreed that I will be initiating more, but more importantly I assured her it has nothing to do with her looks. And when I start feeling her up in the middle of the night she can either properly wake me up or just go with it. 

I realized if she's enjoying it it doesn't really matter because I apparently sleep through the entire act until 2 days ago haha. And if she wants a session that's a bit more 'active' she will wake me up which I'm OK with. I deeply care for her and I feel like shit for not really taking her feelings into consideration. But hopefully we have things worked out now.

Modified Post

Throwaway account. Indian here.

Background

Mine was an arranged marriage. Met my wife for after everything from both families was fixed. Got married 2 years back. We are both from Bihar. Both educated. Living in a metro city currently. We got along just fine.

My wife was earlier very reluctant/mechanical in sex. We were having sex for just its sake. Slowly, she opened up and it got better in around 5-6 months. No issues there. I always suspected something was off with her. One day something happened after which she got very emotional. I consoled her, and she confided in me that her father used to sexually abuse her since she was in class 8. Started with inappropriate touching of private parts, then moved on to full rape while drunk(I didnt ask how many times). Her mother knew, but did nothing as he had beaten her before. She just usually pretends to be sleeping/actually sleeping, who knows. She said he does this when gets drunk (they all used to sleep on same bed). She didnt said anything because he said he would discontinue her education and marry her away.

After 12th, she moved to hostel, and when she goes home, in vacations, it happens..inappropriate touchings, handjobs, bjs, and sometimes rape . Her marriage was fixed as soon her education got ever. All these things stopped after fixing of marriage. She said thats why she was so hesitant of sex earlier, but after establishing trust, opened up . I wanted to confront him., but she didn't even let me confront him. Think about family honour. What would relatives think if it got out.. It happened to me , not you. I dont want it to come out. Past is past... all emotional storm.

This all happened 1.5 years back. From then I made a point of never for a single day sending her to her maternal home alone. Always with me. We get a separate room to stay there, so no probs thereafter.

Now present problem :

We had a baby girl last week, her mother was here to help her through, and as its customary here, after childbirth, her mother wants to take her home, to meet extended family. But I don't want my baby to go even near that man. She is saying im over reacting, nothing gonna happen. Okay fine. Nothing may happen with my wife now, past is past. But just the thought of that man with my newborn baby girl fills me with rage. I cant let that man even near her. Not now, not ever. I dont know if im overreating, i basically told her if she wants, she could go with her mother, I would call my mom, and keep the baby with me here , but wont let my baby near that man. Just the thought of him touching my innocent child, I cant handle it. I dont know what Im doing, am i being unreasonable, too emotional or what ? What should I do now ?

&amp;#x200B;

**UPDATE** 

The unequivocal suggestion I got from here was that I should not let her go . I called my parents that night, and told them the whole story. They understood it completely, but also recognized the fact that I can't not allow her to go (family,customs, relations .. the whole shebang.. people will start murmuring). So I have to come up with a different solution. And that was of confrontation. I sat down my MIL, and my wife and told both of them that I don't want my daughter in any case to be near her husband. First she tried to act aloof, but I maintained my strictness and told I don't care what happened in the past, you know what your husband did to YOUR daughter, and I WILL NOT LET HIM DO IT TO MY DAUGHTER. Period. Get it through your head. After I made it clear that if she doesn't even acknowledge the situation, I won't let her go, she broke down, and started cursing my wife for airing the family's dirty laundry to me. I again, strictly, told her to calm down, take the night and think about it. There was a comment here that maybe my wife was lying, no she wasn't. You could just feel the trauma in a person's body, the eyes, the shivering... Nobody could fake that. 

I went to office next day, talked to my boss and negotiated 1 week leave. That evening, situation at home situation was gloomy as before, but as my MIL had actually acknowledged the situation now, she was ready for the compromise. So I made my demands : 

1. I only got leave for 1 week only, so I would accompany them to their hometown for 5 days, after that my wife and I would return. Not a day more. She would not try to emotionally blackmail my wife to stay longer without me being there. I would get return tickets beforehand. 
2. She would make sure every ceremony to be completed in those 5 days alone, whosoever relative wants to visit , do it in that time 
3. She would personally make sure my daughter would not go into the hands of my FIL, or I would publically make a scene, I won't care who is saying what. I would take my daughter from him and leave. Period. 

She was reluctant for the 3rd point, but I was adamant. She finally agreed. Next day, she went back to her home alone for the preparations of the various ceremonies to be held (initially she want to take my wife and my baby with her, and I was to join them for ceremonies only, that's why this whole drama). 

For my wife part, after my MIL left, I told her that Im concerned about her well being, as it was pointed out in the sub that her defending her father is not normal. It's a coping mechanism. (Didn't tell her I posted it online, or used the words like PTSD). She got defensive again. Someone has commented about some postpartum stuff. Was worried about it too. Told her she need therapy. Now she got extremely agitated about how it went from just a matter between the two of us to getting therapy. I don't know, maybe she was hormonal. For 2 days she was pissed. And was definitely not ready to talk about it.  

Well, we had follow ups scheduled with the gynae. I think here I did something of a fuck up. After normal checkups, I told the doc about my wife's trauma, thinking maybe she could convince her. I was told to go out, and they talked for about an hour. I was sitting outside thinking I had fucked up the whole situation. But when I was called inside, my initial instincts were right. The doc had convinced my wife to confront her past, and that these kinds of situations are actually very common, and people dont talk about it (conservative society). She referred her to a psychiatrist she knows, and we would make an appointment with her after getting back from hometown. Situation with my wife is tense now. She has agreed for now for therapy, hope she doesn't change her mind. We are going to her mother's house for  5 days, and they will definitely talk. I guess my MIL will try to talk my wife out of going to therapy, same airing dirty laundry shit. Now I'm thinking it was idiotic of me to take up this therapy issue now, should've waited for coming back from her hometown. 

We are leaving this weekend, hope I don't have to face any more drama there. Will update if anything happens.

Pnutproblemz,2019-08-20 10:19:51+00:00,My [F28] MIL won't take my kid's [4] anaphylactic peanut allergy seriously,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible. Sorry for mobile formatting. I've never really seen eye-to-eye with my MIL because she's very strict and old fashioned, she's like this with all of her grandchildren: she'll do things like yell at them for not sitting up straight, elbows on table, etc... I understand that children need discipline, but I prefer a gentler approach with my son. I've asked her many times to not do that, but my husband insists I let it go, so I've tried to. 

Until now. My son was officially diagnosed with a life threatening peanut allergy, and we have an epipen jr for him. She insists that when she was younger people ""didn't have allergies"", and if they did they would get rid of them via exposure and that I'm just babying him. I've explained to her that his allergy is very real and potentially deadly.

She has basically scoffed it off and the last time she came to pick him up, she took his epipen/fanny pack from around his waist and threw it on my driveway, saying she's taken him for ice cream many times and nothing has ever happened, and he doesn't ""need it"" with him. I told him she could no longer take him and brought him inside, she left and called my husband, she cried to him saying I accused her of being an unfit grandmother. Which I admittedly did because my child's safety is my priority and apparently not hers. 

Now my husband wants me to apologise to her. He says she would take him to the hospital if he ingested peanuts and that I'm overreacting. I kindly explained to him that epipens save lives because anaphylaxis means your airways are narrowing, your breathing is becoming blocked, etc... and time is OF THE ESSENCE because it happens so quickly. 

So, now my stance is.. no epipen = no taking my child anywhere.

She's even insisting on taking him to a baseball game, which tends to have a LOT of peanuts, everywhere. I asked that she find a peanut free zone which the stadium does offer, but she once again belittled the idea and insisted he would be fine. 

I'm getting really tired of her treatment toward my son, and my husband has always been a Mama's boy who thinks Mama can do no wrong and defends her endlessly. He says he turned out just fine being raised by her and I worry too much. 

Would it be awful if I insist she only see him if I'm present? Am I completely unreasonable and overreacting? Is there anything else I can do so that they'll understand the severity or at the very least take some more precautions?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/csw8po/my_f28_mil_wont_take_my_kids_4_anaphylactic/,relationship_advice,16751,2180,0.0
nadsour,2019-08-20 08:47:54+00:00,Dating a rich girlfriend is getting a little bit under my skin.,"We have been together for over a year now. She’s mid 20s and comes from a very wealthy family, lives in a 4 million dollar+ house, soon she’s buying a Bentley as a first car, whatever she want’s she buys, and it doesn’t matter the price. so am talking a little bit crazy type of wealth. 

One day she asked me if i want to go to the Maldives and i said hell no, and we haven’t discussed it anymore because the whole payment thing was not clarified from her end. I mean she does know that i can’t afford this type of trip, and also she knows that i don’t like being payed for. And also one time she noticed my front windshield has a crack in it, when i fixed it a few weeks back she said and i quote ‘ Finally, you seemed like you didn’t want to fix it’ .... i mean? You do know i am limited when it comes to my expenses!


Me and the other hand, i come around not that bad. My annual income is 24000$, i don’t usually buy whatever i want, i live in a city where the things i spend my money on regarding everyday expenses can get a bit expensive, so sometimes i become forced to live paycheck to paycheck. I only eat outside the house once on weekends but mid week i eat at home to save me some money. I help out my family with the rent and always try to provide my mom with as much money as i can, i really have a close relationship with her so i try my best to always make her happy.

I can’t say that me and my girlfriend are not happy, i mean, we get along good. She’s very sweet and kind, always helpful and caring, she lives in another city 4 hours away from me, whenever we meet, every single time, she always cries in the last day. She talks to her mom about me on a daily basis how good of a person i am and her mom loves me so much.

On her birthday i bought her a Pullover and made a costume hoodie with her name on it, and wrote a long letter. I know it might sound cheesy for a gift but i don’t know, that’s all i had in mind.  

On my birthday she got me a huge box with so many things in it that looked so expensive to a point where i didn’t even bother to ask. When i started my new job, she bought me a Gucci bag that cost 1600$ and i had no idea how to repay her.

Whenever me and her go out for dinner or whatever, she tips the waiter 150$ minimum. Which is something that gets under my skin very easily. She always tells me to buy these weird type of products online like Supplements from iHerb and other odd stuff, which is normal for her and i shouldn’t think otherwise, its just hectic sometimes to try to comply with the idea it self.


When a financial topic pops out of nowhere, i end up having a hard time acting normal, like one time me and her were at Cartier and she showed me a wedding ring that looked SO DAMN EXPENSIVE, and told me and i quote ‘ Take notes ‘ . At that point a small version of me inside my brain started screaming in a small squeaky sound asking for help. 

Sometimes i think she understands where i come from and sometimes i think she’s not being understandable towards it. I don’t know i think i’ve reached a point where am just babbling.

jesustunafish,2019-08-19 22:40:10+00:00,[Update] My (28F) boyfriend (29M) and his best friend (29F) are going on a week-long vacation. They uninvited me.,"Update, as promised.

I was really upset the day I dropped him off and he was texting me but I wasn’t responding. I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do, but I didn’t want to do anything at all in the state I was in. I waited until the next day, and then I sent him a thought out text letting him know that I didn’t feel safe or loved in the way the trip was handled and that I would be dropping his things off at his place and leaving his keys with the neighbor. He called but didn’t leave any messages and then he messaged me that he didn’t understand.

The rest of the week, he called and messaged me, but I couldn’t bring myself to pick up or text back. On Thursday, I think that he realized that I was serious, and he asked me some questions about logistical things — I told him which neighbor his key was with, etc.

When he got back and saw all his things at his place, he got pretty frantic and called and left me a long message. I was working all day, but also I still didn’t want to respond. He asked me to explain because he didn’t understand what was going on. The next day, I sent another text making it clear that it was over, and he got upset and sent me a bunch of texts in a row about how he didn’t understand why I was throwing away everything that we built. He left me a voicemail that was really angry that said he had no idea why I was upset and that he did not accept the break-up because he had no say in it and that he wanted me to tell him the evil story that I had made up about him to his face.

I wasn’t going to respond to him and I wanted to remain calm, but this upset me. So I sat down to write him this letter. It’s long, so skip over if you want. I tried to call him but I started crying and told him I’d just send him an email instead. This is what it said.

“The time that we have had apart has given me some good space and time to think. I have had a chance to think about the things that are important for me in a relationship and I see that we should not be together. I am sorry that I have been asking for you to change things about your life that you shouldn’t have to change at my or anyone’s behest.

From the very start, this trip was made in an insanely disrespectful way in which it started out from you being given an ultimatum by your female best friend who I had never met that either she goes or I go on this trip, and you picked her. You didn’t offer to have her meet me (theoretically I was your long-term partner, so this would have made a lot of sense), you didn’t encourage her to find someone else to come, and you didn’t consult me at all. That’s enough for most people to have a deal-breaker, right there. However, I stayed.

This is a person who you have a history with that is not entirely clear to me. Here is what I understand: some bad rumors got started about the two of you in which you spent an entire night out with her on an acid trip while you were dating someone else. Nothing happened. The other thing I understand is that you were interested in her romantically at some, theoretically other, point and that she started dating her boyfriend and that closed the door on things for you. According to what I also understand, it took a long time for 29F’s boyfriend to feel comfortable with you being around, but you apparently worked to ultimately make him feel comfortable with you after I’m not sure how long. This is the completely unknown person who shut me out of a trip that I was originally going to go on (unilateral decision). You did not tell me this was happening until I asked when the trip to Hawaii would be.

You purchase tickets in another very disrespectful situation in which I have cooked dinner and have guests present, and you choose to go into my room for well over an hour to select tickets with her, and in which I repeatedly ask you to please come to dinner because you say it will just be a few more minutes each time. There is absolutely no reason for doing it at that time and in that situation, seeing as how she is in the same time zone as us and has a 9-5 job. This makes me feel sick to my stomach.

So, to make myself feel better about this whole arrangement, I tell you that I want to meet this person. On my request, we arrange a trip to go meet her and her boyfriend — a brief trip in which they are (and you explicitly agree) inexplicably cold. The first conversation that we have is one in which 29F and her boyfriend argue about how she dm’ed him while he was already in a relationship and got him to date her instead. You tell me about conversations that 29F has had with you recently in which it seems implied that there is some real instability in their long-term relationship — stuff about kids and dogs. I have a discussion in which I let you know that I see that and that it worries me. 

Meanwhile, I am still wanting all of this to work out for you and for me and for her. I, at this point, am planning on being with you for the long term and see no benefit in telling you to not go on a trip with your best friend. I want it to work out. But each and every interaction surrounding this trip chips and chips and chips away at my ability to handle it: the conversations that seem to go nowhere, etc. Your dad, your mom, and your grandparents are all very surprised when we tell them about this trip. It is becoming very obvious that this is a dangerous trip to make with the fragility of our relationship. 29M, we had only been together for nine months. How long did it take before 29F’s boyfriend was comfortable with you hanging around? Much less going on a one-on-one international tropical vacation in which he was uninvited because of your request?

We go over it with (friend) at the rock climbing gym, we go over it in the car, we go over it while we're booking our AirBnb for Copenhagen, we go over it when I tell you that I still feel uncomfortable and I do not feel good about the trip. Talk about repeatedly saying something! Although I ask for you to help me, you actually ask me instead to come up with what would make me feel better. Surprisingly, I have no ideas either. 

Ultimately, it appears that the original plan to meet at my place and hang out and do a game night before you two go on the trip has been canceled, and 29F will be staying at my place, but not hanging out with us at all beforehand. You attribute it to you not bringing it up with her early enough. This is apparently not something that was discussed even two nights before the trip. This upsets me. You do not know what to do. I don’t blame you — at this point, it was well out of hand. I don't know what to do either. There is no good solution that I can think of besides waiting for the trip to be over. I tell you that either I have to get over it, or I have to break up with you, and that I don’t want to break up with you. But my ability to get over it is rather rather rather worn down. 

She arrives at my place very late, and we wake up the next morning for me to take the two of you to the airport. After all of this lead-up, I know that you can tell how unhappy I am. I fully absolutely know you can tell how unhappy I am. You leave, and when I don’t respond to your text messages, you text me to tell me that you hope I’m okay and you’re going to bed. No call.

The rest of the week was rough. My text to you was met with, essentially, “I’m sorry you feel this way.” You tell me that I’m being unfair.

There is no acknowledgment (and there still has been none) that this trip to a fucking honeymoon destination, as we have discussed before, could be a crazy and horrible thing to go through with, even with my quasi-blessing. This is not something that people in relationships have to deal with. This is not something that people in relationships do, besides 29F, I guess.

In the end, all of this is to say that I have felt serious emotional needs go seriously unmet in a way that is a deal-breaker for me.

There have been some wonderful, very positive times, but there has been an unnecessary amount of heartache and suffering for me over things that come down to what I can only assume are personal differences.

I cannot handle your relationship with 29F. And I suppose I could ask you to pick between her and me, but that’s not what I want to do. I want you to have your best friend, and I want to leave. I did love you, but I am not about to fight this fight and hear you tell me that I’m crazy for not seeing how totally platonic everything is for the rest of my life.

It seems like trying to convince someone to like different food, or to have a different favorite color. I am not happy in this, and I do not want to feel these feelings any longer.

There is no need for this to be mutual. I do not need your permission to break up with you.”

He wrote me back an apologetic email in which he accepted responsibility for most things without any argument, except he denied anything that had to do with his relationship with her making me feel uncomfortable and he denied that I would not be able to handle their relationship.

He said that the only thing that made their trip bad for me was my own perspective.

I wrote him back that trust has to be built and that he put too much strain too early on a relationship in which we had not developed that trust.

He agreed and apologized. For me, it ended on a pretty amicable note, but this style of relationship really doesn’t work for me and I don’t feel like his responses to me really healed or changed anything significantly. I stand by my decision at this point.

TLDR: We broke up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/csoob6/update_my_28f_boyfriend_29m_and_his_best_friend/,relationship_advice,10833,1262,0.0
Throwaway203019,2019-08-19 19:57:28+00:00,I [30M] reported my best friend for Pedophilla and I'm looking after his kids,"I just needed somewhere to talk this is all very raw.


So my best friend whom we shall call Geoff and I have always been real tight. So much so that when he had his two kids (3 and 5 years old) I am the goto for babysitting them. I am so much in their lives they refer to me as ""Uncle"".

Anyway, I'm looking after them the past weekend (still kinda am pending legal matters) and let's call them Jim and Mike. Mike is the older at 5 years old and Jim is the younger, both males. So Friday night, I'm putting them to bed, which is nothing out of the ordinary. They both get a bath and have a fun old time. (Mum and Dad are away on a holiday for the weekend and are back this evening).


Anyway Friday night I'm putting them to bed and offer to read a story to them. Jim tells me that he wants to the play the ""pull, pull"" game. So I'm half laughing, ask what that is having never heard of this wonder what weird wacky invention this 3 year old has come up with. He drops his PJ bottoms and starts pulling his penis in what I would suggest is a 3 year olds understanding of masturbation. I stop immediately shocked at his behaviour and Mike at this point tells Jim to stop, in child like whisper saying 'Dad doesn't let us do that with other people!'


At this point alarms are going off in my bed. My background was Youth Work, this is completely inappropriate behaviour but I also can't just let it lie. I ask Jim, who taught you the pull pull game? Jim is not responsive, presumably my shock, his brother's words and my quickness to force him to dress again shut him down.


I ask Mike, do you know about the Pull pull game. Mike doesn't initially respond and slowly nods yes. I ask him who taught them the pull pull game and he quiet says ""Dad"". My child protection training kicks in and I stop asking questions.


I tell the kids to go to bed and I leave the room quietly and wish them good night. It takes me about an hour to get over the initial shock and I go to auto-pilot on my prior training. I call my friend who works in Social Services and explain everything. He tells me he's coming over and the evening became a world wind of his arrival, Police Liaison Officers and people wanted to get a statement from me.


The kids have been away with a Special Officer and Social Services.  My Social Services friend has been working with their legal team to determine guardianship. As far as I know my friend, the kids Dad, and their Mum had been arrested on their return inside the Country around an hour ago and I've been asked in the meantime to look after the kids. Who were understandable distraught that their parents have not come to pick them up. I barely held it together to get them to sleep and now I am here alone till my Social Services friend gets back. I was due to return to work tomorrow but I've already called my boss and told him I'm taking the week off for 'Bereavement leave' and have said no more than that.  I don't even know what I'm going to say to these kids tomorrow, I told them a lie tonight that their parents flight was delayed but that won't wash tomorrow.


Any advice or perspective would be appreciated right now. From a Social Services perspective and legality I’m ok. I just need, human, thoughts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/csmevd/i_30m_reported_my_best_friend_for_pedophilla_and/,relationship_advice,3078,342,0.0
throwayyyy111th,2019-08-19 03:27:36+00:00,Update: My wife may be cheating,"TL:DR Wife wants to divorce if I get the position. She has an answer to everything I saw. I just don't believe her.

I just want to update what has transpired since the post yesterday. Shortly after I posted Saturday, I finally was able to get her to come out of our bedroom. She had me assure her that I would not yell. I said I just want to talk. So I went over everything I saw. The unmade bed, the dinner the wine, Sam leaving right away. She asked what was wrong with any of it? She did not make the bed that day, she was trying out a new recipe, had wine with dinner and finished it after. Probably drank too much. Sam is a long time bachelor, wife passed away 7 years ago. He stays busy with some of the charities we work with. I just shook my head, I know what I was seeing but she has an explaination for all. I asked why she would not open the door. She started with she was afraid of me. She knows that I have never laid a hand on anyone since the 8th grade. It is not me, I would rather talk things out or seperate until everyone cools down. The other reason was she was not ready to tell me something else.

We have known of the position opening since April. My boss presented to the board his plan to retire end of the year. They want the position filled by 4th qtr. There would be a time when the incoming VP would work along side my boss. My boss has vacation time accumulated so that he won't be working much in December. He gave us the heads up shortly after notifying the board. The wife and I talked about it since then. She has expressed that she did not want to start life over again. She has a nice career, her company does not have a branch back east. She would have to job hunt. I told her she could just not work but feels that she would be unfulfilled. She really thinks I will get the promotion because of my boss. I told her over and over that it is not final until the board votes on a candidate.

So she has decided that she would rather divorce than move. She just wasn't ready for me to come home early. She had not in her mind how to tell me. She knew it would crush me. We have a very solid marriage up to now. We do not put on a show for others since we are in the public so much. Sex is still good. Has diminished in frequency as we have aged. We both initiate. We are very much each others best friend. She was right. I am crushed. I asked what was her plan if I don't get the job. Her answer was that everything stays the same then. I asked her if she was crazy. Did she think I would forget? Forgive?

I called my lawyer. We are friends also. Me calling on the weekend is not an infringment into his personal time. After pleasantries he listen to me until I mentioned potential divorce. He stopped me there. He said ""I can not represent you"". The wife has already hired him. I asked if he new someone else, he said he will send me a list of names from other firms. He told me he personally will not handle the divorce, he will hand it over to another associate in the firm.

I still have an uneasy feeling on what I saw. So I took a couple of commentors suggestion. I called Sam. I explained to him very calmly that the wife and I talked. Now I want to hear from him. He gave me the same story word for word, like it was rehearsed. Then I got hold of the wifes phone. It was scrubbed clean. Only messages from Saturday night and today. I guess I am getting divorced anyways why should it matter but it does. 

A few years ago I was off work for a couple months due to some medical issues. I had the company install an office in my home. I took one of the kids old rooms and made a home office. I had couple of the IT guys come over and get me set up. At the time it was better than my office at work. So I called one if the guys to ask if you can retrieve erased messages and call logs that were deleted from a Samsung S10? He said that it was easy, ""Goggle it"". I asked him if he could walk me through it. So after a bit we had most of records restored. I searched the phone and found lots of calls to one number, I don't know who, a few months ago. I found Sams number lots of calls recently. I checked the texts nothing overly sexual but certainly not charity related, lots of meet up plans. As I am finishing the wife knocks on the door as I locked myself in. She asked if I seen her phone. I opened the door and said "" yeah I have it I fixed it."" She asked what I meant. I told her that I saw her call logs and messages were deleted, so I restored them. Her mouth dropped open, she stuttered. Then came the obligory ""You went thru my phone?"" She snatched the phone and stormed away. I called after her ""we need to talk some more"". She went out the door and have not seen or heard from her all day.

So Monday I need to call the lawyer. I have already been thru bank records . No money has been moved around. I printed balances as of today. I now need to call my kids. I see that she had called each Saturday. I think the well has been poisoned. It is starting to set in. She is my life, my partner.  Now she will be gone. I feel like when my parents died. How can I go to such a position without her by my side?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/csbiax/update_my_wife_may_be_cheating/,relationship_advice,1750,396,0.0
queenofgoat,2019-08-19 02:39:51+00:00,[update] on pregnancy that I [26F]wanted to keep but long term boyfriend [27M] didn’t.,"A couple of weeks ago I posted on here about finding out I was pregnant and me and my partner having different views on the situation. (I wanted to keep the baby and my partner wasn’t ready for a child at this time). 
I ended up deleting the post because some of the comments became a little tense but my story had a tragic twist so I thought I would share this update for those who commented on the last post and asked to write an update on what we decided or even possibly for someone going through the same thing.

I went into hospital last Thursday with pain in my stomach and the doctor told me I had a water infection so I was sent home with antibiotics, my boyfriend cared for me at home and my daughter stayed with her grandparents for a couple of days, however by the Saturday I was no better and the pain was even worse and was predominantly in my lower right side so we took a trip to A&amp;E where we had to wait until 4am on Sunday morning for a doctor to see us, when they did eventually get round to us it was all go from there. I was having a ruptured ectopic pregnancy and bleeding out internally. I was rushed into surgery and my right Fallopian tube as well as the baby had to be removed and I had to have three blood transfusions for the blood that I had lost.

It’s the day after and although I am sore and upset I feel lucky that I am here and my boyfriend has been my absolute rock. 

So in the end our choice was made up for us but we are stronger than ever and will be taking extra precautions so that in the future we can decide together when the right time for us to have children is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/csazu8/update_on_pregnancy_that_i_26fwanted_to_keep_but/,relationship_advice,1194,77,0.0
burnerexplosions,2019-08-19 00:28:25+00:00,[UPDATE]I'm feeling a lot of anger about this child[M5] of my[M39] wife's[F39] affair that I've been talked into being a father figure for.,"[First post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cctm2u/im_feeling_a_lot_of_anger_about_this_childm5_of/)

Hey everyone it's been a few weeks since you heard from me. I guess I'm kind of in a spot to update now.

So, my post got a lot of feedback and it was *pretty much* unanimous. I heard from lots of people; parents and sons and daughters in blended families, people who'd been cheated on themselves, people who were Max in their own families and you all told me what I should have been able to admit myself, that this was not normal, that no one had ever heard of an arrangement like this.

I resolved to end the arrangement and met with my ex wife and her partner to tell them a few days after I posted, midway through their custody week. Many people advised me to speak to my boys about it first, like my ex did to me, but I wanted to deliver the message before having to take Max again. I was thinking that it might be better to instead call them out on that behaviour and try to get them to agree not to include the boys in that level of discussion before me, and then we could all sit down with the boys.

The meeting did not go well. They were both pretty mad at me. I had tried to prepare for it to be uncomfortable. I told myself just to be polite and firm, that I didn't owe them an explanations beyond ""I'm sorry, its not working out"". I guess he had made some career move based on this schedule that I was fucking up. In hindsight I do feel sort of responsible for that frustration, in that I regret agreeing to this arrangement in the first place, but in the moment I really was not giving a fuck about this man's work life balance. Then, he said something about how I wasn't being ""fair"", that they just wanted a ""fair"" custody arrangement. That made me very mad. Thinking about this all to type it out has my heart hammering. I have some different opinions on ""fairness"". I said some pretty shitty, regrettable things to both of them and then we were all screaming at each other for awhile and then I stormed out and I didn't talk to the boys.

I didn't get to talk to my boys for several days until hand off. They immediately were asking about why Max wasn't with them and I, prepared for it, held a more serious talk with them than I had up to this point. I talked about how its great that they enjoy spending time with Max, but that I'm their father and that Max has his own father to spend time with. I also talked about how this whole spectacle of our lives is difficult for me, that I don't like having to spend only every other week with them. That their mother's decision to start another family with Max's father and Max still makes me sad. This is pretty awfully difficult stuff to talk about. I've been pretty strict with myself about not venting to my son's about their mother up until now, but effectively that's meant I haven't really talked about her or our breakup at all. If you can't say anything nice, as they say.

Trying to maintain that respect for their mother and also talk frankly about my own feelings is a difficult tightrope balance. I don't want to blame their mother, but I also don't want to *not* blame their mother, if you know what I mean. This would be one of the situations I identify as ""unfair"", where the responsible thing is to never say anything disparaging or ""poisonous"" to my sons about their mother, my ex, but that means I have to describe the current state of affairs and what has happened to get here in a way that isn't disparaging to their mother and act like this is normal. ""She decided"".

I think I actually did a good job navigating the conversation. My sons absorbed it easier than I expected. A few weeks later and things with them are basically normal. 

I have had a few short conversations with my ex since our big embarrassing blowup. I sort of feel like I want her to apologize for this whole thing, but also know that I'm not doing myself any favours waiting for that to happen. I think she remains upset with me, more for the things I said than the rejection of this arrangement with Max. Or maybe that's just projection, because that's what I feel guilty for. I also regret that the last time I spoke to Max was dropping him off before ending the arrangement. I don't know. I guess his mom has explained to him that she missed him too much, to have him gone each week, but I don't know how sturdy that story will be.

Rereading my last post has me feeling pretty shameful of how I talked about Max. I know he doesn't deserve my sustained ire and that he's not going anywhere, so I'll have to be able to adjust to his presence. I'm obviously holding on to a lot of anger that is really about my ex wife but she isn't obligated to give a shit about that and I am obligated to interact with her politely so I guess that anger just got set aside and then vented onto Max just because he was there in my face, but that was my own fault.

So, I sort of expect things will pretty much return to normal from here. Contact with my ex is curt right now, but that'll loosen up.

The comments helped me realize that I was the problem and I needed to get over myself. Letting her slip away because of my judgmental ideas about people would have been a huge mistake. 

So I invited her over to my place last night and I awkwardly blurted out that I was falling in love with her and I see our relationship going somewhere. She laughed and and asked if I was asking her to go steady lol. She told me she felt the same way. Then we got a pizza and some beer and binge watched a show. And I woke up this morning with her snuggled against me.  It was perfect. 

I’m in love with this woman guys. I feel like my heart is going to explode. She’s the one.  I’m going to ask her to marry me one day.

Please help.,"[Original Post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cq95v4/my_23f_bf_23m_hasnt_been_there_for_me_through_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

Hi everyone

It’s been several days since my post, and I really just wanted to say thank you to everyone who gave me their opinions and offered condolences. I appreciate your time and thoughts so much. Plus, reading through this thread was a great distraction and it helped me keep it together for my family when I was with with them... especially the snarky replies lol.

It has felt like a long week but I finally feel like I’m over the hurdle. Yesterday was the funeral, where my family asked me to speak. My cousins couldn’t. The funeral was packed, and the overflow room in the funeral home was filled with people who loved my uncle.

My sisters fiancé and my brothers girlfriend both came to support our family. I think that was one thing that really drove home the conclusions I came to earlier in the week. 

Through this whole week, my bf has not once asked how I feel or if I’m okay. My friends, coworkers, and acquaintances who knew my uncle have shown me more compassion.

I don’t hate him, but he really took me down.

At first I was going to take the advice many people gave and just ghost him. It seemed like the easiest thing to do. I even deleted all of my events from our shared google calendar, and left group chats that we were both in. I blocked him on fb messenger but that only lasted like an hour before I realized that I’m not that person. Even though I was hurt and angry, I don’t need to get even. 

On Thursday (the night before the visitation), I cracked and texted him asking him to just talk to me and explain what was happening, and then I went to sleep.

Part of me didn’t think he’d respond, but in the morning he had sent me a long message explaining his perspective. 

He basically explained he doesn’t handle grief or loss well due to past experiences (I understand), but then accused me of being like his ex-girlfriend and he can’t go back to that and how I have to communicate.

I know I’m not winning any awards for communication. I’m afraid to speak my mind sometimes and that leads me to be passive aggressive or with festering issues. But how can I communicate with someone who doesn’t respond to me or ask questions? I don’t think he realizes it’s a two way street.

We had a previous conversation where I explained to him that it was hard for me to express myself because of past trauma, and that I would try to improve but I would need him to be patient and call me out and ask me questions. This is what frustrated me the most.

I responded with a long message saying that I understand I reacted badly, but then explained my side and told him that his actions were hurtful especially because I really needed him and he rejected me. I needed support and he ignored me instead for being too emotional.

He said sorry, and asked if we can make up. I told him I don’t know and that I couldn’t think about it with everything else going on, so we’re supposed to talk later this week.

The thing is, even though I understand his reaction a little better, it’s not something I can accept or live with. As a lot of you pointed out, our communication styles are just too incompatible. I was willing to work towards bridging it, maybe because I didn’t know where my line was. I definitely found the line this week.

Even his apology didn’t show any concern for my well being. I know some of you pointed out it’s a young relationship, but I think generic condolences are not a lot to ask for from a partner - especially as we knew each other as friends before. 

He took my pain this week and made it about himself, and then waited for me to make it better for him. If I hadn’t messaged him Thursday, I truly doubt I would have heard from him at all. That kind of selfishness is not something I want in a friend or a partner.

So, whenever I get around to it, we’re going to have to have that conversation. I’m pretty anxious about it and still sad, but I’m not willing to keep trying. If I did, I’d feel like I was selling myself out. 

If you read this far, thank you. I wasn’t going to post this update because I felt self absorbed talking about myself like this. But I had a few private messages this week asking about what happened, so this seemed easiest.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cs1qpg/update_my_23f_bf_23m_hasnt_been_there_for_me/,relationship_advice,4315,257,0.0
bucfuc,2019-08-18 09:44:22+00:00,Update: I (34M) think my wife (32F) is cheating on me.,"Original post from a few weeks ago:I travel a lot for work. I’m usually gone Tuesday through Thursday 3 times a month. My wife is a stay at home mother for our two children 3 and 5. We have a nanny that helps out 4 days a week during the day, so that my wife can take care of her errands and shopping. 
About 6 months ago I caught my wife in a lie. Not a big lie just her telling me she was somewhere when I knew she wasn’t. It bothered me but not to the point where I was extremely concerned. Then a week before the 4th of July I came home early from my trip I wanted to surprise her, the next day was the anniversary of the day we had met. I had also received a fairly large bonus two weeks earlier and was going to surprise her with the trip I booked for us to go to St Martin for a week. It was late when I got in from the airport around 11:30pm and we had FaceTimed about three hours earlier so I could see her and the kids. She never mentioned anything about going out that night. When I got home the nanny was there, she said to me that my wife had left about an hour and a half ago. I texted my wife asked her what she was up too, and she responded saying she was about to go to bed. I said thats funny because I just got home and you’re not here. 
When she got home she was telling me that she was just out with two of her friends, she named them, and just didn’t want me upset that she wasn’t home with the kids (usually one of our parents would watch the kids at night we had never used the nanny before), I didn’t really buy her excuse,  but I had no proof and she wasn’t admitting to anything. 
The next day I ordered a gps tracker for her vehicle. I haven’t told her about it. And since then I have caught her in several lies, and I’m not even trying to set her up. She is just telling me she is at one place and I can see she is clearly not. 
Should I confront her with what I did and why is she lying to me or hire a private investigator to get proof of infidelity if it is happening? 

TLDR I caught my wife in a lie so I got a gps for her car. Then I caught her in multiple lies.

I hired a private investigator, gave him a lot of information. My wife has been acting normal all day. We had plans tonight, I canceled told her I was not feeling well (which is the truth). I don’t think anything else will happen until I leave Tuesday morning. I plan on calling my friend who is an attorney on Monday, even though he is not a divorce lawyer I’m sure he can point me in the right direction. Thanks for all the kind words and a few not so kind. I’ll update when the PI does his thing.

Update: so I hired a private investigator to follow my wife when I left on Tuesday. He first followed her to the grocery store, he said he saw her purchase two visa gift cards. He told me that could be how she is paying the nanny for the extra time without giving her a check or CC. She left the house for a second time around 12:30 pm and went to the same location she has been going to. He witnessed an suv pull up and she got in. He followed the vehicle to a gated community where he lost sight of them. He was not able to view the driver due to the dark tint. He has a realtor license and used that to get in, but by the time he got to the house they were already inside. They were there for about 3.5 hours. He then saw my wife and another lady leave the house in the same vehicle, he followed them back to where my wife’s car was parked. She went home and didn’t leave the rest of the day.

Wednesday 8/14 she went to a few shops with the kids. That night around 9:15 (I FaceTimed her and the kids around 8:30) she left and went to the same location. She again met with the same women. This time they went to a restaurant and ate for a little over an hour, then back to her house til 1:15am. She was again dropped off at her car and then went home.

So there was no guy involved at least this week, but she never told me she was going out for dinner or anything. I really don’t know what to do now. The PI was pretty expensive I’m not sure I want to hire him again. Not sure if I should confront her or just try an get more information on my own.

Update: so these last few weeks have been difficult. I kept the PI following her when I have been out of town. It has been the same thing she meets at the same place and the same woman picks her up. This Wednesday they went to dinner instead of her house. The PI got a photo of them embracing and a single kiss when they got to the place where my wife parks. The kiss is not something just friends would do. This is the first real evidence I have gotten, other than just strong suspicion. 
I flew home a day early, and last night I confronted her with the photos. I didn’t tell her how I got them or that I had hired a PI. I asked her to explain why she was cheating and how long it had been going on. She basically denied everything and said that they were just friends. She then tried to accuse me of spying on her and invading her privacy. I couldn’t believe it, even with the photos and her lying she wanted to blame me. 
I haven’t moved forward with the divorce or anything yet, I’m still hoping she will come clean and tell me the truth.

Update: so I have the woman’s name,age and where she works from the PI. She is single no kids, she has a Facebook account but no personal information on relationship status or recent posts or likes and she is not friends with my wife. No instagram or Twitter that he can find either. I think I’m done with him he found out enough.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/crza3d/update_i_34m_think_my_wife_32f_is_cheating_on_me/,relationship_advice,6046,732,0.0

Let’s just say it’s been emotionally manipulative, and verbally abusive for a while now. I was trying my best to love her and work through things. I even flew in today from another state to help her pack because none of her friends were there to help her. 

We got into a heated fight in the car after I landed, and that’s where she punched me in the face. I’ve always suspected she could turn physically violent, but today she proved it. I always told myself I would never tolerate domestic violence. I held my nose in disbelief, got out of the car as she begged me get back in, and go into an Uber. I’m flying back to my state now, confused, hurt, but more emotionally numb than anything else. I guess it’s not a surprise so that’s why. 

Tomorrow I’m removing her from our joint bank accounts. I have already blocked her on social media. My dad thinks I should report her to the police in case she tries to turn this on me, given how bipolar and crazy she is. She is now claiming she didn’t even touch me. I never touched her in my life, and her roommate saw that she was fine, but can I file a police report from another state? 

Tidr: my fiancé punched me. Can I file a police report from a different state. What else can I do to protect myself?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/crh6xb/my_abusive_fiancé_28f_punched_me_28m_in_the_face/,relationship_advice,2687,158,0.0

I just need to talk to someone about this but I can’t bring myself to do it. I just feel so humiliated and confused. It made me feel horrible physically and emotionally. 

I just gave birth four weeks ago. I told him “yes”. But I asked him to be careful. He told me “don’t worry I’ll be gentle”.

But he was not, at all. I told him to “slow down” and he ignored me. I tried to put my hand on his chest to push him away but he grabbed my wrist and pinned it down. I said, “babe please it hurts” and he hushed me. He just got more aggressive every time I said anything so I stopped and just layed down. I tried not it think about what was happening and tried to block out all the pain. 

When he was done, he left me alone and I have just been crying. I know he hears but he hasn’t come back to our bedroom. I’m in so much pain. I don’t know why he did this to me.

shegotdaddyissues124,2019-08-16 22:47:18+00:00,I (29F) found out I own my dead dad's car but my family is pressuring me to give it to his (60F) girlfriend...,"My dad (54) died last month.  We had a very complicated relationship.  He had a girlfriend (60) of 19 years, but they never married, so I'm in the next of kin, heir to the estate, whatever.  He and gf had bought a house together the year before - she's selling that now but needs to fix something in order to close.  She was looking into selling his car and found out that technically I own it now.  So my grandmother calls me to be like, hey you need to sign the car over to GF so that she can sell it to fix the house.  He meant for it to go to her.  So okay sure.  

The thing is, when my great-grandfather died 19 years ago (right around the time they got together), I was left an inheritance that was meant to be used for college.  My dad spent all of it taking himself and GF on vacations to the Caribbean, living off of it, as well as his own inheritance that he got.  I only stayed with him during the summers so it's not like I was enjoying any of this money. He never took me shopping, never took me on a vacation that wasn't Six Flags, he barely even paid child support. 

They were both complicit in this.  My uncles, aunts, and cousins all got their inheritance, but my dad and her spent all of mine and I never saw a penny.  Everytime my mother would ask about it, he'd say ""Something happened to it, idk, it got lost, no it never came through, no his wife kept everything, etc etc.""  He never once admitted to spending it or even acknowledged that it existed. I think my mother talked to the family lawyer at one point and they were basically like, well it was left under his care so he can do what he wants with it.

So I kind of want the car.  It wouldn't be worth much, but it would help me pay off my credit card debt enough to be able to finally start a savings.  I know she needs it to sell the house and I would be burning a huge bridge by doing this, but I am really angry when I think about how I'm being told to ""do the right thing"" when they did not do the right thing when they spent my money when I was a literal child. 

I don't know what to do.  It's legally mine.  She was the one making payments on it.  So I get that it's ""her"" money.  But she was complicit when he spent all of MY money years ago.  I also hate that she had my grandma call to tell me this instead of doing it herself like a coward.  I don't know what to do.

My grandma says this is clearly making me ""sick.""  Well yeah, it's dredging up bad memories of when I was stolen from by my family and had to accrue a shitton of debt to go to college when I could have had a huge leg up.

So do I do the right thing or do I do what's right for me?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/crdscy/i_29f_found_out_i_own_my_dead_dads_car_but_my/,relationship_advice,1365,340,0.0
tj97x,2019-08-16 22:39:01+00:00,I [22m] told my girlfriend [20f] the truth about my scars and she left.,"We've been dating for 8 months. She's easily the best thing that has ever happened to me. Last night we got into a huge fight and she said she's sick of me being secretive (which is ttly fair) and gave me an ultimatum to explain myself. So I basically broke down and told her probably way too much about my past (pretty severe child abuse). She said she needed space since she has her own trauma history. That's fine and I totally respect that but then today the only thing she has said to me is that she's ""not sure"" about us anymore. 

I never ever meant to be triggering and I have been avoiding this conversation forever because I was afraid it would freak her out and that's exactly what happened. She disclosed her trauma to me when we first started dating and now she's saying she feels stupid for telling me because what I experienced ""makes hers seem stupid."" I feel fucking awful. I never meant to make her feel that way. 


TL;DR I finally told my girlfriend the truth about where my scars came from and basically scared her away. 

She already goes to therapy and I'm wait listed but what can I do to fix this for now?

My job involves a lot of time-consuming, individual work so I have almost no time to bond. Somehow, one of my coworkers got wind that I was getting married soon. 

He caught me when I was walking to my car after work and asked for my opinion on floral arrangements. I, being an idiot, gave my opinion and didn't connect the dots until he said ""Do you have flowers for your wedding?"". When I protested he said ""I've already ordered them, I'll send them to your house the day before the wedding. This is my wedding gift to you."" He said something else about how it's important to him that I start my marriage off on the right foot and he walked away.

I drove home in tears. When I told my fiancé he was in disbelief. I don't know what I did to deserve such kindness.

I'm so touched that he went out of his way for me. I want to thank him but I don't know how?? A wedding thank you card seems like it's not enough and giving him money seems disrespectful??

OldUltimatums,2019-08-16 15:44:57+00:00,Should I (F27) divorce my (M27) husband for getting a paternity test behind my back?,"My husband and I have been married for three years. We have a one-and-a-half-year-old son and I'm currently 6 months pregnant with our daughter. 

When I met my husband, he was very shy and we didn't have the best relationship in the beginning. He'd constantly worry he wasn't good looking enough, tall enough, what-have-you. It was mostly due to his friends back then, who were (to put it nicely) Incels. They'd call me awful things and tell him worse, like that I couldn't be trusted because I had had boyfriends before him or that I was just using him for his money (although we earned about the same amount). And I think he genuinely believed it for a time - I don't know.

But when we got married, they started to shut up about it around me. I thought it was over with. That my husband and I could finally just live in peace. That they'd stop breaking him down with their accusations. I was wrong. A couple of months into my pregnancy with our son, he came up to me and said we needed to talk.

He wanted a paternity test. 

I was heartbroken. I cried and yelled at him - asking if I'd ever done anything to make him think I was unfaithful, etc. Then he admitted that his friends had egged him on as to not get 'used by me'. He apologized but I felt so angry. I hated his friends and I hated him for asking, so I just gave him an ultimatum: We could drop the subject and I'd try not to hold it against him or he could get his paternity test and we'd divorce, because I didn't want to be married to a man that didn't trust me. 

He chose the former and I honestly thought that was it. He broke off those friendships when our son was a couple of months old. But yesterday night, while he was in bed, I stumbled upon a shoebox he kept below his bookshelf in our office. I don't know why I decided to go snooping through it. I probably shouldn't have. I don't know, but I found the paternity test he had gotten behind my back. Surprise, surprise, it was his! Because of course it was...

I confronted him and he apologized, begging me to forgive him, saying that he wouldn't have done the same with our daughter, that he trusted me and that everything was different now, that he was different. I don't know if I can believe him anymore. All I can think about is about how he'd so effortlessly been lying to me all this time. 

Honestly, I don't know what to do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cr86av/should_i_f27_divorce_my_m27_husband_for_getting_a/,relationship_advice,1344,780,0.0
idkwhattodo46,2019-08-16 10:36:21+00:00,My (19F) boyfriend (20M) broke up with me because I’m too good at sex,"We’ve been dating for a year and he’s a year older than me and we met in college. We took things slow bc we’re both virgins and it’s special to both of us so we agreed we’d wait until we’re really in love and sure about each other. And after a year, we could see ourselves married in the future so we decided to have sex. 

Even after our first time, he asked me if I really was a virgin or if I lied because I was too good. No I didn’t lie. I just watched some educational videos and practiced on my own. Since then, he’d get weird during sex. Like if I did something good, he’d say it felt good and then his face would change like he was thinking. Now I know he was questioning if I really was a virgin. 

Anyway. He broke up with me yesterday after we had sex. TMI I was riding him and he said I act like a porn star and he’s obviously not the only guy I’ve been with and he thinks I lied to him. I told him I watched a ton of porn and copy from the videos but he doesn’t believe me. 

Great. Never thought I’d be dumped for being too good at sex. It just really sucks bc we had sex bc we thought we’d be long term and we broke up already. I want him back.

snotpilgrim_,2019-08-15 12:54:19+00:00,My (20F) very private best friend (19F) is finally bringing her bf (20M) to meet our group. We have another friend (19M) who is crushing on her HARD and is planning to crash the event to have a talk with my friend’s bf. WTF DO WE DO,"Hi everyone. Throwaway acc. This is going to be long. My best friend, S, has been dating the same guy, C, on and off for about 3 years. We’ve never met him because he lives so far from the rest of the group. Recently, she bonded with our friend J after hanging out with him and seeing a movie. They’ve been hanging out, hiking, doing outdoorsy stuff that the rest of the gang isn’t really into. J has developed a GIGANTIC crush on S. S has noticed and does not encourage him in any way, but is super non confrontational and refuses to bring it up to him so he doesn’t get embarrassed. She doesn’t want to ruin the friendship, and since she found out, she hadn’t hung out with him one on one and has cut down a bit on their communication. We all pretty much know that once we go back to college for the semester, it will die down. However, things kind of suck for the time being. 

J is clingy and hangs onto S when we hang out in a group. He is constantly trying to pull her attention away from us like a child. He will poke her arm, say her name in her ear when she is talking or being spoken to, and even physically pick her up and take her away (she is 5’2 and slender, he is 6’4 and very strong). At first, she took it light heartedly, but now she is avoiding being touched by him at all. She is very anxious and non confrontational, and I usually have to tell him to cut it out because she’s afraid to say something. I don’t mind, obviously at some point she has to learn to stand up for herself, but she and I have already spoken about that and she’s taking the proper steps. But also, like I said, she is doing absolutely nothing to encourage him in any way. I just want to drive the point home that this really is NOT her fault, and J’s actions are distressing her greatly. 

S and J had a falling out 2 days ago where he completely blew up at her. J constantly brings C into the conversation and S tries to avoid it, but J is obsessed with C. If we’re hanging out and he hears her say his name, he will come running from wherever he is to listen and even tries to grab her phone to read their messages if she’s texting him. I’ve linked the screenshots of their fight that S sent me, with some stuff blurred out for anonymity. Blue is S, gray is J. I am E, for reference, and our other friend is L. [Texts.](https://imgur.com/gallery/z1xt6SV)

So S kind of went off on him and blocked him after uninviting him, but it’s been a long time coming. Almost every one on one convo they have is J trying to get S to talk about what’s wrong in her relationship. He even does this in front of the rest of the friend group. S has told me that when they’re alone, he asks very very specific questions about their issues and even about her sex life, kinks and all that Jazz. At first, she said she thought it was light hearted, but now it’s creepy. And it is true that he tries to compete with me for the “best friend” role (S and I have been best friends for like 10 years. They just became close a couple months ago). 

So yes, C is coming to stay with S at her place for the next two weeks. He moved away 2 years ago, so they are long distance over the summers. S has invited us to her place Friday night, and through our friend L I heard that J is still very much planning on going. L came over to my place last night, as she was very concerned. She told me that J was going to crash the party (should also add that this is going to be my fucking BIRTHDAY PARTY) to have a “man to man” talk with C about S. Knowing what I know about C, he wouldn’t entertain J at all. Knowing what I know about J, L and I are worried he might try to get physical with C. What do we say to J to stop him from coming to the party?? What do we do??? This is so much drama that our group never has and I feel so bad for S. My dear friend doesn’t deserve this. How do L and I deal with J without hurting S or C in the process?? Thanks to those who read through the whole thing!! 

Tl;dr: our friend has a massive crush on my bff. He was rude to her the other night and she uninvited him from my birthday celebration where the group would be meeting her boyfriend of 3 years for the first time. Our friend is planning on crashing the even to have a “man to man” talk with the bf.

To preface, I want to say that my GF is declaratively bisexual and her friends are bicurious too from what my GF told me. I have nothing against this fact and treat her the same as anyone.
Recently, GF went on a three day “girl’s trip” with her friends. I’ve had a gut feeling for a while that my gf could have feelings for especially one of her friends. It was confusing to define boundaries in the beginning of the relationship as she’s only dated girls in her life. We’ve been dating off and on for about 4 years, for context.
We’ve had many conversations about boundaries and I’ve let her know that I want all the borderline romantic activities with her friend to stop (cuddling,kissing,codependent texting habits,etc), not because I’m trying to be controlling, but it causes too much confusion for me to define cheating versus “friendliness”.
Before their trip, i told my gf “I don’t wanna hear any stories of you doing single things with these girls.”, mostly because they’re all single except for her and secondly because of her behavior towards her friends.
After the trip, my gf was telling me a story about how apparently two of the girls were taking a bath fully nude together and my gf expressed to me that the girls were being ‘weird, loud and annoying’. I had a weird vibe because she kept emphasizing how annoying they were being. I’m thinking “how annoying can a bath be?”
So I go on to ask her if she was involved with all of this and she reassured that it was “only the two girls and I would never because they’re gross. All girl’s shower together”. Ok.
Few days pass and I kind of forget about the weird interaction. We’re hanging out and I notice on her messages something she closed out very quickly. It was a picture of all of them bathing fully nude together and she sent the picture to the group chat. 
I’ve withheld this from her as I’m trying to prepare myself for confrontation. We’d already been over that I didn’t want to see stuff like this, but she did it anyways and then lied to me about it. I feel like there’s more to this because of how much she bashed them as individuals and rationalized bathing together as full grown adults. 
Although I’m maintaining a unbiased view on this as I try to look at things objectively, I don’t particularly connect with any of these friends either. I think it’s odd that she’s bathing fully nude with friends she mostly met under a month ago. The girls constantly bash men and hate on men. I get really strange vibes from them, especially after finding this.

-Is it normal for my gf to behave like this? It seems she values temporary pleasure over my respect
-How would you confront this situation?

I’m upset because of how she disrespected me behind my back and then lied about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cqoh49/my_gf_20f_bathed_with_3_of_her_female_friends/,relationship_advice,1205,471,0.0

What boggled my mind is that this storey floded over to mainstream media.

But let's get to the story.

So since this went viral a lot happened.

**My sister **

1. My sister saw this story while browsing on her reddit acc. She lost her mind. She accused me of painting her like a looney and misinterpreting facts.
She said that I was being unfair. That she is family and that she asked it nicely because she loves me.
She also underlines the fact that the opinion of internet strangers doesn't count because family is more important and I should focus on making my family happy.

The only text I sent back was this.

* I am sorry that you percived it that way. I did not in any matter distort what happened. As you might notice I didn't describe your tone nor exaggerated anything. Perhaps you have that night different in your mind than I do, but I digress.
I am sick and tired to bending to your will. My whole life I have been your servant and your doormat. Remember all the birthdays I had to share with you because you would throw a tantrum because you didn't get presents? Or when you cried so that I would fill out job applications for you? But the thing that has hurt me most till now is when you ruined my graduation.
I am done. I admit that I also spoiled you but I will not any longer. If you want to marry so bad before your baby is born then you could look at [hotel x] that offers last minute weddings. I have spent too much time planing MY wedding to gift it to you.

And if you want to ruin our relationship over this  then go ahead. I will sleep sound and safe knowing that it wasn't my fault. *

She only sent me a

*wow.... You must love me so very much *

And blocked me. She unblocked me this morning to sent me this

[http://imgur.com/gallery/q9X0Ma1] (a text about my supposed wedding planner overriding her my venue) 

I allready contacted wedding planner but am out of the office hours so I will have to wait. 

**my parents **

My parents haven't actually written me since the thing with my father in law. 
My older brother (yes I have an older brother but he lives in another city and wasn't at the BBQ, that's why I didn't mention him) 


Contacted me and wanted to know what happened because he got a weird story from mom and dad 
*mom had told him that I had offered previous to the BBQ to give up the venue to my sister and that I humiliated her *

I told him what really happened and he had no problem believing me. We talked a lot about our parents behavior and he confessed that him moving was partly due to our parents being, and I quote, shit heads to us. 
He told me that mom had gotten wind from the post and was mad at me for betraying my family. 

I haven't written my parents what so many of you adviced me to because I have to come to terms with the fact that they love my sister more than me (if they love me at all) 

**The wedding **

We sat together and put passwords with mayority of our vendors and also with the venue directly. (we didn't talk to our planner yet wich is why the text of my sister worries me so much) 

Also we canceled the catering that my parents paid for. So short term we won't be able to get a full catering like we wanted to. But all our friends and my fiancés family will help us prepare a buffet (and everyone is going to chip in). That will be our bachelor party. As we will have to spent more on our food now we canceled our bachelor parties and will have a family and friends cooking session. 

Thank you again for helping me see how toxic my family is. I will try to sort it out. If they apologize from the bottom of their heart they will be allowed into my wedding but if not... Then well...

I don’t have that detailed of an update because I’m currently still dealing with this situation but you all have gave me wonderful advice and have patiently waiting for an update and I do not want to keep you waiting.


A few days after this post an unmarked package was in our mailbox, our mailbox is not directly in front of our home but about a quarter mile down the road so I wasn’t able to see who dropped off the package, it was a small box with no address but it had my wife’s initials on it. I opened it and found hundreds of credit cards and debit cards in various different names. 

I finally confronted my wife about the kids stuff and the package she received and she vaguely admitted to being a part of some type of fake credit card scam ring ?? Someone , she wouldn’t tell me who , is supposed to come pick up these cards from my wife and sell them or something of the sort and she gets to keep some of the cards.  

After this interaction she cut off all communication with me and did not return when she was expected to be home. I’ve tried contacting her parents to no avail so that’s currently where I’m at. 

Our youngest is running out of breast milk supply so I’m not sure what to do after that runs out and I’ve been taking our kids to work with me as we don’t have childcare set up, I have a business trip coming up soon so I’m just currently in limbo , I love my wife and I’m not sure what our fate will be after this.

SadLingonberry8,2019-08-14 10:41:20+00:00,I [27M] don't feel sexually compatible with my fiancee [27F],"*(posted from a throwaway account; I'd rather not have this on my posting history. I previously posted it, felt bad and deleted it, but having thought about it again I realise I need to get it off my chest.)*

I'm currently engaged to a girl that I absolutely love, we've been together for the best part of 10 years, and the wedding has been arranged for March. The start of that whole ""*wedding, buying a house and starting a family*"" time. Everything is pretty much perfect, apart from one issue: I feel like the bedroom is dead and/or we're just not compatible sexually.

Just to get the obvious out of the way:

1. I don't have any ""*extreme tastes*"" or anything like that; we're hardly talking about BDSM! Everything involved is distinctively *vanilla* \- i.e tie'n'tease, massages, or a little toy play.
2. Yes, we've been together for 10 years; but if I'm feeling this way before we're even married (**and when I'm still in my twenties**) then it genuinely concerns me about the future.
3. I *know* that communications are incredibly important in a relationship, yet it feels like we've discussed this topic before and.. it was pointless. Pointless either by her defensiveness, or just for the sheer lack of anything changing.

Sex is incredibly important to me - be it for intimacy, pleasure, or both. It just feels like we both have entirely different attitudes though. There are times where I want it slow, so as to savour it and take the most pleasure, there are times where I want it to be intimate and tender, then other times where I may want to be hard and energetic... regardless of these wants though, it's *the same*.

Often it feels like she uses friends as comparators - i.e ""*they haven't had sex in months - I dont know how they do that!*"". Well to be blunt, I'm not in a relationship with her friends, nor do I have the exact same desires as her friends. Other times she may say that I ""*never want normal sex*""; which just isn't true. It makes it sound like she's constantly dressing up or we're doing something exotic; she may put on some stockings 3 or 4 times a year, which I really appreciate... but that's it.

Previous chats have been fruitless, so I've tried to communicate in other ways. That's usually meant buying little things we could try - perhaps a couple of toys, or little tie'n'tease restraints. Quite often these would be used once or twice, and then thrown in a box to gather dust. So I've now opted for books, *specifically with topics for both me and her*, ranging from intimate massage to oral play. I hope this shows that I don't even care for specific fantasies, I just want to play and have fun, *and I recognise that's a two way street.*

She recently embarrassed me (I think she'd had a couple of drinks at the time, so I didn't say anything.) by talking to friends about one of the items I purchased. She made it sound like it was something exotic, it was a bit of an anti-climax when they realised it was just a wand. Yet as I sat there feeling awkward I just realised that I think it's pointless trying to communicate via items or books too, and in combination with words having no effect.. I just feel stuck.

We *have* spoken before about these things, but it never changes anything. She's never really spoken about what *she'd like*, hence me trying to experiment. Yet for me, the few turn-ons that I've mentioned - all incredibly vanilla at that (i.e stockings, tie'n'tease/edging, or simply seeing her enjoy herself.) - are just.. well, it feels like they're forgotten immediately after any conversation.

So I'm sitting here genuinely worried about the future; I have someone I love and I want to spend the rest of my life with, but similarly someone I don't feel compatibility with in a very important way. The last thing I'd want to do is to nag her or make her feel pressured; that's not acceptable. Yet I'm struggling with how this makes me feel; realistically I'm not bad looking, but I begin to focus on weight I could lose etc. It also changes my perception of her - I then begin to find her less attractive, and go off sex all together as *I simply don't feel fulfilled*. I just feel stuck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cq7x8d/i_27m_dont_feel_sexually_compatible_with_my/,relationship_advice,6900,1420,0.0
ToughDelivery,2019-08-13 20:36:09+00:00,Update: This girl (22F) I've (21M) been dating revealed that she's a pornstar,"First post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/as5qtf/_/

It's been a while since my first post. It didn't gain much traction but I remembered posting here and figured I would post an update haha. I believe the day after I posted we had a talk. I had done a lot of thinking and eventually realized I wasn't going to be okay with it. I kept telling myself I was, but suddenly it kicked in and I was not cool with it anymore. So we talked and I told her that while I did want to be with her, I didn't see it working out. She didn't take it well, neither did I because breaking things off after such a strong connection is hard af. She wanted to stay friends but I felt like that was only going to hurt us both, so I told her honestly I was going to go no contact. We were both broken and we didn't want to say goodbye, so in the end we agreed to take a break and maybe get back in contact later.

And well, after a week she showed up at my place, and she told me she was quitting. I just kinda froze and she hugged me lol. We were both smiling like a bunch of idiots and it felt sooo good. She got out of the business soon after, still I can't believe she did that just so we could be together. She never lived a lavish lifestyle and actually saved up a lot, so she's going back to college upcoming year. I moved in with her last month, and things are so great man. I love this girl so incredibly much. It's been a bit awkward introducing her to some people (more than one 'don't I know you from somewhere?' lol..) and my friends give me shit for it but it's whatever. I don't really care. All I care about is her. And I love her. It's not the usual love story haha, but shit I'm so glad I found her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cpz0i3/update_this_girl_22f_ive_21m_been_dating_revealed/,relationship_advice,6921,597,0.0
jubejube25,2019-08-13 13:13:08+00:00,"Leaving my Husband. Made a bullet list of conversation topics to keep my head straight. Any advice, opinions welcomed.","I (24F) have been married to my husband (30M) for 2 years, together for 5. We have 2 boys under 3.

Things that I will always love about you.

-Your deep voice.

-Your up beat spirit, always laughing, always joking.

-Your dimple smile.

-Your integrity, your honestness

-The way you provide tirelessly for your family

-Your handsomeness  

-Your big heart.

-The way you play with the boys and make them smile.

Things that are not working. (We have talked about everyone of these, to no avail.)

-Your selfishness with your down time. 
(Always doing what YOU need, video games, on your phone, running your personal errands, not recognizing that I need personal down time too) 

-The way you isolate (we have no friends, no social life, you don’t even want to visit with my family)

-The way you expect me to isolate with you. (If I’m not with the kids, and doing something while you are working or having YOUR down time, you expect me to be there with you when YOU are ready.)

-Manipulating me to not leaving you alone with the kids (when I was at the gym or my AA meeting or an appointment, you would demand me back right away, guilt tripping me. when I would leave and rush home Caleb would be calm anyway.)

-Our intimacy issues. (We have never been on the same page, sadly I have begun to loose interest in you sexually) 

-The way you have exhausted the extravagant gift giving, (buying gifts doesn’t replace the glue that is slipping away) 

-They way you act like you are better than everyone else because your now on a sober path, (you look down on people who drink or smoke pot, 75% of the population does, it doesn’t make them a bald person, or an addict)

-The way that I’m 100% ignored; physically, emotionally, mentally, sexually, (you are always so lost in your phone or game you never hear me, you are not interested in me until I get upset.)

-The way you hold financial burden over my head. (Belittle me because you are the breadwinner, “good luck having a life with no income”)

-The way you take “jokes” too far. (You know you are making me upset and you turn passive aggressiveness into a game and claim you are just joking, having fun.)

-The way we both are stubborn, butting heads, never backing down, trying to hurt each other with words. (We are unhealthy, the kids hear us fighting and it’s untrue that they would be better off if we stick together. they need two happy, healthy parents, even if we’re not under the same roof.)

Where do we go from here.

I want a separation. I want to share custody. I want to be healthy co-parents, we don’t have to go through courts right away. I don’t want half of your everything. I want to be amicable. I don’t hate you in the least bit. I just cannot be happy married to you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cpsyte/leaving_my_husband_made_a_bullet_list_of/,relationship_advice,1759,498,0.0
Throwaway94759,2019-08-13 11:50:53+00:00,I (27M) found pictures of my girlfriend (23F) topless on the beach at night with strangers,"A bit of background: My girlfriend and I have been together for 5 years. We have lived most of this time at a distance, because both of us did periods of study abroad, now we live in the same country but different cities , about 2-3 hours of driving away from each other. We manage to spend together almost every weekend, and we were used to much bigger distances when we were living in different european nations, so the distance we have now is no big deal. I'm currently working in my hometown (which is her hometown too), she is still studying for her master's degree and will finish in one year. Recently I got a job opportunity in her city and thought it would have been nice to work there for one year and stay together. I didn't previously plan to go there, but I was contacted for a position by an ex colleague of mine and I liked the company. She's renting a house with one male flatmate and I suggested her to leave that house and rent a place with me instead. This was all just to test the ground as I wasn't even interviewed yet, but wanted to talk to my girlfriend before that. She told me she is not ready to live together and wanted me to rent a separate place, she said she would stay often at my place but wanted to keep her own too. Given this reaction, I didn't want to move there anymore, instead she insisted that she wanted me to move, but in a separate house. This made no sense for me, because the job was nice but nothing I couldn't find everywhere else, and my hometown is bigger and has more jobs in my field, the main reason I wanted to move was to stay with her. I told her that given that she wasn't ready to share an apartment with me, I would look for jobs in other cities and go where I could find the better opportunity, in my country or the neighboring one. After we had this conversation, she left for 10 days to go on a vacation at the sea with a friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

The fact: When she was on vacation, she partied every night and posted a lot of pictures where she was dancing and drinking. I was naturally a bit jealous but I thought she was innocently having fun. I'm also on vacation by the sea, in a different place, where my family has a flat, and invited her here when her previous vacation was over, so two days ago I went to pick her up at the airport and brought her here. The morning after she was showing me pictures of her vacation on her phone, and while scrolling she suddenly ends up on something she does not want me to see and locks her phone in embarrassment. The only thing I saw in that moment was a picture of her leaning on a guy, and thought that was what she didn't want me to see. At this point I was angry knowing she wanted to hide something from me. We stopped talking to each other for an hour then she came to show me the pictures and apologize. She showed me this picture of her on the beach at night, with 4 boys and another girl, going for a midnight swim. All other people were wearing swimsuits, but she didn't have one, so she was was with her underwear and no bra. She was wearing an open men shirt, borrowed from one of the guys, with her tits out in the open. I don't know the people in the picture, she says they are her friend's friends. I'm heartbroken since I saw that picture and I feel like my entire life has crumbled to pieces. I would have never expected her to do this to me, and I also don't understand why she would be so lacking of self-love to just show herself to strangers like this. I asked her for explanation multiple times yesterday and got different responses. Her story is this: she was wearing no bra but wanted to swim and didn't want to wet her t-shirt so borrowed a shirt from one of the guys. She said she closed the  shirt and it just happened that the picture was taken meanwhile she was closing it. This makes no sense because she was actively posing in the picture and making a face for the camera. Later she told me that she was upset for our discussions about cohabitation and wanted to do something reckless to forget about our problems for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

I sent her away on a train this morning and told her I want to spend my vacation alone and told her I'm considering breaking up. Right before she hopped on the train we both started crying and I held her in my arms for a couple minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel what she's done justifies breaking up, also I'm not sure if those pictures show everything or are just the tip of the iceberg. However, it's very difficult for me to break up. Our relationship has been perfect up to this time, we shared a lot of intense moments together, thought she was the love of my live and always loyal to me, was planning everything for a future together. Those have been 5 beautiful years and it's hard to imagine my life without her. However, this thing came as a punch to my stomach and I don't feel I can trust her anymore afterwards. Is there a way to recover or are we done for?

I'm hating her for what she has done to me, but am terrified of losing her and would feel miserable without her. When I told her I'm considering breaking up she said she would do everything in the world to get back with me, that I'm all her life, and that she's ashamed of what she did.

&amp;#x200B;

One additional issue: we have already paid for a travel to japan together later this year and can't get the money back. I want to go with her anyway. Am I being too soft? How should I handle it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cps14k/i_27m_found_pictures_of_my_girlfriend_23f_topless/,relationship_advice,8180,3338,0.0
watermel0nsourpatch,2019-08-13 01:19:49+00:00,[UPDATE] I (26m) had a fwb relationship with my former boss (52f) but now I'm dating her daughter. (27f) What do I do now?,"[Original post](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/coubuk/i_26m_had_a_fwb_relationship_with_my_former_boss/)

First of all, I want to thank everybody who took the time to offer advice regarding my situation (aside from the private messages asking me who was better in bed). 

The general consensus on my original post was to either tell her as soon as possible or find a way for me and Mary to somehow keep it a secret from my gf. At the end of the day, I decided to tell her out of respect.

I talked to Olivia first regarding my past relationship with her mother. As you can imagine she wasn't thrilled about it. She asked me for details about my past relationship and I answered all of them truthfully. She was more sad than mad. 

This is where it gets a little more complicated. Since Olivia's mother doesn't live in the same state as us, it was harder for all of us to have a full conversation about the entire situation, but she eventually talked to us over FaceTime  later that night. Her mother pretty much explained a similar story to our relationship.

Mary wasn't thrilled when I told her I was gonna be dating her daughter either. Frankly she was angrier than Olivia about the entire thing, but said that I wasn't the only one at fault considering that you don't go into detail about family with your fwb.

Olivia expressed how uncomfortable she felt that I had a sexual relationship with her mother and said that she needed space to think about the entire situation. Olivia's mother said that she would take a trip to visit her and have more time to fully explain what happened and make sure she's ok.

So here I am. While she hasn't out right broken up with yet, it is still a possibility. I also have to look forward to have a conversation with my former boss and her daughter in about a week when Olivia's mother gets here. Olivia and I are still in contact (mostly to see if she's ok) but who knows what will happen when her mother gets here.

Ultimately, it's her choice. I told her that if she wanted to break up, it would be 100% understandable, but if she somehow wanted to make it work I would be there for her. She told be that it was admirable that I told her the truth (at least I have that)

Thanks again again reddit, if anything significant happens when her mother gets here, maybe I'll update.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cpluv9/update_i_26m_had_a_fwb_relationship_with_my/,relationship_advice,3409,265,0.0

Effieresurrection,2019-08-12 12:50:53+00:00,[29F] I eavesdropped on my husband [30M] crying and now I don’t know how to bring it up to him,"My husband and I have been together for ten years and married for seven. Right after we got married, I was diagnosed with sarcoma and had to undergo intense and invasive treatment for almost two years before I was officially cancer free. It was an awful time for us both, but it definitely made us stronger as a couple. Unfortunately, the cancer came back late last year, and we’re going through nearly the exact same turmoil again.

My husband and I have been described as a good couple by many because we balance each other out. He’s more of the rock, usually being more logical and blunt while I’m more emotional and imaginative. He grounds me and reminds me to be realistic, and I make him laugh and remind him to have a little fun every now and then. It’s not complete night and day like that, and we’re not caricatures, but that’s the gist of our personalities and dynamic. It’s always been this way. My husband did have to grow up faster than others in a lot of ways, as he was in and out of the foster care system at one point in his childhood and he had to help his mother provide for his younger siblings when he was still a child after his father got arrested. He has a strange relationship and dynamic with his family overall. I wonder if that played a small part in him being the way he is. He has dealt with depression throughout our relationship, even taking antidepressants and attending therapy during a few points. I take anti-anxiety medication and did go to therapy briefly during my cancer treatment, so I encouraged him and was supportive. He would always stop after a few months, saying he didn’t like them and they weren’t working enough to stop trying.

My husband has been incredible during my battles with sarcoma. He is always there to be with me during treatment. He has always been a shoulder to cry on and an ear to vent to during this process, letting me be emotional but also keeping me grounded with the facts. He has been very patient with me and understanding of my needs. He always seemed to have it together, as usual. He would acknowledge the bad situation but just make a plan to get through and execute. I would always tell him that I know it’s hard for him too and he would say that it’s not as hard for him, he’s okay, and he doesn’t want me worrying about me. He said this over and over again, so I would try to respect his wishes and listen.

Saturday night, I was lying in bed when my husband came in and told me that he was going outside to take a phone call and that if I needed anything, to call him. I didn’t think much about it. Eventually, I got up and went into the kitchen to make some tea. I started to walk around the house waiting and heard my husband’s voice from outside near the side of the house say something about his wife several times. I was a little startled, and initially, I just was going to walk away and ignore it. But I got a bad gut feeling, and decided to go check out what was happening. I moved a little closer and stood by the door.

My husband then said something about how he can’t believe this is happening again. He said he feels so powerless watching me deteriorate and cry to him and not be able to do anything about it. He stopped talking for a bit then said something along of the lines of how it takes him a long time to get used to the way my body changes with the treatments and that he misses elements of my pre-cancer appearance, but then he feels awful and shallow for thinking that away because I didn’t bring this onto myself; he said he feels like a shit husband when he feels this way because while he wants his wife to be sexually attractive, I’m worrying if I’m even going to survive. Then he said that goes into his worries about if he’s even doing enough at all and if he’s good enough for someone like me. He then stopped and said he’s sorry. I was confused at first but then I realized that he was crying. Like heavily crying. He said that he doesn’t like to talk about how he’s feelings and cry or show his emotions, and that he’s trying to put on a brave face, but it’s difficult. He went on to say that he’s scared and he really can’t lose me, and he’d probably kill himself if he did because I’m the only constant in his life and the only person who loves him unconditionally. I was really caught off guard, as I’d never vaguely seen or heard my husband talk or cry in any way before. I felt a sudden bout of anxiety building up, so I walked away. I came back about twenty minutes later, and my husband was saying he feels bad about calling when “they’re” so busy and he’s sorry about getting emotional, it’s not normally like him, he got overwhelmed vocalizing everything. I walked away again.

I went back to bed, and was confused and anxious about everything I’d heard. An hour later, my husband came to bed and seemed tired but fine. I immediately asked him if he was okay, and he said he was. I didn’t know what to say to that so I just cuddled him and we went to sleep.

Yesterday morning, my husband wanted me to look for some video on his phone, and while I had it in my hands, I looked at the call history to see who he was speaking to. It turns out it was a emotional crisis hotline. My husband appeared to have called them several times before but only spoke to them that night.

I don’t know what to do. This changes everything. I can’t believe him now, he’s not doing fine and I do need to worry about him. Seriously worry. He’s suffering and doing it in complete silence. I feel strange and deeply anxious when I think about him crying like that. He doesn’t want me to see him vulnerable and upset. He doesn’t want to be open about how he’s feeling. I can only imagine what else he’s thinking, how he’s making himself feel guilty for it, and how many times he’s cried like that in isolation or to strangers on the phone. I don’t know what to do. Yesterday, I wouldn’t leave his side. I asked him how he was doing constantly and gave him a lot of physical attention. I was scared to leave him alone. He kept saying he was fine and to stop worrying. He thought I was being weird, but he enjoyed it and didn’t want me to stop. He left for work now, and I’m just sitting here not sure what to do.

Do I confront him on it? Do I just do my part to try and make this easier for him? Do I suggest that he gets back into therapy? Do I try to open up a dialogue another way? He doesn’t and won’t tell me the truth, just acting like he’s fine all the time. I’m so worried about him.

**tl;dr; My husband of seven years called an emotional crisis hotline and cried speaking to them about him struggling with my sarcoma. This was the first time I’ve ever caught my husband being emotional and expressing how things have been affecting him. He has always said, and still will, say that’s he’s fine and not to worry about him. I don’t know what to do and feel deeply worried and scared about him now.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cpby6o/29f_i_eavesdropped_on_my_husband_30m_crying_and/,relationship_advice,2176,186,0.0
paperweightfairy,2019-08-11 23:52:07+00:00,My family is pressuring me to give my (23/F) sister my (28/F) wedding venue because she needs it more and is pregnant.,"My fiancee and i have been together for 8 years and engaged for 3 .  
I was doing my PhD program and was juggling planing the wedding.y fiancee took much of that work but it was perfect because our dream venue was booked till after my graduation. 
 So what we did is book our dream venue 3 years in advance. it is really a beautiful venue. 
The only slot we got was September of this year.   

My sister got engaged a few months ago to her fiancee. They were planing on having a spring wedding next year . They had no venue as of now but had a few vendors lined up as well as the date set. 
My sister got pregnant . I was really exited to be an aunt.  

Yesterday our parents invited us and our SO\`s to a family bbq, where my sister announced to our extended familie that she is expecting . Everyone was so happy for her and my BIL ( who is a great guy).  
 My Nan asked my sister if the wedding was still on the set date or if they were going to wait, because the baby will still be very very young at the set date. She said no that she hoped to move it to September.NBD. We don't have many put of town guest so they could attend to both weddings no problem. 

Nan was happy and asked sister if she needed help planing such a short notice wedding . My sister then turns around and said  
 ""*Thats what i wanted to talk to you about. I was really really hoping we could kinda like take your venue ? I really can not stress myself too much with planing a wedding while going to maternity classes. And i think it is so beautiful! It would really mean a lot to me*"".it went silent. But everyone was looking at me expecting me to say ""yes of course everything for my little sister !""My BIL looked very uncomfortable and told her that they had talked about this and that it was not okay to put me on the spot . But my sister just said "" Don\`t be like that! My sister wants to do whats best for me so its no big deal right?""  
 I just said "" well it kind of is. I don't know . I have my heart really set on the venue""  
 Que the crying. She stormed off and my Nan told me that i was being selfish because she needed the venue more then I did.  
 I tried to defend myself and my mother said "" you waited 3 years. Would it have killed you to wait a few more moths? When has your sister ever asked you for something?""

A few comments later my fiancee got really mad and we left. My sister called me crying and said that it was unfair that I always get what I want and that i could have done this one thing for her. my dad said it is just a venue and what matters is the person who you are marrying. He is kid of right... but we have been planing for so long . 

My fiancee is furiouse with my family and doenst even want my sister to come and now my family is threatening not to come because I am being selfish and my sister needs it more than me because having a baby is too stressful. 

I don't know if they were going to pay me pack if I said yes o don't know. 

I love my family and I am in the dark with what to do. After posting on AITA I have seen that I am not an ass and that I should keep the venue but I am so unsure of everything.

ibleedheroin,2019-08-11 04:08:00+00:00,HELP!!! MY FRIEND’S BOYFRIEND CALLED HER BY MY NAME DURING SEX!!!!,"Hi, my (20F) friend (21F) is no longer my friend as of like a few hours ago because her boyfriend (21F) called her my name during sex. I’ve been so cooperative and supportive through all of her relationship. I used to date her boyfriend years ago and he treated me like royalty and would take me out everywhere and she was my friend through it all. About a year ago I guess they hit it off and I decided to distance from him (we were still friends) out of respect for her. 
She constantly vents to me about ME and about how he doesn’t treat her half as good as he treated me and she doesn’t understand it. I feel terrible but there is nothing I can do, I don’t understand it either. I’ve always been aware he had a hard time getting over me but I guess a couple hours ago he called her by my name during sex. She blew up my phone about it and somehow took it out on me. Reminder; I haven’t spoken to him outside of when I’m with both of them together in a year!!! 
He has called her by my name before but it’s always been brushed off as a simple mistake. 
She insists we cannot be friends and I tried to apologize even though all of this is out of my control.

jesustunafish,2019-08-11 00:29:22+00:00,My (28F) boyfriend (29M) and his best friend (29F) are going on a week-long vacation. They uninvited me.,"My boyfriend wanted to go on a vacation this summer to his mom's friends' house in Hawaii with me and his two best friends (25M and 29F). We had been planning on this all spring, and at some point, 25M dropped out of the trip, leaving just the three of us.

For context, my boyfriend and I have been going out since November, and it's been serious. We had (and still have) been talking about moving in together and he has said, and I agree, that this is a long-term situation and that we are in it for good.

In early June, once 25M unexpectedly dropped out of the trip, 29F called my boyfriend and told him that now that it was just the three of us, she didn't feel comfortable with me going on the trip, since she didn't know me that well and she didn't want to be a third wheel. She said that if I were to go, she wouldn't go on the trip. Without telling me that this was happening, they changed the plans and made it a trip just the two of them and they changed the location to a beach in Costa Rica.

I was trying to figure out when to ask for time off this summer and hadn't heard news about the plans, so I asked my boyfriend which week in August I should be setting aside for the Hawaii trip. He let me know that, actually, he had talked to his friend and that she didn't want to go if I were going, so he was going to go alone with her to Costa Rica. He said that we could go another week later maybe to Mexico City or something. 

I was upset, and tried to talk with him about how the situation made me feel, especially since this wasn't a case of a separate trip being set up ahead of time -- this was a case of me being invited and then uninvited from a week-long tropical vacation with a girl friend of his who I had never met before. We eventually decided to do a trip together to Copenhagen, which we have both wanted to visit, as some sort of compensation. I also asked to meet her, so that I could feel more comfortable with the trip.

We spent the 4th of July going to see her and her boyfriend in the city where they live, and although it was nice to put a face to a name, it was ultimately a very cold trip and she was not at all welcoming to me. My boyfriend remarked on how unfriendly she was -- to both of us, he thought -- and said that he was surprised that she didn't act warmly to me. I went out of my way to try get to know her and her boyfriend (I'm very outgoing and friendly and usually this would be easy), but it didn't really click, even after several days. They were somewhat cold to each other as well -- they bickered a little bit about their future and his own 3 week trip without her that was scheduled for the same time as their trip (this had been scheduled before ours had).

This had been my effort to feel better about the trip, so I told my boyfriend that I still didn't feel comfortable with things, and that I was feeling insulted by the way that it was handled. I had tried to make things smooth between all of us, and I asked him to please come up with something that could help me feel better about the trip.

On a visit to his family, they asked about the trip and they were all shocked that he would have arranged it this way, and let me know that they would have been furious if they were in my position, which triggered a fight in which I asked him to please help come up with a strategy to make me feel better and more secure about them going together without me. He said that he would never do this kind of thing again, which feels like not much to offer, since this is kind of a once in a lifetime trip to begin with. He kind of offered to not go on the trip, but he had already paid for the tickets and made arrangements and I didn't want to stop their trip and be resented by both him and his best friend.

He asked me to give him ideas of how to make me feel better and wanted me to just tell him what to do and stalled and stalled until it was finally the day of the trip. He bought me a bag of peanut butter cups and I drove the two of them to the airport.

I feel so disregarded and disrespected in this situation. I want to break up with him, but I don't want to burn up something that has otherwise been really good.

TL;DR - I (28F) was uninvited from a vacation with my boyfriend (29M) and his best friend (29F) and I can't get over it. I want advice on how to talk with him about this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/copzwa/my_28f_boyfriend_29m_and_his_best_friend_29f_are/,relationship_advice,11593,3656,0.0

createanaccount56,2019-08-10 13:41:29+00:00,I slept with my roommate within an hour of meeting him - [update],"Hey! A week ago I posted about the fact that I slept with my roommate within an hour of meeting him and I wasn’t sure where to go from there. I was surprised at how much attention it got and thank you for all your comments! I think I was a little too excited and you brought me back down to earth. 

The following few days neither of us were home much so we only saw each other briefly, but we were friendly. On Thursday he knocked on my door in the evening and asked if we could talk. I was so nervous I thought he was gonna say he had a gf lol but he was actually really good, he addressed everything straight away and made me feel so comfortable. He said that he’s sorry he wasn’t around much the days after but I was like no it’s fine I haven’t been home either, I knew it wasn’t on purpose. The vibe between us has never been awkward or anything. 

Anyway he said that he was surprised at himself at what happened but that he really enjoyed it and he got a really good feeling from me, and then he laughed and he was real cute and he said ‘like maybe you have a good soul if that’s a thing’ and put his hand on mine and he was kidding but it was cute. And then he stopped and he said he really wanted to know how I felt and he said ‘sorry I’m not trying to make this a big thing I just want to make sure you’re okay with everything and I want to make sure you feel respected’. I was kind of blown away by how sweet he was about it. I said that I was fine and that I felt the same as him, like shocked but happy but not wanting to make it a huge thing. He said he is really attracted to me but his main concern is making sure we’re both happy living together whatever happens. I said I agreed and then we just carried on talking and it just dissolved into talking about nothing but for about 5 hours. Then it was really late and he said he should go to bed, and he kissed my hand jokingly before he left. 

It was all really sweet and nice and I think that whatever happens, he’s a respectful guy and we’ll communicate and we’ll be mindful of each other. At one point while we were talking he did say ‘sorry we’ve gotten off track, but I felt it was important we didn’t just discuss what happened, I wanted to get to know you a bit. It was a spontaneous thing so I’m glad you agree that we shouldn’t make a big deal out of it, and there’s no point discussing hypotheticals or getting caught up in worry. We’ll be good to each other and treat each other like humans and that’s all we can do. And maybe we’ll have sex again too if you’re also up for that.’ 

God he’s great. Anyway, sorry it’s nothing too exciting but I had a few PM’s asking for an update so I wanted to let you know :) I’m really happy with the outcome and I’m sure we’ll be good friends at the very least.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/coi6jl/i_slept_with_my_roommate_within_an_hour_of/,relationship_advice,15543,893,0.0
IcyWarp,2019-08-09 21:20:30+00:00,UPDATE 1: I'm 99.99% sure my (35m) wife (33f) of 14 years has been cheating on me for years. I'm completely broken and at a loss for what to do....,"(Original story below the dotted line)

I met with my lawyer this morning and she was great. She gave me a lot of confidence that I felt was draining away from me throughout the week as I waited to confront. I also had a good friend that was my rock throughout the week, and I will never be able to thank him enough.

I ended up confronting my wife right after the meeting with the lawyer. I refused to give up any of my evidence. I just said ""I know about the other guy, I need you to talk about it."" I just kept repeating that line while she went through crocodile tears and confusion about what I was talking about. It was SO fucking hard not giving up any of that information. But I knew that I had all the power in that situation. 

In the end she never confessed. I basically moved the conversation from there by saying ""Well, it doesn't matter if you admit to what I already know or not, because the sexting that you did last year was enough to destroy any trust I had in you. And I can no longer live like this,."" From there she just kind of shut down, and became pretty docile, and never brought back up this ""outrageous thing I was falsely accusing her of"".

We pretty quickly moved into business-like details about what to do in the short term. Her dad came over and picked her up and gave me a hug, and said ""let us know if you need anything"". I fucking teared up right at that moment...

I'm not letting my guard down yet, because anything can happen, but I think things may work out for the better for everyone involved.

I cannot thank everyone here on Reddit for your thoughts, jabs, pearls of wisdom, and funny comments. You all gave me some serious wake-up calls and support. I am forever in your debt.

&amp;#x200B;

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm sorry in advance for the length of this...

I (35m) think that my wife (33f) is cheating on me, and has been for many years. We've been together for 14 years, we've been married for almost 10 years, and we have a 5 year old daughter together.

**Incident #1:**

When my wife and I were in college (where we first started dating), we had an incident where she had some really sexually graphic texts from a guy we both knew from school. She even had classes with him. I confronted her about the texts. I definitely didn't handle it well, and basically accused her straight out of the gate as cheating on me without realizing there were some possible outs for her. One of those outs was that she claimed that they were just some pervy texts that she got from this guy out of the blue, and that if I had paid any attention when I was snooping through her phone, that she hadn't actually responded to them. At the time, I conceded that I may have overlooked that possibility, and I had overreacted. She apologized to me for not mentioning to me that some guy was hitting on her like that, and I apologized for overreacting and for snooping. We moved on from there.

**Incident #2:**

Fast forward to this last year. My daughter, wife, and I are at the gas station. I can tell my wife is kind of distant and detached from the interactions my daughter and I are having. I notice she's glued to her phone as well. The gas fill for our car is on the passenger side, and I have the rear passenger door open so I can tickle my daughter while I wait for the car to fill up. I'm really suspicious of what my wife is doing at this point, so I decide that I'm going to take a look over my wife's shoulder from the backseat at what it is she's so caught up in. Turns out she is actively/in-the-moment sexting some guy. Like, words/descriptions/acts that very much seem like they've been doing this a while (texting) and looking back with 20/20 hindsight, I'm fairly certain they had been fucking as well. Also, all the shit she was texting was super graphic shit, stuff that she NEVER used with me either in dirty talk or when we got intimate...and I know this next admission is pathetic and that it shouldn't matter more than anything else, but that fact that she wanted to share in these acts with this man instead of me really fucking hurt. Probably just my pride talking, but it is what it is...

So, fast forward 10 mins when we get home, and I have to suffer through smiling during dinner and the whole nighttime ritual of getting our daughter to bed so as not to cause a scene by blowing up at my wife for what I had seen her texting. Honestly, that was probably a blessing, because it allowed me to collect my thoughts before confronting her. I end up telling my wife what I saw at the gas station, and right off the bat she tries to play dumb, ""What are you talking about?!"" ""Honey, you're making no sense."" I told her to not play dumb with me, and I recited some of the texts that I could remember back to her to prove that I saw what I saw. She then goes on to admit that it was a mistake, but that it was 100% nothing physical, and that she was really sorry. She admitted that the guy was a work colleague.

We talked a lot that night about why she felt she needed to be doing that. A lot of it boiled down to her feeling depressed and lonely. We talked about strategies that we could invoke at home, things that we BOTH could change, to help mend the rift. I guess things felt kind of ""OK"" after that. But it felt like that damage to our trust was already done, and I don't think I've ever really recovered. Even that seemingly small moment of infidelity (assuming that was only texts) was just such a fucking hammer to my heart. Ever since that incident from last year, I've been waking up every day as a lesser version of my former self. My emotions and propensity to feel anything have been severely muted. Interacting with my daughter is about the only thing that gets me back close to a baseline of how I remember my former self...But beyond those precious moments, I'm just a walking, grayed out zombie that puts on a good face for pretty much everything for my day-to-day (going to work, interacting with my wife, etc).

**Most recent incident #3:**

Now fast forward to yesterday. My wife has been gone on a week long ""work"" trip to the East coast (we are West coast). I actually had zero suspicions or justifiable reasons to be worried for this trip, because things had been going pretty well between us, and she hadn't really given off any indicators of suspicious behavior. But, my first clue was that when she arrived at her destination, she ""couldn't get the WiFi working for FaceTime"". And.......this stayed true for the entirety of her trip....First of all, FaceTime works on cellular data just fine (which we have a ridiculous amount of). I explained that to her, without much of a response. Second, I know that if I were gone for a week from MY family, it would be my biggest fucking priority to get FaceTime up and running so that I could see my family's faces every time I called to visit (which would be every single night...which brings me to the next point). She called us in the evening to say goodnight maybe two times out of the seven days that she was gone. Based on previous trips she's had, this was REALLY strange. Normally she is like clockwork touching in with us to share her day and to hear from us about our day (AND, again, always on FaceTime). I asked her about that, and she claimed that she was just too tired in the evenings to get back to us. Also, in the past, if she was away me/home, she would always text me goodnight and that she loved me, even if we had previously chatted moments earlier on FaceTime or via phone call. For this recent trip, she never texted me once.

So, when she got back, my radar was on high alert. Now, I don't feel good about this next part, but when she went to sleep that night, I checked her travel bag to see if my suspicions were correct. Sure enough, to my surprise, she keeps this little red book as a diary in her work bag. I open it up, and there is a date marked 2/9/15. Turns out she'd started writing a poem on that day about our daughter, who had just been born the previous fall. Okay, ""That's really sweet!"" I say to myself, and I start to feel bad about my snooping...Flip to the next page, and there's a new entry. There's no date, but it's written sequentially right after the aforementioned poem so I know that I describe here was an entry that came after our daughter being born. This non-dated entry starts off with her describing how much she longs for this specific person (doesn't give his name). She goes on to talk about how she can't stop thinking about him. Every man she sees reminds her of him. She talks about how she never really intended for things to go very far, but ""that one night that started in the bar, and ended up going upstairs"" just felt too right to not be something meaningful. She goes on to say that she doesn't feel bad about making that decision in regard to how it impacts her ""other life"". She describes how she thinks maybe her ""other life"" was the mistake. This goes on for pages. That entry ends with her making peace with herself that he moved on from her, and it was time for her to forget about him. I am assuming that her ""other life"" our daughter and me.

There was only one more entry after that previous one. I took pictures of it and have typed it out here in it's entirety: ""I'm laughing to myself because I haven't opened this book in over two years and here I am sitting in his bed. In his room at his home. Still feeling angst over so many of the same things. I'll go home after having a week with him and I'll be asking the same questions. Is he ever going to call again after? Was it so stupid to go on this trip? So funny how I thought we'd never speak again and look where I am. We worked together, we talked almost every day, and he was there for me as a friend. Now here I am. And back with questions. Why were we so hot and cold those first couple of days and then just tapered off? Maybe he's doing that moral compass wrestling and after I leave we'll never speak again. This trip was probably a bad idea. But we had a lot of fun. And he did say he'd been looking forward to it. He missed me, he wanted this, I know that. I wish he would just tell me he wants me, just me, and always me. It's like we dance around things because he still wants us to have this thing happening despite the rest of my life and I just don't want to talk about that, to the point that I'm lying, and I hate lying to him. But meanwhile, every tender moment I have with him is so precious I can't believe it. I couldn't imagine we'd actually be snuggling on the couch and there we were.""

I have't slept since reading that last full entry. I haven't confronted her yet, either. It's been almost 48 hours now without sleep, and I'm just an emotional wreck. I just don't know how to handle this situation. I guess I've gotten so good at wearing this zombie mask ever since incident #2 happened, that I've been able to limp through the last couple of days, but it's getting really really hard to be around her...

I hopped online and read some guides on how to deal with infidelity, and most of the guides mentioned therapy. So I'm going to look into that tomorrow. I've been drinking heavily over this last year as well since incident #2. I didn't realize it had gotten so bad until recently. Maybe the therapy can help with that as well.

Just filing for divorce isn't so simple. My wife has a serious seizure disorder that is uncontrolled. She can't tell when they're happening, so that puts herself and possibly others (small kids especially...our daughter to be exact) in danger. I mention this as it pertains to custody. Imagine she's making dinner for her and my daughter one evening, and she has a seizure near the stove top, and the house catches on fire? Well, the only adult in the house is lying on the floor unconscious.  Or what if my daughter has a medical emergency, but then my wife has a seizure due to the stress of the situation? These are very real possibilities, and ones that I fear could happen if she got custody in any way. Some of those examples aren't too far off from other real life incidents we've had over the years due to her seizure disorder. She obviously can't drive. Would this factor into a custody dispute? I mean, our daughter is starting kindergarten in a month, how could my wife transport her?

I don't know what I'm looking for with this whole rambling post...maybe just assurance that her gas-lighting isn't working? That what I've described isn't the workings of an overly paranoid mind? I feel like one minute I'm ready to file for divorce, and then the next I want to try to salvage things for the sake of our daughter, and just to avoid the awful mess that will be made of all three of our lives if we end up separating....

**Here's some other logistical details that seem important for anyone who's managed to read this far:**

* We own a house together (have a mortgage).
* I make about $85k per year. She makes around $60k per year.
* We have significant investments that we have joint control over that were given to us by her Dad. They total somewhere in the range of $600k in stocks and bonds.
* I'm on wonderful terms with her parents and her family in general. I've always been that son-in-law that was there for everyone to lend help no matter how small or large.
* All of her immediate family is right here where we live.
* I have zero family support from my side where we live. My nearest FRIEND is 1-1/2 hours away...

Thanks for any help in advance.

Edit/update: I left work today in order to start lining things up. I have a lawyer lined up for this Friday, that’s the earliest I could find in my area. It’s just a consultation, so I’m not sure what to expect from that one meeting alone?

Thanks everyone for all of your pearls and especially your daggers. I definitely needed some other perspectives. I know it seems unbelievable that I could go this long, but I’ve been seriously gas lit for years now...just conditioned to it. It’s also a character flaw of mine to want to see the best in people...

I’m just so fucking scared of the unexpected...god dammit. I just hope she admits to it.

Is there any way she can twist this around on me? Like invasion of privacy?

Sorry for not replying to anything in the previous thread. 

Wednesday evening Rachel and I sat down to talk about things. I put forward that we both need to make amends with Beth, Rachel for bullying her and me for ending my friendship with her when she needed me the most. Rachel refused straight away. She said the stuff that went on between her and Beth was ''just kid stuff'' and ''things all girls do''. She said that if Beth couldn't take a joke then that wasn't her problem. She asked if I expected her to apologise to everyone her and her girls had a problem with. I then asked if she is still acting this way at work, and she pointed out that as a high up doctor, she at time needs to ''lay down the law'' to those working under her, and then proceeded to get at me and ask if I expected her to apologise to them too. 

I asked if Rachel had any regrets at all about how she treated Beth, and she said it just a bit of fun and there was nothing to regret. I asked if she regretted lying to me about the fact that she continued to bully Beth, and she answered saying that if I'd known what she was doing, I'd never have agreed to go out with her. ''You want me to apologise for starting this relationship?'' I was shocked and confused. I love Rachel to bits I truly do, but I feel like I'm suddenly living with a completely different person. My Rachel is bubbly, funny and passionate about her career. She isn't someone who sees nothing wrong with the fact that she made someone's life a living hell. 

I said we need time to work through this, possibly through therapy, and should put the engagement on the back seat for the moment. We are also trying for a baby, and I said that we should maybe hold off until we are in a better place. Rachel started to cry and I went out to give her some space. 

Rachel rarely drinks due to her work, and I'm not a big drinker either, but we do have some booze in the house for gatherings and things like that. When I got back I found Rachel absolutely wasted drunk. Because she rarely drinks she goes crazy when she's drunk. This time around it seemed like she turned back into her school self. She started saying I should be grateful that she told the lies she did, because otherwise I'd have ended up with ''ugly Beth'' (her exact words). She then started screaming at me that ''how could you let that c\*nt get between us?'' and then broke down sobbing and hugging me. 

Rachel was so drunk she barely knew what she was doing. I helped her onto the sofa where she passed out fairly soon, and she slept there until Thursday morning. She was extremely hungover, and would never risk her career by going into work with alcohol in her system, so she called in sick. I went to work, and when I got home she was still on the sofa and was sobbing quietly. 

After Rachel's drunk behaviour therapy is definitely the way forward. I'm looking into it right now and Rachel has reluctantly agreed, though she's insisted she doesn't need it. I think apologising to Beth is a bit of a stretch at this point, but maybe something for the future?

TLDR: My fiancee and me had a long talk about the issues. She still does not think she did anything wrong. She had a drunk rant at me afterwards so I'm definitely looking into couple's therapy now. The wedding and baby plans are on hold for the moment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/co2toj/update_should_i_33m_break_off_my_engagement_to_my/,relationship_advice,1182,408,0.0
throwawayqqwwe,2019-08-09 10:43:10+00:00,I [M 26] am getting married soon. Need advice on keeping stalker[F 25] away,"Hello,

Using throwaway because family knows my username.

&amp;#x200B;

So back in 2017 I had met a girl on Tinder. We texted for two months before we met. We had told each other we weren't looking for serious relationships (which is kinda why I agreed to meet her in the first place - I was not in a frame of mind to get into a relationship.). Hooked up the first time we met. Following day she told me she was in love with me and asked if we could date, to which I said no. 

Long drawn fights, a lot of gaslighting, manipulation, crying followed in the subsequent weeks over texts (which I documented) and calls (which I recorded). She told me she was depressed, suffered child abuse, was sexually assaulted and that's the source of her rage. She started threatening me with suicide. I caved and continued to talk to her on a condition that she remains platonic. We did not meet in person, but she sent me &gt; 50 texts daily and would call every alternate day. I played along, thinking she will lose interest soon but that did not happen. She asked three more times if we could get into a relationship and three times I said no. Of course, the logical inconsistency with her saying she will keep it platonic and asking for a relationship went unnoticed because I was just too chicken, too scared, to say anything, thinking she might hurt herself.

After a while this started to affect me and work started to suffer. I tried to distance myself from her. After about 4 months after meeting her, she asked me to meet her again as a birthday present. I refused. She lashed out at me. I told her the ""friendship"" was not going to work this was and I changed my phone number, deleted all my social media and alerted friends. She then contacted a handful of my friends (who she probably figured out from social media), colleagues and started a smear campaign. She also made suicide threats, but did not receive any detectable response. She then showed up at my workplace, and a colleague sent her back telling her that I have quit. I passed on a message through one of the colleagues she called, saying I want no further contact. She keeps listening to some music I upload  - spends hours at times - which is how I know she hasn't completely forgotten me yet. However, last she tried to contact me directly was over a year ago.  

I subsequently found out I am not the first person she did this to. One of the previous victims even works for the same employer as I! There have been at least 4 guys she has done the same thing to.

\[Clearly I am skipping details, but I don't believe these are important\]

I am a guy in India, so there is no provision for me to complain against her - the law thinks Indian men cannot get stalked and harassed. So legal action is not possible. She lives in the same city.

I met a wonderful person by end of 2018 and we got engaged recently. We are getting married soon. What all precautions should I be taking?

yinyangyawn,2019-08-09 05:49:04+00:00,My husband (31 M) and I (29 F) are having some seriously weird issues (UPDATE),"Hey guys, update to my last post.

I've done like three TLDRs, so here's quick one. My husband has created something called a tulpa, and it for the last month has actively participated in our life at home together. It joins in on meals, has long conversations with my husband, and fucks me. It doesn't even fucking exist, yet I'm paranoid as shit because my husband is in league with this small church-like organization with some major juju, and there's this shaman who has invited us on a spiritual retreat to Spokane. Okay, I'll just link the post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/cnfraj/my\_husband\_31\_m\_and\_i\_29\_f\_are\_having\_some/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cnfraj/my_husband_31_m_and_i_29_f_are_having_some/) 

Anyways, I wanted to write a little update post because I had a serious chat with both my husband and my mother-in-law. My mother-in-law decided to drop the bomb on me that my husband was in therapy as a child because of attachment issues from- I kid you not- the death of a childhood friend named Adam who drowned when my husband and him were both eight. So, I don't know if that has anything to do with imaginary friend Adam, but that's that. I knew that a friend of his drowned as a child (he's told me that story in passing before) but I didn't know the child was named Adam, not that I would have connected it to his imaginary friend in the first place had I. She's driving over tomorrow to set things straight, and maybe even get him into an institution or at least with a therapist. I think seeing his mother will knock some sense into him for sure. 

The shaman did come over a few hours ago, and definitely gave him a piece of my mind (not that he cared). He kinda left, and hubby got a bit angry at me for telling the guy that A, we're not going to Spokane tomorrow, and B, to get out of my husband's life. I dragged my husband over to the living room, chewed him out a bit (he yelled too), and then he started to cry and told me he felt ""incomplete"" and that he consulted this church after meeting the shaman at the school he works for. I told him to reflect on our marriage, and left him alone, though I assured him that I'm still there for him. At some point he came out of the room and gave me a kinda half-hearted little hug, and told me that Spokane would be great for our marriage. As if it needed any fixing in the first place. So, completely busted, I'm now updating you guys, and really wondering whether I should GTFO or wait until my mother-in-law gets here. I honestly want to do the latter because I don't believe this church is dangerous per se, but I would be ready to do the former if things get bad. He isn't acting violent or anything, and surprisingly he hasn't mentioned Adam a single time today. Maybe I just haven't talked to him enough today.

WTF. If I ever saw my marriage collapsing, I never in a hundred years would have thought it would like this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cny2x4/my_husband_31_m_and_i_29_f_are_having_some/,relationship_advice,1073,390,0.0
ThrowawayPlzhlp763,2019-08-08 20:39:44+00:00,UPDATE: My [36M] fiancé [38F] wanted separate finances...,"Link to the previous thread:

[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cimtl4/my_36m_fianc%C3%A9_38f_wanted_split_finances_now_she/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

So a lot has happened in a short span of time. Frankly my head is spinning. I’ll do my best to provide a comprehensive recap.

I got home the day I posted the last thread and I was prepared to confront her. Unfortunately she and the kids weren’t home when we arrived. My brother and I started talking and they returned while we were on the phone. I left the house to finish the call and she called 15 times while I was outside. I ignored her calls. 

I got back inside and the fireworks began. We got into a verbally heated argument but I refused to back down. She was adamant that I was disrespecting her by asking her to contribute to the house and that I wasn’t a real man. She maintained her innocence throughout and continued trying to gaslight me. I wasn’t having any of it and I think she realized she had lost her grip over me. 

She left the room, effectively ending the discussion. She slept in her daughters room. Around 11 am the next day she emerged from her daughters room, got her bathing suit and some beach items and took her kids out again without inviting my daughter, who cried as they left, begging to join them. 

This is where things got wild.  She and her kids never returned that day (Sunday). I assume they slept at the friends house who invited them over. I went to work Monday morning and dropped my daughter at camp per usual. I picked her up after work and we returned to the house. Literally all of their belongings were gone. She took about half the furniture in the house.  And a ton of things that were mine she has since refused to return. I was floored...

There was no communication, no indication that she was leaving, nothing. I texted her and she said she wanted time and space to think about things and that I needed to respect that. She said she needed to consider if she could be with someone who didn’t want to fully support her and her kids...

I asked her for my $30k engagement ring back and she claimed she threw it in a lake!  I don’t believe it for a second.  She likely pawned it or intends to shortly. After consulting my lawyer and family I called the police to report what happened and file a report for my missing belongings. 

The police have informed me that because she lived here for over a year and her license uses this address that the household belongings are as much hers as they are mine. My attorney disagrees and we are filing a civil suit to sue her.  The ring is a separate matter. As I understand it, that’s a conditional gift in Texas and if we don’t marry it must be returned assuming I can prove her to be at fault for the end of the relationship. Even if I don’t win it will be a small victory forcing her to retain counsel and spend some money. 

Obviously the relationship is over. Not sure if she realizes that but I have listed the house since it’s way too big for me and found a new place in the city. We move next Friday.  I plan to live there while I get in therapy and fix my head. I don’t think this girl ever loved me. I was just a bank account and the minute I cut off access to my funds she literally LEFT. I’ve never felt so worthless and unloved.  I’m not sure how to recover.  Or trust another woman frankly. I thought she was my soulmate. I love her and am still in love with her. That’s how fucked my head is right now.  I just hope it heals with time.

Thank you to everyone that has commented or reached out after my last two posts. I first want to say that I am doing okay, even after what I am going to say in this post, I'm okay. I am going to attempt to make this as brief as possible because I can't give this situation any more of my heart or energy. But it will most likely be long. *Here we go*.

I am all but moved out of the apartment, my things going into storage because I am still staying in my friend's home for the time being. This break up has proved to be financially burdensome but somehow money has managed to be the least stressful part of this ordeal. It turns out that I never knew the man I shared my life with for the past 3 years. My ex and I ended up having a conversation on the last day of us moving out. He seemed apologetic and sad and asked if we could talk. He said that he loves me, that he will always love me and he wants us to stay together. He apologized and said he would stop bullshitting, no more lies. I didn't feel the need to have a conversation but I did have just one question. I asked him ""why?""

I never could have imagined in a million years that he would tell me that the reason he cheated was because I miscarried 6 months ago. Especially because of how supportive and loving he was during that period in our lives, I felt blindsided and betrayed. He said that he knows that it was not my fault, that there was nothing I could have done differently but it had caused him to resent me. That he was angry. He said he knew how this sounded which is why he never talked to me about it. He didn't want to hurt me - ha. I of course at this point felt sick. My heart hurt in ways I never knew possible. Even the death of my father did not hurt in ways his words and actions were hurting me. Here is this man that I have unconditionally loved and supported for over three years. I was his biggest cheerleader in life, encouraged him to be his own person and to still live his own life. I wanted him to be happy. We never went to bed mad at each other, we never called each other names, we never not kissed each other goodnight or goodbye in the morning. Our relationship *seemed*great and yet he's telling me for the last six months he has resented me, borderline hated me at times.

He admitted to downloading Tinder and chatting with women over the last six months. He swore that it never became sexual up until the night he cheated and that was only because they had history. I have no clue if that is true. Honestly, I don't care whether or not it is. The cheating is minimal compared to the words he just spoke. We were both crying and I handed him my keys for him to turn in. I gave him a hug and told him that he needs therapy and that I never want to speak to or see him again. I have a therapy appointment next week and will start to work on healing.

I am looking at potentially getting a loan so I can get out of anything left that we have shared. I also want to look into moving to a different city but that is still up in the air. I have changed my phone number and blocked him everywhere. There was never a chance of him and I getting back together and this just solidifies my decision. This will most likely be my last post on the subject but I once again thank each and every one of you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cnqw7o/final_update_boyfriend_of_3_years_just_admitted/,relationship_advice,1978,210,0.0
chocolatescrambled,2019-08-08 19:11:08+00:00,LAST UPDATE my ex girlfriend spent the night at a random guys house and FaceTimed me in the morning eating breakfast with him in bed,"Probably the last update since I’m not changing my mind and that’s it. A ton of people are asking so sorry for those who think I’m going on too much about it 

She took an early flight and is back in New York. Of course all her friends were texting me saying she’s innocent and didn’t do anything and I better forgive her and not break her heart “or else” (as if these 5’ girls are gonna attack me or something. fr bitch.. cmon. Am I the only who hates when girls say shit like this lol) and that I’m overreacting. And she came to my fucking house and of course, my mom let her in and I told her i didn’t wanna see her and she wasn’t listening and just cried to my mom saying I broke up with her for no reason and making me seem like the bad guy so I told my mom that she spent the night at a random guys house and was in his bed in the morning. Yeah that was embarrassing to tell my mom our business and it got messy but she was acting so innocent and she’s the one who came crying and shit all dramatic. Anyway my mom was just trying to get her to calm down but I left bc I hate bullshit like that 

Currently at Panera bread eating a Tom moz panini and half lemonade half green tea. waiting for my brother to text me that she left our house. He told me she is still crying to my mom and saying she didn’t do anything. Yeah unfortunately I am done with her, that’s it, no more chances. I just wanna go home wtf. 

anyway thanks for everyone’s advice. You guys are the best and i appreciate all the messages I got. I will not waste anymore time on her

Tbh I am a very passionate guy, I would never cheat on a girl or mistreat her. When I make a girl my girlfriend, like another comment said, that means she’s a potential wife. I don’t take that shit lightly. I love intensely and with all my heart, as cheesy as it sounds. And I’m sure a girl is out there who wants a guy who is obsessed with the relationship like I am lol. If I love a girl, I am all hers but I refuse to be disrespected and stepped on like what the fuck. Spending the night at some random Jersey Shore Pauly D lookin ass guy’s bed and then crying to my mf MOTHER that I dumped her for no reason?? That shit was embarrassing, my fucking dog got in the middle and was staring like “wtf some shit is going on, I have to see this.” Got damn. First of all I would never even go on a vacation without my girlfriend, what’s the point. that shit is boring. Drinking and dancing at a club and then going to an empty hotel room alone while everyone else is hooking up , how the fuck is that even fun, I’d need my girl there to have some fun with. That’s like torture, not a vacation.

Married for 10 years. I'm really drunk, so pardon me for this gibberish. 

My wife's best friend Megan and I work for the same company( different departments ). So yesterday, she wanted to meet me after work and told me that she had to tell me something. So I met her and she immediately broke down and started crying. I tried to console her and asked if something was wrong and she told me that my wife and her husband were having an affair. 

According to her, this affair has been going on for years and she also told me that her husband was my daughter's biological father. She confronted her husband and he didn't deny anything. 

And when I confronted my wife, she tried to deny everything but when I told her that Megan told me about it, she broke down and started crying. 

I really don't know what to do. I mean, everything was a lie right? My little girl Taylor is not mine and my wife blatantly faked everything for years. What do I live for now?

I_Prefer_Boxers,2019-08-08 12:46:13+00:00,I [28f] left in the middle of vacation with my bf [46m] because of his kids. I am feeling guilty. Did I do the right thing?,"We have been dating for 9 months. His daughter is 18 and his son is 15. My bf has been split from their mother for 2.5 years and just settled everything. The kids took the divorce very hard. 

We decided to plan a vacation and take the kids with us for a full week. I don’t have any kids and have never been in a relationship with someone who has kids. I had only spent time with the kids for a night or so before. I figured I could adapt and learn to enjoy my time with them. 

The week started out great. We enjoyed our time, lots of laughing and exploring. After a couple days the kids start relaxing and really opening up. I started to notice the typical kid things like gossip, loud music, being excited, wanting to do everything and see everything. But eventually they started to become rude and obnoxious to other people and sometimes to us. I especially noticed this when we would go out for lunch or dinner and how rude they were to wait staff. They also kept making racial comments and continued dropping the “n” word which I was not cool with. My bf told them to knock it off but eventually gave up.  A couple times his son yelled out the window at people for being “idiots” and even chewed out a woman for almost hitting our car. I understand that situation can be scary but there was a better way of dealing with it. I was so embarrassed.

It got to a point where I was not enjoying my time and my bf turned into a completely different person. There were certain times he snapped on me for no reason and when confronted denied it even occurred. My bf and I had been in a fight all day after he snapped on me, typically we just ignore each other until we cool down. I had spoken to him later in the day of maybe catching a flight home early. He must have told the kids and at one point in the car they started swearing and screaming that I had disrespected their father. I was shocked. I tried to explain that they didn’t understand the situation and that we were working through something, but they continued. Eventually my bf told them to knock it off. I found it so inappropriate. 

Eventually this was my tipping point and I decided to catch a flight home. My bf was heart broken.

I feel like I made a mistake as I am making my way home. He begged me to stay. I told him I didn’t like the way he spoke to me in certain situations and there was times I brought up some concerns with his children but he would not even hear me out. He is very protective of them and gets mad at me if I say anything regarding them, even if simple concerns. I told him I think he is blind to their behaviour. I know he feels guilty about the divorce, but they need boundaries. He turns into mush whenever they are around, and many times has said whatever his daughter says goes. 

I also confessed to him before I left about being disappointed on how he had handled a situation earlier with them in the month. Their family went up to my family’s cottage. They did pay but only 1/3 of the price, which was dirt cheap for a week. When they left the kids had made a huge mess in our guest cottage where they stayed, to the point where my family had to replace some things because of the damage. They also left food in the bed sheets and my dad found vaping stuff in the cupboards. I was so embarrassed especially since I asked him to triple check where the kids were sleeping to make sure it was clean. (We get mice if food is left out). He sent them a text and they said sorry to him over text and that was it. Am I wrong for expecting them to apologize to me ? 


I love my bf and I can’t imagine life without him, but I don’t enjoy being around his kids. I know that makes me a horrible person. I don’t want him to pick between us and I love seeing him happy when he is around them. The divorce has been hard on him and I’m glad he can see a future with them soon. I just didn’t feel like I fit. I understand it’s early but I’m looking into the future and can’t imagine even owning a home with my bf and having them live there. 

Did I make the right choice by leaving ? How do I even navigate through our future ? Maybe there isn’t one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cnl9no/i_28f_left_in_the_middle_of_vacation_with_my_bf/,relationship_advice,5575,1247,0.0

She doesn't want her kids to get my families genetics. She thinks we're less fortunate in the looks/attractiveness department than hers and that it'll spoil her genetics.

She also called me about 100 times for our “morning FaceTime call” and I declined her. I wanted to tell her that I had a girl in my bed and we’re eating pancakes but that’s petty af so I didn’t

creepy_crepe,2019-08-06 13:45:23+00:00,Packing up and leaving the state after parent broke into the house while I was in it...,"I don’t know what I’m looking for here, I guess advice or validation. I’ve always been the more sensitive family member and my mom would take her anger out on me as a kid when she was having a bad day, which was a lot. Mostly yelling or name calling, after which they’d pretend that nothing ever happened and make me feel like I’m crazy and dramatic. My parents would have really volatile fights with eachother too. This gave me constant anxiety.

I became independent, got a good job and grew up. My mom tried to show that she had changed, but never apologized. I visit her every other week for dinner or whatever to catch up, thinking things had changed. 

They built a new house on their land and I agreed to live there a couple weeks as I had just purchased a new house out of state but needed to finish up work here. My partner left a couple days ago to visit his family, leaving me here alone for a few days. You can guess where this is going.

I end up getting yelled at over disinfecting an iPad screen (of all things...I do this for work). I learned to walk away from the tantrums without giving an ounce of attention. So I go to the house to make some calls and get some space. 

Long story short, over the next 24 hours my parent was yelling through the windows of the house (while I’m on work calls), pushing in doors and threatening to use the spare key to come in. Mind you I’ve been totally polite and receptive to texts, I just expect privacy when I’m working at home. Eventually parent used the spare key and just stood hovering outside of my bedroom door while I was on a call. I had to confront the situation and got yelled at more. She refused to leave for a long while.

After this I’m shaking. This person has made me feel afraid my entire childhood with empty threats. I make some calls and everyone agrees it’s time to leave, now. Within 3 hours my partner is here. Within 6 hours were packed up and in 2 hours we will be on the road. It’s a 10 hour drive with 2 cats...wish me luck.

I know they will confront us as we’re leaving. I hope I’m doing the right thing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cmqrsk/packing_up_and_leaving_the_state_after_parent/,relationship_advice,2496,119,0.0

I then called her and told her my girlfriend found a used condom wrapper in my apartment and believes I cheated on her, when in fact I know I didn't. I asked if her if she knew why I had a used condom wrapper that didn't belong to me in my apartment after she had cleaned it.

She asked me how me and my girlfriend were during and I said she's most likely going dump me because I look guilty as sin. 

She started crying and confessed. She's been seeing someone in the neighborhood and a few months ago they've been routinely having sex in my apartment when she cleans.

EnvironmentalEase0,2019-08-05 21:00:31+00:00,My wife (25f) let her idiot friend (28f) negligently discharge one of my (30m)rifles. I’m angry with both of them and my wife is acting like I’m being unreasonable. Advice?,"Obviously, I keep some guns. Just for hunting and sport shooting.

I’ve got four rifles right now and I keep them locked in a safe in my barn.

Before we got together two years ago, my wife had never really been around guns and at first wasn’t too interested. After some time (and me explaining my philosophy on why I like to hunt), she has started to express an interest in learning to hunt for herself.

So over the last couple months I have been showing her how to handle and shoot a hunting rifle. Taking her to the range, doing some dry practice at home, etc. She’s been learning a lot and doing a great job. And she has been very careful to follow proper safety on her firearms which makes me a little madder about the situation this morning.

She had a friend come over this morning. I already don’t have a high opinion of this friend. I think she is kind of an idiot, but she’s also got that unfortunate personality trait where she tends to be way overconfident and think she knows everything about any given subject. I’ve gotten into a few mild arguments with her over it. But she’s at least harmless so I never worried about her too much.

So this friend came over today. I figured the ladies would just chill out or something and I kinda found my way outside to work on my car, mostly so I didn’t get sucked into a conversation with the friend.

At some point I saw them leave the house and head to the barn, but I didn’t think much of it. Half an hour later I heard a gunshot from inside the barn.

I freaked a little and ran into the barn. I found my wife and her friend, her friend holding one of my rifles, and they were both looking at me like they realized they really messed up.

In the immediate moment, after I saw the ladies were okay, I took my rifle out of friends hands and was mostly concerned with where the round had gone, luckily it just landed in the dirt a few yards away.

So with all that sorted, I wound up heading back inside and took my rifle back inside and got it put back away, and then with the immediate concern gone, I started to get mad.

I’m not necessarily proud of the language I used, but I’ll try and portray it accurately since I am asking you alls opinions.

I asked the girls “Why. The. *Fuck*. Was one of my guns pulled out?”

Friend didn’t say anything at all, but my wife started explaining that friends husband wants to take her hunting sometime, so she was showing her a little bit about how to use a rifle.

So then I asked why it was loaded. I *know* I clear my guns before they go back in the safe, so I know there wasn’t a round in there. And I keep my ammo in a whole different safe then the guns, which incidentally, was opened.

Wife explained again she was showing friend how to load it. Friend loaded it successfully, obviously, looked down the barrel, and “accidentally” pulled the trigger, according to my wife.

They were making a “Woops!” Face that kind ignorant upset me more. And it didn’t help matters when my wife’s friend started telling me that “every rifle she is used to” has a different kind of safety mechanism and-I don’t know, I stopped listening to her there and told her it was probably best that she leave.

I locked up my guns and ammo, collected the keys from my wife and went back outside for a smoke. Friend takes off shortly after that and my wife approaches me.

She approached me and just said “Sorry”. I was still mad so I told her something like “Yeah...’sorry’ isn’t quite going to cut it here.”

And then I asked her what she was thinking, because she *knows* better than this. I know she knows better because I taught her!

I told her she made a string of very bad decisions that started with opening the gun safe, handing one of my rifles to someone who very obviously doesn’t know how to handle it, then opening the ammo safe, *letting her load a fucking round* and then letting her swing it around!”

My wife started getting defensive. She told me I’ve taken her shooting on our property before. The effect was the same here, right.

I told her, yeah, we’ve gone and shot empty bottles and stuff, but we got out into the woods and do it in front of a hill that we know works as a backstop. We *dont* just load a gun and fire wherever!”

Wife told me that she *did* make sure her friend pointed in a safe direction at least, meaning out the door towards the ground. And I got a little mad again and said something along the lines of “Yeah, and it’s a good fucking thing you did or else one of us would probably be in a police car by now!”

My wife finally said it was just an accident and I didn’t have to make such a deal over it, I told her that this was an accident that *would* have killed someone if her luck had been slightly less.

She walked away and as she did I said something to her like “Do not go in the gun safe again without asking me.” She got re-pissed at that and asked why I’m treating her like I’m her “dad”. I told her that those guns are registered to me and I don’t want to go to jail if she hands it to someone who doesn’t need to have it.

And thats where we’ve been all day. We’re kind of just avoiding each other. That sort of argument is very uncharacteristic of my wife. She is generally a very responsible and level-headed woman and she is also pretty good about taking responsibility when she makes a mistake. This is the only real shouting-argument we’ve had and it really bothers me that she’s throwing blame on me instead of recognizing how serious this mistake was.

Like if she had at least admitted that she made a serious mistake I probably would not have added that bit about staying out of my gun safe.

I *do* for myself feel bad for cussing at her, because I never do that. And what she said about me acting like her dad hit a nerve to. So I’ll probably apologize for the cussing here once I’m a little less angry.

So what should I do to handle this now? First big argument, and my wife seems to want to downplay how big of a deal this is. I don’t want to talk down to her, but I do, really want her to acknowledge what a bad decision(s) she made or I’m not sure I’ll be able to trust her handling one of my guns again. There is also the matter of her friend. Like I said, my wife is normally a very responsible and mature woman, but when she gets around her friend it’s like she gets......stupider, for lack of a better term. That is something that has bothered me about her friend before, but I’ve never said anything because it wasn’t that big of a deal before.

How should I approach this? How do I get my wife to stop avoiding me right now for one, and how can I get her to recognize the seriousness here without her feeling like I’m trying to be her dad?

**TL;DR**: My wife pulled out one of my rifles without my permission, gave it to her friend, who then fired it negligently. I’m super pissed, wife is pissed that I’m pissed, and it’s all a mess now.

Obvnotmeatall,2019-08-05 16:47:49+00:00,My (43M) wife(41F) just hit me in anger and proceeded to kick a hole in the door I hid behind. What should I do?,"I don't know where to start.

My wife has an anger issue. If something goes wrong, I disagree with her, I try to explain myself, I have a criticism, or any plans changes without her control, she gets angry. Sometimes a little, sometimes a lot. If I don't give in, it always gets worse. When it gets bad, it has a significan effect on my emotional wellbeing - Due to the stress I lose sleep, feel bad, get headaches and my stomach acts up. 

At the moment, I tend to just not disagree with her as much as I can, and not push any issue. This is partially effective, but not that much, since she tends to be vague, and if I interpret her words wrong (or ask for clarification) she gets angry. 

Today we were driving home from some shopping, and she asked me what I talked about with my therapist. I was still processing that conversation, and I really didn't want to talk about it with her, so I told her that. She insisted that she wanted to talk about it, she had a right to know. I refused. So she got angrier and angrier.

During the fight we came home, and she kept getting angrier, and then she hit me multiple times, losing all control. She didn't hurt me, but it scared me a lot. I (as gently as I could) took hold of her arms, moved her to arms length away from me, and hid in the nearest room, blocking the door. She couldn't get in, (I'm twice her size so the door wasn't opening), but she ranted and raged for a while, kicking and punching the door and yelling at me.

When she cooled down a little I made her promise not to hit me again and we yelled at eachother for a while. That was the first time I raised my voice that day.

While we eventually both calmed down and came to a kinda decision about what to do, I'm still very shaken up and don't know what to do. I get the feeling she doesn't take what happened seriously - when we brought it up, she first told me how angry I made her, and eventually said sorry, but later claimed that saying sorry made it all okay, and I shouldn't overstate how much it affects me.

I love her a lot, but this behavior scares the life out of me. I was inches away from calling the police on her, but I didn't, because there is a fair chance I'm the one that would end up in jail, and I didn't want to escalate it any further.

What if it happens again and I lose my temper and hit back?

Part of me tells me to man up, and just suck it up because I'm a big strong man. But I can't. 

She's staying at a friend's house tonight. Tomorrow at four we continue the conversation.

I work as an Animator and he never really talks about it and the rare times he does he never has anything nice to say about it. When I was in uni studying animation he always made fun of how I would never get a job either and made fun of me. I was fine with it back then but after 5 years it has honestly made me resent him. Animation is a large part of my life that he just ignores.

He wont even watch an animated show or movie with him. An example is when into the spiderverse came out. We both love super hero films but he refused to even give it a chance because it was an animation so I had to go alone. 

A recent thing we have discussed which I think has been the tipping point for me, is that I should become a SAHM while he works, nothing against SAHMs but I am not willing to put a job I am so passionate about and have worked so hard for aside so that I can look after a child. TBH I dont even know how he thought that was a reasonable idea considering he has never been able to hold down  job since I met him.

Giocatore45,2019-08-04 11:52:52+00:00,[UPDATE] Would I (23M) be a jerk for ditching a girl (26F) for no sex after 3 months?,"Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cl7kxl/would_i_23m_be_a_jerk_for_ditching_a_girl_26f/?st=JYWVX4S6&amp;sh=bd9714c5

So I told the girl from the original post that we should be friends instead of a romantic couple. I did it at a bar on a night where we had a date planned. She didn’t see it coming and was dissappointed mainly. She didn’t really agree with me but she accepted it.

We weren’t in an official relationship but after seeing eachother weekly for months,  it did feel like a breakup. After the conversation ended we ate and she admitted that she felt bad about being friendzoned. We (stupidly) strolled through the city as ‘friends’ instead of both going home. It kind of felt like nothing had changed. We talked a bit and eventually kissed. We were both confused at this point.

We kept walking and right before we were going to leave she asked to have a final date for closure. I said no and told her that I thought we should have the conversation now if anything was still bothering her.

Well... turns out she never told me she was a virgin. I knew she values sex as a very valuable thing which she is not going to give up for anybody but I didn’t know it was to the point where she never did it before. Her previous relationship ended because the guy couldn’t handle celibacy for over two years. I then admitted that I couldn’t wait for that long either.

We talked and wished eachother the best. We agreed to stay friends. 

I gained a very awesome friend and dodged continuing to date someone who I am incompatible with. Thanks for the advice reddit!",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/clvhya/update_would_i_23m_be_a_jerk_for_ditching_a_girl/,relationship_advice,3050,281,0.0

I have no idea if anyone cares about the outcome of this situation but it is almost cathartic to write it all down so i'm doing it anyway. I finally have a calm moment to sit at my computer and compose a logical thought.

Upon me returning home he and I had very little communication at my request. I had originally planned to spend the week at my friend's home to process this life altering event but early this afternoon he texted me telling me he was home. Now, some people might think that shows a lot of effort on his part, that he's remorseful and rather than enjoy his vacation he flew home to talk. Perhaps I would feel that way too except I asked for space. I told him that if he had ever loved me he would give me time alone. He couldn't even give me that.

I agreed to meet with him at our apartment to talk. I only wanted to talk about and sort out all the details. Our finances, home, etc. We agreed on paying to break our lease, to stay on the insurance policy and phone plan together for now but unenroll auto pay so we're able to make our payments separately. I also asked for him to reimburse me for what I paid towards the vacation from hell. I wanted to wrap things up enough in that moment to where I would have to see and speak to him as little as possible. I know that some communication in the future will be inevitable but right now I can't deal with it. I told him he can stay in our apartment until we have to leave. I packed some more of my things and left.

I don't know if he looked upset or if he was crying. I honestly barely heard anything he had to say because I was so enraged at the person in front of me, a complete stranger. I don't know if the past 3 years were all a lie, I don't know if he has cheated before or that he would cheat on me again. All I am sure of is that he was capable of lying and cheating now. I refuse to be another cautionary tale of a woman who loved someone more than herself so she forgave a cheater only to be cheated on again.

createanaccount56,2019-08-02 17:01:19+00:00,I (24F) met my new flatmate (26M) yesterday and we had sex within an hour of meeting. Don’t know what to do,"Hi. Please don’t judge me!

I’m not the kind of girl that usually does this. I’ve only slept with 5 people, all relationships. I’ve never even had a one night stand.

I live in a 4 bed house, and we had a room spare. Yesterday the new flatmate moved in. I wasn’t in when he arrived but when I got back from work, he was in the kitchen making food. The second that I walked in, I don’t know how or why or what happened but the sexual tension was just ridiculous. Even just from seeing the back of his head I felt something weird.

We spoke for a few minutes, introduced ourselves etc. But it felt like we were really comfortable with each other already and we were getting along so well. There’s no point me going into all the details I am literally just blown away by what happened and I guess typing it is helping me come to terms with it. There’s so much sexual tension between us that I want to brag about it haha.

So we started talking about a new tv series and I invited him to watch it in my room, as I’d just put on the next episode. He accepted, and soon were stoned in bed watching tv and then we just made eye contact at like an awkward sex scene and then suddenly we’re kissing.

It was crazy, I wasn’t even thinking, I wasn’t making sense of anything around me, I just wanted to have sex with him. He’s sooo ridiculously like my type but extra somehow. I wish I could explain it. Literally if anyone can tell me what sexual tension is scientifically, ELI5, pleaseeee.

Anyway, we had sex for maybe half an hour and then we heard another flatmate come home and my mum called me, so he just went to his room. I saw him a couple hours later going to the bathroom and he just winked at me and said ‘can’t believe we just did that’ and I just said ‘yeah crazy...’ 

Wtf do I do now

I fancy him so much

The sex was great

But he’s my flatmate and it’s all awkward and weird 

And I stalked his Instagram and he doesn’t upload regularly but it looks like he had a girlfriend pretty recently. I can only assume (well pray) that they are in fact broken up.

Lord how do I survive in this house, is it safe to keep having sex with him? Because I want to... can I just knock on his door and ask if he wants to do it again?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cl6sp8/i_24f_met_my_new_flatmate_26m_yesterday_and_we/,relationship_advice,2297,761,0.0

Glad to be posting something that isn't cheating or something fucked up.

My GF and I really love this particular band, I always keep an eye out for cool/rare merch to get a little 'anytime' gift for each-other.

Cue last week. Her birthday is coming up and I found a rare version of a Vinyl on eBay for waaaay under market price. I instantly bid on it and day later someone bids back, I end up in a little bidding war with this randomer and eventually win. The next day my GF and I are chatting and she begins to tell me that she had found this really cool rare bit of merch but got out bid and she really wanted it for our collection. That's when it hits me, I was bidding against her.

Now, normally I would've just told her it was me and we would've got a good giggle out of it, but considering I was buying it as a surprise (birthday) I kept quiet. However now I'm starting to think I should just tell her as she's pretty bummed out about it (May seem silly to some but its a really important thing to us)

ohjesusohfuckohno,2019-08-02 00:35:00+00:00,(UPDATE) Brother (15m) made fake instagram of me (25m) to make JW parents think I'm not gay.,"Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/cjkflc/my\_brother\_15m\_has\_been\_lying\_about\_my\_25m\_life/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cjkflc/my_brother_15m_has_been_lying_about_my_25m_life/) 

Thank you all for your illuminating comments. I'm honestly overwhelmed at the response &amp; apologize for not replying much, it was so much. But I'd like to specifically thank [u/\_\_my\_man\_\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/__my_man__/) for his comment, which suggested that this was not him trying to rope me back in, but him trying to escape the cult. You were exactly right.

Today we talked for the first time since our conversation. He took down the insta after our conversation (which I hadn't noticed at the time of writing the post, haha), and I gently asked why, exactly, he did this. He's fifteen, so he didn't quite have the language to say ""I'm being abused and need to leave the JW."" What he said, instead, was that mom and dad are ""crazy"" and he's become disillusioned with the cult (he even used the word ""cult""). He still believes in God and wants to explore different sects of Judeo-Christianity. My hometown is a small place in the midwest, and everyone knows who the JW are...they're, like, ""those people"". So he couldn't covertly go to another service without someone recognizing him and it getting back to my parents.

His motive was pretty much what [u/\_\_my\_man\_\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/__my_man__/) said. He said he wants to visit, hang out, and explore the religions around Chicago, but the only way my parents would allow him to leave town is if they knew EXACTLY where he was, who he was with the whole time, etc. So in his head, propping me up as converted was the only way to make it happen. I told him I was completely uncomfortable with that, and that my relationship with my parents is over. He apologized, and pretty much already knew the logistical problems. I think this was a very maturing ordeal for him.

I established myself as a lifeline. I told him that if it ever gets too much, I will pay for his train ticket and he can stay with me for as long as he likes, even moving in for the remainder of high school. (And I mean it: I have enough space, and my aunt will help with childcare/extra expenses). He seemed apprehensive, but the thought's out there, and he now seems comfortable enough to vent about the church/my parents/my crazy ass sister directly. 

As for my parents, I just told him to cold turkey stop talking about me. If they ask (and this was suggested by Julie, my ""bride-to-be""), he will tell them that I might have refound Christianity but I have no intentions to return to the Watch Tower, and that he stopped talking to me. Leaving JW for any reason is grounds for excommunication. And I put my actual insta on private, in case they go looking. They might think I'm not gay, might now have the sliver of hope that I'll return to them, but that's honestly not my fucking problem. 

And for the guys who suggested this was a honeypot...no. No fifteen year old can act this well. He's so, so full of love and kindness, and as fucked up as his plan was, it was at the end of the day because he is panicking in a toxic enviorment. 

Thank you all, again. My brother is back in my life, and I now have the means to help him. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

**TL;DR: My brother made the fake insta so he could have an excuse to visit me. I told him if he ever wants to escape my parents, I will be here for him to move in with. The insta is deleted.

My GF (28f) and I (28m) have been togheter for two years. She's everything I have ever dreamed and we will move together next year. We have talked about marriage and starting a family together. I don't see a future without her tbh. 

She has always been loyal, she is against cheating due to her father cheating on her mom several years ago, and I have never had any doubts until now. It's a very touchy subject for her and she has begged me from the start to leave her if I ever want to cheat. To accuse her of cheating would hurt her for sure. 

However since a couple of months ago she has started using an old phone of hers, I have never seen her using it before and she doesn't use it in front if me but she is not secretive about it... she just leaves it charging in her room in the open, but it's always charging when I am at her place so I know she is using it. 

I thought it had something to do with her studies because she is very tech savy but today her rommate let me in and when I got into her room she closed it as soon as she saw me and she seemed guily as fuck.
But again, she did not hid it, she put it on her nightstand and we went out. 

Now I'm home and she is asleep next to me and I can't stop thinking about that damn cellphone. 

I don't know how to approach the subject with her: I cannot snoop because she uses an anti-theft app on all her devices so I will be busted immediately, and honestly I don't want to breach her trust.
I am afraid she will get mad and hurt if I accuse her of cheating, especially if it's not true but I can't think of any explanation for this fucking cellphone.

I started to cry a little and he just covered my mouth. Then he got up and told me to “have fun at work”. I called in sick because I felt so terrible. I don’t think he raped me I dont want to use that word but he made me feel horrible. My husband has changed ever since I got pregnant and he’s a lot less more calm. I just don’t understand. I wish I could be a stay at home mom and make him happy but I feel like I would miserable.

wife-,2019-07-31 02:09:58+00:00,[UPDATE] My (23F) [autistic] husband (36M) will only eat “kiddie food” [and lied by omission about his autism].,"Previous post [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bobslu/update_my_23f_husband_36m_will_only_eat_kiddie/).

Well.

It’s been a lot longer than the one week update I promised. I could make excuses but I won’t.

For those of you who don’t want to read my original post, I asked for help with my husband’s food preference issues and through talking with many people on here and, ultimately, his mother, it was revealed that he was diagnosed with autism as a child.

Some of the comments on my original post were... not so kind. I got a lot of accusations that still hurt me. Some just make me angry, particularly the person who commented simply “Please don’t bully him.” He’s my goddamn husband. Not a schoolyard friend, not a sibling, not a child. Infantilizing him doesn’t help his case at all.

Moving on.

I was very upset as he had never mentioned anything to me. We’ve discussed all sorts of medical issues together but his diagnosis never came up.

I want to stress this: This isn’t a matter of me not wanting to be married to an autistic man. This is a matter of my husband keeping something important from me and causing me a great deal of stress that could have been avoided if I was aware of his diagnosis.

For example, I continuously pushed him to try new foods or attend concerts or visit loud amusement parks. I knew he wasn’t particularly thrilled about any of those things but they are all very normal couple activities that I wanted us to experience together. Had I been aware of his autism I would have had a better understanding of how negatively these things affected him, and made more of an effort to integrate things he liked with things I liked (maybe a smaller local band, or a craft fair instead of an amusement park).

Anyways. That’s the backstory. Read below for the update.

**UPDATE**

I confronted him about my conversation with his mother the night before our counseling appointment. I made sure to bring it up casually so I didn’t become angry again.

He tried to brush me off at first, saying he didn’t know what I was talking about. After talking for a bit he eventually confessed that he not only knew of the diagnosis but deliberately kept it from me. He said I was his dream and he didn’t want to do anything to ruin our “perfect” relationship.

I explained how him keeping this from me hurt me. I explained how I could have been there to support him instead of feeling like he needed to hide.

He said he wasn’t ashamed of it at all. He explained that it’s just not something that affects him anymore. I, again, explained how it affects me, but he didn’t seem to care. I didn’t show him the post I made but I used some of the advice from you all to try to explain why his autism really does in fact still affect his life.

We went to bed upset.

The next day he acted like nothing happened. We ate breakfast (he had chicken nuggets), and went about our day. I kept expecting him to bring it up but he never did.

I didn’t have the nerve to bring it up again until later at the marriage counselor’s office. I spoke to the counselor so as not to seem accusing and explained that this was an issue that bothered me.

My husband actually laughed and said he assumed I’d “gotten over it by now”. When I explained that no, I really hadn’t, he got angry with me and stormed out. The counselor tried to mediate but it wasn’t much use as my husband went to wait in the car. I was worried he’d leave without me so I cut the meeting short.

Our ride home was quiet. It wasn’t until we got home that I said I was worried he was keeping other things from me too.

He said he’d been reading online about how women can’t understand autism and therefore he didn’t think it was important to tell me about it. I said that was the weakest excuse I’d ever heard. He then said that I’d leave him if I knew. I said if I left him it’d be because he’s a liar.

Apparently he told all of our mutual friends that he’d “just” been diagnosed with autism and I was considering leaving him because of it. Now many of our friends won’t talk to me and act very cold when we run into each other in public. I don’t know what else he’s told them but I think he told someone I cheated on him as a fake account has been commenting horrible things about me and my supposed sexual habits on all of my instagram posts. I keep reporting them but then it seems like another just pops up in its place. 

I haven’t decided if divorce is the right path. I know he’s been browsing “incel” and other bitter male-centric websites (one of his friends is a self-described “incel”) so I’m even more convinced that this isn’t the man I married.

I’m mostly just confused. I’ve been avoiding him at home and it feels like more of a room mate situation at this point. He doesn’t really leave his den until it’s time for work, and then he’s back in the den until bed.

It seems like everything is messed up, just from me wanting to help. I don’t even know what to expect at this point, much less how to move on from here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ck1w7p/update_my_23f_autistic_husband_36m_will_only_eat/,relationship_advice,3794,734,0.0
redditowl1313,2019-07-31 02:04:05+00:00,[UPDATE] Am I [F22] wrong for leaving my family dinner after my brothers fiancé [F24] decided to publicly “joke” about my relationship issues in front of everyone?,"First of all,  thank you to everyone who offered advice it means a great deal to me. I thought I would post a follow up considering the amount of traction this post received. 

So as some of you suggested, I reached out to my brother and expressed my frustration and sadness given the whole situation. I was not able to reach him through phone, so I ended up sending him a text detailing all this information. I didn’t hear anything from him the rest of day so I started to wonder if he was just going to ignore my message. Then today I got a text from his finance saying, “Good morning [my name]. I didn’t mean any offense when I said that comment the other night. I was trying to make light of the situation and kind of pump you up make you feel good? Like kind of a “yay” thing. I should have taken into consideration that we were in front of everyone &amp; I don’t know 100% what’s going on. I know you were considerate about the pearl thing so I should do the same. I do apologize and didn’t mean any harm, it won’t happen again♥️”. 

I have mixed feelings about her response. While I do appreciate her reaching out and apologizing, I am struggling to believe she genuinely thought this would make me feel good, or in her words “pump me up”. Right...because nothing pumps you up like having your relationship issues put on blast and shared to the masses? I received this message two hours ago and I have yet to reply. Like many of you suggested this seemed more a tactic for her to persuade how people see me. I do know for certain she is a very judgmental person (which gives me more reason to doubt the authenticity of her reply) . For example, I’ve witnessed on several occasions her be rude to waitstaff, talk down on other people’s relationships, lives, and jobs. 

After further reading comments I have started to speculate she decided to publicly “joke” about my relationship issues in a desperate attempt to boost her own insecurities. For starters she does not allow my brother to go out to bars with his male friends because in her words “those are not activities taken men do”. He’s not allowed to drive his Camaro to the gym as she believes this will attract others girl attention. Also, as I’m sure you can conclude from all this he is by no means allowed to have any female friends. I could go on and on here, but you get the idea. Because of this I do wonder if she is trying to embarrass me publicly in an attempt to boost her self esteem. At a minimum I do believe it makes her a hypocrite. 

I am also little disappointed I haven’t received a response from my brother. While he obviously relayed the message to her, it would have been nice to hear from him as well. As others pointed out it may not be in my best interest to confide in him going forward. As for my reply to his finance, I still am unsure what is the best course of action to take. Perhaps just let it go, and only press the issue if it happens again? I have a feeling this won’t be the last time despite what she’s said here. I will update you all here once I gather my thoughts and decide what I should say going forward. 

Edit for clarification: she noted how I was considerate given the “Pearl” situation. This is my lifelong friend of over 10 years. My brother and my friend pearl had a  brief fling that lasted a few months back in 2012. My brother came to me explaining how his fiancé was very upset that I would share funny stories about me and Pearl’s  travels together in front of her. I apologized and explained to my brother I had no idea she even knew about their brief fling (given it was so long ago). I was a little surprised he even thought to mention it to her when he explained she somehow managed to find text messages between them on his phone dating all the way back to 2012. From that point on I was not allowed to even mention her name around my brothers fiancé, let alone invite her on any family outings (as I used to do frequently). She has even “overheard” our private conversations between me and brother where I’ve mentioned Pearl’s name, to which she criticized my brother for not completely shutting down the conversation immediately. She’s a real gem, I know.

hamandmayonaise,2019-07-30 18:08:20+00:00,"My friends and I (22-23f) invited a trans girl (28MTF) to an all girls party and she made us all very, very uncomfortable. How do we tactfully uninvite her from our ""girls only bachelorette viewing party"" tonight?","I'm using a throwaway because I just don't want to hurt any feelings IRL if that makes sense and I want to be sensitive to everyone involved (even the people that read this). 

On Friday night we a group of friends and I decided to have a girls night in to ""celebrate"" a break up one of them had just had. Our plan was to watch cheesy movies, laugh, cry, order pizza, drink wine and just do girl things. It wasn't a planned sleepover but I didn't mind if anyone decided to stay. 

We have a trans girl who is sort of like our friend but she lives an hour a way so we don't know her all that well but on the occasion we do see her she's always been friendly and nice. Her name Tilly Some of us know her pre-trans, some of us don't but all accept her now, I think she slowly started transitioning about a year ago. She said she was going to be in town and asked if I could hang out. I told her I would do her one better, why don't you come to our break up party?  Everyone was on board with this. Our friend was super excited because she said she'd never been taken seriously enough to be invited to a party like ours so that made me very happy. 

We all arrived and sat around my table and laughed and had a great time and we all agreed to meet again at my place to watch the Bachelorette finale tonight. 

I am trying to be very delicate here but things with Tilly got weird from the start. It was almost like she expected this to be some sort of male fantasy idealized version of a teenage sleepover. We were watching ""love actually"" (yes we were that cheesy) on my king size bed (there were six of us total) and Tilly grabbed a pillow and smashed me in the face so hard it actually made my head ring. It was completely out of the blue. I was dazed and my other friend asked her why she did that. Tilly said that watching the movie was boring and she was ready for the fun to start.  We told her that none of us were in the mood for that sort of thing and she called us ""lame"" and went to surf her phone for maybe 15 minutes or so. She even posted on Instagram a selfie with something like ""who knew all girl sleepovers weren't fun?"" but deleted it really quickly after a guy I think who is her brother commented ""you aren't a girl b!tch."" That made me feel really bad for her so I invited her back in and then she asked when we were changing into pajamas and having the make out party. I have one friend who is very direct and she told Tilly that she's ""very sorry but that sort of stuff really doesn't happen and we aren't sure if you're trying to make jokes but you're making some of us uncomfortable."" Tilly said something like ""I'm sorry but if your uncomfortable now, wait until we lez out and instead of licking you have to suck.""  The same friend asked Tilly if there was something wrong with her and Tilly admitted that she had been doing cocaine since early that afternoon and was sorry that it was all gone (none of us do drugs). After that the fun was gone, we were stunned into silence and we finished the movie. Tilly got up with about 15 minutes to go and passed out on my couch.  Everyone left shortly after the movie was over but was very, very quiet. 

Another friend offered to stay the night with me because she was a little worried about me being alone with Tilly. We woke up to extreme banging in the kitchen and Tilly was completely nude in the kitchen looking like she was completely out of it trying to make breakfast.  When she noticed us she said she was so disappointed her first girl sleep over was almost done and she was the only one the balls to show her pussy (I don't know how intentional her wording was).  I told Tilly I was very uncomfortable and she needed to put on clothes. She did and then she started crying on the couch that she'd probably ruined her friendship with us. I tried to comfort her and tell her maybe it was best she just give us some space and we'll talk later. I called her an uber and she said she was very sorry and she would give us space. 

I didn't hear anything from her until just about an hour ago when she asked what time she should come over tonight? I texted the rest of the group and no one is comfortable with her being around after Friday. 

After all I said above, how do I tactfully uninvite her our party tonight?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cjvm06/my_friends_and_i_2223f_invited_a_trans_girl_28mtf/,relationship_advice,19030,303,0.0
AmeliaBedelia2468,2019-07-30 13:16:52+00:00,My (34 F) husband (38 M) is cheating on me with my best friend's au pair (20 F),"My husband and I have been married 13 years and have two children (12 M&amp;F).

Our marriage has been good but the last 5 years I've been wheelchair bound due to my MS. 

Anyway, my best friend hired her au pair from Russia. She was here to learn English. They both work so she was around our kids a lot since they all play together. 

We were all at a wedding this past weekend. We got back yesterday. My friend told me she wanted to talk to me. She showed me a picture she took of my husband kissing her au pair in what they thought was a private corner by the coat check. She confronted the girl later and she confessed they have been in a sexual relationship for 6 months. 

I am very brokenhearted at this discovery. I am not completely surprised because we haven't been intimate in at least 4 years and my husband is not sexually attracted to me anymore.

conflicteduncle111,2019-07-30 04:46:40+00:00,Nephew attacked my infant and we don't know what to do,"My brother and his wife have a son that is 6. My wife and I have a baby. 

My nephew has serious behavioral issues. He hits smaller kids constantly, chokes/kicks/punches small animals (any cats or small dogs he comes into contact with), screams at adults, and refuses to listen. My brother has had him tested for a variety of disorders, and none have been identified.

My wife and I both think the problems are caused by the fact that my nephew has been essentially raised by my mom (nephew's grandmother) who has never enforced any rules or disciplined him in any way. Similarly, we have never seen my brother or his wife punish him in any way that made sense or lasted more than 5 minutes. Every time he hits another little kid he immediately starts crying and saying that it was an accident and that the other kids were being mean to him. Every adult in his life has always accepted that excuse right away, and rushed in to give him candy and hugs until he feels better (even if he was crying because he punched a little girl in the face). My wife and I have watched this happen repeatedly. Every time he is near a kid smaller than him it is certain that he will find a way to shove them over, kick them, punch them, spit on them, or choke them, then this whole scene will replay itself.

Last year we had a baby. When the baby was 8 months old we traveled to visit my family, and were extremely nervous about the baby being near our nephew. He proved our fears to be true within an hour of us getting there. We all sat down to dinner, and the instant my wife and I were not watching the baby, our nephew grabbed him by the back of the head and shoved his face into the table part of the highchair; hard enough to make the baby scream and bawl. My wife and I discussed this happening, and made a pretty big deal out of it. My brother told nephew he would have to apologize or he would get a time out. My wife and I accepted, but forced him to agree that he had to be nice to the baby the entire time we were there, no ""accidents"" and no exceptions. 

The next morning I was playing with the baby in the living room. We had a bongo drum, and my mom was watching us drum and laugh and baby was cooing and singing. Nephew came in and right away tried to snatch the drum away from the baby, and shouted out ""its no fair, he's not sharing!"" I told him that snatching something away was not sharing and it was not nice, and reminded him of our agreement the night before. He settled down and started drumming with us, and my brother walked in to watch. 

The night before had rattled me, and I watched that kid like a hawk. The entire time he was within arms' reach of the baby I didn't blink and I didn't take my eyes off of him. After 4-5 minutes, I saw him glance at me out of the side of his eye and not realize that I was watching him. He started swinging his arms wildly at the drum, and 2 or 3 swings in I saw him glance back over, this time at the baby in my lap, then lean WAY over and use the backswing of his drumming to whack the baby clean in the face. At the instant of impact I saw him smile and look back down. The baby started crying and I snatched him up and let out an unintentional ""what the FUCK?!"" Nephew started screaming ""It was an AAACCIDENNNNNNT!!!"" and crying loudly. My brother rushed over and said ""Did you just swear at my kid?""

I was in shock, and just stormed out of the room to find my wife. I told her what had happened and we decided we needed to leave, right now. It was the first morning of what was supposed to be a 3-day weekend, but we cut the trip early, packed everything and headed for the door. As we were walking out, I heard my brother talking to my parents in the living room. He was telling them that the kids bumped into each other and I lost my shit. My parents were consoling my nephew and telling him it wasn't his fault. At that point, with every adult in the near vicinity giving this kid everything he needed to not feel bad about backhanding my infant across the face and acting like we were crazy for not accepting the accident excuse, we walked out and have not been back.

Since then our nephew has attacked three other children that we know of (this all happened 2 months ago). One of the victims belonged to mutual friends of mine and my brother's who told me they thought I was being melodramatic about it until they watched my nephew shove their 5-year-old daughter over from behind then jump on her back. They left when my mom (nephew's grandmother) gave him ice cream to make him feel better about it. 

We don't know what to do. It hurts that my brother is bad parent, and that his awful parenting is turning someone I love (my nephew) into a monster that gets enjoyment from hurting defenseless things. I love my brother, and we've been best friends our entire lives. I've tried talking to him, but he refuses to budge an inch and insists that my nephew is just ""all boy"" (a phrase my wife and I HATE now, btw) and being ""a little wild."" We haven't been back (it's been 5 months), and while we face chat with my parents we have to be careful not to bring up my brother or nephew or they get extremely passive aggressive towards us. Every time my parents bring up us coming back to visit we tell them we don't know what our schedule is like and invite them to come stay with us. Has anyone else dealt with something like this? How do I protect my child without ruining my relationship with my brother?

tl;dr Nephew likes to hurt small children and animals. Slapped my infant in the face. I'm the bad guy (?)",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cjmtco/nephew_attacked_my_infant_and_we_dont_know_what/,relationship_advice,1134,681,0.0
annalease,2019-07-30 02:17:42+00:00,I don’t know how to escape from my police officer husband,"My husband (m, 32) and I (f, 28) have been together 8 years. We have two children my sons are 7 and 4. I am starting to feel very depressed and I don’t know what to do. It’s all starting to be too much for me and I feel like he’s gonna break me and I just won’t care anymore. I’m so scared of him sometimes my hands shake when he’s around. I can’t explain why it’s just him. His voice the way he stands everything he’s always on the defense. I’ve been taking pills and drinking too much for years trying to live through the pain. I just am holding on to threads of hope because sometimes he can be a very good husband and I just want him like that all the time.

He just sees even the tiniest disagreement to be me “disrespecting” him. He thinks I’m talking back if I say anything else then “yes” or “no”. He manipulates me and I can’t fight it I just end up crying in his chest. 
My happiness depends on whether he wants to let me have it or not.

He thinks I belong at home. I do everything I cook and clean and take care of our children. He gives me no help because he “works hard”. He tells me I wasn’t made to work so I don’t understand. And even though my husband pays our children dust 80% of the time, he still acts like they’re his more then mine. He will say, “my son” on purpose just to annoy me. He always yells at them for back talking but how can a 4 year old really talk back he can barely say words right.

My husband also does not like me speaking to people. He says I’m a people pleaser and I can’t read people like he can. He doesn’t even let me talk to my own father hardly because he thinks my father hates cops. I don’t even trust myself anymore I just rely on my husband for everything. I cry to him all the time even though he’s the one making me cry but I wouldn’t tell him that but still I want comfort from him I don’t get it.

He has no trust in me. He accuses me of flirting even though I’m just being nice. He even said the other day I was looking at the mailman for too long. I do everything possible to not look at or talk to other men but no matter what I do, he finds a problem. 

He will come home to just “check” on me. He follows me. He has a tracker on my car and he has my phone tapped.

He will lock me in our bedroom or bathroom with him and berate me for hours. He calls me a whore, a slut, a bitch. He always wants me to ambit to doing things I didn’t or feeling things I don’t. He won’t let me sleep or leave or anything till he’s satisfied.

I hardly ever say no to my husband. He will say things like he can go to other women if I don’t have sex with him. And I know he’s cheating on me anyway, he leaves in the night and says he’s going to work if I ask but I don’t believe him. 

My husband has hit me before but not too often. I hardly ever have bruises he can inflict a lot of pain on me and not leave a mark. But once in a while he is careless and he leaves them. He never apologizes when he touches me like this, he tells me it’s my fault for “escalating” and “provoking him”. He will only say he’s sorry through buying me flowers or gifts and saying he loves me. Sorry is just not in his vocabulary. He tells me I’m lucky and I don’t know what abuse is.

Another thing I despise is that my husband is inseparable from his gun. He will never not have it. And if we are arguing or I do something he doesn’t like he will toy with it. I just hate that he could kill me at any moment and he knows it. 

One time he was drunk and made us play one sided Russian roulette. I really will never forget this it almost made me hate him. 

He sounds like a monster but I love him and this is just the bad side of him. Part of me really wants to leave him but I can’t. One time when he beat me particularly bad like a year and a half ago for trying to leave him our neighbors called the cops. And nothing happened to my husband. He didn’t get arrested or in trouble at work or anything. They told us to “work it out”. My husband will kill me he constantly reminds me that I made a vow till death do us part, he has told me he would rather see me dead then with another man.

I have no idea what I can do. Or if I can even bring myself to leave him I’m addicted to him. But I know I should. I think I am trapped for life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cjl8sh/i_dont_know_how_to_escape_from_my_police_officer/,relationship_advice,9736,1412,0.0
DandelionSprinkles,2019-07-29 18:11:02+00:00,I think I’m falling out of love with my husband because he’s an asshole to strangers.,"My (35f) husband (47m) have been married only a year. Throughout our whole relationship I have known of his road rage and impatience. He is an extremely aggressive driver and tells me it’s better to be aggressive when driving but that doesn’t mean he has to ride someone’s ass at full speed then switch lanes and stare the driver down. 

The other day a young man wasn’t paying attention in a parking lot and as I waited for him to look up and see my car my husband starts getting anxious and was like what the F is this guys problem, he then tried to roll down the window to say something. I quickly locked the window and said the guy just wasn’t paying attention for maybe 20 seconds and it’s not a big deal and once he noticed my car he mouthed “sorry” and quickly moved. My husband says back “f’n idiot!”

My husband is constantly saying negative things. Last night I wanted to have a serious talk with him about my cousin who is dying from cancer while it was just the two of us at dinner and he quickly cut me off to get mad at the fact the there was a car parked with it’s lights on shining into the restaurant while the driver ran in to pick up their order. Then my husband quickly changed his focus on our server because he wasn’t refilling his soda fast enough even though it was completely busy. I never told him about my cousin. It just isn’t worth it sometimes. I know he won’t listen or understand. 

My husband once got up and went behind a sushi bar to refill his own soda because it was taking too long. He’s that type of person. 

He likes to call himself an asshole. Says everyone knows he’s an asshole even his family knows he’s an asshole. 

At first I just figured he was impatient or wasn’t taught proper etiquette but he’s family is so great and loving and cares for less fortunate, he’s just so opposite. He tells me he loves that I remind him a lot of his mom and sister in the ways we care for other but that’s just a quality he doesn’t have. He Doesn’t think of putting the shoe on the other foot. 

I am constantly trying to downplay every situation so he doesn’t get so upset. I’m worried about the road rage and someone pulling out a gun and how dangerous it is and asked him to at least not do it while I’m in the car. he gets mad and defensive and says if I don’t like driving with him don’t get in the car when he’s driving. 

I guess what has really turned me off is the way he treats strangers. He’s insensitive to other people and what they might be going through. It’s almost like he’s incapable of thinking a stranger has struggles and feelings too. 

It’s been getting worse. He never has anything positive to say, he gets so angry and defensive so easily. I’ve tried talking to him about this but like I said he just gets angry and defensive now. Before he would say he’s going to change but that was years ago now he just gets mad. 

I’m not sure if this is just a rant but my heart hurts and I don’t like being around him and all his negative energy. I feel like sometimes it rubs off on me and I hate it.

radslwd,2019-07-29 16:09:33+00:00,"[UPDATE] I (21, F) want to kiss my best friend (22, F, bisexual).","I've told her how I feel, and we are dating now. EEEEEEEEEE!!! Thank you so much, everyone!

Original post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/chzz58/i\_21\_f\_want\_to\_kiss\_my\_best\_friend\_22\_f\_bisexual/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/chzz58/i_21_f_want_to_kiss_my_best_friend_22_f_bisexual/) 

(Again, apologies for grammar mistakes. I'm too excited to proof-read this.)

After posting my previous post, I was shocked to receive so many encouragements. You guys really cheered me up and gave me the courage I desperately needed. I decided to tell her honestly and move on from there, whether the answer is yes or no. I trusted my friend to appreciate my feelings and I was confident that we can still be friends even if she turns me down. I tossed and turned for several nights, and I decided to talk to her, but there will be three promises I'm going to keep. One, we will both be sober for the conversation, two, I will not pressure her to date me by guilt-tripping or using any other emotional manipulation, and three, when she says no, I'm going to maturely accept it and do my best to make her feel comfortable. Remember these three rules, people. I sort of broke every single one of them :')

&amp;#x200B;

We met today to watch movies together. I think I was dazed throughout the whole day, thinking ""*this is it, I'm going to tell her, it's now or never!""* My heart somehow managed to go up to my throat, and was beating way too fast. I laugh a lot when I'm nervous, and I was laughing way too much. We watched IT together (it was a good excuse to hold her hand when it got scary) and we went for early dinner. I suggested traditional food, since we both love it, but I regretted afterward worrying about bad breath. One worry turned into another, and I realized how sticky I was with sweat and moist from the air. This was not romantic. I thought there's no way I can tell her today with bad breath and smelly clothes and sticky hands. So when she suggested we go to a pub, I was conflicted for a few seconds, but agreed. There's always a next time.

&amp;#x200B;

So she had a bottle of beer, I had a cocktail. We weren't drunk and I don't think we were even tipsy. But that small amount of alcohol pushed me back to *I-need-to-tell-her* state. We fell into a comfortable silence while I internally screamed at myself to just spit the words out. But I couldn't. I couldn't get myself to say anything. The best I could do was say ""hey,"" and then I'd say something stupid like, what's your plan for tomorrow, what do you think those people in the back are talking about, or don't you think that dog is cute, etc. At that point, I was exhausted from fighting myself and almost gave up. I got another gin tonic, and my friend stood up to get more beer. 

&amp;#x200B;

Remember I didn't want to have this conversation while drunk? It was important to me that we reach an agreement without either of us being drunk, and if she started drinking that, there was no way she would be sober. So I snatched the bottle from her hand. I SNATCHED the bottle from her hand, and said, Hey. 

&amp;#x200B;

But then I couldn't say anything. She was waiting for me to say something dramatic and I had no idea what I was doing and now that I stole her drink I *had* to say it but I hadn't thought of this part. After looking around nervously at everywhere but her and clearing my throats a hundred times, I asked her if she remembers a few nights before when I asked her bunch of questions on bisexuality and dating friends. She looked back at me with a blank face. And guess what people! I started to freaking cry. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't bawl. It was just a few drops of tears that I have no idea where it came from. I teared up and she left the table again to get me some napkins, all the while I was thinking, *Oh wow, so much for not guilt-tripping. Well done, me, fucking fantastic.* I calmed down seconds later (it was embarrassing) and started to ramble things. English is not my native language, so I made absolutely no sense trying to put words into a proper sentence. I realized I was fumbling, so I said something like ""Okay. Remember I said I might like girls? I said that because... No, I didn't say it because of but... What I'm trying to say is I liked you. A lot."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Which was a mistake because her second response (after ""since when?"") was ""Wait, past tense?"" So I told her no, I still have feelings. BUT I would totally respect and understand if she doesn't feel the same way, or if she needs some time to think. 

&amp;#x200B;

It didn't feel cathartic. I was still nervous, and most of all, very exhausted. So when she started telling her story, I was wide-eyed, mouth gaping, and definitely not acting mature. She told me that she had a crush on me since the beginning of this year but hasn't done anything because she knew I was straight. She never used tinder (even though many of her friends suggested) because she had feelings for me! She said she won't drink much more tonight because she wants to remember this. She said she can't believe how brave I am to tell her, because she could never have done it herself. And what else? I used to have a crush on this guy last year and I told her about it recently, and she said she was so jealous. I was in disbelief listening to her talk so I don't remember the rest, sadly. But I can say this for sure, I could have cried again then and there in joy.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, we scheduled a date (tomorrow!) and talked about this and that. We decided to make this relationship secret even to our closest friends until we are sure that we can tell them. I was giggling like mad the whole time (laughing when nervous, remember? *so mature*) and we hold hands. I still haven't kissed her yet, but I have a feeling we will very soon.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to thank everyone for encouraging me. This post got so much longer than I planned, but I wanted to put down all the details I could remember. One comment suggested that I show the original post to my girlfriend (hehehehe I can't wait to call her that every chance that I get) but I don't think I will for some time. It's too intimate, and I still feel embarrassed about it. Now that we are together, I should start thinking about how to have a healthy relationship in a homophobic society. I'm worried, but not as much as I was because I know I have a beautiful person with me to go through this together. If anyone out there reading this have the same problem I had, do what your heart tells you. Your friend will still love you no matter what. 

&amp;#x200B;

3h8383,2019-07-29 16:07:25+00:00,I [17F] stood up to my sister [20F] and my parents kicked me out for it.,"My sister Sienna bullies me and has done since I was little. She is my parents favourite. Pretty, smart, popular successful, etc. All I ever get told by my parents is to be like Sienna. Sienna can do awful things to me but my parents laugh it off. Yesterday she took my plate away at the table and said I should be losing weight not gaining it. They were laughing their heads off at this. 

Today I was on the phone to my boyfriend Aidan. Sienna has tried to make moves on him before. She thought it would be funny to snatch my phone and start flirting with him on it. He shouted at her to fuck off and told her to give it back to me. She then started asking if he'd like to know what he's missing by being with me and not her. He was getting angrier and angrier at this point. I kept trying to snatch the phone but she was too quick. 

Sienna has severe eye problems. Her glasses aren't regular glasses. She has to go to a specialist eye hospital because her eyesight is so bad. She has needed many surgeries and even with her glasses she can't drive and can only read close-up, and without them all she sees is blurred colours. 

I was told for as long as I remember to never touch Sienna's glasses. Rightfully so since she is completely blind without them, and understandably my parents were protective over her. To this day I've never broken this rule because I thought it would be a step too far. 

However, when she didn't give my phone back and was saying all that stuff to aidan I felt like crying, and I just grabbed her glasses and threw them to the other side of the room under a table. 

As soon as the glasses came off Sienna started crying. She dropped the phone and was begging me to get her glasses. I was so angry with her that I took the phone and went to Aidan's place. 

I got home earlier and my parents were home from work. Mum was hugging Sienna and soothing her and dad was furious. Apparently Sienna spent over an hour feeling around for her glasses, and mum had to find them for her. Sienna was still sobbing when I got home, and if I went anywhere near her she'd step back. It's like she's scared of me. 

Mum says that after what I did to ''our poor little girl'' I should stay somewhere else for a few nights, since Sienna doesn't feel safe with me here. I packed some stuff and went to stay with Aidan, which is where I'm typing this. 

I don't think I did anything wrong. She took my phone and tried it on with my boyfriend. I know I should've given the glasses back but it's not like I broke them or damaged them. 

Did I go too far and how do I win my parents trust back? 

TLDR:I stood up to my sister by taking her glasses, and now she doesn't feel safe with me and my parents have kicked me out because of it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cjda2g/i_17f_stood_up_to_my_sister_20f_and_my_parents/,relationship_advice,1578,498,0.0
youresovain123,2019-07-29 12:30:45+00:00,"My (35m) wife (35f) nearly died in hospital, her family doesn’t care and now I don’t know how to act around my in-laws","**Tl;dr** – Over the summer, we discovered my wife has a rare heart condition and nearly died. Three open-heart surgeries, two months in the ICU, and being put on the heart transplant list, and her family did little more than check in occasionally. I’m pissed and hurt, but don’t know what to do about it.

So here’s the story. Buckle in, it’s long. Throwaway because some of her family lives on Reddit and will probably see this. If you think this song is about you...

A few weeks before Easter, my wife started not feeling well. Just breathless and really tired all the time. She went in for some blood work and they discovered she was in heart failure. It went real critical, real fast. We never even celebrated Easter—my kid’s Easter basket, full of Dora the Explorer toys and candy, is still hidden in the bottom of my closet.

We went from “nothing’s wrong, maybe a mild flu that she can’t shake” to the ER at our local hospital, transferred to the city hospital, and being told that we need to get her on the heart transplant list ASAP. After a month at the city hospital, with me driving an hour there and back with our kid to visit her daily, her family had not bothered to come visit her ONCE. They lived about 30ish minutes away from the city hospital. 

I should stop here and mention that my wife and I are better off financially than the rest of her immediate family. I fully am aware this is because I had a wealthy family, good education, and a great job that lets me work flexible hours and do extra jobs on the side. Her family—mother (60s), brother (32), and sister (34)—aren’t as well off. Mother works at WalMart and makes ends meet. Brother has a decent job but just in general has trouble keeping his shit together, but he tries. Sister is a stay at home mom—they budget well, but don’t have a lot of disposable income. 

In the past, I have been the safety net for her family. Brother’s car breaks down, we’ve paid to fix it. Sister has a health issue, we’ve paid his medical bills. We’ve even done some family vacations where we paid for the rental property on the beach and groceries. We never demand repayment (although we accept it when/if they do), and my attitude has always been “money is just a thing, but family is important.” Maybe I felt this way because I didn't have any family left.

That said, I always also thought we’d be “paid back” emotionally, if that makes sense? I thought they'd be there for us when we needed it. When my wife first went to the city hospital, I’d drop my kid off at the mother’s house in order to visit with wife. Mother insisted I didn’t need to pay her for babysitting, but after the first week, when it became apparent that my wife wasn’t getting better quickly and this was a long term situation, I felt bad just dumping my kid off, and instead kept her with me when I visited. 

The first few weeks, I didn’t think anything of the fact that her family didn’t come visit, even though they lived a little closer to the city hospital. Mother, sister, brother all work (brother with odd hours), and none of them have the best cars (or money for parking, etc.). 

Then things got progressively worse. My wife’s other organs started failing. We had to speak to palliative care, which freaked me the fuck out. Eventually, the city hospital said they couldn’t take care of my wife and give her a rare operation, and we’d be transferred to a major hospital 250+ miles away. I called her family and basically said “if you want to see her before she’s transferred—and maybe before she literally DIES—come now.” 

They did come that day and stayed with her several hours. I felt like a tool, because it was clear that the mother was upset and kind of freaked out and didn’t know how to deal with the idea that her daughter was so sick. 

But also...JFC. It’d been a month at that point, and this was the first time they’d visited her in the hospital. 

After that, wife was transferred by ambulance to the major hospital. She spends another few weeks in ICU there, while they get her health up to as good as possible before the first major surgery. Me and the kid are living in a trashy motel—we are okay financially, but we can’t afford weeks and months at a nice hotel. I’m feeding my kid nuggets out of the motel microwave and dealing with daily visits at the hospital in a city we aren’t used to.

It was stressful as fuck, guys. Not just seeing my wife, who’s only 35 years old, suddenly take a nosedive in health for a rare condition we didn’t know she had, but also being the sole provider for my kid and worrying about her mental health as she sees her mom dying. I was torn on how much to let my kid see versus how much to let my wife see my kid... I started taking pictures and thinking about which one would be the last family picture we had together. I talked to the hospital’s child psychologist for my kid. 

And also, I did a lot of freelance work, because I knew these bills were coming. My days were: wake up before the kid, sneak out of the motel bed, work, kid wakes up, get her dressed, go to the hospital, come back to the motel, try to find a way to make my kid’s day bright and not depressing as fuck, get kid to bed, work until I passed out. 

Look guys, I don’t want pity or to come off as a whiner, but...I was dealing with a lot in this. And I had no help. My family is either dead or living in a different state. All our friends are in our hometown, not the major hospital city. 

All my wife’s family—not just the mother, brother, and sister, but also the aunts, uncles, etc.—live in about the same area. And yeah, that’s a 3-4 hour drive from the major city hospital, but at most 45 minutes from the first city hospital, and the only ones who visited her there were the m, b, s, and that was only after I basically begged them to come see her. No one, not one goddamn person, visited her at the major city hospital. Not before the first risky surgery, not in the full month of recovery after it. 

Not. 

One.

Goddamn.

Person.

She’s been in hospitals for about three months now. She’s spent most of that time in ICU. She’s had three open heart surgeries, and is coming home with implants and drugs and basically a whole new handicapped life.

And her family doesn’t give a shit. 

After she had the last surgery, she mentioned, in a very quiet, sad voice, “do you think anyone else is going to come up and visit me?”

My heart fucking broke. As soon as I left her room, I texted her whole family—all of them, not just her immediate fam. I offered my wife’s car for them to drive. I offered money for gas and food. I offered to pay for them to stay overnight at the hotel. 

The mother and brother both said they’d come up, just needed to get time off work. 

Spoiler: they never came. 

The sister said she was planning to come up in a few weeks. 

Spoiler: that was last week and she didn’t come. 

They all had excuses. 

But jfc. Three months in the hospital. One visit—after I guilted and begged, and only because it was at the closer hospital.

As for the rest of her extended family, I also sent them all the information on this program the major city hospital does, where you can basically send an email to the hospital, and they print it up and make it look like a card. Literally as simple as a fucking email, and guess how many of them did it? One cousin—the one member of her extended family that lives on the opposite side of the country. 

No one else could even be arsed enough to send a fucking “get well soon” email.

Meanwhile, my friends called and offered help. I had one friend drive two hours to spend a day with my kid so she could have a break. College buddies I’ve not seen in years saw my Facebook post and sent me $100 gift cards or gift cards to meal delivery and stuff. I say this because (a) it’s not like I was being secret about how grave the situation was, and (b) any normal human being could see this is one of those situations where we need help. And while yes, the money helped, what we really needed was fucking emotional support or something. 

Now before it sounds like we’re in a Victor Hugo novel, I should say that her family has a Facebook messenger chat thing, and they did keep up with her there. So I guess I can’t say they didn’t care, but...

IDK, am I being an asshole about this? I realize that they have jobs that aren’t as flexible as mine, but three months. Major surgeries. She nearly fucking died. 

And they didn’t come visit. They didn’t even send a fucking email. 

And I saw the way she was hurt. I saw the hope fade from her eyes when she thought her mom was coming, and then she didn’t. 

And I saw my kid, dragged from hospital to motel and back again, because I didn’t have any help with her in the other city. Wife's sister was going to bring her kids up so that my kid could spend some time with them at the motel pool and she could visit with my wife. My kid cried when she found out her cousins weren't coming. It was the ONLY thing she had to look forward literally this whole summer---one day where she could have fun, and my wife's sister didn't come.

I always thought to myself that it didn’t matter if I loaned out money or whatever to my wife’s family because I could always count on them to be there for us when we needed it. 

We needed it. 

And they weren’t there.

And now...I don’t know how to react or deal with them. Because every time I think of them, I’m filled with rage and resentment. 

But...my kid loves them. And my wife loves them. And they’re more important in this situation. I’m ready to salt the earth with these fuck ups, but my wife is recovering from a major illness and it’s not like she needs drama. And I don’t have family left on my side, and don’t want my kid to be alone. 

So, Reddit hive mind...what should I do? I can swallow my own emotions and play nice around her family. Now that my wife is coming home soon, they all want to visit (on their sweet time, at our house—basically, now that it’s not inconvenient any more). And she’s happy, so I’m not saying anything. I know she’s hurt by the way they didn’t bother with her, but I don’t feel like it’s my place to put it into words: Your family is shit, and they just proved it. 

So I guess I’m at a point where I feel like I just have to grin and bear it. Maybe in the future, I’ll excuse myself from being around them. I know I'm not going to be there financially for them unless it's a life or death situation. But is there a better way to act, or something else I should do? Should I bring this up to my wife--ever?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cjam1e/my_35m_wife_35f_nearly_died_in_hospital_her/,relationship_advice,2674,309,0.0
redditowl1313,2019-07-29 10:04:56+00:00,Am I [F22] wrong for leaving my family dinner after my brothers fiancé [F24] decided to publicly “joke” about my relationship issues in front of everyone?,"A bit of background: Me and boyfriend (recently ex boyfriend) definitely had our fair share of issues. He really struggled with insecurities and jealousy issues. The idea of me going to the gym alone was one he struggled with. Additionally certain articles of clothing I wore were also an issue for him (he would get extremely upset seeing other men “check me out”). He ultimately decided to seek therapy for these issues determined to fix them. After long discussion we decided it would be best for both of us to part ways as he tries to work through his own issues. This break up occurred not even 2 weeks ago, and of course still feels very raw to me. 

I would regularly confined in my older brother about these issues throughout my relationship (we are very close). It has been apparent he has discussed some of these issues with his finance. I wasn’t upset, I understood it was his finance after all. I felt comfortable that these discussions were between the three of us. 

However this was not the case tonight. Everyone came to our house this evening for a BBQ. This included my parents, all my siblings, and friends of my brother and I. I walked in the door in full gym attire as I had just came from the gym. My brother finances looks at me and loudly announces “WOW you really are single now! Look at you actually being allowed to  go to the gym again! *insert annoying laugh here*”. The room instantly got silent, everyone looked to me with uncomfortable expressions looking for my reaction. I was so shocked it took me a second to process what she just said in front of everyone. My dad quickly realizing how uncomfortable I was, changed the subject and everyone began talking again. 

I was hurt by this so called “joke” but for the sake of the night I decided to let it go thinking that would be the end of it. NOPE. Not even thirty minutes later, everyone is gathered around the table getting food buffet style. She looks at my outfit and announces “Oooh you wore leggings to the gym? Must be nice to finally be able to wear leggings again without (ex’s name) telling you what you can and can’t wear” again followed by her fake laughter. I instantly felt my blood boil (from anger and sheer embarrassment). I politely corrected her saying I was always allowed to wear what I like, despite his feelings of insecurities. 

NO ONE in my family knew these details about our relationship. I had no intention of ever telling them. This was extremely personal to me. I excused myself to the restroom and quickly grabbed my car keys and slid out the backdoor. As soon as I started driving, I started bawling my eyes out. I know this may seem dramatic to some, but I was really effected by this. I was so shocked and angry by how another adult could ever think this type of behavior was ok. I received several texts asking where I was, and saying how I made a “scene” by leaving the dinner. I only responded to my parents letting them know I needed a bit of space. I also feel extremely hurt for my ex, as some of his friends were in attendance at this dinner. She has no right to publicly air my ex’s very personal issues to his friends or to my family. Am I wrong for abruptly leaving the family dinner and creating an apparent “scene”?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cj97v6/am_i_f22_wrong_for_leaving_my_family_dinner_after/,relationship_advice,5348,509,0.0

I am so empty and it feels so godamn horrible. I've been trying to act like I didn't care but when they were driving to the airport I couldn't stop crying. My mother was so hurt and they kept saying they loved me. Last time we went to a family vacation was when I was around 13. I cried so much I had cramps in my abdomen.

I wrote them a message trying to make them understand what I was feeling and that it hurt me alot. I got back that I was ruining the vacation and to just accept it. They said they thought I wanted to be ""free"". I know it might have been an asshole move to mention this at the first day of their vacation, but the pictures they sent being all happy made all my emotions I've tried to hide come through. I've never felt this left out and I feel like I'm not a family member. I'm trapped in this house taking care of an animal when they are out being a family on Holliday.
I feel heartbroken.

My plan right now is to leave the pet with an relative and go back to Uni and dive into school to forget.

datedaslut,2019-07-28 22:40:17+00:00,Found my gf at a concert with another guy,"TL;DR my gf was caught with another guy. Will this hurt go away like other break ups? It just feels so different.

My (m26) gf(f25) have been seeing each other since May this year. She got out of a relationship in March. So we have been taking it slow. I don't want to appear clingy but I would love to spend more time with her. I respect she only wants to go out a couple times a week. We text all the time.

This weekend we plan on going out on Saturday. The city we live in has a big park along the river. They plan different events all summer. This weekend it was party in the park. They have bounce houses, entertainment and invite everyone to bring a blanket and have a giant picnic. They also have a sectioned off area with a beer tent and a stage have to be 21 to enter. Entertainment started at 8pm until 11pm.  We planned on seeing the local bands that played after our picnic. 

She texted me Friday night late and says she can't make it, some family stuff came up she had to take care of. I know some of her family lives here and some live a couple hours away. I text back I understood and asked if there was anything I could do to help, like drive her. No she had it handled but would let me know when she was free to make it up to me. So I dirty text her that I really need her to make it up to me. Got no response. Oh well. I had to work Saturday so after work I text a friend to see what was going on this weekend. They were going to the park. They would grab some food from a food truck then to the beer tent. I said I would meet them there around 8pm.

 I get there pay the entance fee. Grab a beer. The band has already started playing. They sound really good for a local band. The headliner wasn't on until later. I make my way through the crowd and find my friend with some buddies. He asks above the noise that he thought my gf wasn't coming? He points to the stage and there she is with her gf. I think wtf. Then 2 guys walk up with beers and hand them to the girls. So my buddy and I watch for a bit. These guys are with the girls just by how they are acting. The girls are right in front of the stage, hands in the air swaying and jumping to the music. I couldn't hear but probably woohooing as she does. My friend says they are acting like they are drunk but only on their second beer that he knows of. I watch as the girls are doing their gyrations the guys are just standing there next to each other. 

So I am really pissed. I tell my friend I am going to say something . He says not to, let it go until tomorrow.  Fuck it. I approach them I get right behind her, she is into it , the swinging, woohoos acting drunk. I put my hands around her waist and start swaying grinding on her. She is grinding back. She looks over at her girlfriend who is doing her own version of woohooing. She sees the guys on the other side of her. She stops and turns around. She says ""oh shit"". I lean in and say ""you are a fucking slut"". I walk away. I get half way back to my friends and see them coming at me. The guy is chasing me down from behind. He stops me. He starts yelling ""who the fuck are you to be touching my girlfriend""? My friends now surround us in case he tries throwing a punch. So I yell back gf? I have been fucking her for 2 months how long have you been fucking her? He says a bunch of stuff then walks away. 

Next thing I see him yelling at her and walks away. She is pleading with him. He keeps going. Eventually the girls start leaving the friend starring daggers at us. Next thing I know I got another beer in my hand. Later on a group of young ladies are hanging out with us. I finally peel away and go home. I have messages from her and the girl friend to call I deleted them.  I don't understand the mentality of someone trying to balance multiple partners. I assume she never broke with ex, but don't know. This really hurts, today, as I am alone in my thoughts. This is my first breakup because of cheating. Other break ups were more mutual or one not feeling it. I bounced back from those quickly, will this be the same? I think this hurts so much more.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cj2k67/found_my_gf_at_a_concert_with_another_guy/,relationship_advice,1027,224,0.0

Let me preface this with saying that he had texted her often while he was in her area and they would try and meet up but couldn't, so I knew he liked to try and meet up with her while he was in her area. So they go to dinner and he doesn't tell me and I ask him about it after he gets home from the trip and he confesses. I get upset because if it isn't a big deal, then why can't he tell me? So instead he lies and when I confront him about it, he fesses up.

Fast forward 4 months, right around when this girl's birthday is. I come home one day to a swimsuit on our doorstep for her. Found out that he sent her one that cost $120 and this one that was $200 was on it's way but got sent to our address instead. I was so mad and hurt and was upset for a few weeks. I didn't trust him and that he wasn't talking to her still, so I looked through his phone. There I found out he had previously sent her flowers and a vibrator. They also talked about how it sucks it never worked out because of the cousin he dated. He told me it was my fault basically because I get stressed and upset about things like him taking her out to dinner and just some other financial things (I think we should save more than he does). He told me he doesn't see me as a friend and he can't talk to me. Did I have the right to be upset he lied about dinner in the first place?

He says the swimsuit was payback for dinner and the vibrator and flowers were because she was feeling lonely. But why is it his responsibility to send her those things?!? And what kind of a girl asks another person's husband to send them swimsuits for payback for dinner?

I don't get it and I'm still hurt and upset by all of this. I don't know how to trust my husband and it sucks. He also saves pictures to his phone from Facebook of this girl and some others of them in their swimsuits or a picture of them in a tight dress. I went through and deleted all of the pictures, but am I overreacting? Is that a normal thing guys do, save pictures of girls they know, even if they're married?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cj1xor/my_husband_31_m_bought_another_woman_a_vibrator/,relationship_advice,2572,754,0.0
Tradgear2012,2019-07-28 20:47:08+00:00,Why does my (40m) wife (38f) sabotage EVERY vacation/trip we take? Looking for clarity.,"TL/DR: My wife brings up or imagines issues between us and has a meltdown on every vacation we take. 

I’m writing this as I sit in our rented oceanfront cottage on the coast of Maine.  My wife is somewhere in a rented car or sitting at an airport trying to get back home to Minnesota. I don’t know where she’s gone, she just asked me to drop her off at a small airport terminal that also has rental cars. We have two more days left of our seven day vacation driving up and down the coast eating oysters, visiting the light houses, and going sailing. 

The whole of our trip has been fantastic, up until  last night precisely between when our waitress asked if we would like to see a dessert menu and when the menu showed up. We had been having a blast for 5 days with zero disagreements, I drove and she held the map, randomly wandering the coast. She would say turn here, let’s see what’s down this road, let’s stop at this stand to grab lobster/oysters/fudges, let’s go see this lighthouse, etc., it was fantastic!  Then yesterday happened, first we were hiking a national park when she spotted some mushrooms that she wanted to identify, so she steps off the trail and straight into a pile of human shit. No big deal, we laughed it off, got her cleaned up, and bitched about how disgusting people are. We drove to our next “romantic cottage by the sea”, which turned out to be a room in a mobile home without tv or air conditioning. No big deal, we teased each other about how the place was haunted by the ghosts of Dwight Schrutes ancestors. We moved on to dinner at a golf club, which we were subtly informed that we did not have the class to dine at such an establishment; fuck those pretentious assholes we agreed and had great dinner at a restaurant more in line with our pay grade. And then... the waitress asks if we would like dessert. She says yes. 

Immediately she turns to me and asks why I’m always judging her. She starts shouting. She’s yelling at me “why do you think you are better than me”, she’s pissed that I left a $10 tip out of my own pocket for the housekeeping instead of “both of us” leaving the tip. She gets pissed that I don’t like sweets. She tells me that she knows I think she is a pig (I don’t, nor is she overweight). Keep in mind this whole time I have said nor indicated anything; this was just an sudden explosion; my jaw hanging in disbelief the whole time. I realize this is getting bad, as does the wait staff, so I quickly pay the bill and we leave. Once in the car she starts yelling that she wished my dog was dead, she’s yelling how taking a week off of work is costing her thousands (while my only cost was my half of the trip), along with reiterating everything that she was going off about in the restaurant. I’m being quiet, trying not to say anything that would escalate her. We get back to our room. She then says her diamond wedding ring isn’t worth the $200 it would take to fix it (it had a scratch).  She then takes her ring off and throws it into the ocean.   This hurt me the most. I spent everything I had on that ring when I was 33 and proposed to her. We were both broke at the time and $3000 was all of the money I had then. After this I walked away, hurt and broken. We remained distant and didn’t talk for the rest of the night. This morning she asked if I would give her a ride, which I said I would. That ride turned out to be to the airport. I dropped her off and haven’t heard from her since. 

The thing is; this isn’t the first time something like this happened, not by far. Last winter I had chartered a sailboat in Florida for her and I to do a long sail to the Dry Tortugas and back. I left our home a few weeks early to prep the boat and plan the passage. She flew down on the day of our departure, got on the boat, and within an hour of leaving for our 22 hour sail she looses it. She starts yelling about how she can no longer live with my dog in our house. She’s crying and screaming. We aren’t fighting, she’s just doing her thing. An hour later she’s at the airport going home. 

I could go on and on with these stories; missed flights to the Caribbean because she had to clean the stove at 6 a.m.; not showing up to family events because the dog needed a bath. 

I love my wife with all of my heart, she’s not perfect, nor am I. 95% of the time things are good between us. She is beautiful, intelligent, and successful. Please don’t call her a nut, please don’t say “run, don’t walk...”.  Please tell me your experiences if you have been in my position or hers. Please tell me if you have overcome issues like these. Thanks internet.

When I got there I met a woman and we hit it off really well, she was laughing at all my shitty jokes which just fuels my confidence. We were also very close and touchy throughout the night, and when the party ended we exchanged numbers. On the Uber ride home my friend was explaining to me that I was basically getting close with the owner of the really nice house, he’s telling me how’s she’s some high level investment banker and how she’s worth millions of dollars. As soon as I heard this I felt deflated, career wise this girl is leagues ahead of me. She’s well educated and independent. I work as a service tech for hvac with no college education making pennies compared to her. I texted her this morning and she immediately says how much fun she had Friday night and how she wants to hangout again. I’m scared to respond, because now I feel like I have to act like I even deserve to be in her presence.

jtothecast,2019-07-28 13:39:09+00:00,Wife physically prevented me from leaving a room and called me abusive when I tried to leave.,"Other day in the midst of an argument with wife I went into another room to get away. She followed me. As I tried to leave that room she blocked the door with her body and wouldn’t let me leave. I asked and said several times to move and that I want to leave. She refused to allow me free passage. When I made motions to leave the room she stepped in my way. I tried this a couple more times and same result. I then used my body to move out of the room by pushing it against hers. Very similar to a basketball move. She fought back and still prevented me from leaving. I had to grab onto the wall and door frame to help me move and she continued to fight me. 
I eventually got past her. I did not grab her in any violent way. I was not showing any signs of out right anger, rage or making threats of any kind.
 
She’s now claiming what I did was abusive towards her. 

Following day I was sitting in a chair and she stood in front of me. I told her to step back but she didn’t. I told her again and again to step back. She refused. I started getting angry and started shouting to back up and don’t touch me. She refused and then stuck her finger out to touch me but intentionally stopped short. Much like a sibling would do to annoy each other. 
I then pull out my phone and said if you don’t back up then I will dial 911. She still did not back up. I started yelling back up or I’ll call. She finally did after several threats like that. 

Next day she tells me I was manipulative and controlling and abusive by pretending to call 911. I did not pretend to call. I said I would call if she didn’t back up.

howdoiescapethrow,2019-07-28 09:50:02+00:00,I'm (28M) my gf (27F) of 5 years suggested we try swinging about a year ago because our sex life was not great. I was not in great shape when we started so I started working out. Now I'm in really good shape and my GF wants us to stop swinging because women want to hook up with me now.,"I'll try to keep this short. When we met, we were both in really amazing physical shape. She's naturally really fit and has the best features regardless of what she eats and even though she doesn't work out other than light jogging sometimes. She has a perfectly shaped and sized butt, slim legs and stomach, arms, etc and has DD breasts. As for me, when we met I was working out almost every day, eating very healthy, etc. I was built but thin and had visible abs, toned muscles, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So with any relationship, as you fall more in love, and get more comfortable you slow down on the self care sometimes. We moved in after 6 months. She wanted us to move into a nice condo that was more central to both of our work locations. But with that condo, it was more rent. She didn't have the option for overtime but I did. So I started working more hours. The more I worked, the less I felt like I wanted to work out and the less I had the desire to meal prep and count macros when I was working 14-18hr shifts everyday and taking one day off per week. So Over time, I lost the physique I had when we met.

&amp;#x200B;

Our sex life went off the deep end, we went from having sex 2-3 times a day to having sex maybe 2-3 times a week. We fought alot, she would drink alot, i would drink a lot. She would say that she wanted me to start working out again and I'd say ""okay then I need to work less"", but we were both accustomed to the lifestyle of all my overtime so she'd tell me to not work less and I was so used to the schedule of working 16ish hr shifts that even if I did cut down on hours, I'd probably just want to sleep. So nothing really changed. 

&amp;#x200B;

About 1.5years or so ago, she told me that she thought our relationship would improve if we had sex more often. So I would come home after work and try to initiate sex but she'd say I was covered in dirt and grease and to shower first. So I showered, then she'd say she wasn't in the mood anymore. I'd try to initiate it when I woke up and she'd say she needed more sleep. So after 6 months of consistently trying to initiate sex all the time and her turning me down all the time, I just stopped. I felt like I shouldn't be the only one initiating it plus it was upsetting that she always turned me down. 

&amp;#x200B;

Around this time, I was working on a project and had to work out of town. I was chill with it because it was all prevailing wage and I was making a bunch of money. I was gone sunday evening and got home friday evening, sometimes saturday morning. So the first week, on a Wednesday i think? She called me and we were talking for a while and she said she was really horny and masturbating wasn't enough. Then the next week, midweek, we were talking on the phone again and she talked about how she thinks her ""bitchy attitude"" is because she doesn't get enough sex. She said something like ""well since you're in a different city, and going to be out of town for the week for a couple months, you should make a tinder, find a girl and get laid. and I'll also get laid and then we won't fight as much because we won't be so frustrated sexually."", now as I think about it, I believe she said I should get a ""mistress"" and she could get a ""manstress"". I believe my exact words were ""uh fuck no"". Though, to this day, she denies those conversations ever happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

So a couple weeks later, right as I was nearing finishing the profect, she suggests swinging. I was on the fence at first but thought about it and If she is getting laid by random guys and stops being such a bitch about stuff and I get laid with random girls and she's okay with it, then that's a win-win. Except it didn't work out that way. We came up with some rules. 

1.) We had to approve of the person sleeping with our partner

2.) Always use a condom unless said person could verify with current paperwork that they were clean

3.) If for literally any reason we didn't like the person, her or I could stop her or i from hooking up with that person, even if we were already in the middle of hooking up. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, my gf would pick a guy she was attracted to. Which most of the time were men that were way more attractive than me. Some of them had a wife/gf. Out of the 4 guys that I know of the she slept with, they all had wives and they all weren't interested in me. They would want to watch their husband with my gf but not interested in being with me, probably because I was so severely out of shape. I would say I'm not comfortable with this and she'd always like idk pressure me into letting her sleep with the guy. So We'd go to these parties once a month, and she'd either sleep with a man or do foreplay with a man. And I just felt idk kind of alone. Because I wasn't getting anything out of it. I mean her overall mood improved. We never fought, like at all. I mean before the swinging, if I put a dirty dish in the sink instead of in the dishwasher, she used to start a 45min scream about how I never clean up and never help around the house(even though I was the one who did 90% of the daily chores). But that completely stopped once we did the swinging.  

&amp;#x200B;

So I started working out and doing meal prep again, cut all sugar out of my diet, cut down on the gluten, etc about 9 months or so ago, and now i'm in really good shape. Honestly better shape than I was when I met my gf. Slowly, as I started getting in better shape, she would suggest the swinger parties a little less (but would still turn me down for sex) and when we did go, she would always come up with an excuse as to why she didn't want me to hook up w/ a woman that wanted to hook up with me. And since we came up with the golden rule, that if either of us didn't want the other to hook up w/ a person for any reason, we wouldn't.

""I really just don't like her. She's such a bitch to me, we should just go home""

""Her husband/bf is really creepy. He wants us to watch you and her""

""Her husband/bf said that she had chlamydia last year and even though you're gonna use protection I'm just not comfortable cause you might get it""

""I think I know her from somewhere, I'm not sure where but it'll be awkward if I run into her in public""

Or my favorite

""She wants to have sex with you in the hot tub and I didn't bring a swimsuit and I'm not comfortable with her bf seeing me naked"" (Which is fun because she had sex with said bf months prior at one of the parties.)

Etc, etc, etc. Just excuses

&amp;#x200B;

So when I was not fit and was working all the time to provide for our life, she didn't want to have sex and wanted to have sex with other men under the ruse of ""I'll stop being so difficult"". Now that I'm in good shape and attractive and attractive women want to sleep with me, she is not into it anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

We went to a party last night and a woman, who was very attractive, came on to me very hard, and my gf said she was feeling really sick and wanted to go home and take some nyquil and go to sleep. On the drive home, she told me that she was 100% done with swinging and that she never wanted to do it again. And I quote/summarize this:

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm just not really into this anymore. It was fun at first but most of these people are weird and I don't want us to do this anymore.""

She also mentioned that she got really jealous seeing women that were more attractive than her wanting to sleep with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess I need advice on this because I don't really understand it all. I mean, I agreed to it because I was down with having sex with other women and okay with her sleeping with other men as long as it was mutually beneficial and if it would improve our relationship. It improved our relationship but I was also upset because I wasn't really *benefiting* from it until I got in better shape while my gf was benefiting from it the whole time. I slept with 0 women during this whole thing while she slept with 4 men that I know of (and by ""that I know of"" I mean that I got home from work late a few times and she was already at the party and I met up with her later, she said she didn't sleep with anyone but who knows). 

So why exactly would she be okay with us sleeping with other people when I was dad bod status and not okay when I'm fit?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My gf suggested swinging to improve our relationship and slept with other men, I was overweight and didn't sleep with anyone. When I started working out and got fit, she made us stop swinging because attractive women wanted to sleep with me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ciu1ga/im_28m_my_gf_27f_of_5_years_suggested_we_try/,relationship_advice,1337,356,0.0
dumbthrowaway84822,2019-07-28 09:01:10+00:00,Fiancé has Dropbox folder of all nudes and of sexually explicit acts from all of his past exes and hookups—including coworkers who doesn’t know he has them and women he’s said he’s never been with.,"Me: 30F
Fiancé: 38M

We’ve been together for 5+ years and engaged for just the past few months. Throughout the course of our relationship, a few women would constantly reach out to him. When I asked about them, he told me that they were just friends and that nothing had happened between them. 

This past week, I was playing a game we play together on his iPad when a questionable text came in. I went into the text messages and found out that he had been lying about talking to and grabbing lunches with one of his current friends from work. Being really angry and insecure about it I then went through his phone. We have access to each other’s phones to play each other’s dumb games when one of us isn’t felling well but I have always respected his privacy up until this point.

What I discovered was a Dropbox folder with a bunch of folders with women’s initials. In each folder was pictures of nudes his ex’s and hookups had sent him, pictures of him or her performing sexual acts on each other, and pictures of me that were taken while I was so black out drunk I couldn’t remember them being taken. 

Several of the women in the photos were women he swore up and down to me were just childhood friends/coworkers and that I had nothing to worry about even though he had daily conversations with one and the other would text him heart and I love you’s. 

After some discussion he admitted that some of the pictures he had taken off of his coworkers computer without their consent. He is an IT professional with access to all of his coworkers computers. 

I checked through time stamps and I don’t believe any of this was sent during the duration of our relationship together. I am still very upset that he lied about his relationship level with several people and the pictures he had of me and that he violated his coworker’s privacy as well.  He insists he has never gone back to this folder while we were together. I feel like I’d be very disturbed if I were one of these women and knew that he still had these photos. 

Regarding the original girl, he just didn’t want to tell me because he thought I’d be mad. I am much madder that he lied than that he has a female friend that he gets lunch with.  After we hashed this out, I asked him if there was anything else he was lying about or hiding from me or if there’s anything else I should know and I wouldn’t get mad. He lied. Two days later I found this personal porn stash. 

I am so shocked and have no idea what to make of this situation. Am I making a bigger deal out of this than it really is? Is this grounds for ending the engagement? The relationship as a whole? Part of me wants to tell these other women what he did but at the same time I just forced him to delete the whole folder permanently so it couldn’t be restored. 

He claims that he had a sex addictions the time that he was still working through as we started dating which I’m sure I can believe but I don’t have any experience with this but I’m just so overwhelmed and caught off guard that I don’t know how to make a rational decision right now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/citoye/fiancé_has_dropbox_folder_of_all_nudes_and_of/,relationship_advice,12542,2066,0.0
steponmyflowers,2019-07-28 01:23:49+00:00,My (17M) twin sister (17F) has been sleeping in my bed with me,"We're fraternal (obviously) and we've always been really close. Her boyfriend unexpectedly died in an accident about two weeks ago, which has made her so sad that she can barely function. 

The day after he died, she knocked on my door at like 3 AM. When I told her to come in, all she said was ""I can't be alone in my room for one more second"". Then she climbed onto my bed, got under the sheets, and went to sleep. I didn't protest or say anything, I just let her do what she wanted. 

After that night, she slept in my bed every night for about four nights. It was the same situation each time. She'd come in my room and not really ask, she'd just get in my bed and go to sleep. Sometimes she'd say something like ""talk about anything to distract me until I fall asleep"". She doesn't sleep in my room every night anymore, but she does it every few nights. She did it two nights ago and I'm pretty sure she'll do it again.

I have a king sized bed so it's not like she's too close to me or anything, we don't even touch all night and it doesn't really make me uncomfortable, but I'm just wondering if this is normal for someone who's grieving.

I no longer can work and have been denied SSDI twice and am on a waiting list for an appeal. I have no health insurance and no income of my own. My wife works 2 jobs as a Mental Health Case Manager, which pays well, but has no benefits because they work as contractors. I can barely leave the house now at this point due to migraines and seizures. 

 So, onto the story. I'm laying on my bed reading and she comes in out of nowhere and lies down next to me and wants to cuddle. I'm like, ok, why not. We talk for a few minutes and she just bluest out, ""I need to tell you something, but you'll hate me forever"". I new what she was going to say, but I said ""ok, what"". She says ""I was feeling vulnerable and I slept with the brother of one of my clients"". Then she starts crying and telling me that she has been thinking about it for 2 weeks and it's the worst thing she's ever done, she hates herself, it's ok if I hate her and want her to leave, do I still love her, and all that. Now, understand, CTE is a disease that makes handling anger very hard. I was a rock. I simply said, ""you've had 2 weeks to think about this, I'm a guy dying of CTE who just found out his wife cheated on him, I need a little time"". She stayed right there and kept crying and hugging me and saying sorry, but my anger was only growing. That man knew the whole story also. She fucked up, but he's a fucking dirtbag. I'm having a very hard time controlling myself right now. Not much is stopping me from hurting this man badly. I would go to a nut hut and get medical care at the very worst. I'm trapped in the marriage until I die, I have no income, the house is in my name, I have no insurance, I can't pay for anything, we have 3 kids. She can basically do what she wants. I'm stuck. I love her but it hurts. I'm still able to have sex, but she's ""afraid to hurt me"" so she hasn't touched me in months. I will probably die without having sex again ever. I'm just completely lost right now. My 7 year old son is the only thing that keeps me from ending it. This isn't helping.

zinaMM,2019-07-27 11:22:45+00:00,Ex refuses to accept we are over and proposed at my graduation,"Well the title says it all. 
I'm still new to Reddit so bear with me. 

A while ago I posted about how my ex [28M] wanted children and I [27F]do not, I already have one. We had plenty of discussions and arguements which turned nasty. I told him I no longer wanted to be with him. You'd think that was the end of it. 

He decided we were still together. He would turn up at my house, do my food shopping, pop up randomly all things that made me slightly scared if I'm honest with you. Even to the point I started asking my son's dad to let me son stay with him more often whilst I try and file harassment charges against my current ex. 

Sadly police can only do so much as they seemed I wasn't in immediate danger (I have no idea of they're just stupid or I'm simply not important enough). Cue me literally playing hide and seek with this guy. 

Now onto my graduation, it's taken me a good 9byears to finally finish uni, lots of hardships including being homeless, having a baby, and just being broke meant a 3 year degree turned into well 9. So as you can imagine this meant the world to me.
Suprise suprise guess who not only turned up at my graduation, but he tried to start a fight with my son's dad for being there. He brought his family members, whom I do not like. But the but that takes the absolute biscuit, this inconsiderate a**hole decided to get on his knee and propose. 

I'm so upset, he took what was meant to be my day and selfishly made it about himself. So I now have 2 choices, I keep going to the police in hopes he will leave me alone. Or I pack my bags and move to a different city. The only downside is starting again and my son will see his dad less.

unconcernedhusband,2019-07-27 08:12:26+00:00,UPDATE: My husband got a sex doll,"Well, it’s been rough, but here goes.

Sometime yesterday or the day before, my wife posted a story about how I got a sex doll because she didn’t have libido and couldn’t bring herself to have sex as often as I wanted. She posted it on four different subs, with her post here on relationship advice garnering the most attention. Here’s what actually happened.

Firstly we haven’t been married 7 years. I feel this was a lie she told so she could pass it off as a long relationship. We’ve been married for just four years. When we first started dating, her sex drive was almost as high as mine. Still wasn't close but it wasn't this bad. We got married and it was still the same. After the second year, she just suddenly became more detached and less affectionate. The sex wasn't the only thing, but it became telling when we would only have sex once a month.

So I asked her to go to therapy with me. She obliged after much convincing, but she barely made any progress. We came to a compromise with the therapist, where we would tab when we wanted to have sex on a sort of wall note, and then the other person would have to eventually answer this at their own time and preference. If the tab remained on the wall longer than a week there would be a penalty(which is private). As at the time I'm.writing this post, I have about 17 unanswered tabs. She just began ignoring them. (I only added this sort because most of the replies involved advice on us going to therapy. Been there, done that)

So what happened was I came to her and told her if she wasn't interested in sleeping with me I might as well get divorced. Now here's the tricky part. She's an immigrant. She got her green card through me. As at when I told her I had forgotten that she would need me to renew it. She broke down in a crying fit and begged me to reconsider. She told me she was just going through a lot she didn't want to talk about. I felt bad and I told her it was fine and I still loved her. However, that was when I decided to get the sex doll.

I regret not telling her before I did it, honestly I do, but her follow up reactions made me lose all form of regret. She got mad and told me to get rid of it and get a fleshlite. She told me it was like a real human being and I was cheating on her with it. She began telling her friends that I'm a loser who needs a sex doll. She showed me her friends opinions and they mostly sided with her. I told her they were biased.

She comes to me the next day telling me a bunch of internet strangers on her relationship forum agree with her, and that I was being a misogynistic pig. I ask to see the forum and she tells me she logged out of the account and forgot her password. I told her my mind is made up. She comes to me with “I know you’re doing this to get me to sleep with you and that’s sexual coercion”. Apparently something on twitter made about how a boyfriend kept begging his girlfriend for sex blew up and the comments were about how that’s wrong and it’s sexual coercion and rape. I became paranoid that she could actually accuse me of this.

When she was gone, I logged onto her computer to see if I could actually check what she posted. When I stumble upon her Reddit(with the same password as her laptop which I've known for a while), I'm dumbfounded. Hear me out, I know it's wrong for me to Snoop, but she posted the altered version of our story on four different boards, with the only one agreeing with her being the radical feminist Gendercritical. She has probably deleted the posts now but I saved the links and I think the one she posted on AITA makes a copy of the original message. Here are the posts:

When i confronted her about it she went into a rage on how I'm an asshole for invading her privacy and I should really consider her feelings. Okay, that was fine. What really pissed me off to no ends was this:

spanishpatatahead,2019-07-26 23:27:45+00:00,I(30F) found out that my husband(35M) of 10 years has been cheating for over 2 years with my little sister (21F) who is now pregnant at the same time as me.,"I don't even know where to start. I am shaking right now and can't keep a straight though. So sorry for all the spelling mistakes.


My husband and I have been married for 10 years and together for over 15 years. I was 15 he was 20. I know it's weird but we lived in a small town where that was not out of the norm.

When my family moved in 2006  he decided to come with us so he wouldn't leave my site. I was so head over heals for him. We got married in 2009 and a few weeks ago I found out I was pregnant. He was so happy . Or so I thought.

My husband and I have a very open phone policy. That means that I take his when mine is dead to watch videos or he takes mine to text his buddies. So I never had any kind of doubt on him.

He often goes to business trips and sends me pictures of the events his room etc. So again there no ground for distrust. And I knew all his work friends and trusted them.

So that brings us to sunday morning. I was doing some extensive chores. Like spring cleaning. I was emptying every closet to rearrange it. When I came to his sock drawer I found a phone that I didn't recognize. Didn't tick alarm bells as this was a nice Samsung phone and by no means a burner. I left it on top of his drawer and continued.

So yesterday when I came back from the gym(no wild gym session just some soft exercises) I dropped my phone in the toilet. I tried to salvage it by putting it in a bag of rice.
So now I was out of a phone and I had the brilliant idea to boot up the one I found in my husband's drawer to keep connected. So I took out my Sim and charged the phone. Immediately as the lock screen showed, my heart dropped to my stomach. It was a picture of him and my sister on the maldives (same resort we went to on our honeymoon).
I began going trough everything. The gallery, the notes and specially an app called line. It's something like WhatsApp but I think it works with an ID rather than with a number.

My husbands only contacts were my little sister and his best friend.
The chat was fucking disgusting. They send each other graphic pictures, said how much they loved each other. I was livid. I scrolled and scrolled and scrolled in the hope that this had only been going on for a few weeks. No. 2 years. 2 fucking years. The first message on this line app was from a year ago but it said

""happy anniversary baby. It has been the happiest year in my life. You are going to love our trip""

I felt sick to my stomach. How dared he say it was the happiest year.
I just broke down. Then I looked at the chats from him an his best friend.
Apparently all the fotos he send me of the conferences he was in, came from his best friend to cover. Husband  would take pictures of his room and his face.

I didn't know what to do so I just called my mother sobbing and having a panic attack. My mother rushed to my apartment on the spot because she thought something did happen to the baby.
Once she callmed me Down I could explain. What had happened. At first she didn't want to belive me, but I showed her everything. Even the pictures In the gallery.

My mother cried with me . She couldnt believe my sister had done this to me.

She had dinner with me and we drove to our family home, where we told dad. I don't know if that was the best as dad is pretty conservative and for him this was such a big sin that he could have dissowend my sister.

He called her and told her to come ASAP. Didn't tell her why tho. He was very silent and drank some whiskey. I was still crying with my mother. The phone on the table.

My sister came in as if nothing. She came to were we where sitting and wanted to say something when she saw our faces. That bitch really had the audacity to ask
""omg... Op what's wrong??? Is it your baby?""
I don't know what came over me but I just stood up and slapped her as hard as I could. My dad had to restrain me.
She started screaming ""what the fuck is wrong with you"". And then all hell broke loose. My father  started tearing her a new one. Showing her the messages the videos and repeating ""you are a disgrace for this family! How could you"".
She didn't say anything she cried. My father threw the phone in her face and then Took it between his finger, made her look at me and screamed.
""fucking look at her! Tell her why you did it!""
She just cried more. I cried. My mom cried.

Then she said the worst thing possible ""I couldn't help it. We fell in love""

That's when I lost it. I told her she was dead to me and stormed out.
My mom tried to call after me but I just took off. I walked so long that I couldn't feel my feet anymore and stayed the night at a motel eating junk and crying.

This morning my mom came to pick me up. She sat me down and told me that my sister was pregnant and that she was going to keep the baby.
I asked mom if she had told her why  she did it. My mom said that the only thing my sister said all night long was that she loved my husband and was going to keep the baby.

I know I have to leave him. But what now? I don't fucking know what to do. My life is over. How do I Confront him? Do I really cut my sister off my life? I don't know if I could ever look him In the face again.i don't know if I should keep my baby. I am just at a loss.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cia6hx/i30f_found_out_that_my_husband35m_of_10_years_has/,relationship_advice,1326,397,0.0

Every morning I wake up hours before him and every night we go to bed at the same time. I’m exhausted, sleep deprived, and depressed. I’ve tried talking to him so many times.","I moved in with him 6 months ago- into a shitty apartment in a shitty part of town. We had plans to move into our own place 2 months later. (Our leases ended at different times and now he’s month to month), clearly he has no plans on moving anymore and clearly doesn’t want to. He claims he does want to move, but can’t afford it yet. Months ago when we were planning, he never said it would be a problem. 

I do all the cleaning and shopping. I’ve asked him to split groceries and stuff with me and he never manages to actually give me the money or says he has to wait till he gets paid. Now I’m kinda tight on money which gives me anxiety. 

He plays video games all day while I work all day. He complains we don’t have sex enough and that I work too much. He’s annoyed when I go to bed early. 

I get home an hour after him (and leave for work like 4-6 hours before him). He complains about his job and says he’s tired from work or that his job is so hard, I listen and support him. But when I talk about work he gets mad and says all I ever do is talk about work. And again says I work too much. So I don’t mention it anymore.

I’ve asked him for help, nothing comes of it. I’ve told him I’m depressed, he has nothing to say. 

I love him so so so much, and I love his/our puppy so so much, it’s breaking my heart to write this post.

SunshineMama1976,2019-07-26 05:57:02+00:00,My husband cheated on me with a teenager. It happened to me.,"Hello everyone. I was googling about my ordeal and I came across this site so decided to sign up and ask for advice. Thank you to everyone who will answer.

I am 43 years old, my husband turns 50 in 8 days. We have been married for 17 years and we have two daughters aged 16 and 9.

I am a mess. I haven’t been able to do anything ever since I found out 3 days ago. My younger girl thinks I’m sick because I’ve called in sick at work and I’ve been in bed most of the time. My older one knows something is up but I can’t bear to tell her what it really is.

My husband has gone to visit his father in order to give me some space to think. Immediately after finding out I thought of getting a divorce but then I thought of the children, particularly my younger girl. I don’t want to raise her in a dysfunctional family especially since shes very close to her father. But my husband repulses me now. If I think of him at all I see red. I thought he was happy. I would have sex with him 3 times a week when I didn’t want to. And then he goes to repeatedly sleep with a girl his daughter’s age over a 2 month period, behind my back, thinking I’d never find out. 

I need ways to cope if you can suggest them. And reassurance that I’m doing the right thing for my children by staying. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/chz1k8/my_husband_cheated_on_me_with_a_teenager_it/,relationship_advice,1697,780,0.0
Feelshittyrightnww,2019-07-26 01:36:08+00:00,My (23M) GF (25F) made me have sex while she’s on her period. I feel kinda gross now?,"I don’t know if I’m just being an overly sensitive twat here but what was previously an amazing relationship with my GF has really taken a turn for the worse.

A few nights ago we got home from a few drinks (not drunk or anything) and my GF wanted to have sex. I knew she was on her period and told her I wasn’t comfortable having sex with her then and we should wait a few days. She kept insisting and got quite aggressive (verbally, not physically) about wanting sex. I eventually relented just so she’d let me sleep as it was getting quite uncomfortable talking to her.

The act itself wasn’t very enjoyable, and when I pulled out after finishing I noticed my entire penis was bloody. Like, not dripping with blood, but as if someone had smeared blood over it. It made me feel sick and I immediately took a shower. 

When she saw how I reacted she got really upset and accused me of being a poofta, though that might have been the alcohol talking as she is a lightweight. The next morning I acted distant, not intentionally to make her feel bad, I just felt shit.

She confronted me about why I am distant and I explained that the previous night made me feel sick with myself. She said I was being sexist and that she has to deal with that every month. I guess she has a point.

I like my GF a lot and don’t want this to ruin our relationship. How should I move on with this while also letting her know she crossed a boundary?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/chwjyh/my_23m_gf_25f_made_me_have_sex_while_shes_on_her/,relationship_advice,6193,1819,0.0
KillustratedPixie,2019-07-25 17:51:57+00:00,UPDATE: (35M) CrashBandiChild claims I was merely setting a fire for attention.,"You guys? I can't. 

First of all, I want to say a huge THANK YOU for the responses I received on my last post. It is below for your reference in case you missed the comedic shitshow that is this recent life experience. 

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/cgw77v/my\_32f\_boyfriend\_35m\_got\_in\_an\_accident\_in\_my\_car/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cgw77v/my_32f_boyfriend_35m_got_in_an_accident_in_my_car/) 

I was straight up blown away by the support, suggestion, and compassion I was shown by total strangers. Some of y'all had me DYING laughing in one of the shittiest times of my adult life. A VERY kind gentleman from Scotland even offered to pay for my daughter to and I to go out to a nice meal together because he noticed in the thread that I mentioned I was a single mom. Reddit rules. 

So. I know most of you said ghost him, but I just couldn't. While undoubtedly that is what he deserved, I needed to hear from his perspective why he thought any of this was okay before I could close the door. And honestly, I am glad I did because it solidified for me that 

His avoidance of the situation was explained by his thinking it wasn't that big of a deal. He said that he didn't understand why this lady was making such a big fuss about her bumper, and that I was unreasonably upset about it and he didn't want to talk about it until I had ""calmed down"". Oh. Hell. No. I kept it together until I got his side of the story. According to him, they were both backing out of their parking spots and smacked into each other. He was all the way out of his spot, she was halfway out of hers when BANG. I literally DIALED THE PHONE AND SAT WITH HIM while he called the insurance rep and gave his statement. He was found at fault due to his being all the way out of the spot. I am not 100% sure what this means for me, my policy, or my pocket yet. 

As far as the relationship - done. When he came over to talk I had all his things packed up. I tried to explain how hurt and disappointed I was about his actions, and told that I could no longer trust him because of how terribly he handled this situation. He said, I shit you not, ""Oh, please. You just set a fire and expected me to come to your rescue and put it out and when I didn't you threw a fit. I'm sorry. I just didn't have the energy to put out your fire."" THIS IS YOUR GOD DAMN FIRE SET BY YOUR SHITTY ACTIONS AND FUELED BY YOUR AVOIDANCE. I burst into tears, handed him his bag, and said I needed him to leave. Now.  I told him anything of mine left at his place he can throw away, or leave there until his next victim or mother comes and cleans it for him. 

Speaking of his mother, I did listen to you and craft a very detailed email to her with him CC'd. I explained what happened, and then asked her for his Driver's License number and policy name and ID number just in case its needed. Her response was, ""I am very sorry that you are having to deal with all this, but I don't see how this is our problem if it was your car"". I feel like this whole family are a bunch of lizard people sent to Earth to make me question my reality.

Anyway. Single at 32 again. Woot. I am **sad as fuck**, but trying to focus on the plus side as someone said ""cutting a bunch of deadass weight"". Thanks again for all the love and laughs. 

Oh - and yes - once it is determined how much this is going to affect my rates and my pocket, I will be taking his cartoon quoting ass to small claims court. I have already spoken to my attorney about it. 

Much Love,

RedArmyRevolution,2019-07-25 11:06:42+00:00,How do I repay my boyfriend for his kindness?,"Throwaway because I don't want him to see this 

My boyfriend (29) and I (25F) have been dating around 6 months. I go to school full time and work part time and he works full time and a fair bit of overtime as well. We don't have conventional 9-5 jobs so our weekends are harder to align together to be able to see each other. I have PCOS (ovarian cysts which make periods delightfully awful) and am on the pill to treat it but sometimes they have a mind of their own.

Last week, by some miracle we both had 3 days off together. Excited to make the most of it, he planned a hike and a big lunch after for day one, and two full days of being lazy, eating and having sex, all in front of the tv. Sounded perfect. 

Well morning of day one he was going to pick me up and we'd be off on our hike, but as soon as I woke up, the beaches of Normandy had been stormed. It was D-Day. 2 days early. Absolutely fan-fucking-tastic. I am crap at remembering to take the pill, this is my own fault.

Because of our haywire schedules and limited time together I had successfully managed to not see him when the Bolsheviks invaded. We hadn't even had the conversation about what happens for us during the invasion (do we have sex or not). But I couldn't do that this week. We hadn't seen each other in 2 weeks it was starting to frustrate both of us.

I was miserable, I wanted to down an entire bottle of Midol and stay in bed. I texted him, ""Morning! Please don't hate me but could we hang out tomorrow instead and still do our weekend thing? My stomach is absolutely killing me right now"". 

He called when saw the text this is almost verbatim our conversation.

Him: shit, what's wrong??
Me: Nothing, I just woke up and my stomach is all crampy. It happens sometimes, I'll be fine tomorrow. I just need to stay in bed and not move very much.
Him: Did you eat something off yesterday?
Me: I don't think so, it will be fine tomorrow don't worry.
Him: You could still come over. We don't have to do the hike. We'll wear socks and slide around. Or I will and you can watch me 
Me: I really want to see you but I'll be shit company. 
Him: shut up you're never shit company. (Pause) Yo are you on your period?
Me: yeah ugh. How did you know?
Him: (laughs) take a shower. I'm coming to get you. 45 minutes okay?
Me: yeah it's okay. you're fine with me just being moody on your couch?
Him; yeah bitch. 45 minutes. Go.

I asked him how he figured out in the car and he said that once a month I'd get really weird about seeing him even if had time off and he thought horses when he heard hooves, not zebras. 

He handed me a bottle of Midol as soon as I got into his car  A liquor store stop and an hour later I was on his couch, good and drugged up, cradling a heating pad like the baby my uterus longed me to have, hating myself for being such miserable company and annoyed at him for making me want to see him so badly. He had disappeared into the kitchen while I repeatedly stabbed his undeserving remote combing through Netflix. He came back clutching a mug of some orange lemon tea that smelt like summer in one hand and a big plate of French fries in the other, looking very pleased with himself and rightfully so. I would have jumped up and hugged him had I not actively been trying to stop my uterus from self destructing. We traded the tea for the remote. He put on a Hitchcock movie to distract me, We wrapped up in a blanket and cuddled.

We took a break midway through to use the bathroom and smoke. The pain had considerably subsided by then. When we were outside he asked if I wanted to try some yoga to help with the pain. I told him it might feel a little awkward doing it, knowing he'd see me. So he OFFERED TO DO IT WITH ME. He'd found a whole bunch of videos on YouTube and downloaded them all. I should add that he's a big muscular guy, goes to the gym very regularly and loathes stretching but afaik begrudgingly does it. He's the guy who will tell you to never skip leg day.

Some of them required a fair bit of bending in awkward positions. We did them together, there were mock wails of wounded pride from him after he couldn't fold his legs for more than 10 seconds and from later almost falling over in a seated position. It was fun, he tried to give the poses new names, tried to bark during downward dog and ended up farting instead. That made us both laugh. It was the cutest thing, watching him laugh and fart with pride. It helped my pain, I'd forgotten how miserable I was and was just so grateful for him and his company. I told him how amazing he was and how much I appreciate what he was doing and just brushed it off. 

I woke up before him and wanted to wake him up to a cooked breakfast as a thank you and decided on cinnamon french toast. He eats eggs and toast for breakfast most of the time, and even though french toast is those ingredients they're strictly only for special occasions. It's his absolute favorite breakfast. I prep and wait for him to wake up.

When he wakes up and goes to the bathroom, I heat up the pan and begin toasting the first slice. He smells the cinnamon, comes running, sliding on his socks into the kitchen, screaming, ""CINNAMON BITCH"". He's so excited! I thank him once again for being so wonderful yesterday and hug him and he just brushes it off, more interested in breakfast. I have to practically push him out of the kitchen so I can serve him properly instead of tossing it on his outstretched plate like it's Oliver Twist.

I was raised to believe that getting your period was something really embarrassing and it has to be hidden away and never talked about; especially not with a boyfriend/male friend. He just blew all that up, didn't faze him, he was just his sweet ass self. In the past I've had my exes reschedule, get grossed out or straight up shame me for it, even if I said we didn't have to have sex, so this was so refreshing and thoughtful of him. 

I need to show him how much I appreciate what he did for me and saying thank you feels empty. He gets uncomfortable with verbal compliments.  I mean the man is acting like three slices of eggy cinnamon bread was a 7 course meal cooked by Wolfgang Puck and served by a naked Scarlett Johansson. I want him to know how much I appreciate him but don't know what to do.

My wife has more integrity than anyone I know. She wont even let us run both vehicles through a gas station for the full 30 gallons when we claim fuel perks.

But about two months ago she started texting another guy she met through work. She is in sales, he is a client. The dude is in an unhappy marriage and is clearly hitting on my wife. I have warned her about it, told her i am not a fan, but i am not going to babysit her and I trust her. She gives me regular updates abt how she keeps trying to help him fix his marriage. 

She has been dealing with a lot of stress. Sunday she disappeared for 3 hours. Claims she had a panic attack and just drove somewhere and then passed out. She said she had talked to the guy via text during her panic attack and he went looking for her but never found her... like i said i want to trust my wife, but then the following happened.

Today she was hospitalized, i came home she was passed out unresponsive and hyperventilating, remained that way for nearly an hour until she awoke.  Diagnosis was a severe panic attack. I grabbed her phone to take to the hospital and went to call her boss to let her know she wont be in. Her phone had a password lock on it. In the 7 years we have been married, neither of us have bothered to lock our phones. It wasnt any of our usual combinations either. So when she woke up i asked for the password and she said ""thats something I take to the grave."" 


She is hiding something from me and I dont know how to confront her about it. I let it go tonight because there were more important things going on, but i now am seriously concerned about this.

Tl;dr. Wife wont let me unlock her phone for the first time in 7 years of marriage.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/chjz4o/wife_suddenly_locking_phone/,relationship_advice,1426,569,0.0

Sooo I told Natalie that she has to either tell eric or I will. A shitty ultimatum. but I was very serious and even typed out a text to tell him and showed her. She said she was very certain it was his baby since apparently she only fucked Dylan PIV like three times, I guess I kept walking in on them and assumed it was more frequently than it was. But she told him herself. Which was a relief since I couldn’t do that. She told Eric that she wasn’t loyal but the baby was his and he was angry anyway and he broke up with Natalie. The thing was she was supposed to move in with him and all that so her plans were ruined. But yeah I guess he didn’t care after all if that was his baby or not since she cheated. Idk she was really sure that he was the father but neither wanted to pay for a paternity test since it’s expensive. Listen idk she said Dylan pulled out but she lets eric finish inside since she’s usually on birth control. 

She also cut our friendship after all that and hates me now. I asked some of our other friends and she’s probably gonna get an abortion because she can’t do it alone. Dylan found out and thinks it’s his baby and wants to be there for her but she basically told him that he’s nothing to her and fuck off and never talk to her again. He still likes her , I don’t know why since she’s mean to him and he could get any other girl but he liked her since elementary school. 

So yeah. Everything kinda sucks. I was looking forward to being an auntie. And I lost my best friend. Can’t believe she’s having an abortion. I wish I could be there for her to help her thru it since I know she’s scared but she hates me now.

lavrene,2019-07-24 18:59:17+00:00,My fiancé told me that marital rape laws are “bullshit”,"My fiancé( m, 26) and me (f, 23) have been together for a couple years. But he said something to me the other night that was a little crazy. I was in the kitchen cooking and he was at the table and the news was on. They were talking about some man who got sentenced for raping his wife.

My boyfriend said, “that’s bullshit there’s no such thing as raping your wife”. 

I said, “how?” And he said something like “part of being a good wife is having sex”

I left it alone and went back to what I was doing but I still am thinking of it. It kind’ve scares me. I don’t want him to get any ideas. Im trying to think of the times I’ve said no to him and looking back his reactions were not great with this in mind.

snapchatsadness,2019-07-24 09:59:21+00:00,Husband has a 100k snap score with a woman I’ve never heard of; please advise,"This is going to be a hot unedited mess and I’m sorry. I can’t even believe I am writing this, but I need some advice and I am too embarrassed to ask my friends. Throwaway because he’s on reddit. 

I (F 29) have been living with my husband (32M) for 7 years, married for 3.

Lately, he has been using Snapchat quite a bit. I didn’t have the app on my phone (deleted it a few years ago) and we haven’t used it to communicate with one another in quite some time. He said he uses it to bullshit around with his work friends. I didn’t want to give him a hard time about that because we’re still new to town and I want him to establish friendships. But I have noticed that lately he seems to close the app when I’m around and he’s been kinda cagey with his phone. 

The other morning before I was even fully awake, I woke up and went to the bathroom right after him. I noticed that he left his phone in the bathroom, which is something he rarely does. I felt compelled to go through it, which is something I have not done for years (but I do admit I have gone through it in the past, twice, several years ago). I was not really thinking, but I found myself navigating to snap chat. 

I looked at his recent conversations and there was a woman’s name I didn’t recognize. I was instantly hurt, but tried to give the benefit of the doubt. I looked at his best friends list and she was one of two people on it. I was super unfamiliar with how Snapchat works (the app seems to have been redesigned a lot since I last used it and I never was a regular) so I didn’t think to replay their most recent snap , if that’s even still possible. But I saw enough to be deeply sketched out by the fact that my husbands most contacted friend on the disappearing message app was a woman I’ve never heard of. 

I freaked out, yelled at him “who is (name)?!”, and he looked totally surprised. I was screaming and crying and he left for work. Over text that day he tried to tell me the following things about her: 

1. She is a lesbian.
2. She is the biological mother of a 2 year old child. 
3. He knew her because she was one of the higher ups at his last job (I looked up her LinkedIn, she’s an assistant manager )
4. It wasn’t a big deal because they rarely spoke and he only did so to get the inside scoop to help his sales numbers. He said sometimes he would chat her small talk to not be so obvious about only talking to her to get ahead at work. 
5. She wouldn’t even notice if he deleted the app 

Well I was devastated anyway and spent the whole day crying and arguing with him over text. We really got into it, him calling me a psycho and telling me that it’s all in my head. It just wasn’t adding up to me. I felt sick. He went straight from work out with his friends that night and was snapping little stories (19 of them) of the event they were attending while ignoring my texts. I noticed that his snap score was rising quickly while he was out. He told me I only downloaded the app again to monitor him which is true.  

He found excuses to be out of the house for the next day and a half, broke up with me in the heat of the moment and then took it back, then finally agreed to hash things out with me. He maintained that he never went outside of the relationship with anyone, especially not her. I made him agree to open Snapchat in front of me and show me their score. He told me that he deleted the app and her phone number. I told him to re download it and he finally agreed after much debate. 

He put it off for another day and went back on his word several times, saying he changed his mind and shouldn’t have to prove anything and that I’m crazy. We argued constantly about it. I slept on the couch. He went on a two hour run as soon as he got home from work today and came back when it was after dark. He is leaving in the morning for a 2 day business trip. 

I finally said I didn’t trust him anymore and I was going to leave if he wasn’t willing to be open with me.  He did everything he could to delay talking to me, but finally after a few hours (and many tears and arguments) he re downloaded the Snapchat app. I told him to search her name and he did and he had already de friended her.  No surprise, he had deleted all his conversations for the past 17 weeks too. I called him out on this and he admitted to “downplaying” how much they talked but couldn’t tell me any examples of what they talked about. I got mad and could tell he had been covering his tracks and insisted that he add her back. 

He kept refusing and I made him click on the “...” menu dnd happened to see that an option was “accept friend request”.  She had already sent him one!!!! 

We argued for another hour while I insisted that he accept it and as soon as he relented I saw that their score was over 100,000. Ours was 3k. Granted, we didn’t use it that much and I haven’t for years, but holy shit. 

They also had the “in touch” and “snap master” badges. 

AND HE HAD A MISSED SNAPCHATCALL FROM HER 2 HOURS AGO. (9pm on a Tuesday.)

I begged him to call her back from his Snapchat with me next to him so I could ask her for myself what is going on. He wouldn’t do it. He kept saying it would be embarrassing and that he knew I would freak out. We argued for hours until it was until he finally said he would, but in the morning because he needed to sleep (he’s going out of town for a few days early tomorrow morning for work.




So really what I want to know from people who do use Snapchat is how many snaps does it take to rack up 100k snap score? A shit ton of snaps, right?

Is there any conceivable reason outside of infidelity why my husband would snapchat a woman I’ve never heard of at this rate and keep it a secret? 

Is there anything a young mother of a toddler who is also apparently newly a lesbian would be interested in speaking with a straight married man who lives in another state about?

He’s obviously cheating on me, right?

Should I pack my shit up and dip while he’s gone?

Typing this out I feel like the biggest fucking idiot but I love him and I’m still hoping I’m the crazy one.

If anyone sees this thanks for reading. I can update after our phone call in the morning 🙃",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ch66qt/husband_has_a_100k_snap_score_with_a_woman_ive/,relationship_advice,1266,1026,0.0
jimmygymie,2019-07-24 03:42:50+00:00,I want to break up with my fiancée because she thinks it’s weird me and my sister slept on the same bed.,"Title basically says it all. 

I went to visit family in another state with my older sister and they had 1 guest bedroom with a king bed. Obviously I’m not going to make my sister sleep on the floor or couch and there was enough room for us to both sleep comfortably on the bed. 

I didn’t think anything of it as this is my sister-I clearly don’t see her in that way, when we were young we had sleep overs in our rooms all the time. 

When I was FaceTiming my fiancée she asked for a tour of my room, after I gave her the tour she asked to see the room my sister was staying in and I told her we were staying in here together. She asked if one of us was sleeping on the floor and I said no, we were sleeping on the bed together and she told me that was inappropriate and disgusting and that I basically had just confessed to cheating. I thought she was joking for a few minutes before I realized she was being dead serious and told her to knock it off and why in the hell she would even accuse us of something like that. She got even more mad at me and hung up. 

It’s been 3 days into the trip and I have not contacted her and this morning I woke up to a message from her best friend saying I was a disgusting, cheating prick and that there was something wrong with my family if I couldn’t understand why my fiancée was upset. 

Idk what to say. I’m bewildered and feel sick to my stomach that I even thought about marrying someone like this. How dare she specialize me and my sisters relationship. I can’t even think of it without getting a knot in my stomach and here she is throwing nasty claims around for her friend and possibly family to hear. Idk who the hell I proposed to, and idk how I’m going to face her to break off the engagement. 

Luckily my sister wasn’t in the room at the time and doesn’t know any of this happened. I’m thinking of just lying to my family and saying we broke up mutually. I can’t even bring up what vile shit my ex spewed to my family as I wanna puke every time I even try to see her point of view.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ch2xtl/i_want_to_break_up_with_my_fiancée_because_she/,relationship_advice,8328,1329,0.0
ChanceFigure,2019-07-23 19:29:28+00:00,Update: I'm (24F) getting jealous and insecure about my boyfriend's (21M) interactions as a personal trainer,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c7tc1y/_/

It's been a while.. Thanks for everyone who weighed in last time. I did decide to confront him the next day. He was a bit annoyed but said he understood, and he would try to tone down their interactions. Though I didn't tell him about seeing their Instagram stories, and I kept checking them and exactly nothing changed.. He was still posing for pictures, arms around them or the girls touching him. I was really upset at this point and .didn't know what to do. Then about 2 weeks ago he came home after the gym and went straight to the shower. His phone kept blowing up so I decided to go through his conversations.. Yep bad move I know. But this way I did find out he has been going behind my back. A bunch of messages from one of those girls how much she enjoyed the workout, and when he could meet up for another 'private' session.. Confronted him once again and at first he denied it, and eventually it turned into 'just a blowjob'. Like that makes it any better.. I told him I wanted him out, and he said he was going to make things right and asked for a second chance. I (stupidly) gave in after lots of crying and talking. We were going to keep open communication and work on trust.. 

Well yesterday I got a message from a DIFFERENT girl saying she was sorry but that my bf had been cheating on me with her. She claims she didn't know I existed and they were seriously dating. She sent me screenshots and yeah I was done right then and there. Again told him he had to leave, and he kept denying it until I showed the screenshots. Then he told me he never stopped seeing the fitness slut.. Yay me.. Anyway he's gone now at least, though I feel so utterly betrayed and broken. I bought into all of his lies too, maybe I'm easy to fool. Obviously it was never just a bj either. Sooo yeah thanks for the advice last time. Seems like many of you were right. I was already not in a good mood the past few months but this has made it 10x worse. Just feeling broken, like something is wrong with me. That I got cheated on again just fucks me up.

crudites_4_all,2019-07-23 02:00:03+00:00,I (37M) found out my wife (36F) has been renting out our condo to pornographers.,"This weekend I had a very awkward conversation with my brother over text, who told me he thought he'd recognized my home in a porn video. He sent me a link to the video in question and it is undoubtedly our living room. What gave it away was a unique mural my sister who's an artist had painted on one of the walls. The rest of the room had been transformed into one of those sterile stock-furniture porn sets, none of our stuff was in it but obviously it hadn't been possible to remove the mural. 

We live in a high-rise condo in Miami with a great view - the view of the city and ocean out the window in the video is the same as ours.

How the fuck did this happen? I confronted my wife because it clearly wasn't while I was there. I have a career that requires me to travel somewhat regularly, at least a few days a month. So it must have happened while I was away.

She first insisted I had to be mistaken. I showed her the video and even positioned her in the room from the same vantage point as the camera so she could see for herself how everything matched up exactly. 

Then she admitted the truth. She has allowed the use of our condo to multiple porn directors who had posted ads online looking for shoot locations. (Side question, is this even a thing that happens? Don't these guys have their own rentals specifically for doing porn?)

Anyway they've been coming during periods I'm away and having free reign of the place. She kept stressing no one ever went in our bedroom or used any of our furniture, but how do I know I can trust that? She said she ""usually"" wasn't at home when this happened so how would she herself even know what-all they did? And for the times she WAS here during it...why???

She opened a bank account (that she's kept hidden from me) where all the money from this goes. She's made tens of thousands of dollars from this gig! Never mentioned a word of it to me!!

I'm dumbfounded. I can't decide which is worse, the financial dishonesty (what is she stashing all this for??) or that out of all the possible ways to make money in this world, this was the idea she chose to go with. 

I did some more digging around and there's over a dozen videos set in our home on the porn site my brother linked me to. They've been uploaded by several different accounts. They all involve some pretty specific fetishes so it wasn't too hard to find them using keywords. In one of them there's a black leather couch that might be ours, can't tell for sure. That's just on this one site, who knows what else is out there on others. There are different people in most of the scenes. For months, there's essentially been a revolving door of strangers coming in and out of the place without my knowledge or agreement, having sex on camera in my home for the internet. The whole thing is extremely weird and gross to me. It feels like something personal to me has been violated. They could have stolen things. They could have set up hidden cameras. We have no way of knowing anything. My wife just blindly trusted these people.

But let's just say for the sake of the argument that she's right and they really never did anything bad: that doesn't change the fact that now our condo is in porn videos that anyone who knows us could come across. After all my fucking brother was the one who found it. 

How do I get her to understand this? She doesn't see the big deal, the only thing she's apologized for is not telling me about it. She doesn't see the problems with actually doing it in the first place.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cgmewd/i_37m_found_out_my_wife_36f_has_been_renting_out/,relationship_advice,5107,749,0.0
Doctor_Naptime,2019-07-22 13:01:37+00:00,I [32M] make significantly more money than my new girlfriend [26F] and it's causing problems,"Hi everyone. Long time lurker, first time poster. This may just be a problem I'm identifying in my head, and I know you all are good at cutting through bullshit, so hopefully you can help.

I'm an anesthesiologist in Washington, D.C. and make over 300k a year. Consequently, I live a comfortable life and, while I have a significant amount of medical school debt, am pretty financially stable for the foreseeable future. I'm glad to spend a little more than most would on special dinner, gifts, and things, because I'm pretty much guaranteed this salary for the rest of my career.

My gal works at a nonprofit and makes 55k a year. She's a bit of a penny pincher, happy to spend money on trips and dining out, but budgets religiously and tracks every penny she spends. 

We've been dating for about four months now, and it's going really well. I love spending time with her.

The issue is, I think she's uncomfortable with how much money I make. Whenever I take her on a date, I insist on paying for everything. This makes perfect sense to me, because money I spend to take her out is a drop in the ocean, but for her it would probably add up. But she sometimes doesn't let me or doesn't want me to pay. She'll insist on splitting the bill, or if I pay, she'll try and pay the next time we hang out. I've told her time and time again that I'm more than happy to pay for things, spending time with her makes me happy, and so I'd be glad to drop a couple hundred bucks a month on dinners, drinks, movies, etc. But she always insists that ""she can pay her own way"" and ""she doesn't need to be taken care of."" 

One time she had to miss a flight to visit a friend. It was nonrefundable and she was out $300. When she was complaining to me about it, I immediately offered to give her the $300 back, just so she wouldn't feel bad about losing the money, But she rejected me and said she just needed to vent. 

It's not really a problem in the grand scheme of things, I just think it's silly that she spends money on me when I make more in a year what she'll make in five. And like I said, I'm happy to treat her.

Any thoughts on how to navigate this? I especially would like to hear from people in relationships with huge income differences. 

tl;dr I make a lot more money that GF, but she won't let me pay for things.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cgcwwy/i_32m_make_significantly_more_money_than_my_new/,relationship_advice,10777,1864,0.0

CaptainLongshorts,2019-07-20 05:43:37+00:00,"I (M26) just got cheated on/dumped by girlfriend (F23). Have chance for revenge, should I take it?","Some quick context. My GF of 2 years had to drop out of uni last October due to money issues. I helped her move to my city to start fresh. After a few months of living separately and saving, we moved into an apartment together and she got an awesome job offer. Things were looking great. 

Her new job requires her to attend a 3 month training course on a campus in a different part of the country. She’s 2 weeks into this course and she’s just told me that she’s ending our relationship because she’s started fucking another trainee. This means I now have to move out of our apartment because I can’t afford to live here by myself (whereas she can). 

So I’ve lost my girlfriend and my apartment and naturally I’m pretty pissed. However I know that the training course she is on has a strict ‘no relationship’ policy amongst trainees, and is punishable by exclusion from the course. I’m contemplating sending an email to the company explaining the situation. I don’t have any proof but I’m sure if they monitored her she would get caught out soon enough and sent home. 

I don’t know whether or not to do it. I feel like she has just ruined my life, and as much as I’d like to walk away from this situation, part of me wants to get some payback.

lalu014,2019-07-19 19:45:04+00:00,After I (36F) told my Dad and Stepmom (both late 50s) about my engagement and their response triggered me to suddenly remember years of repressed childhood memories and now I do not know how to move forward with our relationship.,"Long post, but there's kind of a lot to this... 

Repressed childhood memories coming back? I have heard of this happening but I honestly never thought I'd experience it and holy shit this has been jarring.

My Dad and stepmom have been together since I was age 3, so 33 years.

My childhood was a disaster zone. I have lost large chunks of time where it is a big blank area. I thought it was maybe because I had to take so much Benedryl as a kid because my allergies were so bad that I didn't remember much. Now I think the memory loss is mostly trauma-related. Dark murky memories would come up but I have had no real timeline of my childhood. My mom was married many (many) times and we moved a lot and she had a baby and then another baby and then two more babies. I can sometimes piece together a home we lived in, or what school I went to when, but it is all a blur. I was both my parents first child and the baby of teenage marriage. There was alcoholism and drug use and chaos. Somethings have always stood out... Like the time a stepdad put a gun to my mom's head. Or, my sister being born. Or, times when we had to move out fast and we were told to start throwing the things we wanted into garbage bags and put them into the car.

My mom and I were very close and I was kind of her copilot through all the crap. Crazy as our life was, I loved the hell out of her and she died 2 years ago from cancer. All in all, I have had a kind of hero through it - my dad.

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago, my dad, stepmom and I were sitting outside around a backyard fire having drinks and real talk. He said something that surprised me, which was that I had lived with them as a kid for a period of about 4-5 years. This was news to me. I had not remembered living with them for that long at all. In my head, it was maybe 6 months. My dad was hurt I did not remember living with them. During that time, my stepmom apologized for being so mean to me during my childhood. I shrugged it off and joked, ""Well, I guess its water under the bridge since I don't remember."" She said, ""no, I was really mean."" And, I said, ""It's okay. All of it has come around. We are good now.""

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to two days ago. Over the weekend, the man I love got down on knees and asked me to marry him. Magical moment and we have been very happy. In fact, it's the first relationship I have ever felt safe in, but it takes work and effort for me to trust. I tell my Dad and stepmom the news and watch the whole thing turn and capsize. My dad makes a comment about how I had to beat my sister to a ring (my sister is their daughter/ my half-sister and is in a serious relationship that is also leading to marriage soon). I am struck. I do not feel competitive with my sister and she and I have always celebrated each other's victories. Then, my stepmom asks about where and when and I tell her it might be a year out and she starts making excuses about how she will not be able to go, not willing to go, but tells my dad he can go. I hear this and know my dad will not ever take a trip without her and start to panic that he will not come to my wedding. The comments pile and mount, one on top of the other, until my whole body is trembling. Although I have been sober for over a year suddenly I want nothing more than to drink. But, I do not drink and say everything is ""fine"" when asked and try to leave on a good note to make sense of my feelings in private.

&amp;#x200B;

Something that needs to be explained is that there has always been a strain with stepmom and me. I try hard to do things right, but I am scared of her and always have been. As an adult woman, she still scares me. She is incredibly controlling, powerful, dominating and it is hard. My tactic in avoiding being a target of her passive-aggressive behavior and anger is just to be super nice. Nice all the time. Smile. Swallow. Repeat.

&amp;#x200B;

When I came home from the engagement announcement, it was like the flood gates opened.

One memory cascades into another and another and another.

Suddenly I can recall being 7 and 10 and 12 and all the fear I had as a child in their home.

I remember how much she hated me. The name-calling. The scapegoating.

I remember sucking back tears and being told not to cry at all. I remember hearing all the time ""You're fine."" 

I remember the secrets I had to keep about how mean she was. I remember walking down the hallway in our home and being pushed into another room while my dad watched TV in the living room and her whisper-screaming that I was a brat and a terrible child and was ruining her marriage and being told to say nothing to my dad.

I remembered she controlled my sleep habits. I have always slept on my stomach but she required that I slept on my side to face my little sister at night and would come into the room in the middle of the night and catch me on my stomach and wake me up to yell at me and tell me to go back on my side.

She controlled the relationship I had with my dad. We could not do anything she was not a part of, did not supervise, or control.

I remember being cornered again and again. I was targeted and she was after me and it was relentless.

I remember her sisters telling me how sorry they were and that is was not okay for me to be treated this way.

She was a relentless bully.

I remember my sister who is 7 years younger, always trying to protect me and shield me from her mom.

I remember being taunted and teased and made fun of. 

I remember one time she yelled at me out front of our house and I got so scared I peed my pants and had to run inside and change.

I remember our neighbors saying that I was safe in their home and if I ever made a mistake in their house they would not tell my stepmom.

I remember when I left my dad and stepmom's house to move back with my mom that they took down all my photos from the walls and told me they would be fostering or adopting a kid to fill my place.

When I moved back with my mom life changed and was chaotic in the way it was with my mom so I think I just forgot all of this stuff and kept going.

But with this sudden flash of remembering everything now, there is just anger. Layers and layers of anger. Anger that my dad did not stand up for me. Anger about what they knew, but I did not. A huge sense of abandonment. What the hell is this? How can I have forgotten all of this? How does it just sweep from view? 

&amp;#x200B;

In my head, I rage at her and the main thing I say is, **""Guess what? Now I remember.""**

&amp;#x200B;

I sent them a text. A sheepish way to confront it, but for once I stood up for myself. It was very hard and my whole body quaked and trembled. They did not respond.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is... they have been trying in the past few years. They moved to my state. They want a relationship with me. She did apologize back in the yard that day. I know my dad loves me and tried in his own way to protect me. I don't think I will get any sense of accountability from them. But, now it's like this mystery has unlocked inside me. I always felt unsafe around her. I never felt like even when she has been nice to me as an adult like I could trust her. Now I know why.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I am about to lose this last remaining chunk of parents I had. My mom is gone and I have continued to work through all the things that happened with her and will head back to therapy to deal with the rest...

&amp;#x200B;

My sister asked what I want to come of all of this. Why put it all towards them? What kind of battle am I setting out to wage? And, I really don't know. I didn't see this coming and I am at a loss. I feel guilty for bringing this up. Like, I am going to wreck the family. But I am also furious. I want them to have to hear it all from me. I want to ask my dad what he did and did not know. I want her confession. I feel like I can already hear my dad telling me not to be so dramatic, and yet, I feel like I will not be able to stuff this one back in. 

&amp;#x200B;

How can I rehash something that I only now remember? Is it worth it to even try or do I just salvage a fake relationship for the sake of having one? 

I feel bad about feeling sorry for myself. Is there anything that will come from holding them accountable or am I just headed down a path of anger and victimhood?  I wonder if we can even have a relationship from here... 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: I recently told my dad and stepmom I was getting engaged. My dad brought up my sister's likely engagement immediately and completely derailed my news. My stepmom said she wouldn't be coming to my wedding. It brought up years of bullying from my stepmom and neglect from my dad that I had forgotten all about. Now I do not know if I can or want to have a relationship with them and feel insanely guilty for even bringing it up.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cfc6w3/after_i_36f_told_my_dad_and_stepmom_both_late_50s/,relationship_advice,4712,420,0.0
antinonius,2019-07-19 17:04:26+00:00,I found a hidden camera in our bathroom and suspect my girlfriend,"Hi everyone I live with my girlfriend in the condo that I bought 4 years ago. We are both late twenties.

This morning I cleaned the bathroom because we are having a small party at our place tonight where some of my and her friends are coming to celebrate her birthday .

We frequently have gatherings at our place but my girlfriend never lets me tidy up. She claims it’s cause I don’t do as good a job and that she just wants to do it so she knows it’s “done right”.

Since it’s her birthday I decided to surprise her and do it while she is at work before she comes home (I work from home btw).

But when I was scrubbing the floor I noticed something weird in the corner of the bathroom where the electrical outlet is - I ended up taking off the plate cover and found what is definitely a microsized camera. It was wired to a large usb battery tucked into the wall.

My first thought was maybe this was here before I bought the condo but I bought it from an elderly woman who was under assisted care - and the battery had a full charge.

The only person I can think is that it is her. She’s never given off signs of being a weirdo pervert so I’m honestly shocked. 

I’m also extremely pissed cause the condo is on my name so if someone else found this and reported it to police, then *I* would be responsible and get arrested and convicted and prison.

While I would love to pack up her shit and just throw it out the window, I know there’s laws that protect ppl from being evicted without notice.

I guess my question is should I even talk to her about this and give her the opportunity to lie? Or should I just keep my mouth shut and break up with her for other reasons (say I am just not feeling it anymore)? My head is spinning and I’m both nervous and sick at the same time.

Worse yet I cannot cancel this party because she is having several friends come from her sorority in college and they’re staying with us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cfa4vj/i_found_a_hidden_camera_in_our_bathroom_and/,relationship_advice,1023,372,0.0
feelshitty12345,2019-07-19 15:15:11+00:00,I (26M) just broke up with my GF (26F). She was raped a year ago and my entire family hates me now.,"For background, I have been with my GF for 4 years. I realise she is technically my ex-GF, but it feels weird saying that, so I will just call her my GF.

Anyway we have been together for 4 years, and everything was amazing up until a year ago. She went to a party without me, drank way more than she should have, and was sexually assaulted by two of the men there. Both men were identified by people at the party, plead guilty, and convicted. 

After this my GF's personality completely changed. She no longer showed any affection to me and was, all things considered, very cold to me. She tried to blame it on me since I didn't go with her, something which I have always found fucked up. Even though she stopped showing me any affection, she got 100x more clingy in insisting I'm always with her, which wouldn't be so bad if she at least showed some affection when I'm around her.

We have never had any kind of sex since the incident. She very occasionally gives me a kiss, but only a kiss and nothing more. I can 100% understand her feeling uncomfortable with being intimate after what she went through, but she has made literally no attempt in the past year to work on this, or at least try and be intimate with me.

She has been going to therapy this entire time, but she is still as cold and distant to me as she was a year ago. I feel like she's not even my GF anymore, just a clingy loner that sucks the life out of me. I have tried to talk to her about how our relationship is suffering, but I have to stop because she immediately starts crying and asking me to forgive her, only for her to make no attempt to change afterwards.

As you can tell from my rambling tone, I am no longer happy in this relationship, and after making many attempts to help her I feel as though I need  to move on. I'm only getting older and I want to start a family and raise kids, and I feel as though there's no chance of that happening with her now in the state she's in.

So I broke up with her last week. I was straight to the point and then left without comforting her, because I knew that once she started crying and begging me to stay I'd eventually give in. I feel as though I've done enough to try and save this relationship and simply need to move on.

Ever since this my entire family has literally cut me out of their life. My mother and 3 sisters all blocked me on Facebook/WhatsApp and wont return my calls. The only message I got was an extremely upsetting email from my mum telling me how heartless I am for abandoning my GF when she needs me most. My dad passed away a few years ago so they are the only family I have. I feel as though I have to go back to my GF, who in all honestly makes me feel like shit when I'm around her, if I want to maintain a relationship with my family.

I am considering buying a plane ticket to go home so I can confront my mother in person, but other than that I have no idea what the fuck I am supposed to do. Probably a long shot but if anyone has any ideas on how I can repair my relationship with my family without getting back together with my GF, I'd much appreciate it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cf8ru5/i_26m_just_broke_up_with_my_gf_26f_she_was_raped/,relationship_advice,2067,622,0.0
matungimodsdi,2019-07-19 15:04:15+00:00,Update: Wife (24f) told her friends Im (24m) ugly.,"I had more replies than I expected to my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cef9vw/wife_24f_told_her_friends_im_24m_ugly/). I wanted to just delete but thought it would be unfair to those who posted so many kind messages. This will be my only update:

1) We married within an year because I truly believe she is the one and I believe she thinks me to be her soulmate as well. Besides, she has a lot more to lose compared to me. We're both citizens of the same country, and as I mentioned she makes more than I do so those yelling gold-digger are way off the mark. If anything I would be owed alimony if we divorced.

2)The friends group she is a part of is the major problem from my pov. They are all 20 something, young, attractive women and imo that kind of company just lends itself to this kind of talk. Not that my wife is blameless. She could have said anything other than what she did, but I'm at least thankful that she didn't start the whole thing. 

3) I have severe self esteem issues arising from my scarring. I appreciate the support but you don't know what it looks like. This isn't a minor bad boy scar that girls swoon over. This is stuff that gives kids nightmares. Combined with self harm where I tried to use a razor to shave it all away it's been left objectively hideous. I can't expect anyone to act like it's not there, and it's unrealistic to expect anyone will be able to. 

4) We don't fuck with the lights off.

I sat her down today, told her I overheard what she said to her friends about me and she didnt remember it. When i mentioned ""the Freddy Kreuger thing"" she paled and immediately came close to me and whispered that she was sorry. That she was drunk and didn't know what she was saying at the time. I simply asked her if my scar was something she couldn't get over which in hindsight was stupid since she fucking married me right? So she got a bit irritated and said that no it wasn't. She didn't care about the scar, and she was just joking with her friends since they were meeting up after a very long time. They're college friends and they used to usually rag on their SO's (small dick, cant fuck, etc) when together and I asked her if she said anything else about me and she swore she didn't.  

I asked her if she wanted me to get cosmetic surgery and she hesitated before answering no. I told her I'd get it on my own dime since I didn't want children pointing at me in public and she adamantly refused the notion of me paying for it by myself and that we'd go to the appointment together. 

I asked her if she loved me and she said Yes, with all her heart. She said she found me sexy, which I believe because Im low libido and she's usually the one who initiates every other day. But she couldn't come to bear my scars I answered, and she repeated that she didn't care about the fucking scars. All the annoyance she had was about how they itched when she laid there and how she hated the thought of me getting negative attention in public. Her words and actions were pretty contradictory, but I didn't trust myself to decipher it all and told her we had to go to couples counselling to which she agreed after a few denials. I also told her that she had to cut that friend group out of her life. That they were the kind of people who would have made my life hell in high school and she also agreed, apologizing once again. 

I don't know if this will work out, I don't know if I'm strong enough to end it when it turns out that it wont, but I'm thankful for all the kind words and the not so kind ones. Those of you who want to call me a cu ck or w/e, you can't possibly berate me more than I used to berate myself. If I'm wrong, I'll learn from this.

DensimetricFroude,2019-07-19 12:19:52+00:00,"UPDATE/Solved - My wife has started ""acting sexier"" since the marriage - I want to support her but am slightly concerned","Hi All,

Thanks for most people's perspectives. I figured it didn't make sense to wait, so I called up my brother in law (i.e. wife's sister's hubby) to chat. My wife and her sister and absolute best friends in the world, so I thought BIL might have some insight. My wife has been talking to and spending time with her sister a lot recently, which is not uncommon, but it seemed a bit out of the ordinary. 

My BIL said that my SIL has been pretty depressed and sad/jealous since my wedding. She's said some things like ""now the perfect couple can have the perfect life"" (directed at us) and saying things like ""50% of marriages end up in divorce, I wonder who we know will be first"" (directed at no one in particular). They also went out shopping, and the thong purchases were from that trip. My BIL has talked to my SIL about the jealousy and sadness, and I guess she is exploring some therapy options. SIL has been in a horrible job situation recently as well.

I have always loved my SIL, but I know she had some relationship trust issues in the past and I think she might be (accidentally or on purpose, I don't really know) planting some seeds in my wife's mind about being hesitant to settle down (but after 7 years? weird...).

After talking to BIL, I brought it back up with my wife very gently. She did tell me that SIL told her things like ""you know, after marriage you need to keep your game up - what if he leaves? You'd have nothing."" That type of thing. My wife said she just mostly ignored these things but can now see that her personality might have been starting to change. She stayed with her sister for a while when I was working out of state, and she said they read of lot of cosmo type stuff (which my wife is not usually a fan of) and went shopping where my SIL bought my wife some new sexier dresses.

It's a tough situation because I honestly thing my wife loves my SIL just as much as she loves me, so it must be a bit confusing. At least I got my wife to admit something might be changing, and I am almost certain I know the source now. I think we're in the clear - my wife and I have dealt with some strife in our relationship early on because of her sister, so this is something we can deal with!

Throwaway-yam,2019-07-19 12:02:30+00:00,I snooped on my brother and found something horrifying,"I just found something pretty disturbing, and I’m not sure what really to do next. 

&amp;#x200B;

My brother is usually a super private person and doesn’t hand out his phone to anyone. We’re currently on a family vacation overseas and he is the only one with a working data plan, so we've been using is phone quite a bit. His open web tab was on a popular fiction website, and I saw his logged in username before he swapped tabs to a new one. 

&amp;#x200B;

I frequent the site too, and when back in the airbnb, went to check his profile to see if he too ran in the same fandoms as me. I must admit that this situation is entirely my fault as I snooped. I know I shouldn't have, but I was so curious. To my surprise, he had a few published works, but when I opened one, I almost puked - his latest story was of a brother violently raping his sister, who had the same name and general description as me, in a setting I recognised as my parent's house. He insulted my eldest sibling and also my parents in horrible ways too. I won't go into further detail but suffice to say it was the single most horrifying thing I've ever read. Ever.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm in the bathroom of this airbnb typing this and I'm not sure how I'm going to go out and face my family. Should I just ignore this? Is this normal and am I overreacting? I mean, everyone has their kinks and my brother has never, ever acted inappropriately towards me or anyone in my family in real life. Please tell me this is so.

throwawayacc25789,2019-07-19 09:52:32+00:00,"My (18F) best friend (18F) cheated on her boyfriend (21M), got pregnant and is lying that he’s the dad. Should I tell him?","Ok this is a crazy rollercoaster. Also I know this is pretty fucked up but Natalie is a nice girl, she’s my best friend. 

We graduated high school this summer so our friends and I all went on a small vacation to Italy. We found a Groupon thing online so it wasn’t too expensive. Natalie is dating Eric but he didn’t come on the trip with us. It was basically a whole bunch of friends from our senior class. It’s pretty well known among us friends that Dylan who is in our high school, likes Natalie. He’s like really into her. Well when we all went to Europe, since Eric wasn’t there, Natalie was all over Dylan. Acting like a couple, being all flirty. They’d SLEEP in the same bed but she’d insist nothing was going on and they were just friends. Well, I shared a room with Natalie and I walked in on them having sex. Afterwards I asked her what she was doing since she was dating Eric and she said she was on vacation and it was a one time thing. It was not. We were there for a week and they had a ton of sex. Dylan’s dreams came true that week. But only I knew about it since it was our room. Everyone else had their suspicions but I was the only one who really knew the truth. 

When we got back home, she promised me that she was just “crazy” since she was on vacation and she’d never cheat on Eric again. She kept saying how he was amazing and perfect for her and to please not tell anyone. So I promised to keep her little fling a secret. Fucked up I know but I have more loyalty to Natalie than Eric. 

She continued to act like everything was fine but she recently told me that she’s now pregnant and I asked her who the father is and she gave me this look as if I slapped her across the face. She said it’s obviously Eric and I reminded her about Dylan and she insisted that Eric is the father and to never mention Dylan in front of her again. She’s terrified since she was supposed to start college but she told Eric and he told her not to worry and he’ll take care of her and their baby and he loves her and that they’ll be ok. She told me he was a little scared but he begged her not to have an abortion and promised that he’s gonna be a good dad. He wants to get married before she starts showing since they both think it looks tacky wearing a wedding dress and being obviously pregnant so she’s busy planning a quick wedding too. 

Y’all. Dylan is obviously the father. Like 100%. They were fucking like rabbits in Italy and I don’t think she knew how to say “where can I buy condoms” in Italian. I feel bad for Eric since he’s like.. already buying cute baby clothes and prenatal vitamins and doing research on what she needs to be eating.

I love Natalie she’s my best friend but this is so fucked up like I feel really bad for Eric. I know she’s scared and Eric would obviously be the better dad but c’mon that’s not his baby. Dylan is 18 and hes nice but definitely not ready to be a father. Eric is older and he’s graduating college soon and he has a car and an apartment and hes a good guy. But it’s not fair for him. I know she’s trying to save her own ass but it’s her fault for cheating on him.

I don’t know like if I tell Eric, Natalie will hate me forever for ruiningher life and her baby’s life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cf5ltj/my_18f_best_friend_18f_cheated_on_her_boyfriend/,relationship_advice,26914,5974,0.0

I made a personal year long goal to save as much as possible in hopes of leveraging my saving for starting another business.

I calculated how much I have saved since January and I have surprised myself with what I was actually able to save. I told my GF, thinking that she would share in the joy I feel for having all of my hard work pay off and she flat out said ""im going to stop paying for stuff"". It started a conversation about how she expects me to pay for more things now that she is aware of this. I feel like she miss-understands why I am saving.

First post

Sorry for the late update. Didn't really have the time to write something.

I decided to snoop, and I hit the jackpot right away. I unlocked it with his fingerprint (should have been the first sign. He claimed it was convenient). I scrolled through their messages and it was obvious. They were even making fun of me together. They've been sleeping together for months. Don't know what got over me but I wanted to read everything they ever said to each other and I did. Pretty sure they slept together just two days after he proposed. From what I could gather from their talks she wants him to leave me but he's hesitant. But sleeping with her for months is okay right?

Not proud of my reaction but I went a little crazy. Been with this dude since I was 16. I packed and threw some of his stuff and called a friend over, and woke him up and told him he should leave. He confessed and begged for a second chance, I couldn't believe it really. He left and only came back to grab more of his stuff. I blocked him everywhere and haven't spoken to him since, but obviously I'm going to need to be in contact with him to figure out  the details about our finances. 

I don't know, I'm still hurt and upset but not as much as I thought. Initially I felt like I was going crazy. And I feel sooooo stupid for not noticing or finding out earlier. I wasted so much time with him. Somehow because it's a full blown affair it hurts less. Oh and there was no work trip. I mainly feel like an idiot for not asking more questions and blindly trusting him. My friend has been with me and she is always able to make me laugh. We went out together most nights and I've been feeling better. To top it off I slept with one of his best buddies last night, and he told me not to tell him lol. I was drunk and wanted revenge and well I guess I sorta got it 😅, tho I'll definitely be letting him now. 

Not much else to say. I guess I'm going to be single for a while and enjoy that. I seriously can't believe I was going to get married to this asshole.

We recently graduated from our college and were planning to get a good job. She is from a very underdeveloped village and was given scholarship by the government to study. Her parents are socially backward and never contributed for her well being and were against of her education from start. Her mom is abusive and her father is an alcoholic. She is the only one in her family to graduate. Her sister dropped out of the school and works as a part time maidservant. The one who supported her through tough times is her aunt. Her aunt fought with her parents and supported her through graduation, but she later passed away last december. Now that her aunt is out of the way her parents are trying to claim her as their own. Her parents are forcing her to marry a 43 year-old for their personal gain. Basically this man is ready to offer her parents three lakhs rupees ( roughly 4354 USD) in exchange of their daughter. The man in question is very shady. He has many lawsuits filed over him and is potentially connected with the local gang members. He is avoiding his jail time because of his political connections and power. He is already married to two women 41F and 32F and has four children, eldest being a 19 year old boy. 

My friend does not know what to do. She cried yesterday while being with our other friends. We are motivating her to move away from her parents and start her own life. But she is too scared to take any actions. 

If the marriage continues and they both get married, her life will get ruined. She will get abused more and will be forced to work in kitchen for rest of her life.

TinderMarriageThrow,2019-07-17 22:18:11+00:00,I [m32] matched with my wife [f29] on Tinder...,"Big time throwaway account.

I’ll start by saying that my wife and I don’t have any sort of open relationship agreement or anything of that nature.  

We met on Tinder 3 years ago, fell in love fast, moved in together, and got married. We’ve been married over 14 months now, and quite happily, I would say.

A month ago she left on a business trip for a week and I found myself downloading Tinder on a particularly lonely night. I don’t even know why. I didn’t have any intentions. But I did it.

I swiped here and there and got pretty bored with it. It was a funny reminder of that time of my life. I deleted it and moved on.

On Monday my wife left for another business trip. Last night I once again downloaded Tinder and started swiping. Again, I had a laugh, but ultimately was bored of it. 

Then I saw her picture come up.

I say shocked for a moment. I wondered if I should just delete it and pretend nothing happened. I thought maybe a bot stole her picture.... But I read her profile... it’s her. It’s her now and it’s her live. There’s even a picture of her where I am cut out.

I decided to make a bold move and swipe right. 

I swiped and we matched.

She gets back from her business trip tomorrow. I’m going to confront her then. I don’t even know how this is happening. She’s over 100 miles. Is a friend of her using her account??

Now I have to explain why I was on Tinder. This is just a huge can of worms that got opened.

What the hell do I do?

We met In the cliche matter of I bumped I to her and knocked her books out of her hands and she cussed me out and told her I owed her a coffee and I was suddenly in love. 

2 years later we're sitting pretty on our very own apartment. Poor as can be, but happy and working on it. 

I work early mornings managing a warehouse. It isn't flashy or even pays well, but it pays enough that we can occasionally but something we want. She works at a kiosk and goes to school on the side. Normally working late at night. So we hang out together in the afternoons together. 

For the last month or so, she's been staying late at work so I usually fall asleep before she gets home. 
But this last night I couldn't fall asleep, so I decided to hit our gym to run a little bit. 

And that's when I saw her, the woman who hates working out sweating it out on a treadmill. Just booking it. 

Apparently she decided not to tell anyone that shes been doing this every night. 

I'm so proud of her, but how can I support her without letting her know I know?

ilonasuper,2019-07-17 08:42:01+00:00,8 month-pregnant myself (F32) found texts of my husband (M34) to his ex asking her to raise baby together,"Dear all,
I am 8 months pregnant. Few days ago I did something I for the first time in my life: my husband fell asleep with unlocked phone and I checked it. 
What I found shook the ground: I found a Whatsapp conversation between him and his ex dating back to Feb. Clarification: back then I was  2 months pregnant and it was 1 month before our wedding. 
He said many things, such as “I really really tried but I don’t love her the way I did love you”, “Fuck the wedding day, I want to marry you”, “I have never stopped thinking about you”.
A bit of their story: she is 40,  and their struggled to have children. She managed to get pregnant, then had a misscarriage and they broke afterwards. 
The wors thing he said “Babe, we couldn’t have children. Now we can. Let her carry it, and we will cherish fruits of it together”. 
My world literally fell apart, as I feel it was built on a big lie. I am giving birth in 1 month. We have just bought a house and moved in. I am not ok at all, but I haven’t talked to him yet. I am afraid of how far he can go.

AniceBowlofSoup,2019-07-17 04:26:42+00:00,I (M24) have been having sex with my girlfriends (f21) twin sister by mistake. I promise this isn't a movie script for some Messed up dark movie.,"Now this is going to sound like a crazy situation but it is fucked up and I'm not sure what to do about it. This is also a throw away account as some of my friends know my reddit account. I have been dating, lets call her Kate, for 8 months now things were starting to get serious. I met her family around the 2 month mark and met her twin sister and thought it was coll she had a twin, the most normal reaction people have to seeing a identical Twin ""oh wow thats so neat"" typical reaction to that situation. Before we go on i want to say I have a rare genetic disorder called marfan syndrome. This is important to the story because it explains -

&amp;#x200B;

""how do you accidentally have sex with her twin there must be some differences."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Well marfan syndrome makes it hard for your body to develop connective tissues and in some advanced cases (mine) your lens in your eyes can become detached or change your vision etc. I am legally blind without glasses and even with glasses due to the nature of marfans my vision still changes and can very. generally it stays around the same shitty site but can change. Even with my glasses i don't have the best vision... so when i tell you i don't notice a difference i don't.  AT ALL. they do have some what different personality's and this is what led me to finding out what was happening.

&amp;#x200B;

About 2 months back my girlfriend sex drive seemed to peak again. just like in the beginning of our relationship all she wanted to do was basically have sex again. Which for me was fine but it was defiantly odd. I also noticed some personality changes and mannerisms that were different. i thought maybe i was being paranoid and then i explained the changes to my friend group during a game night and they basally said i was complaining because my girlfriend was more horny then usual and a bunch of cliche guy jokes. One suggested that she might be pregnant with scared the shit out of me because it could explain personality changes and the change in sex drive. Then my closest friend, we will call him Dave, suggested AS A JOKE that she might be sharing me with her sister... and that was something i didn't think of at all but then i just got a gut feeling and chills. I'm not superstitious at all but i just had a feeling. 

&amp;#x200B;

So i didn't know how to bring this up to my girlfriend without sounding like an asshole and ultimately leading to a ridiculous arguement of how i was insane... so i decided to be upfront and just ask because i felt like something was going on and i need to know.

Well, i was right.

So right away she got guilty and told me that she knew it was happening and that she was the one the suggested it!?!?!?!?!!!!

remembering this moment feels out of body and surreal.. i was blown away at first i thought she might be fucking with me but it turns out they have shared partners before ... she explained some stupid story about how its okay and i shouldn't be mad because its basically like having sex with her or something. Also her sister had just gone through a rough brake up and needed some ""stress relief"" and said sex with me was that medium ... wtf is this shit. Well I broke up with her and she is making a big deal I feel Violated. i havent told anyone about this but i have texts and facebook messages from her and her sister confessing to this. her sister tried to explain that she was the asshole and not my GF and to take her back... i Feel like i should go to the cops... do i have a case? i just feel like if they have been doing this shit they need to be stopped. i havent responed to anything they have sent so should i go to the cops or something i dont know what to do...",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ce7zxv/i_m24_have_been_having_sex_with_my_girlfriends/,relationship_advice,1555,447,0.0
CokecanX10,2019-07-16 23:54:23+00:00,My (15M) sister (20F) accidentally shot me and I'm still angry a year later.,"Last year my sister's (20F, 22F,22F) were visiting my parents and myself. My dad was in the backyard at the BBQ. The twins were in the kitchen with mom and I was on the sofa with my other sister watching football. My sister reached into her purse for something and I heard a loud bang go off. I didn't realize what happened at first, but when I looked down I was gushing blood out of my side. That's when I started to feel this burning feeling. 2 seconds later my mom came in and she started to scream for my dad. Dad was a medic for the army before he left. 

I don't remember much after that because I passed out, but I was in the ER for a while. I was shot almost at point blank range because my sister had a loaded pistol in her purse and it went off. She shot me. 

I'm still angry about it a year later. I'm fucking annoyed because every time she tries to make jokes about it and tries to make me laugh with it. She keeps trying to justify it to me and the twins that she needs this stupid gun because of how the world is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ce54qa/my_15m_sister_20f_accidentally_shot_me_and_im/,relationship_advice,16679,3234,0.0
ThrowAwayIrishman20,2019-07-16 18:05:05+00:00,"I (38M) Irishman recently found out I have a Brazilian daughter (19F) I knew nothing about because her mother never told me. DNA proved she is mine, but there is a serious language barrier.","19 years ago I met a Brazilian girl who was friends with my Brazilian buddy who worked and lived in Ireland. She came over to Ireland to study and joined our group of friends, we grew close and to put it bluntly we had sex many times. She couldn't stick Ireland's climate though and found the culture too different and went back to Brazil, she wanted me to apply and move with her back to Brazil. but I was in Brazil before with my buddy in the late 90's, lovely country, but the climate and culture I found too alien, just like she viewed Ireland as too alien. She eventually came to understand and all that shite, we broke up and we went our seperate ways. Sadly never heard from her after that. I moved on. 

Fastforward to half a year ago I'm at home after long day at work, doorbell rings, I answer the door and there she is again, this time with a young woman beside her. She explains that the girl is my daughter. I instantly believe it to be a real possibility, the girls age matches up to when we were together, she is quite fair and has similiar green eyes to me, and me and her mother did not have protected sex. I invite them in to ask all the standard questions. The girl really started to get emotional and cried and got angry at her mother and then looked at me crying asking in broken English was I really her Papa? I said I don't know, but we can do a DNA test and find out which her mother translated to her.  We did the DNA test as fast as possible due to the fact they aren't EU citizens so only had a certain amount of time here and weren't here on work visas. Did the DNA test and yup, it turns out i'm her papa. I'm overjoyed, I never had kids in the 19 years since, always felt bad that I was a 38 guy without a family, as I've never been good at staying in long term relationships. I am quite pissed at her mother, her explanation was that I wouldn't move with her to Brazil so I was no longer relevant to her, pregnant or not, the only reason she brought our girl to finally meet me is because my daughter kept begging to know who her father and she decided once my daughter was an adult she would bring her over to meet her father. This is warped and fucked, but what matters now is my daughter and not her mother. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway now that the backstory in out of the way. My daughter is getting Irish citizenship as I am her father and am Irish which allows her to. Her mother has gone back to Brazil. She is living with me now for the time being and wants to get to know me better, she is very affectionate and we get along amazingly she is into many of the same movies, genres as I am which allows us to connect despite the language barrier. I will never get used to being called ''Papa'' though as in Ireland we call our parents, Da, daddy or dad. She is going to start learning English via tutor. She finds the language very difficult at the moment and I have been trying to personally help her learn it as best I can too, but it can be frustrating when trying to communicate with her.  I am crap at languages and can only understand a few key Portugese words. She has quickly filled a hole In my life, is a joy and I feel like I have a lot to life for.

lovemygirlfriend267,2019-07-16 16:43:46+00:00,My [33M] fiancée [27F] chose to save my deceased father's stuff over her deceased mother's in a fire. How can I ever repay her?,"Two nights ago, my girlfriend accidentally set fire to our kitchen and the fire extinguisher in our apartment was defective. The fire spread quickly and burned through most of the building before they were able to contain it. I wasn't home, so I wasn't there to help my girlfriend gather anything up. If I was, I would have forced her outside and told her to leave it all. It's just stuff. 

She chose differently. First, she took out two dogs outside and handed them off to a neighbor on leashes. Then she went back in. At this point the kitchen was engulfed in flames and she couldn't make it into the living room, but she could get into the bedroom. She knew she wouldn't be able to make two trips and she had to act fast. 

Both of us have lost parents. I lost my dad 3 years ago. He was a friend of her father's so she knew him (though not very well), but he died before I actually met her. I have most of my dad's stuff in a storage unit, but in our bedroom I have his ashes, two guns, and a couple of other very personal things from my time with him. She lost her mom as a teenager, and because her father is an asshole, she only has a few small things of hers, and her wedding dress. 

Instead of choosing to save the few things that she has of her mom's, she gathered up my father's things, wrapped them in a sheet, and ran out of the room. 

I don't even know how to begin to say thank you. I'm so completely devastated by her losing her mom's things like that, and I can't imagine what she was thinking or how much she must really love me to make that decision. I don't know how to repay her. Or where to begin. Can anybody think of a nice gesture I can make it up to her? She must be devastated. I can't imagine losing the last bit of my dad. 

Tl;dr: my fiancée had an opportunity to save stuff from her dead mom when the apartment was burning, but chose to save mine instead. How do I repay her?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cdzjre/my_33m_fiancée_27f_chose_to_save_my_deceased/,relationship_advice,25690,1479,0.0
throwaw112358132134,2019-07-16 08:45:34+00:00,Daughter's friend (F18) is making me (M45) uncomfortable,"I have known this girl for years. She always was a sweet girl and one of the things I always liked about her and my daughter was that they were never the type to be 14 going on 40. Her family life is stable as far as I know and up until around 6 months ago she treated me like an adult - that is, a vaguely human shaped object that dispensed lifts and shit music.

&amp;#x200B;

But around the time of my wife leaving my daughter and I, she and my daughter started making jokes between each other about getting me a new girlfriend. When I'd overhear, I'd ignore it and the two of them would go all red and embarrassed.

&amp;#x200B;

Then it seems to have escalated to her getting uncomfortably flirty with me. I acted dumb initially, but had to actually say something to her about it, because it was getting way too... frank? It stopped for a while, but after turning 18, she started up again and just made fun of me when I try to tell her to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

So, to avoid anything else, I cut myself out of giving rides if she was in the party or being anywhere where she might be. But the past two weekends, she has called me in the middle of the night drunk as hell saying that she is going to walk home if I don't pick her up. So I pick her up, she gets really handsy to the point where I was having trouble driving, and every time I stop, she tries to put my hands on her.

&amp;#x200B;

The first time I got her home, she got herself under control, and while her mother raised an eyebrow, she mostly believed my denials of getting her into this state. The second time, she didn't and it was bad. I was telling the truth, and even I thought I was a sleaze. I told her mother that I was indeed stupid for not calling her instead and should the girl try anything like that again, I'll call her instead of going anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know what is going on here. I am a balding, overweight middle-aged man who feels like I am the butt of a joke somewhere having this 18-year-old acting so obsessively over me. I have spoken to my daughter about it who initially thought it was funny, but after a conversation with her friend is now kinda worried as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am sure that something else is going to happen, and I just need some advice on getting her to realize she should be with boys her own age.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cdufmj/daughters_friend_f18_is_making_me_m45/,relationship_advice,12163,1082,0.0

Usually on dates, we split the bill. I don’t really care like in the past, I’ve paid for the full bill and my ex would pay for the bill other times. Like we’d go back and forth. 

My current boyfriend wants us to each pay for what we ordered. From the first date, he said that’s how he likes to do things. I was fine with it, I didn’t  really care if he wouldn’t pay for me. Paying on a date is sweet to me and I like it but I have my own job so it’s whatever. I figured maybe he doesn’t have a ton of money and he can only cover his own bill. 

Anyway I didn’t really have any problem with it. But we went out to some random spot. Like a local chipotle, it tastes way better though. So he went down the line and he got his own meal. I ordered mine and then when I went into my bag, I realized I forgot my wallet at my house. I told him that I forgot it by accident and I thought he’d offer to pay and id pay him back but he was like “oh that sucks...” and sat down to eat. 

I was just like what the fuck..? This guy standing behind me in the line paid for my food and I paid him back through cashapp. After we ate, I lied and said my mom needed me to come home for something and our date was cut short since we were supposed to go shopping in the city.

We have one kid [2] and another on the way","I thought that my husband ""Doug"" was the perfect partner. We have been together for most of our lives and I thought I was the luckiest woman alive. He is sweet, sensitive, handsome, smart, talented, hilarious...the list goes on. We usually are very good at communicating: we have our share of fights and disagreements, but we always manage to figure everything out really fast.

We had an extremely stressful wedding a little over 9 years ago. Both of us were students with part-time jobs, and we couldn't really afford the wedding we'd always dreamed of. But my grandmother who raised me got diagnosed with cancer, and I wanted her to be able to come to my wedding. It was the hardest few months of our time together (including having a kid). 

Doug has a close friend we'll call ""Patti"". I never really suspected anything between them since their relationship is very platonic (I always thought she wasn't Doug's ""type"" and vice versa). A month or so after our wedding, Doug and Patti kind of drifted apart...I didn't really think anything of it since that happens. They reconnected about 3 years ago, and Doug and I now spend a lot of time with Patti and her husband ""Roger"" (they met about 6 years ago). 

Yesterday, the four of us were out with our kids. Doug and Patti were off playing with the kids, and Roger and I were just talking. All of a sudden, he asked me how Doug and I were so good at resolving arguments. At some point, he asked how I could be so calm about Doug and Patti's ""history"". When I asked what he meant, he told me Patti had told him about hooking up with Doug before she met Roger. 

I tried to hide my shocked expression, but I think he could tell I was blindsided. He gave me a rough timeframe and location, and I realized that it was the week before our wedding.

I have been in shock ever since. Reddit, what do I do? I thought my husband was a wonderful man but he has been keeping this secret from me for almost a decade. How can I trust him again? How do I confront him about this?

Holamybbychode,2019-07-15 09:57:33+00:00,I was drunk and pretended to be asleep so I wouldn’t have to talk to my boyfriend but It turned dark.,"I (21f) was on a work night out two nights ago and drank a bit but wasn’t too drunk just tipsy. My boyfriend also went out for drinks and met me afterwards and we went home together.
He was acting rude towards me and was pissed off that I walked out of the nightclub with a male colleague that he knows I’m friends with.

Fast forward to when we’re in bed, turned off the lights and start to cuddle. He asks if I’m alright and I didn’t answer I wasn’t in the mood to talk and he just presumed I was asleep.

This is where it turns weird on both our parts, I’m slightly embarrassed to say I let it go this far but at the same time I wanted to see what he was going to do I DID NOT let it go on because I liked what was happening because I genuinely felt sick. 

He put his hand down my pants and started rubbing and when I didn’t react he spit on his fingers and put them in me. He then went to the other hole which is something I would never let him do and something we have never done before. I held back every urge to stop him because I needed to see what he was capable of.

He started to wank off and then started going under the covers with the torch on his phone. This is where I couldn’t let it go on any further and I started to ‘wake up’ I asked what was he doing and he said nothing and asked was I okay and started to tickle my back till I ‘fell asleep’ again.

He tried the flash light thing 2 more times and then ran into the bathroom. After he was in the bathroom awhile I asked was he okay and he said he was taking a shit. 

Now I’ve asked him to move out and he’s making it difficult saying he’ll convince me to stay with him.

throwawayincelbf,2019-07-15 04:25:59+00:00,Just found out my boyfriend was an incel — reposted from AITA,"(Deleted from AITA so reposting here.)

I met my boyfriend through a local DnD Facebook page. We started talking every day over Messenger and pretty soon we were meeting up to continue our conversations in person. We had a lot of stuff in common, and I thought he was really funny, and I just enjoyed his company. We started dating and we’ve been dating for nearly a year. We moved in together in May.

However, yesterday I found out from one of our DnD friends that he used to comment on r/Braincels . He brought it up in a “good for him for moving on” way but holy fuck. I only knew about incels from the guy that killed all those people a few years back. I managed to get the friend to tell me the account name (he got really uncomfortable and asked me not to tell my boyfriend) and although he never said anything violent, my boyfriend repeatedly called girls derogatory names, said we were inferior, we were whores, we would never date a short ugly man like him, etc. His last post he mentioned that he was talking to a “foid” and that she was actually showing interest. I think he meant me.

He was going through a really hard time this past year, not in a good mental place, but I don’t think that excuses all the sexist and gross things he said about women. He’s never shown any misogyny towards me or anyone else, but how do I know he doesn’t still feel that way? Would I be the asshole for dumping him over something that happened pre-our relationship? Should I give him a chance to explain? I love him and I don’t know if I can be objective if he asks me to sympathize with him. But I also don’t think I can continue to be with him knowing he things I’m not deserving of the same respect as men.

Added info from last post: he’s never done anything I consider a red flag, but I also have been blind to warning signs in past relationships, and he never told me about his misogynistic history. I feel like my trust has been breached.

He said I have a year left to think about it because he’s still on the lease. 

He took me out the following day for my birthday and paid for the whole day. It was nice. He kept counting outloud how much money he had spent on me- which sucked. After the day ended the honeymoon phase was over again. Back to normal with his moodiness and screamed at me when I asked him a question over his video game. His roommate looked at me like I was crazy. I looked away. 

I told my friends at work about what happened. They’re all a lot older than me and reminded me of events that happened between us I forgot about. I’ve come to work one to many times with bruises and handprints, I must have blocked those memories out. I’m very alone. I don’t have many friends, the one I do have moved to a different continent.

This came completely out of the blue.","Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cba218/my_29m_fiancee_28f_of_4_years_randomly_claimed_i/)  
Update post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cc3mlx/update_my_29m_fiancee_28f_of_4_years_randomly/)

So firstly thanks for all of your input. I read and considered every single reply. First I'll update you, then I'll tie up some loose ends from the comments in the previous post. I want to apologize for the bluntness of this post ahead of time, because despite your comments about me being calm and level headed, I'm actually quite upset about the entire situation, and I feel like me sitting and thinking about it is only marinading this anger and making it more juicy and flavorful. 

Update: 

I spoke to her in person after I posted my update. From her perspective, her original idea was to make it look like she just got mad or something, grabbed a few things, and left to her friend's house, where she was going to have the party thrown. Her friend has a really nice house that's perfect for a 20-30 person get-together. She was with her two friends, and made an off the cuff remark when her friend said, ""what are you going to say when he asks why?"" and she said, ""I don't know, I'll probably tell him that I feel like he got too serious when we had sex,"" or something like that. Then her other friend who was with her immediately took it to social media with out the other two girls knowing, and then when they checked their phones later on that day, it was already a dumpster fire. 

I said great, all that is understandable. Just one question - why did you then block me and then refuse to answer my calls, because that seemed pretty fucking intentional to me. 

She said because she didn't want to throw her idiot friend under the bus, and thought it would all go away if she just threw the party, and she hadn't realized how far it all went so quickly. 

I thanked her for telling me, and then I called off the wedding entirely. 

She cried, I cried, it was a goddamn mess. She asked where we go from here. I told her I don't know. I don't even know if the relationship is over yet, but I know that the engagement is over, and that **if** I decide to give it another chance, at the bare minimum, we need to build my trust for her from the ground up, if not the entire relationship. And now I have to decide if **I** want that. Do I went to spend another 4 years being undecided? If I'm being honest with myself, I imagine it taking another couple of years before I can trust her again. Do I want to get married and start *thinking* about having children at 35? 36? Close to 40? 

I told her that I have a lot to think about. 

I spoke to her dad last night. We shared a case of beers and had a conversation that lasted about 5 hours. My ex (?) hasn't spoken to anyone, and has basically been locked up in her old bedroom for now. She's been crying a lot. I do believe that she's genuinely remorseful about all of this, which complicates things. 

Her dad caught wind of the situation on Facebook but learned what was really going on maybe like an hour later. He'd gotten my calls, but hadn't returned them because he called his daughter first. She told him, and he just didn't know what to say to her. He told me that she's not truly stupid, but that she has a history of sometimes not thinking about things before she says them, and the impact her off-hand remarks can have. He said this is the worst it's ever snowballed, but she's had situations in the past where she says something stupid or insulting, and doesn't realize the impact of what she said until hours later when the other person blows up over it. 

So that's it. I still have a lot to think about. I know a lot of you guys are telling me that I have no balls for not literally tossing her out into traffic and laughing about it or something weird like that, but you have to understand that I still love her and have loved her for a few years now. Right now, I'm leaning toward moving on, but you're going to have to empathize with me here. 

As for my reputation, nobody thinks I'm an abuser. It's firmly out there now. Her reputation took a much more significant and lasting hit.

I have always prayed that he turned out okay and that his adoptive parents were good to him. He is 20 now and wrote me a letter (I chose open adoption). It sounds like he has a wonderful life. I really want to reply and I'm opening to meeting of he wants to. 

My husband who I married when I was 25 does not want me to reply. He said I should focus on raising our 3 daughters (8, 6, 2) and forget the past.

throwawaynocollege01,2019-07-13 14:25:28+00:00,"[UPDATE] Mom had an affair 18 years ago, I [18M] am the product of it. My dad just informed me of all this, and told me he will not pay for my college, while my siblings got their college experience paid by our dad.","The reaction to my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ca66sv/mom_had_an_affair_18_years_ago_i_18m_am_the/) put an uncomfortable amount of pressure on me to write this update.

I am not sure if it's what's you want to hear, but things are more or less back to a ""normal"" state, if you consider other events.

Unfortunately, my grandpa died at the beginning of this week, and I am still processing it.

I did manage to talk with both my mom and dad, and I know where I now stand in relation with them, as well as my siblings.

I am not sure I would have had the courage to say what I had to say if not for the amount of help and advice in the comments.

I think it is safe to say both my parents love me, and what happened two weeks ago was an overreaction to a fight between my parents. It makes me uncomfortable knowing I am not aware of my own environment, but a stranger in the comments can tell me what's happening in my life with only a few lines of text from my side. A lot of comments were spot on about what is happening in my life.

I have so far went through 40% (I estimate) of the comments, but I have given up, there are too many for me to keep up with.

The conclusion is that I am definitely going to college, it will be the college I have always wanted to go to, and I will have the same experience as my siblings. The money to pay for all this already exists, my family is not going bankrupt as suggested, my dad just had a mental breakup with all the issues around my grandpa and his fight with my mom.

Even if my dad would have went through with his decision, my grandma let me know my grandpa left me and my siblings a sum we will have to split between the three of us, but enough to put me through college.

What started the entire scandal was poor timing on my part, my parents just had a fight, and then I showed up ""hey, pay for my college"".

My parents were talking about us, their children, and mom said something to the lines of ""to think you wanted to split up when I came back pregnant"", or something like that, I was not there, this is what she told me. I guess dad was talking how proud he was of his children, and mom wanted to express her ""gratitude"" for dad raising me as his own, and dad took it as ""the affair was the best decision I ever made"" or something like that. And their fight escalated from there, and mom told dad something like ""what makes you think any of them are yours"".

Yeah, it went downhill from there fast. Shortly after that my dumb face showed up, and here I am.

Dad and mom have since made up, mom is still a mess, dad is not handling my grandpa's passing away too well either.

I did talk with my siblings, and my sister raised a storm and rode it here while blasting my parents on the phone, ha ha. My brother was calmer, but made his feelings known in no uncertain terms as well once he got back home.

My grandpa passing away sort of kept spirits calm, I guess, and shifted the focus to dealing with that.

Reading the comments was a mind opening experience. I felt unprepared for the world out there. Many have asked how I had no idea how to apply for loans or grants. Well, in my defense, when you go year after year after year knowing you have nothing to worry about, that your college as good as paid for already, you don't really have to worry about anything else. Of course I knew there are loans and other things students have to be aware of, but it didn't apply to me.

I went from ""I am going to college, can't wait"" to ""you're not my son and I will not pay for your college"" in less than 24 hours.

Others have been prepared for this, at the very least they knew they had to get a loan, or get a job, look for a place to live, and so on. For me it was a sudden change in reality.

Going through the comments I managed to put a list together with various ""tips and tricks"", what jobs are available for students, how to find a place to live, how to get a credit card, a bank account, a cell phone plan, and so on. Really good stuff that I think, even after the return to normal, will help me.

My parents have been called more names then they go by, and that was uncomfortable to read, and I haven't even read all comments. I can't even imagine what else lies in the comments, waiting.

Dad is very sorry, apologetic, about his reaction and behavior. I understand his reaction, but I still feel hurt by it. I understand he was not in the best place of mind, but I can't control my feelings either. We will be alright, and this hasn't irreparably damaged our relationship.

Mom hasn't handled everything that well. But she is coming around, and she answered some more questions for me.

When mom had an affair years ago, and got pregnant with me, my parents started divorce. Mom moved in with the man she had the affair with, but after a few months that guy decided he wants nothing to do with it. He kicked mom out, and she had nowhere to go. So my grandparents took her in, because she was still the mother of their nephews. Mom and dad got back together, after a lot of work, dad took me as his own, and that's my life since then.

The man who is my natural father is not in the picture any more. Dad didn't really know who he is, and mom hasn't heard or seen him ever since. He was fully aware mom was pregnant with his child, I guess he had more important things to do. But it doesn't sound like he was about to cure world hunger, she met him in a bar, not at a fund raiser.

And I don't feel a need to know any more about who he is. I thought about the matter the last two weeks, since I've been aware of everything, and haven't really felt a desire to know who he is, where he is, if he is still alive, if I have other siblings out there.

I was suggested to go and buy a DNA kit from 23andme, maybe I can find him that way, but I think I will avoid doing this specifically so I don't find him or he finds me. As far as I care, I have a mom and dad and a brother and a sister, and that's my family.

Moving forward I do plan of getting a job, and becoming more independent, but not in an attempt to distance myself from my family, but to feel like I would not be lost in the world if my family suddenly disappears.

My mom admits I've been babied way more than my siblings, and that they should have prepared me more for what's coming next.

I did learn where I stand with my family, and it's safe to say that I am loved, and I have options. I thought I am isolated, but my world is wider than I thought. Grandparents, siblings, my aunt, my cousins, all have my back.

I think my parents are human, and they make mistakes, and even though this was not their greatest moment, I think I will look at everything as nothing more than a weak moment in an otherwise wonderful relationship.

InfernalNymphet,2019-07-12 22:45:43+00:00,UPDATE: I [22F] broke up with my [34M] boyfriend (7 months ago) because I found an engagement ring. He came to my work today and PROPOSED. Help me. Please.,"First of all I’d like to thank everyone for their input on my other post. I know it was all over the place and at first I was on the defence in the comments and refusing to see the situation from any angle other than my own, but as time when on and I got more responses/messages, my point of view has shifted. Thank you for really persevering with me and helping me to see it from a different side. I really appreciate it. 

If you kept up with the last post and followed it to any extent, then you will know that I was meeting with my ex after work today to discuss the whole proposal and to discuss the whole relationship in general. Well, I did. He came to my place after work. And I’m crying as I type this, because the majority of you were right about him. My heart feels broken and I don’t know what to do from here. I can go into a lot more detail on this post as opposed to my last one, and I can clarify things more now because I’m no longer defending him. This post is gonna be a very long post so, I’m warning you now you may be here long.

When he came around to my house, my best friend had came too for support and she went upstairs and kept the bedroom door open to make sure that if I needed any help then I could get it. He was not happy that she was there, I told him that’s the only way I’ll speak is if she’s there because I don’t think being alone together is appropriate.
First of all, he went on a tangent about how I should never of made that post and that I was stupid to do it, he’s asked me like 1000 times to remove it, because I changed the password to the account before I made the post he’s extremely angry he can’t take it down. He was focused on that at the beginning until our conversation progressed, and he was getting incredibly irate such as pacing back and forth, huffing and puffing, throwing things. Whenever he made accounts, he would always make sure that everything to do the account was in his control. 
For those of you who didn’t read the comments previously, or for those who just wanted more info, when me and him were together he would have me make accounts which were solidly adult content. 

First of all it started with a Tumblr where he would post the content we’d make together such as pics/vids and share them with his friends and brag, then that progressed into making me Reddit accounts where he’d have me post any sexual experiences we’d had together or sexual experiences that he’d planned for me. Most of which, I weren’t comfortable with. I mentioned last time in the comments he’d use phrases like “If you love me, you’ll do it”, “You know how happy it would make me”, “You’ll enjoy it”, “vanilla is boring, you don’t want me to bored”, and those are just the ones that stick in my mind, there’s more. He’d use those phrases to get me to engage in certain sexual behaviour, he’d involve his friends, have us do CNC, specifically plan for something to happen and do so he could then get me to write a detailed post about it. The public posting of the experiences got him off and I wanted to make him happy.
And before you mention as multiple people have on the first post - this current account which I’m posting this on, he made and had me use during our break up and he asked me to delete all the other accounts and posts and instead repost them on this account. Stupidly I didn’t question his intentions and I know I was naive, I just thought as I hurt him it was the least I could do. Obviously to him, that meant he still had some sort of control over me even despite our break up. Also him not having access to it anymore really fuelled him.

We spoke about our sex life, and I asked him why he treated me like basically a sex toy, why he would pressure me into doing all of those things when he knew I was apprehensive, and he denied it. Said there was no pressure from him, just that he thought I would enjoy all those things and I’d want to do them with him because the thought I would want a ‘healthy’ sex life (his words). Honestly, by this point when he was talking I could just see through his bullshit, and it was having no affect on me anymore, just making me angry. Just from that, I started to feel a bit more sane and like I could finally stand up for myself and like my feelings for him were no longer blinding me. I was just angry that he would blatantly lie to my face, we argued over it and in regards to that he snapped at me and said “you should consider yourself lucky that I’ve not put any of what I have on you on social media, I could ruin your life but I choose not to because I love you and I’m not that type of person”
Like, fucking really? Who even says that? That’s such a passive threat. So, now I’m expecting that to happen some point soon.

Then the conversation moved onto that god damn ring. I told him that it was inappropriate and unfair of him that after 7 MONTHS of no romantic contact or talk, that he would propose out of the blue. I told him I didn’t want to marry him, or even be with him now. He didn’t like that, and got aggressive with me. Told me I’d never find anyone like him, how no one would ever marry me especially because I can’t have kids so I’m useless to most men so I should marry him because he “loves me more than life” and would never hurt me, all whilst getting up in my face and poking me on the forehead, obviously in an attempt to make me feel small and like he’s in charge. 
I kept telling him on what planet does he think he can do all this and then just expect me to roll over and take it? And his response was “you did for 4 years”. So, the majority of you were right, to him I was literally just some inexperienced girl who he could manipulate and take advantage of, he clearly didn’t love me. And all of this actually hurts, because I genuinely loved this person, and now I’m confused about how I could’ve been so naive to not notice anything. Part of me thinks I was so preoccupied with ending up like my parents that I missed all the warning signs and like many of you said - it became a self fulfilling prophecy. 

I gave him the ring back and told him I don’t want to see him anymore, he then turned to begging after he realised intimidation wasn’t working. Literally, him on his knees with crocodile tears and he arms wrapped around my legs telling me how much he loves me, he’ll buy me whatever I want (I’ve never been financially dependent on him, I have my own place) and do whatever I want him to do to make it right. I told him there’s nothing I want from him anymore and that I want him to leave, and just like before he flicked back to being aggressive. It wasn’t poking me in the face or anything, he was ‘hugging’ (more like restraining) me, kissing, groping me, putting his hands down my pants/up my top whilst telling me it’ll make me feel better and I’ll remember why I love him. At which point there was a knock at the door, my friend thankfully had text her dad what was going on and he came around and asked him to leave otherwise the police will be phoned, and he told him to never contact me again or he’ll make him feel as intimidated as he was making me feel. His face was a picture, he really didn’t like someone talking to him the way he speaks to me.

So he said he’d leave, in the process of leaving he threw the ring box at my head, no idea why, literally zero point. My friends dad pushed him out the door whilst he was shouting all sorts of abuse at me. And that was the end of that.
Now I’m expecting he’s not going to leave me alone, especially after the passive aggressive threat that he could ruin my life, I’ve asked to talk to my manager tomorrow so I can warn her of what happened and that he may post stuff about me on social media in an attempt to get me to lose my job.
My best friends dad said he’ll take me to the police station tomorrow and we’ll start a report because he’s worried that after what my friend told him that it won’t be the last I hear from him, so at least if anything else happens I’ve started one and can eventually get a restraining order against him.

Thank you for all your advice, seriously. I received a lot of criticism on my last post but I’m thankful to the people that kept giving me advice even when I was defending him and in denial, without you I wouldn’t of had the courage to end it. I also wouldn’t have been able to see it from a different perspective because I was so far under his spell.
I’m pretty upset right now, because this was my first proper relationship and I did genuinely love him, and now because I know he was manipulating, taking advantage of me and treating me like a fetish I don’t really know what to think, and I feel stupid and like an idiot that I didn’t notice it. And now I don’t know where I go from here, and I’m worrying he’s going to get even more irrational, aggressive or weird with me because he’s really not happy.
I’ve already spoke to my doctor this morning about counselling, so I’ll be starting the healing process soon. I guess I’ve gotta focus on myself now. I’ll be expanding my friendship group too and letting people know I won’t be going to any events if he’s there etc, I’ve blocked him on all social media, I know he’ll be here reading this though because he doesn’t need an account to read so blocking him will do nothing.
I just hope I can get through this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cchtb8/update_i_22f_broke_up_with_my_34m_boyfriend_7/,relationship_advice,8104,625,0.0

For the last 3 months my life has been a living hell, my wife uses her pregnancy to defend making my life a living hell.

This came completely out of the blue.","Okay so this is going to be a weird ass update. I'm sorry if you guys thought this was going to be anything interesting. 

A friend came forward and told me that apparently my dumb ass fiancee decided to play a prank on me. She had the bright idea of leaving the house for a couple of days to set up a surprise birthday party for me set for this weekend. I don't know what the fuck she was thinking, nor do I even really know the full story yet. She is not really the prank playing type and I guess thought this would be hilarious or something. 

It looks like a majority of those ""friends"" who were acting distant were in on it. After I started being up front and honest with showing people my texts with her as this sub suggested, one of them told her that this wasn't cool, and that if she didn't come clean, than he would. Well, she didn't come clean, and he came forward. I guess that's why nobody was answering their texts?  

Anyway, I texted her and I told her that I knew, asked her what the fuck she was thinking. She started blowing my phone up apologizing. She said her prank just went too far and spiraled out of control when it got to social media, and that she didn't know how to come clean when she realized that it crossed a line. She also said that she didn't mean to let it come out that I was abusing her, and that she just wanted to make it seem like she left me, and that the abuse stuff was a rumor started by some other people who weren't in on her joke. 

I just didn't really respond to her. I left and went to my parents' house before she got back home. My family now thinks she's a fucking moron, so her relationship with them is ruined right before our marriage, so that's great. Our mutual friends are now split in half with half of them thinking she's an idiot, and the other half feeling god knows what about the situation. I'm frankly embarrassed, and feel stupid for wasting everyone's time and dragging them into my relationship with my fiancee. 

I don't really know where to go from here. I don't know if I should call of the wedding, or postpone it and try to work out what the hell went through her mind. 

I'm sorry if this isn't the ending to the story you were all hoping for. I'm having drinks and will be here all night feeling sorry for myself and answering comments for as long as I'm awake with this Jameson.

heyhoitsmeeeee,2019-07-11 13:37:18+00:00,Another update: I hate being touched by my husband,"Hey y’all. I have no idea why reddit keeps deleting my posts but I’ve had multiple people DM me asking me about the update so I’ll post it one more time. 

original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cbijp0/update_i_hate_being_touched_by_my_husband/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

I had the conversation with my husband. This might be a long read so I appreciate anyone who decides to help at this point. 

When I got home from work, I told my husband what he said was not okay and I did not want to be with him anymore. (This wasn’t the only reason, we’ve been having marriage problems for a couple months now.) my husband said that he was joking when he said that since we’re married I can’t say no to having sex, (I swear on everything I know and love. He was NOT joking. I know he was upset in the moment and the thought of me not having sex with him turned him into something disgusting.) then he proceeded to say he realized what he said wasn’t right, and the fact that he dropped it, I should too. This happens a lot in our relationship. He says or does  something demeaning/over the top and just because he is cooled down I’m expected to get over it too. He kept saying since he got over what he said, I should too. He also tells me that I hold onto grudges too much and that’s why we have problems in our marriage. (These grudges he’s taking about are controlling, and abusive behaviors on his part he’s done to me.) and again, just because he let go of what he’s done, I should too. 

Then I brought up the subject of sex. I told him that he doesn’t deserve someone who doesn’t want to have sex with him and I don’t deserve to be stuck in a marriage where I don’t want to have sex with my husband. This point didn’t get thru to him. I told him I’m not attracted to him the way I used to be and he just kept saying “oh cuz now I’m a fatass you don’t wanna have sex?” And I responded with “no, because you don’t care about your health and your attitude is why I don’t want to have sex.” 

At this point I kept on telling him that I wanted a divorce. I was not happy, I have not been for awhile. He said that he’s not giving me a divorce and that he will make the process of divorce really ugly for me. Then later he said, “well if divorce is really what you want, fine.” Then he went back to saying that we’re not getting divorced. It was extremely condescending.

Of course I brought up the fact that he’s not even willing to do couples counseling with me. He said it’s a waste of time and we’re not “that bad” in our marriage. I then again pointed out that we are. I’m at the point where I don’t want to be with him anymore.

The conversation was going in circles. He couldn’t understand how I just “shut my feelings off for him.” And he couldn’t understand why I’m at the point of wanting to divorce him. We had a similar conversation last month, I told him I wanted a divorce, same shit happened, then i told him I was willing to work on us. A month later, here we are again. I told him tonight that I’m not happy with him and even if we decide to work on things, we’ll be having this conversation again really soon. He says he loves me and doesn’t want to let the marriage go. 

No matter how many times I tell him that I’m not happy and don’t want to be married, he’s not accepting it. I’m at the point where I’m beginning to feel guilty and second guess myself. I keep asking myself, am I right? Am I giving up too easily? Should I keep fighting ??

He eventually started crying and couldn’t sleep all night because he did loves me and doesn’t want to lose me..

There is a difference between me sleepily waving him off and giving him a sleepy kiss (which I don’t mind because then I can go back to sleep quite easily after he leaves) and me having to be fully awake because he wants a “proper”, whatever the fuck that means, I love you and goodbye. It’s always been really difficult for me to fall back asleep after I’ve woken up no matter how sleepy I am, or If i do it ends up happening about an hour later. 

This is really inconvenient when I have to be up at 8. 2 hours of sleep really makes a difference, especially if I’ve already stayed up a bit later the night before because i was relying on those extra two hours of sleep. 

I’m actually typing this an hour after he’s left now. I tried to fall back asleep for the first 30 min but I know it’s hopeless so now I’m on reddit, pissed as fuck because I can’t sleep now. 

I’m convinced my husband is the reason for my fucking dark circles. You may think I’m exaggerating but 2 hours are 2 hours!!! It doesn’t help anyone for me to be on the verge of falling asleep throughout the day when I have shit to do too!!

I’ve tried talking to him calmly about it, I’ve tried talking to him pissed off about it. Nothing works. I’m about to go mad.

It simply is not something I'm comfortable with, and I try to reject, not encourage women who ask me out for coffee to be friends because I know better.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think she cheated, I just think she appreciates male attention, and accordingly most of her friends are male. Some men are okay with that, I'm evidently not.

Unsureaboutthis9,2019-07-11 05:42:52+00:00,Girlfriend doesn’t want to sign a prenup,"To make a long story short, I love my girlfriend but she is financially illiterate and doesn’t save a dime.

We both come from very poor families, but I have always saved every penny, started investing when I was 14, and now actively trade as well. My portfolio is just south of 3.6M at 26 years old. My girlfriend earns as much as me at her job, but unlike me she spends her entire paycheque on dinners/clothes/shoes/concerts etc. She earns enough to be saving plenty but wastes it all on luxuries. Her entire savings is like $100 and hasn’t paid anything off her student loan.

Now I don’t have a problem with how my girlfriend spends her money, the problem is she wants it to be our money. She wants to get married, but doesn’t want to sign a prenup. I want a prenup which clearly protects not just my current investments, but also future investments + investment growth. We would split all bills otherwise and also pay any mortgage equally. So our finances would be separate except for mortgages/expenses etc which we would split.

The reason for this is that I know my would-be wife would save very little and if we ever got divorced, I’d end up giving away a good chunk of my savings with nothing in return. It would be extremely one sided.

I know I sound like a greedy prick here, but I’m just trying to be blunt and I’m not as asshole sounding in person.

Anyway, how do I talk to her about this? I am honestly not willing to get married without such a prenup. She said she’s hurt I’d consider a prenup and that I’m not considering her feelings, but I also feel the same way. She isn’t seeing it from my point of view.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cbrwp1/girlfriend_doesnt_want_to_sign_a_prenup/,relationship_advice,2295,1101,0.0
heyhoitsmeeeee,2019-07-11 03:00:12+00:00,another update: I don’t like being touched by my husband,"original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cbijp0/update_i_hate_being_touched_by_my_husband/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

I had the conversation with my husband. This might be a long read so I appreciate anyone who decides to help at this point. 

When I got home from work, I told my husband what he said was not okay and I did not want to be with him anymore. (This wasn’t the only reason, we’ve been having marriage problems for a couple months now.) my husband said that he was joking when he said that since we’re married I can’t say no to having sex, (I swear on everything I know and love. He was NOT joking. I know he was upset in the moment and the thought of me not having sex with him turned him into something disgusting.) then he proceeded to say he realized what he said wasn’t right, and the fact that he dropped it, I should too. This happens a lot in our relationship. He says or does  something demeaning/over the top and just because he is cooled down I’m expected to get over it too. He kept saying since he got over what he said, I should too. He also tells me that I hold onto grudges too much and that’s why we have problems in our marriage. (These grudges he’s taking about are controlling, and abusive behaviors on his part he’s done to me.) and again, just because he let go of what he’s done, I should too. 

Then I brought up the subject of sex. I told him that he doesn’t deserve someone who doesn’t want to have sex with him and I don’t deserve to be stuck in a marriage where I don’t want to have sex with my husband. This point didn’t get thru to him. I told him I’m not attracted to him the way I used to be and he just kept saying “oh cuz now I’m a fatass you don’t wanna have sex?” And I responded with “no, because you don’t care about your health and your attitude is why I don’t want to have sex.” 

At this point I kept on telling him that I wanted a divorce. I was not happy, I have not been for awhile. He said that he’s not giving me a divorce and that he will make the process of divorce really ugly for me. Then later he said, “well if divorce is really what you want, fine.” Then he went back to saying that we’re not getting divorced. It was extremely condescending.

Of course I brought up the fact that he’s not even willing to do couples counseling with me. He said it’s a waste of time and we’re not “that bad” in our marriage. I then again pointed out that we are. I’m at the point where I don’t want to be with him anymore.

The conversation was going in circles. He couldn’t understand how I just “shut my feelings off for him.” And he couldn’t understand why I’m at the point of wanting to divorce him. We had a similar conversation last month, I told him I wanted a divorce, same shit happened, then i told him I was willing to work on us. A month later, here we are again. I told him tonight that I’m not happy with him and even if we decide to work on things, we’ll be having this conversation again really soon. He says he loves me and doesn’t want to let the marriage go. 

No matter how many times I tell him that I’m not happy and don’t want to be married, he’s not accepting it. I’m at the point where I’m beginning to feel guilty and second guess myself. I keep asking myself, am I right? Am I giving up too easily? Should I keep fighting ??

I told him that as of now I don’t want to be with him, he said he’ll give me an hour to clear my head then we’ll talk about it again.

Am I being unreasonable in ending it?","Last weekend I had arranged a week in advance for her to join me kayaking in Sydney harbor as it's something she's wanted to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Last weekend I had arranged a week in advance for her to join me kayaking in Sydney harbor as it's something she's wanted to do.

&amp;#x200B;

She cancelled last minute and asked if she could attend a house party with a work friends without inviting me. I agreed as a free day would help me focus going to the gym etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The following day we saw one another and she revealed she invited a male friend who is not a work friend but someone who is new to town. 

&amp;#x200B;

My gut feeling suggested this action did not reveal much respect for me and sat her down and said I would have to rethink seeing her.

&amp;#x200B;

She cried and I conceded I should give another chance.

&amp;#x200B;

She has many male friends, most of which are not life long friends but rather men who to be frank probably are romantically interested and she likes the attention.

&amp;#x200B;

I spoke to her about this, and it appears she is unable to set clear boundaries besides communicating she is dating someone - as she often has gone on 1 on 1 'dates'. 

&amp;#x200B;

I said, this is a boundary I am not comfortable with as it's not something I would do to my partner and perhaps we are not compatible. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I being too old fashioned in this regard?

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, given the age difference, there is differences in maturity but at her age I was old enough to understand this behavior is naive at best or deceitful at worst as some of these men have expressed romantic interest. 

&amp;#x200B;

Note she pursued me after a break up and I was also just a male friend initially. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I being unreasonable? I'd like some insights from objective third parties to see if I am simply holding her to a too high standard.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cbot23/my_29m_girlfriend_24f_cancelled_weekend_plans_to/,relationship_advice,1808,337,0.0

Hidejag,2019-07-10 16:49:43+00:00,"Me [33M] with my Fiance[29f]. Together 6 years, she's rethinking our relationship because of advice from her recently reunited best friend [30F].","I and my fiance have been together for 6 years, engaged for about 8 months, and our wedding is scheduled for November. It's been a good, solid relationship from the beginning. We have great chemistry and have similar interests and principles. We are both doing well in our careers, have been saving money for our wedding and the down payment for our future house.

I'm going to try and keep the rest chronological, but there's a lot that I don't know.

My fiance (let's call her Beth) was best friends through school and uni with Sonia, that is for about 8 years. But then Sonia started dating a foreign student in their Uni and they got serious really quickly and got married within 6 months of dating. After their course was over Sonia moved with him back to his home country, and basically cut out Beth from her life. All of this happened before I met Beth, and from what she told me she was devastated when it happened, she would try to contact Sonia for years after and be totally ignored, and the hurt remained. Around last Christmas, Sonia came back to the UK and moved in with her parents. It was Sonia's mom who told Beth about her return, this happened in January. Beth went up to her parents during Easter, and since Sonia and her family were from the same town she tried to meet Sonia as well. That reunion did not go really well. Turns out Sonia's now ex-husband was extremely controlling and emotionally abusive and it took her a lot of effort to divorce and then move back home. Sonia was still recovering and would lash out at everyone including Beth. 

When Beth got back home she told me about it. She was deeply hurt and cried a lot, a lot of nasty things were said to her because Sonia blamed everyone from her life for her terrible relationship with her ex, special anger was reserved for Beth since she was around when she first started dating her ex and she should have somehow seen signs of the guy being the evil one he turned out to be. 

Beth still wanted to rekindle her friendship and they would write to each other a lot, there were ups and downs but over a couple of months, they did get back to a semblance of their old friendship. I and Beth went on a vacation in mid-June, three days before we were about to leave Beth invited Sonia and she agreed to join us. I found out about this the day before we were leaving and it annoyed me a lot. Firstly, the main reason we were going on this trip was because me and Beth were going to be really busy with work for the next few months and we needed to spend some time with each other, especially because there's going to be a lot of wedding stress coming up. And I was also annoyed because now I had to spend two weeks with someone who I had never met before, someone for whom my empathy was tempered by the fact that she was needlessly hurtful to my fiance. 

We arrived at a compromise. Sonia would join us for the first week of the vacation and Me and Beth would have the second week to ourselves.  From what Beth told me Sonia was ticked off by that and almost cancelled. But she didn't and the trip was a disaster from the beginning. 

We met at the airport and after a frosty hello, she simply talked to Beth the whole time. Any small talk that I attempted was rebuffed with monosyllabic responses or just shrug. When Sonia would need to tell me something she would talk to Beth, with me sitting right there. Like when she needed to go to the bathroom and I was sitting on the aisle seat, she turned to Beth and said: ""can you tell that guy to move, I need to pee"". Later in the hotel, when Me and Beth went to get Sonia for Lunch, she told her ""tell that guy that I'll just have room service"", I was the one who asked the question and I was standing right there. Worst was during the nights, Sonia said she didn't want to sleep alone and she didn't want to share a room with us. So Beth would sleep in Sonia's room and I would be alone. 

Beth wasn't happy about this behaviour either and told me that Sonia is very uncomfortable around men in general, so I should give her a wide berth. Then when I did that for a day, Beth came back to me and said that Sonia finds it very rude the way I've been ignoring her. I genuinely didn't know what to do, it ended up being me sitting around them while I was not included in their conversation and any conversation that I would try to have was shot down by Sonia. 

Beth would try and smooth things out but she was also caught in an uncomfortable position. It all came to a head on the second last day of Sonia's time with us. Beth has always wanted to go parasailing and our vacation spot was chosen specifically for a parasailing spot nearby which is supposed to be one of the most scenic ones in Europe. Sonia refused to join us of course. But then when we got to the spot, Sonia's mum called Beth and said that she just had a very worrying phone call with Sonia where she talked about suicide. So we rushed back, calling Sonia all the way back to the hotel when she didn't pick up multiple calls we called the hotel to check up on her for emergency reasons. Sonia was just fine, she told the hotel guys that her friends are just paranoid, and she told us that her mum was paranoid and she wasn't actually talking about committing suicide, just talking about suicide in general. Beth was fuming and they had an awful row. I found out two things during this row, firstly that Sonia was extremely manipulative even in the old days and that she had forced Beth to pay for her tickets and hotel room. While there was no real resolution to their argument, they stayed civil for the one day that Sonia was there afterwards, it was just us awkwardly watching TV in silence in our hotel rooms.   

Thankfully the non-Sonia part of our vacation was beautiful, while we didn't get to go parasailing again (you have to book at least 30 days in advance), we still had a great time doing all sorts of things and I've never felt more in love with Beth than that week. Beth also came to the resolution that she was going to take a step back from her friendship with Sonia for a while, at least till she apologises for her behaviour and pays Beth back. 

That resolution did not last long. 

We got back to London on the 23rd of June, and Beth left for her parents on the 27th without telling me. I walked into our empty flat and called her only to find out that she has been rethinking our relationship, and wanted some time to herself and that she would get in touch with me later. 

I was completely devastated, I had no inkling that this was on the cards and since Beth wasn't taking my call or responding to my messages I called Beth's mum, and she tells me that Beth isn't staying with them but with Sonia. So not only did she break her own resolution Beth also lied to me. 

The next time we spoke was on the 1st of this month when our rent was due and I texted her that she needs to send her half to the landlord.  She called me and said that though she'll send her share this month, she will also give her one month notice to remove herself from the lease. And that's how I found out that my fiance had decided to become my ex-fiance. I asked her why she was doing something this drastic without even giving us a chance to resolve whatever the problem was, she said she was going to send me an email detailing everything and that she had talked to her parents about this and they also thought that it was right for us to break up. I told her that I had talked to her mum earlier in the day and knew that she hadn't been in any sort of contact with her parents since she got to her hometown, Beth was extremely angry that I would talk to her mum and that it 'was very creepy to call a girls mum', I said that it would be very creepy if it was a random stranger, but when it's your fiance who left without any notice and then refuses to talk to you calling their parents is the obvious thing to do. An angry back and forth happened till finally, she admitted that she was with Sonia and she didn't want to tell me because she knew I was going to be annoyed about it and talk her out of it. 

On Monday, I finally get that email and its a total pile of shite. The main thing she says is that I'm controlling and that she can't spend the rest of her life with a guy like that. She used three different examples of my controlling behaviour: 

1. The vacation we just had, where I forced her and Sonia to go to all these museums and monuments that they didn't want to go to. Complete and utter bullshit, Beth has a degree in European History and these were places she had never visited before that play a big role in that history. Also, the fact that Beth had researched and found some of these places and bought tickets with literally no input from me.
2. That we'll be having a church wedding even though she isn't really religious and doesn't want to do that. Again, complete and utter bullshit. I had literally no say in the choice of venue, and the fact that the church that was chosen is the one that Beth's parents were married in might give a hint as to who chose that place.
3. That I shoot down all her proposals about flats that we might buy after the wedding and that I refuse to move to her hometown. This one is by far the weirdest. She has never made any proposals about flats we might buy, mainly because we don't even know what our budget will be until after the wedding expenses are dealt with. Also, she has never stated any desire to move back to her hometown, especially considering that her career is very much London based and would be improbable in her town.

&amp;#x200B;

I sent my reply to her along these lines, less curtly and with a lot more pleading of course. I received no reply until last night when she said that she has come to the realisation that her parents are also very controlling and that she has decided to be low-contact with them. Her parents are wonderful people who have loved and supported Beth through thick and thin, this is what Beth has said to me all through our relationship until last night.

There's something massively wrong with Beth and Sonia has been a catalyst. This part I'm sure about because today morning I got a text from Sonia saying that whatever I may need to say to Beth has to go through her and that I should refrain from contacting Beth directly or they would go to the police.

Me and Beth's parents had a conversation earlier today and they want to go to the police about Sonia. I am not sure about that. It's been less than 20 days since me and Beth were snuggling and talking about what to name our future kids. I don't know whether I'm delusional or not, but I think this is just something temporary that she'll snap out of soon. I don't even know what I will say to the police, that Beth has been kidnapped by this tiny 5-foot woman who's brainwashed her into believing everyone else in her life is abusive and controlling? I know that Beth still picks up her own calls, maybe if she doesn't hang up as soon as she hears my voice I might be able to talk to her. But what do I say that might make a difference. 

I'm very very tired by all of this, haven't slept more than 2 hours a night since she left. I want to talk to her all the time but I have to hold myself back and not come across as the controlling person that I supposedly am.

heyhoitsmeeeee,2019-07-10 16:02:01+00:00,Update: I hate being touched by my husband,"Hi all. I posted last night on an issue I’m having with my husband (check my page to see the post if you want more details), I got a lot of good advice and decided to put some of it to use. 

My husband texted me this morning asking for sex tonight and I texted him back saying “you can’t ask me 12 hours ahead. I’m not sure if I’ll want to have sex that far in advanced.” Then he proceeds to call me and basically says that since we’re married I can’t tell him no to have sex with him. He says he doesn’t tell me no that I can’t go to the gym every night after work (as if I’m not a grown ass woman and I need permission to go to the gym) so I shouldn’t tell him no sex...

I was dumb founded, literally speechless. I asked if he was serious and he said 100% yes. I tried explaining to him that just because we’re married doesn’t mean guaranteed sex, if I really wanted to I could say no to sex with him for weeks. He said “hell no, that’s not how this works. I’ve already told you, if you don’t show me affection and give me sex then we’re gonna have problems in our marriage. Because that’s what I need” 

Then he started bitching about something else so I just got off the phone as fast as possible.

The comments I got from your redditors yesterday really gave me the courage to stand up for myself. Even though my husband was not understanding, it made me feel empowered. Thank you Reddit. I know tonight after I get home from work and the gym he’ll probably bitch when I say I don’t want to have sex, but that’s the risk I’m willing to take.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cbijp0/update_i_hate_being_touched_by_my_husband/,relationship_advice,10333,2279,0.0

In the time I have known him, my boyfriend has always fell politically independent, or so I thought. Politics was never an issue between us at all. However he just admitted to me that over the past year he’s grown more and more extreme in his views, to the point that he believes women have ruined the country (we are American) and that they should not be allowed to vote... He says he did not feel comfortable telling me about this sooner because he thought he would lose me.

I’m upset and I can’t tell if I’m wrong to be upset about this because I know that everyone is entitled to have their own views, but now I just feel as though he doesn’t even value my own input/views. He has assured me that he still thinks that I should be allowed to vote but that women in general should not...

This is a person I have been with for almost 5 years. We’ve talked about marriage. I don’t know what to think. In all other aspects he is the perfect, most amazing partner, and I can’t imagine my life without him in it. But this suddenly has me rethinking about a lot.

Am I wrong to be questioning our relationship over his new beliefs? As his girlfriend am I supposed to be tolerant and respectful of his views even though I may (strongly) disagree?

Thanks everyone for your support. I actually bumped into my ex-girlfriend at the birthday party of a friend a few days ago. I didn’t know she’d be there. She said hi to me like nothing was the matter. Like we hadn’t spent 2 years of our lives together. She looked great and I wish I hadn’t gone to the party. I was healing in my own time, just going to work and focusing on friends and family. But seeing her again was like opening an old wound.

After the party, she unblocked me and sent me a very long text. She said she was sorry for how she acted, that she just woke up one day when I was gone and realized that she didn’t want to be with me. Just like that. She said being in a relationship just exhausts her (she’s an introvert). She said she likes being by herself, without any drama or tears or stress. 

I said that’s fine, but she could have at least told me. She apologized to me again and said she was being a coward. She said she hates breaking up with people and said she was waiting for me to break up with her first.

I just think she got tired of me and didn’t even care enough about me to end it properly. So she just decided pretending I didn’t exist was the best way to do it. 

I can’t say hearing all this helps. I don’t really even have much closure. But people wanted me to update and so I did.

Yesterday I went on a date with this guy my friend set me up with and he works at Walmart. I asked him what his goals were and he said he’s living in the moment. I asked him if he wanted to work at Walmart forever and he got offended and told me if I’m a gold digger then I came to the wrong place. My friend heard of this and said I’m too picky. I don’t want someone swimming in money, I just want you to not live paycheck to paycheck. It feels like women are more successful than men these days and we seem to work harder. Am I honestly being too picky or what? Would you guys be ok with dating a person that was ok with living the struggle life when they didn’t have to?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cafzch/am_i_shallow_for_wanting_a_guy_with_a_decent_job/,relationship_advice,7551,3046,0.0
rollinheightsballas,2019-07-07 20:45:31+00:00,My [28M] wife [28F] exploded at me because of a dress that I bought her.,"Hi all.

Last week I bought my wife Beth (who is my childhood sweetheart) a beautiful designer red dress which at first she absolutely adored. She wore it on a date on Friday night and we had a great time. 

However, I came home from work today and found Beth in tears. She had ripped the dress in half and told me that she hated me for getting her *this* dress. I didn't understand but she soon explained everything. 

A long time ago back when we were in school Beth was bullied by a girl called Alice. I don't think ''bullied'' is even a strong enough word. It was truly horrific what that she was put through. A lot of Beth's friends turned against her and for a long time I was her only friend (though I'm ashamed to admit there was once a brief period when I believed Alice's lies and kept my distance). 

I think Beth is the most beautiful woman alive, but sadly she has always been convinced that Alice is prettier than her, especially since Alice told her every single day that she was ugly. 

Unfortunately Beth still has those insecurity issues. She looks Alice up occasionally and still believes that she will never be as beautiful as her (even though she's a million times more), and worse she thinks that Alice is doing better in life. Beth works as a pastry chef and loves her job, but (according to linkedin) Alice went to an elite university and is now a doctor. Even though Beth loves what she does she sees Alice as more successful than herself and feels like Alice will always get away with all the horrible things she did. 

Anyways back to the present. We have a lot of friends/followers on social media from our school days, which means that Alice and her friends often come up as ''people to follow''. Unfortunately Alice came up on Beth's instagram and she couldn't resist having a look at her profile. 

Beth found a picture of Alice at some kind of party and she was clearly wearing the same dress that I had bought Beth. Bear in mind that this happened when I wasn't at home, so by the time I got home Beth had become convinced that I had seen Alice's picture and thought she was beautiful, which is why I bought the dress. She accused me of only complimenting her because she was in Alice's dress.

I swear that I had no idea that Alice had the same dress, but Beth accused me of ''wanting'' Alice. I understand where these insecurities come from. A fair few of Beth's friends ditched her to become friends with Alice and those abandonment issues have stuck around unfortunately. Beth's parents also have mental health issues and while they loved her, they were often very emotionally distant when she was a child so she often feels very unloved and at times becomes convinced that I no longer love her and will leave her. 

I tried to assure her that I hate Alice, because I do. I honestly have never hated anyone as much as that woman and wish her nothing but misery and hurt. I tried to hug Beth and tell her that I loved her, that I didn't know that Alice had the same dress, and even suggested that we burn the dress if it makes her happy. But Beth just told me to stay away from her. She is sleeping on the sofa tonight and is still downstairs crying at the moment. 

How do I make this better for her? 

tl;dr: I unknowingly bought my wife the same dress that was worn by the girl who severely bullied her at school, and she thinks that it was deliberate and that I want the bully.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cabqjk/my_28m_wife_28f_exploded_at_me_because_of_a_dress/,relationship_advice,1289,209,0.0
grizzythekid,2019-07-07 16:03:19+00:00,I just found out that my daughter is not my daughter. What the heck am I supposed to do?,"So my SO of 4+ years just confessed that my daughter who is 2.5 yrs old is not my daughter.

I was really excited to do an ancestry test on her, not because I had doubts, but just because I figured my daughter could shine some light on my and my girlfriend's ancestry. So I did it, and the results came back..

I know I was born in Scotland, and I know my family's history maybe 4 generations past. All Scotland. When the results came back, there was zero match for Celtic, Anglo Saxon etc. I was so surprised and so confused, I was getting my phone out to call my mum, and my girlfriend burst out crying saying she had fucked up.

She confessed that I wasn't her father, and that she made a mistake when I was out of town for a hot minute 2.6 years ago.

I want to make clear that I love MY daughter. I raised her, on my own sometimes, and she means the world to me. I don't feel any I'll will towards her, and I feel like I want to take care of her the same way I always have.

Her mother though, I don't know. I feel like, for our daughters sake, maybe we should try to work it out. This is, to me, a massive betrayal, so I don't even know if that's fucking possible. It's like she took the shine off of my fucking joy.

I'm trying my hardest to see beyond what she's done. Trying so hard to feel and be the same to my wonderful baby girl, but my mind is stormy, and I'm fucking raging ATM. I've turned to the bottle to try chill out, but it's not working.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ca8eih/i_just_found_out_that_my_daughter_is_not_my/,relationship_advice,1744,614,0.0
throwawaynocollege01,2019-07-07 12:13:03+00:00,"Mom had an affair 18 years ago, I [18M] am the product of it. My dad just informed me of all this, and told me he will not pay for my college, while my siblings got their college experience paid by our dad.","Pretty much the title. I have no idea how to process all this, and I am completely unprepared for what lies ahead :(

Both my older brother and sister went to the same college. My brother graduated two years ago, my sister is set to graduate in two years. Both had their college paid by our dad. Dad paid all their college expenses, including rent, food, their cars, pocket money, you name it.

My brother has a job now, his own place, lives together with his fiancee, and has his life together.

My sister already has a good paying job, and my dad still pays for almost everything for her.

I got accepted to the same college, which was always the plan, and was looking forward to talk with my parents about the next steps, and ask them to help me the same they did for my siblings. I always assumed they had money put aside for my college the way they had for my siblings.

Instead I was met with a story about my mom's cheating, how I am the result of her cheating, and how my dad is not willing to support me any more moving forward.

Dad told me that mom had 18 years to let me know and prepare me for the future, but obviously she never did. He said it was never is place to say anything since I am not his son, and didn't want to interfere with mom's parenting.

Apparently my grandparents know I am not dad's biological son, but they haven't bothered to tell me anything either.

My siblings had no idea, and they are as surprised as I am because there was never a hint of anything being off. I might be naive, but I always thought I had a great relationship with my dad. We go to see sports together, we go fishing together, he tutored me when I had difficulties with math (dad is an engineer), he taught me to drive. I never got a hint he stores resentment towards me. I mean, he gave me my name, and has explained what my name means, and he was very proud of it. It's a story he tells from time to time. He likes to talk about stuff like that about me.

My mom has never said a word about anything, and apparently she was supposed to have ""the talk"" with me, but she never did.

I feel abandoned and unprepared for what lies ahead. I am not even sure I will be able to go to college any more, I always assumed my parents will pay for it. I never had a job, and I am not sure what job I can even get to support me through college, I have no idea how to apply for loans.

All my mom has done is cry and apologize. But nothing of substance, she has no idea how to help me.

I don't even know if I am welcomed home any more, it's all up in the air, I feel shame leaving my room, and if I will be asked to move out I don't know where to go. I don't have any savings, maybe $400 put together.

I am angry at my mom, I am confused about where I stand with my dad. There's a man out there who is my father that never wanted to have anything to do with me. I feel rejected and I have no idea what to do to fix this situation.

Anyone have any idea what to do here?

Do I apologize to my dad? What do I say to him?

thegoodtwin28,2019-07-06 22:52:54+00:00,UPDATE: I'm thinking of distancing myself from my twin sister and telling her close friend about a five year long affair between her husband and my twin sister. Should I do it?,"A little while after my husband came back home with our kids I asked him about the pic my sister sent him. He told me that every now and then she sends him pics and asks questions/his opinions etc. I asked him about what has she sent before, and he told me that sometimes in the past she sent him pics of her in different dresses and  hairstyles and asked for his opinions. I asked him if there is anything else she sends him or messages him about and he told me no. I asked why he didn't tell me about the pics she sent him, he told me that since the pics were innocent he didn't think it was necessary to tell me. I told him that he definitely should have told me and he apologised. After that I told him about what my sis confessed to last night and he was in disbelief. I told him that I'm going to cut ties with her and I want him to do the same as well as blocking her phone number. He agreed.

After that I wanted to contact Jane. Since I'm not close with her I didn't have her number and I forgot to get it from my sister's phone last night  so I got it from a mutual friend instead. Then, I called Jane and told her who I was and asked if I could meet her because it's urgent. I gave her my address and told her to come alone. When she arrived we hugged and I took her to my living room and sat her down. Then I explained to her what my sis told me regarding her and Jane's husband's affair and I showed her videos I recorded of their texts and pics/vids she sent him. She burst into tears and wrapped her arms around me. I tried to console her and I offered her my full support.

A few minutes later she thanked me for telling her and told me she's going back home to confront her husband. A few hours after that she called back and told me what went down between her and her husband. He confessed to everything and begged for her forgiveness. She told me that a while after thinking about it she agreed to give him another chance to keep their marriage and family intact. She told me that he said it was my sis who initiated the affair and she asked me if that's true to the best of my knowledge. I told her about my sister's lifestyle involving married men and said I'm 99.9% sure that she must have been the one who started the affair. She them told me that she and her husband are completely cutting all ties with my sis and I told her that I'm doing the same. I recommended that if they are planning on fixing their marriage they go to couple's therapy. She agreed and and then asked me if she and I could talk to and see each other more often. I told her that I will absolutely do that and I'm there for her if she needs me.

Then I called my sister and told her why my husband and I are cutting off all ties with her and that she should not try to interact with him,me or our children anymore and then I hung up. She hasn't called back since. Now, I'm only concentrating on Jane and how I can be a friend to her in her time of need.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c9ztfk/update_im_thinking_of_distancing_myself_from_my/,relationship_advice,8596,684,0.0
ozzymomo123,2019-07-06 19:56:02+00:00,"[UPDATE] Me [18M] and 9 other friends [18M] on holiday in Spain. One friend won't pay for the Villa, as he came last minute as a replacement. Shall we kick him out? [UPDATE]","Okay so I listened to everyone who commented, and discussed all of it with the rest of my friends. 

Thank you all for the advice. 

We were all upstairs around a table and some chairs / sofa. We called him upstairs, and I think he knew what was coming because he seemed already pissed off. 

I started off by explaining by trying to calmly explain the situation with him having to pay, but then was immediately cut off by someone saying ""Yo you have to pay us £250 for the Villa."" Obviously he got pissed at this. 

We were arguing / discussing / whatever it was for a good half an hour or so. It was kinda heated not gonna lie. 

He handled it really well, and I admit it was really sly of us to all sort of ""gang up"" on him, because I've been in that situation before and it feels really bad. So I tried to keep everything calm. 

Basically there was a bit more to the story, since the 2 people organising this trip to Spain, basically didn't fill the rest of us in on some essential stuff. 

Like for example, the amount Mark got refunded was only £100, whereas the price of the Villa was £250. But the thing is, the 2 people organising it apparently ""agreed"" that it's fine for him to stay, and this is where the confusion comes in, because they say they didn't. Essentially, when we were still planning the holiday, Mark apparently already asked these 2 people if it's okay for him to cancel the apartment and come in our villa, and they said yes but none of them set prices and shit straight from the start. 

Mark's point is, he's taking Harry's spot, so why should he pay, since, if he wasn't there, the refundable deposit would go to Harry either way? 

This is probably confusing and it's hard to explain since it was a very lengthy and heated engagement so I'm not sure how to explain absolutely everything, so that's the jist of it. 

Harry, who cancelled, was going to get all of the refundable deposit. We asked Mark to pay for staying in the villa, and he said no. 

We asked him in many different ways, and he raised some valid points, but still said No. Also, he has thousands of pounds, so paying that wasn't the problem. 

He just didn't want to pay. 

So, we listened to all of you, and told him he can't sleep in the villa if he's not paying because it's not fair on everyone else. He was pissed, and we even had to ring some of our friends back home to clear up some more shit that was there due to poor organising and lack of communication. 

So, I suggested instead of £250 he pay £145, which is how much it would cost to stay in the villa for the remainder of the holiday. The reason I said this is because we did bring it up with him 3 days into the holiday, so it's unfair of us to expect him to pay the full amount. 

He didn't want to pay it. Eventually, and I mean eventually, we decided that he's going to stay in the apartment that those 2 other people rented out that is near our Villa. He will pay them for staying in the apartment, as it's cheaper than our Villa, only around £100. 

Everything is awkward as fuck and I'm fearing that the holiday may be ruined because of this. I felt so bad after for all of us ""ganging up"" on him, because that's pretty much what it was. I've been on the other side, and I know how it feels like. 

So, I offered to pay the £45 for him, and he only pays £100. At this point he was packing his suitcase and everything so he still declined and said he didn't want to stay with people who didn't want him there anyway. 

We all tried to stress how it's not personal, and we aren't doing it on purpose. I felt bad after so I went to him individually and just said sorry essentially for all of us ganging up on him, and we aren't doing it just for the sake of it. 

So he packed, and he's staying elsewhere, like you guys said he should. So thank you. 

In the meantime we just went to the beach to try kill the tension and any awkwardness between us, it's working slowly but surely. 

Thanks again and happy holidays to everyone :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c9xveg/update_me_18m_and_9_other_friends_18m_on_holiday/,relationship_advice,2047,441,0.0

drobthrowaway,2019-07-06 12:15:30+00:00,UPDATE: My (M21) parents (M/F 50s) think I need therapy because I enjoyed my summer vacation. PLEASE HELP ME.,"I didn’t think that I would update this but I’d just give a little something.

My mother came into my bedroom and we sat down and talked. She said that she was now mad at my dad for saying that he “wasn’t in my corner” most of my life. This is 100 percent true. I truly think my dad doesn’t understand other people’s perspectives. 

With his career, there’s a three month stretch that he has to work over 100 hours a week. Hard to believe but it’s true. He thinks that if you’re not busy, you should be working. Which brings me to my previous problem about my summer vacation. 

He thought that there was something wrong with me because I wasn’t working. I was just so burned out from work/school that I decided to take a break for the summer. I go to college 1300 miles from my hometown so he never saw me struggle trying to juggle school and work (it paid off, just found out I made deans list for the second time). And I knew that once I headed back to school, the cycle would continue.

My mother told me that he’s been making snide remarks this whole summer about me not working. And my mother was the only whole that kept him for forcing me to work. It made me realize that I was a dumbass for yelling at my mom today. We have our own problems but she is seriously my rock. This has nothing to do with anything but if my parents ever got divorced when I was younger, I would’ve wanted to stay with my mom permanently.

She’s the one who taught me to hit a jump shot and how to throw a curveball. She took me to all my AAU basketball tournaments from age 13 to 18. My dad was never been there for those moments because he’s always been working. I think I may have grown to resent him a little for always working. 

I think I started to truly hate him last winter when I came home for Christmas break. The previous semester was when I started my full time job. It was a little hard for me to balance time but the second semester of my sophomore year was a lot better. I told him that I got 3 B’s, 1 A and a C for my grades. He made a comment that still sticks to me today. He said “well you better get deans list next semester so you’ll save me money.” My mom and I both laughed because we thought he was joking. He wasn’t. It started another argument where my mom defended me.

From that moment on, I’ve secretly hated him. And the events of yesterday was the icing on the cake. I told him straight up that I hate him. And his response? He said “well you’re entitled to your own opinion. Just remember how much I do for you.” I was seething with anger but just decided that it wasn’t worth my time.

I slept till around 11 pm and grab some food as I didn’t eat the whole day. My mom was sleeping on the couch, mostly because she was still mad about what he said to me.

So ya that’s basically it. I made up with my mom but I told my dad that I hate him.

Thank you to all the people who told me about the benefits of therapy. It truly changed my opinion. I haven’t told either of them yet but I’m gonna say that I’ll only go to therapy if my dad goes as well. It can be him and I together or both of us separate. I just wanna know why he thinks there’s something wrong with me.

I don’t know if there will be another update. There’s really nothing else to say at this point. Thanks everyone for the help.

This subreddit became a pseudo hobby for me for the past month. I kinda like giving my opinion when others ask for help about their relationships and the dialogue people have together as a community. I’m just glad that people were here to help me out when I needed it.

Shall we kick him out?","Okay so it's essentially the title but I'll try to explain it as best as I can. Names have been changed. 

There are 10 of us in total. 8 of us in the Villa, and 2 have an apartment near our Villa. 

1) Harry was going to come. 

2) Harry cancelled around 1 week before we were going to come, so we didn't know until then that he wasn't going to come. 

3) Zack was going to come. 

4) Zack cancelled around 1 month before we were going to come, so we had plenty of time to find a replacement. 

5) Hank and Mark replaced them but none of us were told, one guy literally invited them out of nowhere, and none of us are that close with both of them. They both said Yes. 

6) He asked them both, even though at that time only Zack had cancelled. They both said Yes, so they decided Hank stay in the Villa, and Mark would get an apartment near us as well. 

7) Hank is replacing Zack. At this point we didn't know Harry wasn't coming. 

8) Hank is booked in for the villa, he pays all the money like everyone else (£240 just for Villa for 1 week). 

9) As we didn't know Harry was going to cancel, Mark books his own little apartment near to the other 2 people. 

10) Harry cancels around 1 week before we're about to leave. 

11) Without the rest of us knowing Mark refund his apartment, and decides to just stay in our villa, even though we've told the villa owner there's 7 of us only, since Harry cancelled. 

12) We had to show and sign documents showing our passports, and documentation basically to confirm there is only 7 of us staying in the villa. 

13) So, the only thing Mark has paid for is is own flight which is £160. 

14) So, he needs to pay around £240 for staying in the villa for 1 week, like everyone else has. 

15) The rest of us only found out yesterday that he hasn't paid, but he's already said to 2 other people, he's not gonna pay because ""ITS EASIER FOR ME"". 

16) He goes ""I'm doing you guys a favour by taking the extra spot that Harry was gonna go on"" ?!?!?!

17) Also, basically because Haarith isn't coming we all decided to do something nice and all give him the refundable deposit for the villa which was £250 which means between us we are paying like £35 for the deposit. By doing this we are minimising the amount of money he loses, since some of the things he paid was non-refundable.  

18) If you think about it, if Mark paid, we would all get our deposit back. But he's not, and the deposit that's going to Haarith, is covering £250 worth of the shit at the villa. The villa that Mark is staying at free of charge because it's ""easier"". 

19) So we are literally paying £250 to Mark essentially  and he is saying ""im doing you guys a favour"". We are basically paying for his holiday, and losing money ourselves. 

20) So yeah we are going to ask him to pay later on otherwise he's not staying in the villa he can actually fuck off and find some other accommodation. Do you think that's fair? But we really don't want to put him out on the streets, but we don't know how else to get him to pay. 

21) If he says he will pay after the holiday, he literally and simply just won't, he will be lying, and after the holiday is done there's nothing that we can do really. 

22) he's slimey, scummy, stingey, and a cunt. How can we get him to pay? If he pays that means we can all get our refundable deposit back too, which is around £35 per person which would be nice too. 

23) 2 people have asked him to pay already, and he told them all to Fuck Off. We know for a fact that he has the money, so that's not the issue. He himself has money in his account, and his family is also decently well off, like not poor or anything. 

What can we do? 

TL;DR : Friend came last minute. He won't pay for staying in the Villa. What shall we do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c9spf7/me_18m_and_9_other_friends_18m_on_holiday_in/,relationship_advice,4408,1225,0.0
helpme19711817817181,2019-07-05 22:14:38+00:00,FINAL UPDATE I (27f) found out my boyfriend (33m) is not divorced or childless when I told him I was pregnant.,"Short update because I realize it kind of seems like I left you guys hanging. 

First I’d like to address that the pregnancy was unexpected but not explicitly planned. “Accidental” was not the right word, but I’m aware of how babies are made. I was in a sense trying to get pregnant, but only because my ex lied to me and convinced me he was onboard. I’m not gonna sit here and explain the ins and outs of how I was duped, I was stupid and missed some flags but I absolutely planned on bringing a child into what I expected would be a healthy, safe, loving environment. 

That environment is not real. I am not ready to be a mother under the current circumstances, I am not mentally or emotionally fit to carry out a pregnancy, and I am most definitely not going to put a child through the adoption system. It is just not a guarantee of a good life and I can’t in good conscience do that. For those and other reasons I’ve explained before, I have begun the process of getting an abortion. 

I collected photographs, videos, screenshots of texts, and everything I could find as evidence to show my ex’s wife. I tried to find texts in which he referenced being divorced or just any lies to prove that I’m not at fault, but I heeded yalls warnings to not try and help her or push her too far since I don’t know how she’d receive these news. I simply found her on social media, sent her all the pictures and screenshots, and a short run down of what her husbands been doing for 2 years. It took a day for her to respond but all she said was “thank you” and once I saw that, I blocked her. 

I have not heard from anyone and I hope to never have to hear or think about this situation again. It’s behind me. I have no idea what happened with my ex and his wife, and I probably never will.

SameTrainer,2019-07-05 19:09:20+00:00,Update: Boyfriend's (21M) best friend (20F) hates me (25F) and wants us to break up.,"first post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c3eda8/_/

so it's been 2 weeks since i posted.

i talked to my bf the day after and basically said what everyone else already commented and what i was thinking. no, i didn't secretly record her because that didn't sit right with me. i told him her behavior was making me super uncomfortable and that he needed to set boundaries with her asap, or i wasn't going to put up with it anymore. i was fucking pissed while telling him this and he got the message. he texted her in front of me and even let me read it. i was satisfied and very relieved. felt like i could finally breathe.

best friend came over a few times and was very nice to me. she wasn't being inappropriate even once, very respectful of the boundaries we had set. when we were alone she was the same girl as when we were all together. total 180. great. i was sooo glad and happy. thought she got the hint.

Throwaway99d58aw,2019-07-05 09:18:54+00:00,[Update] Wife started to hate me and our kids out of a sudden and now she left us,"A lot of people seem to care and I got a ton of encouraging messages, so I will post an update for you.

We live in northern Europe, for those that asked.

&amp;#x200B;

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c8kusg/wife_started_to_hate_me_and_our_kids_out_of_a/)

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for everyone that gave me their advice. A lot of you have assumed schizophrenia or the rare Capgras delusion. Some of you assumed she was cheating which is something I won’t even address. 

Thinking about it, Capgras really fitted the symptoms but I couldn’t just accept that, still hoping she was somehow fucking with us or that it was something mild and temporary and I just overreacted.

After they took her in, i drove to the mental institute to give an exact explanation of what happened in the last week. The psychiatrist assumed some sort of schizophrenia. They told me they will look after her and I should go home to my children. I felt like i was drunk the entire time, I couldn’t close a single eye at night.

The psychiatrist called me yesterday evening and asked me to come to her office. I left my children with my grandparents and drove for what it felt like an eternity.

She told me straight up that she strongly assumes that its Capgras. She never saw a case of Capgras before but it fits everything she gathered. She explained to me how the past 2 days went down.

My wife arrived there, being extremely hostile. She was put in a 'safe room' where she couldn't hurt herself. She calmed down after a couple of hours and the psychiatrist was able to talk to her. The good news was, that she quickly opened up and explained to her what she thinks. She 'knows' that her family and most of her friends have been swapped by clones. She assumed that we, 'the clones', have sent police officers to get her and that she was scared of what we might do to her. She flew in the first place because she felt that we might attack her but mostly to get some space. She still isn’t sure if the 'clones' are malicious or not. That explains why she was distrusting me and always searched for some signs in me and the kids. My wife said that we act exactly like the real ones and how perfect our disguise was, but she knew that we aren’t real because she didn’t feel any love towards me or the kids or her own parents. Writing this down feels like a lance piercing through my chest. 

She also told her how she was trying to hide her distrust of us, because she couldn't be sure if we know that she knows that we aren’t the real 'we'. Her delusion that we’ve been swapped came to her 1 day before I noticed it. 10 days ago. She woke up, looked at me and knew that I wasn't the same anymore, not the real one. Same with the kids, her parents and her friends. She hadn’t had those thoughts before. 

She asked the psychiatrist if she knows who swapped us or why it happened or if this happens often. She tried to avoid answering her question because she wasn’t sure how my wife would react if she gave in or took her out of her delusion. My wife asked her when she can get out again, the psychiatrist asked her if she wants to get out and she answered that she’s ok being here. It gives her some comfort being with professionals and she now has time to think. It helps that my wife is a nurse and that she respects doctors a lot. 

The psychiatrist explained to me, how they will try to slowly deconstruct her delusion and that it can take a short or a very long time until she fully recovers. She explained to me that it’s possible that she might never truly recover. But the fact that she opened up about it and doesn’t necessarily feel scared is a good sign. Im still not allowed to see her as it could make her panic. She apperas to be completely clear of mind about everything else. She knows names, dates, places, facts and everything she knew before. Only the thought that we aren’t the real ones is now a fact for her. Now I wait, till they have some good or bad news of how she develops.

Writing all of this down really helped me. I’m trying to wrap my head around this situation and im mostly scared for her and the children. I can’t hide how distressed I am and that my wife isn’t at home so I explained to them that she is in a mental hospital and she has to recover. The 4yo doesn’t really understand but the other two took it surprisingly well. It helps that they heard all those morbid stories my wife told them from the hospital i guess. They asked me  when they can see her and i told them that i dont know, but i hope it will be soon. I havent felt this empty and i dont know if i should be sad or angry. fuck

Thanks to everyone here that helped me. I feel like im in a waiting room at the dentist. Ist so surreal. I feel better knowing what the problem is, but worse not knowing when it ends.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c9dwlr/update_wife_started_to_hate_me_and_our_kids_out/,relationship_advice,7225,342,0.0

RIPpuppythrowaway,2019-07-05 02:54:27+00:00,I think my (25M) twin brother killed our sister's (22) puppy by feeding the puppy alcohol on purpose.,"Sorry this is so long. Idk where to begin. I have a twin brother and a little sister that my parents adopted when we were 7. I always knew my brother was jealous of our sister. She was the only one in our family to go to college, and she'll be starting graduate school this fall. As you can imagine, everyone is so proud of her, except my brother. He didn't even attend her college graduation because he was busy "" babysitting his friends at a bar.""

He also has always made bad decisions. He does a lot of drugs, has a girlfriend that is a toxic person, and is a total dick to our sister.

Me and my brother currently rent a house, and our sister moved in to the basement since the house is a few blocks away from her school. She always wanted a puppy, so me and my parents contributed to get her a new puppy as a graduation present.

Fast forward to last night, my brother got so so drunk at home with his buddies while I was at work. I texted him asking to give the puppy some fresh water and food. He texted back saying he did. I came back from work this morning, and I see the puppy lifeless near his dog bowl. There was also so a putrid smell prominent near the area. It smelled like bad wine. 

I asked him wtf happened, and he said something along the lines of "" I probably was so drunk I thought the vodka was water."" I don't believe him at all. I think he did it on purpose. 

My sister is currently on vacation and trusted us to watch her puppy. My parent's just want to get her a new puppy and not tell her. She's smart and will find out. How do I tell her? Also, should I cut all ties with my brother, and move me and my sister out somewhere else, maybe back home with the  parents for now? 

TLDR: I think my brother gave alcohol to my sisters puppy and killed it out of jealousy",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c9aw4n/i_think_my_25m_twin_brother_killed_our_sisters_22/,relationship_advice,1269,290,0.0

My wife (F26) sold our bed and purchased a queen size because it matches a cute frame she likes. We do not sleep together anymore.,"Probably a weird post because I've never seen anyone complain about this but I am a tall guy and I value sleep. When my wife and I got married we had a king size and we slept together for 6 years. Last year she got rid of our king and got a queen with a frame she likes. 

At first it was alright. I did manage to at least get some sleep but I would wake up at the edge of the bed and my feet were always hanging off the bed. I mentioned this to my wife and she said I just need go adjust. Couple months go by and it gets worse.

One night I fall asleep downstairs on my sectional and have one of the best nights of sleep in my life. Months later and I'm still sleeping downstairs on my sectional. My wife complained but I told her that I need to sleep and not wake up every night hanging off the bed or being constantly awakened by her sprawling out.

Tonight she begged me to go to sleep with her upstairs. I told her I'm not sleeping in that bed because I have to work tomorrow and need a good nights sleep and that I have told her countless times that if she just gets a bigger bed again I'll sleep with her.

Friends [women in their 20s] think my brother [35/M] is a bad choice""","[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c5rn6a/i_am_25_and_getting_married_dealing_with_issue/)

&amp;#x200B;

I am so thankful for all of your comments - I read every single one of them! 

&amp;#x200B;

So, what happened? Well, I realized that it is my wedding. My fiance fully understood my position and really likes my brother and thought it was a great idea. I organized a brunch with my current bridesmaids to explain my position and why I did what I did. I realized that it's a story I've told but didn't talk about with my friends, I thought it was abundantly clear that being 'different' from my family made it obvious. 

&amp;#x200B;

The brunch was interesting. What I didn't mention in my last post was that the person who raised the most fuss was also someone who seemed to get the other people going more than they otherwise would have. We met for a lovely brunch at a nice place (my treat, too!) and I raised the issue once more. The person who was most ""disgusted"" by it, ""Ms. X"" again raised her objection. She was furious and said that this was a travesty and tried to rally the other girls. This time, there wasn't as much of a reaction and the others sort of just didn't care. I told them all why I wanted to honor my brother and why it was so important to me and Ms. X admitted that it was lovely and touching but it should be her because *it's her business!* Turns out that she wanted to be MoH and was going behind my back to get the other girls to drop-out of contention so that she could do it so she could plan the wedding and thus could be MoH/Wedding Planner and this would be for her business. I was a bit... surprised. Ms. X was so upset that she threatened to drop out of the bridal party altogether if this went further. Brunch was tense after she left but the consensus was, the other girls wanted her gone and I didn't want her around anymore either, so she's no longer being included (I will send her an invite). 

&amp;#x200B;

That meant I had to speak to my brother. As I mentioned he's a doctor and has a dual practice, so I swung by his office and texted him that I really needed to talk. He misinterpreted my comments so he kept the office open late and his secretary/nurse/wife let me in. I went into his office and he was immediately worried I was sick, but I told him what had happened and why Ms. X dropped out and that I wanted him to be my ""Man of Honor"". He was totally surprised and confused. He asked if I was sure and that I really shouldn't feel compelled which is when I began crying (I had so much pent up emotion) so he made me laugh which meant I was snorting-laugh-crying which is my usual. He said he would be delighted but wasn't really good at bridal showers so he would need help. 

&amp;#x200B;

We arranged a time for all the bridesmaids to come together and meet the Man of Honor so we are having a BBQ at my parent's place this weekend. My mom and dad are so happy that he's involved - my dad is walking me down the aisle and my brother will stand at the end. My brother offered a very VERY generous gift towards paying for the wedding so not only is he standing as the MoH but is paying about 1/3 of the wedding. We're really, really excited. 

&amp;#x200B;

Interesting story: One of the bridesmaids actually knows my brother - this bridesmaid and I were friends at college and lived away for a while. While visiting home she developed some sort of nasty infection and was directed from a walk-in clinic to an emergency room where my brother attended to her and got her on her way. So there's a weird personal connection that they can talk about when they meet ""Hey, you lanced something somewhere! Glad to meet you again!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

All-in-all, I'm sad one friend turned out to be so selfish but I'm happy to got my Man of Honor.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c8rzzg/update_to_i_am_25_and_getting_married_dealing/,relationship_advice,5315,203,0.0
Drud_man,2019-07-03 12:13:24+00:00,[UPDATE] I (25M) let my step-sister (21F) move into my apartment and now she is trying to seducing me. Please help.,"***Previous post:*** [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/c3oyqa/i\_25m\_let\_my\_stepsister\_21f\_move\_into\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c3oyqa/i_25m_let_my_stepsister_21f_move_into_my/)

&amp;#x200B;

So first of all I want to thank everyone who took time to read and comment on my previous post. To all people who made insest jokes and inappropriate comments on my previous post, I strongly dislike them. Even if we both are not blood related we are still siblings and I would under no circumstances have a intimate relationship with my sister.

So after that day, I called my mom and told her everything. She did not believe me at first. Then I texted her everything small clips of surveillance footage, screenshots of texts with Laura before I blocked her. She was shocked and disgusted, the footage showed how inappropriate she was. My mom then had a meltdown on the phone. Yes I feel sad for my mom, but I did not knew of any other way to deal with this situation. My mom always had an image of Laura as some innocent little child. She did scold me because I did not told her before. So at night I called her again now that she was calm. I told her to come over to my place, she agreed.

Meanwhile before my mom came, I avoided being with Laura as much as possible. I left early morning and came late to the house. I kept any conversations short and only had to deal with her few times. Yes Laura was sorry, she was apologetic. She kept telling me she messed up.But I knew none of that and I just had enough of her. I wanted her to just leave. As much as I know Laura, she is very manipulative.

So now last friday my mom came to my apartment. First thing she did after putting her bags down was to confront Laura.  My mom and Laura had a big fight over this, so I left the apartment for a short while. When I came back Laura was packing her stuff. My mom had booked a hotel room for her to stay for a day. Apparently she has been moved into a ""all girls hostel"". 

Now currently I am asking my bio dad move in with me to satisfy a need for a roommate, as Laura has now gone.

**Now here are answers to some common questions I got on my previous post:**

**1) Why I don't want to pursue romantic relationship with Laura?**

   She is my sister.

**2) Is Laura beautiful?**

   Yes. But I don't see her anything more than a ""sister"".

**3) Am I single?**

   I have started to see a girl.

**4) Did I tell my parents about this?**

   Yes.

**5) Am I going to continue to keep contact with Laura?**

   Probably no.

**6) Will this affect my relationship with my parents?**

   Yes. But I am sure they will get over it.

**7) Why Laura acted this way towards me?**

   According to her I was a very gentle and supportive person to her. She developed crush feelings for me. But I think she   
   did this because of the messy breakup she had.

&amp;#x200B;

Throwaway99d58aw,2019-07-03 06:52:33+00:00,Wife started to hate me and our kids out of a sudden and now she left us,"Hi, this is my first time posting and im not an english native speaker. Im also sorry for my mess of a text but im just at the end mentally.

&amp;#x200B;

My \[38M\] wife \[36F\] started to become increasingly hostile towards me, the kids and her own parents.

Our kids are 12, 9 and 4 yo. I first started to notice it around one week ago when our 12 yo tripped while playing and fell on her face. I ran to her to reassure she was ok but my wife didn't really...bother? She just sat on the bench and watched me and our daughter. That evening i asked her why she showed no reaction and she shrugged it off and told me that 'I looked after her so its ok'. Thats not her normal behaviour at all and if that had happened a couple months ago she would have dropped everything and immediately look after our daughter. 

A day after that incident we ate dinner and the 9 yo asked her to pass him the Ketchup. She didn't pass it but responded with 'Why do you want to eat our Ketchup?'. That caught me off guard and I was extremely baffled. He asked if it isn't also 'his' Ketchup but she insisted that its hers and her families Ketchup. I Thought she was making a joke but she looked extremely stern and sincere, so I gave him the ketchup. The rest of the day was uneventful but she kept looking at me and the kids in this... I really dont know... aggressive fassion. As if we were a threat to her. 

During the last week I received only one kisse, not a single hug or any other kind of affection and even if she sometimes smiles at me, it just looks extremely forced. Sometimes she just looks at me as if she searches something. Obiously I asked her a couple times if something was wrong but she always denied it and said everything is fine. The problem is, if she was only hostile towards me i could somewhat in some way understand it. Maybe I annoy her, maybe she doesn't love me anymore or she thinks im cheating or I dont fucking know. But she also seems to hate or at least be neutral towards the children. When they talk about school she doesnt care, when they have problems she doesnt care. She doesn't tuck them in at night and i tell our kids that she's just in a bad mood and has a lot on her plate. But obiously they know as sure as I do that something isn't right. It really got out of hand when 2 days ago her mother called me, asking me if something is wrong with her daughter. Apparently she doesnt or at least only briefly answers her texts and doesn't want to meet her anymore. She told me that my wife told her that she 'isn't her real mother' which of course is something horrible to say and we both dont know why she said it or what exactly it meant. When she asked my wife why she just said that she excused herself and said that it was a joke. She never or at least rarely had an argument with her mom. We all hat a great relation up to this week and i just cant in any possible way find out what changed. It kept me up at night because my wife just feels like a different person. Now I thought about a mental illness, maybe some form of early altsheimers? But it doesn't seem to fit her behaviour. She had a depression when she was younger but thats 10 years ago. She was as lovely as one can be not even 2 weeks ago. There are a lot of other instances of her behaviour but i dont have the energy to write it down right now.

That brings me to yesterday. I sat her down and asked her if something is wrong and I need an answer now or otherwise we will see a psychiatrist. She started telling me that everything was fine and she just 'has to act as she always does'. That sentence made me feel sick to my stomach because I didn't know what it meant. Is she seeing someone? Is someone fucking holding her hostage or what is happening? I asked her what she meant but she just brushed it off again, saying that she is ok. I then told her that we're seeing a psychologist and she started screaming at me that I can't make her. I insisted so she threw a cup at me, got up and told me that she wants her 'real family' back. I don't fucking know what that means. We didn't change anything. Everything is as it was a month ago. She grabbed her purse and ran out of the house. She returned a couple hours later and told me she is sorry for how she acted. She did a complete 360 and said everything is good now she kissed me and told me she will explain it tomorrow but she is just tired now. When we got to bed later she kept looking at me as if I'm a stranger but I was also extremely exhausted from everything and just fell asleep. Its morning now and she left the house. I can't find her and it looks like she packed some stuff of hers. Some jackets, her purse 2 pairs of shoes. I called her parents, her friends, everyone she knows but they all havent seen her. Her friends told me all that they haven't had contact with her in the last week.  Should I call the police now? Have some of you experienced something similar? I just dont know what to do. I have never felt this helpless.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c8kusg/wife_started_to_hate_me_and_our_kids_out_of_a/,relationship_advice,1587,218,0.0
unknowndate,2019-07-03 06:05:45+00:00,Girlfriend’s parents say I embarrassed them by teaching their daughter. Time to go ?,"Long story short, my girlfriend has already been heavily spoiled by her parents and the tonnes of pathetic chasers that are willing to do anything for her like a queen, before we were together. I just didn’t realise it would be this bad.

So to sum up, recently it was her birthday, and she literally nagged and nitpicked everything, from the restaurant (tables without table cloth, curtains not good, waiters not smart enough, food not good, plates not pretty, air conditioner too cold, too many people, too noisy, there’s mosquitoes which will bite her), to the cake, to the gift, to the location of the restaurant (the fact that we have to walk a while to get up here, like literally 10 mins, but she’s wearing high heels so I can relate).

Since we were eating with her parents, she has been throwing these moods at me all the way when we were walking from the station, all the way even when we sat down, and she continued to sulk and threw tantrums about all the things mentioned above, in front of her parents.

She even began saying shit like; next time, I’ll arrange the birthday celebration myself. Can’t really trust you. Right, next year you probably ain’t here too, no worries. 

That moment I kept controlling myself to talk back and kept saying: it’s okay. I’ll do better...etc, but I could no longer take this crap anymore (she’s been acting like this back then, not just on the birthday, but today I’ve opened my eyes wide). I spoke up to her and reasoned with her. I said: I planned everything for you since I love you, and the least thing you could do is appreciate ? How do you think it makes me feel if you keep saying those things ? I have emotions too. 

And then she started crying and said I’m abusing her and embarrassing her in front of her parents. Her parents seemed cool and they should know their daughter well, so they just defused the situation.

Now day’s over. Once they’re back home, they love to have these family discussions. My girlfriend called me that night and said: I’m very disappointed. You embarrassed me and thrashed my party. Now I’ll forever remember this 2xth birthday every year. And my parents said you embarrassed them too because it feels like you’re helping them to teach their daughter, implying they don’t know how to teach her.

You guys all really hyped me up so thanks for the thousands of pep talks, I wouldn’t have been able to muster up the courage on my own. So I told him that I didn’t enjoy sex. I could tell by his face that he already knew it wasn’t fun for me and he was frustrated I brought it up. 

basicallyyyy I asked him to please do something for me for once or I can’t do it anymore. I don’t like giving ultimatums or being confrontational like that especially knowing he is in a tough spot. But He agreed to touch me over my underwear but he was very obviously trying to distract himself when I was getting wet by kissing me. He was upset afterwards and locked himself in the bathroom. I couldn’t help but cry like it felt so fucked up, how does he get me off and then go hide in the bathroom. and he heard me so he came out and I said I hated him. Not the most constructive thing to say but I couldn’t help it. He said he couldn’t do that again and offered opening up the relationship so I could have sex with other guys and get oral from them. 

I do NOT want to be in a polygamous relationships. I am a strictly monogamous type of girl. I don’t want 2 boyfriends. So I told him that wasn’t an option and he just shrugged. I asked him if he was gay and he said no. I asked if he was sure or if he had a traumatic experience or if he’s trying to get out of doing the work. he told me we can break up if I want since he wouldn’t answer my questions. And when I told him ok it’s over, he started crying and I asked him to please tell me what was wrong and he said no. 

Basically we broke up. I wanna help him and figure out what’s wrong but he doesn’t wanna open up so there. I didn’t think he’d get emotional but yeah",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c8go62/update_to_my_20f_boyfriend_21m_hates_my_vagina/,relationship_advice,6096,1019,0.0

This will be my only update, and I'm only posting it due to the amount of support I've gotten as well as the numerous requests to do so. I didn't expect the response I got and I've unfortunately seen it referenced on other subreddits, so I'm choosing to confront it. Most of you were right. Congratulations.

I read through all of your replies and spoke to friends, and stewed for a day. My wife stuck to her story, apologized for making me uncomfortable and assured me it wouldn't happen again. Cocksucker decided to leave a handwritten note in the mailbox specifically apologizing as well. I still didn't feel better, and the consensus was that I should speak to my neighbor's wife, who we're going to call Sally, so that's what I did.

Watched my neighbor leave for work, then called my MIL to come take my wife for a lunch and a girls date so she could get out of the house. I left as usual for work, called off again and went to stay with a friend. Got a text from my wife around noon telling me she was with MIL and would be back by dinner. Went home and knocked on Sally's door.

Cocksucker decided to tell Sally I kicked him out and caused a scene about not wanting either of them speaking to us anymore because I was pissed about him ""helping"" my wife. Come to find out both Sally and cocksucker have been going over to my house while I was away busy for the past few weeks as my wife had approached her and asked if they would be willing to lend a hand with chores she could no longer do alone. Sometimes Sally went over and did small tasks or just hung out, sometimes both, sometimes just cocksucker. Wife told her I knew and was fine with it, and that's why she was confused when her husband told her his bullshit about me being mad. She showed me where she texted my wife (has her number, not mine) to clarify and ask if she was welcome over and my wife hasn't replied, and since I don't often see Sally or socialize with them she just assumed her husband was telling the truth. She also admitted that she noticed cocksucker and my wife becoming ""fast friends"" and figured it was due to the pregnancy, but thought it was his way of dealing with their own inability to have kids so she wrote it off. I told her what I walked in on. I told her about the tools, which ended up being bullshit too.

Came to the same conclusions. Both cried. Both hugged for the first time. Both took turns denying and accepting and talking each other down. Took a walk around the block together and conspired. She planned to call cocksucker at work and say that my wife messaged her confessing to the two of them having an affair, and seeing what happened. 

Went back to my friend's. Started having major panic attacks thinking I fucked up, I was about to ruin my marriage, worrying I might be wrong. Bit later and I get a call from my wife screaming at me to find a way to leave work and come home. So I go home. Cocksucker called her telling her what Sally told him. She told me I was crazy, I was a piece of shit, that she was considering leaving me, everything. Having a panic attack thinking I just ruined my entire life over nothing while also trying to calm her down for the baby's sake. Impulsively told her that if she was leaving, I'd still be requesting a DNA test.

And that's when it all came down. Entire tone changed. Pleading, begging, apologizing, hyperventilating, holding me. Asking me how I found out while denying anything happened. I told her it'd be ok and asked if she'd talk to me if we went for a drive. She agreed. Took us to a parking lot and we talked, told her if there was any chance of anything happening she needed to tell me what was happening because I already knew a lot. She'd fucked cocksucker a handful of times before she was pregnant. Our baby might not be ours. Cocksucker had been coming by and doing daddy duties once in a blue moon ""in case it's his"". They haven't slept together in months. She said we could move away, that it's ours no matter what, that he had manipulated her. Admitted she lied to Sally to justify cocksucker going over for daddy duties. I asked her if she'd stay with MIL for a few days while I calmed down. She agreed, took her home, packed up some stuff and dropped her off.

I've cleaned out my essentials and I'm in a friend's basement. Friend called her on my behalf and told her that if the baby is mine I'll be dealing with it, if it isn't it's on her, but either way I'll be filing for divorce. My friends took my phone from me and deleted my social media. She's been calling my friends, friends told her to fuck off. I spoke to my boss and he's been very understanding. Last I heard from Sally, cocksucker hadn't been home and stopped responding to her calls and texts. I have nothing left. In less than a week my life has fallen apart. The only thing keeping me here is the small chance that baby is mine. I have nothing else. I woke up today disappointed I woke up at all. I've never felt this alone, and I haven't accepted any of it yet. I'm praying for the first time in my life that I can stop feeling this way and find strength.

TL;DR There's your update. For those of you who took the time to reach out, I've been reading your messages even if I didn't respond and I'm incredibly grateful, they're much needed positivity. For those of you who took the time to mock me or accuse me of lying, ask yourselves just how much you think I give a fuck about your approval. Value those close to you and what you have before it's gone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c8cz7z/update_i_29m_caught_my_wife_27f_letting_our_male/,relationship_advice,27707,2362,0.0
crowtheory,2019-07-02 12:16:34+00:00,UPDATE: I [24F] am dating a [25M] almost unreasonably picky eater and I'm pretty much at the end of my rope,"[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c3ev1n/i_24f_am_dating_a_25m_an_almost_unreasonably/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

This happened last night.

&amp;#x200B;

This update is way more dramatic and unpleasant than I had hoped but it is what it is. I read what you all wrote and I appreciate all the comments left for me. Despite a few outlandish ones, they were all very helpful and reaffirming of my beliefs that I’m not being nit picky about this issue. 

I decided to give it one last shot at broaching this issue with him and letting him know how serious it was to me. He needed help and so long as I saw that he was trying that was all I asked for. We were out to dinner (I’m sure you can all guess what we had to eat) when he brought up his trip to Germany and how he would have to find a supermarket stat in order to stock up on frozen pizzas to keep his “streak going.” I was hoping to do it after the trip so as not to ruin his good time but I figured now was as good a time as any: 

Me: Maybe you don’t have to continue to the streak. Maybe you can just try new German cuisine without worrying about having to get pizza into your diet the entire time. Have you talked with your therapist about your avoidant eating?

J: No way. I have people depending on me to continue this streak. I don’t want to let them down.

Me: I don’t think anybody really cares about this streak as much as you do and frankly, I’m worried about you. This is really unhealthy and it’s consuming your life. You’re about to go on this incredible trip to Germany and the forefront of your mind is to get to a grocery store to pick up frozen pizzas. I think you really need to discuss this with your therapist again.

We had a back and forth the rest of our meal about his diet and how it was affecting our relationship. He doesn’t think it’s a problem because his health is fine (keep in mind he’s only 25) and how I was being a busy body and needed to mind my own business. I let him know how this IS my business because it affects me. We can only go out to eat one thing, we can never have a meal at home together, and if we did decide to move forth and have children the example he is setting is awful. 

We let the issue go for the rest of dinner not wanting to escalate it, and ate in silence. The plan after was to go back to his place where I would spend the night. The entire trip home he was silent but very obviously simmering while I wished I had just gone home. I should have gone home. I guess I didn’t expect the shitstorm that waited when I got to his place.

He flipped.

He began screaming how he was so sick of me bringing this up and how it was his life and how I couldn’t control what he did or ate. I told him I cared about him and his health and wanted him to recognize what he was doing was not healthy. I ultimately agreed that he was right, I couldn’t control what he did or what he ate, but he can’t expect that I stick around and watch and enable him like I had been doing in the past. 

It escalated from there how he had been there for me the entire time when I was an active alcoholic and through my relapses. I could not and still cannot dispute that. He was. I guess the only difference between him and I is that I wanted to change. I acknowledged the issue and knew I could not go on like this any longer. Obviously though, it is much quicker to see the downfall of someone suffering from alcoholism vs someone who is suffering from this kind of eating disorder. One spirals much faster than the other so I was able to recognize it much quicker. 

I told him I was going to leave because I couldn’t deal with this anymore. We kept fighting and fighting and he let me know he would “expose” me. He has a blog and he told me how he would write one about what it was to live with an alcoholic and use my name. He would be sharing it on facebook. I completely panicked. I cried and begged that he didn’t use my most vulnerable moments against me. He told me if I walked out he absolutely would. 

That was all I needed to hear. He was going to blackmail me. I think this snapped me awake to realize this isn’t love. If I leave he’s going to humiliate me on the internet to get back at me, that absolutely isn't love.

So I left. I don’t have many possessions there but he can keep them for all I care. He emailed me a draft of the post (blocked him on everything else) and the subject was “last chance.”

Let him post it. Fuck it. I can’t control other people I can only control myself and how I react. I deactivated all my social media and I’m ready to move on with my life. It hurts that somebody I trusted so much would explicitly broadcast my past, but it’s a learning lesson.

GuarenteedRed,2019-07-02 00:33:05+00:00,My boyfriend (21M) hates my (20F) vagina with a passion,"I recently became sexually active with my boyfriend and he told me that sex feels very pleasurable but he doesn’t like my vagina. He said it just looks unappealing and he doesn’t wanna touch it or put his mouth on it or anything. He gave me oral once but he seemed very disgusted so I didn’t push him to continue until I finished and I said he could stop. He doesn’t like fingering me either. He basically just said that he doesn’t like looking at it or anything. He said the folds are weird and it looks nasty. 

So I thought I had a vagina that looked similar like the ones in porn. My inner labia are not long or stick out and I’m an innie or whatever. I taste and smell fine. I think he just doesn’t like vaginas. But he has a very high sex drive and he wants to have sex like 24/7 but it’s just him fucking me and playing with my boobs. No attention down there. I do cum but I have to touch myself because he won’t do it. It’s just basically like he’s having sex with me and I’m masturbating like rubbing my own clit so I can get off too. I don’t wanna force him to do anything he doesn’t like but is he ever gonna get over this aversion to my vagina? He’s 100% straight and he likes boobs and he’s attracted to girls and he likes when I wear sexy underwear and he likes looking at me naked from the front and he likes having sex. He just thinks vaginas are ugly looking. His penis is not beautiful I still put it in my mouth and touch it and give him a lot of attention because he enjoys it. Idk it’s weird. 

My friends boyfriends are obsessed with their vaginas. My friend told me that her boyfriend always begs to let him eat her out and they’re always touching them and they worship them down there and sorry to sound gross but they always lick them out. Not only that, their boyfriends are not grossed out about anything. My friend told me her boyfriend is always asking to tongue her asshole and he fingers her there sometimes. My boyfriend doesn’t even like to ever look at my butthole. My boyfriend thinks it’s disgusting if I get too wet and he said it’s like a swamp down there and he wipes me off with a tissue and he always gets mad if I drip onto his sheets and dirty them. He will only touch me momentarily for 2 seconds to find where to put his dick and that’s it. I get jealous sometimes. I wish he would be more accepting or loving or something. It sounds so stupid but writing this out is making me wanna cry. It’s like he hates me for having a vagina or something. He’s never even looked at it properly since the first time we had sex and he was very visibly disgusted.

Capable_Bird,2019-07-01 23:09:41+00:00,Me (15F) My mom (30sF) cares more about drinking and fucking guys than being a parent.,"Yo I'm 15 and utterly clueless how to deal with my ""mother""

That's in quotes because she doesn't act like one. Never has. I don't know who my dad was. Neither does she. Yep she's that kind of person.

None of my siblings dads are around. They're either locked up or didn't care or she refuses to talk to them for who knows why. She stopped persuing child support from the one she had contact with bc it was ""too much work"" but when she used to get the child support, she just spent it all on shit for herself. Like tattoos, alcohol, clothes.

She's addicted to online shopping, the apartment is stuffed with her shit and she doesn't even use most of it. Also she doesn't clean. I have to clean (I'm the oldest) or it doesn't happen. Before I learned to clean, we got tons of ants and flies, we had roaches for months before she finally was willing to pay for getting rid of them. Said she ""didn't want to waste money"", but she wastes money all the time on whatever she wants. Food and bills are an after thought. She has WIC but literally can't be bothered to get us food unless I nag her when we're flat out. Then she just loads up with garbage from the dollar store, so I'm really worried about my siblings, bc some of them are getting really overweight and she doesn't ever take us to the doctor and I don't even know if we've got health insurance.

She bounces around between temp jobs, nothing permanant, bc if she worked fulltime she couldn't party. She's almost always out at night sometimes during the day. Or she's passed out drunk. I've dragged her to her bed bc she blacked out in the bathroom or on the floor. Or, some random dude shows up after midnight hauling her in the door as she's unable to walk. How do these men have keys??? She just copies the key and gives it to literally ANYONE she trusts. Which is practically everyone, she has no idea who's a good person or bad person. As a result there are men who have touched me when I was younger. Now I can fight them and protetc myself and my siblings. She never protects us. She doesn't care. She called me a liar bc that's her boyfriend so he wouldn't do that blah blah blah. 

There is a revolving door of these boyfriends. They don't last longer than a year and even when she's with a guy guaranteed she's fucking at least one other behind his back. Me and my siblings can clearly hear the telltale slapping sounds and disgusting groaning and fakeass porno screeches coming from her room. It's happened at all hours of the night waking us up. We've even found nasty sex toys and fetish outfits in places outside of her bedroom.

She's pregnant right now (kid number 8) and STILL doing this. Still drinking too. I mean what the fuck, I started suspecting she's doing this for money and asked if she was a prostitute, she slapped me across the face. Well that's my answer I guess. She's been a stripper so it's more than likely. Anyway I still said why is she okay poisoning a baby and risking one of these abusive guys injuring it, she said I can't judge her until I'm a mother. So whatever. I'm never gonna be one looooool

Then, despite constantly being broke and relying on the minor government aid + whatever these fuckboys give her (she begs online for donations all over social media), she went and got a huge fucking boobjob a couple years ago. I was only 13 but I've been constantly aware of our poverty. I've been bullied for it, even my 5 year old brother got teased about his clothes. It's impossible to NOT be aware. I started learning when rent and bills are due to try to get my mom to keep on top of it so our electricity and heat stops getting shut off. Then she goes and buys fake tits. It's like, what is even the point. She's gonna blow her money every time no matter what I do.

I'm so scared and sick of always worrying about money. We've been evicted 5 times that I can remember. Utilities shut off countless times. Half the time I have to make my younger siblings ramen for dinner because it's all I can afford from the change she leaves us.

I'm so sick of the grossness of the apartment, the grossness of the men always coming and going, her dressing like a hooker, using her tits to get men now that she looks twice her age thanks to alcohol addiction, the trashiness of everything in my life. The apartment is 3 bedrooms with half the living room hosting me and my next oldest sister's bunk beds and the other half hosting my mom's piles of junk. The rest of my siblings are split between the other two bedrooms and then my mom has the third. Everyone's room is covered in clothes toys books and random junk on the floor, bc there's simply no space for anything that could store it. Garbage and masses of toiletries/cosmetics in the bathroom and mold in the shower. Garbage always overflowing in the kitchen. Dirty stove fridge and oven I can never stay on top of. Everything's old and falling apart. It's just shit. She couldn't care less she's hardly ever here so sees no reason to care.

I hate that I can't give my siblings a better childhood. I hate that she won't make a single effort to do that when it's her responsibility, SHE'S THE PARENT NOT ME, but I cannot stand to see them neglected. They all see me and my next oldest sister as parents more than her. We are ""their moms"" they say. We bathe them and dress them, do laundry when we can. We take care of each other when we're sick.

Please get one thing clear from my post besides that I hate my mom, it's that I love my brothers and sisters. I would do anything to make their lives just a little better. But I don't know how when we're stuck living in this place with this person. I realized we'll have to get out on our own for things to get better but even once I'm old enough, they won't be. I could adopt them but I doubt I could get custody of all 6 + the baby that's coming + however many fucking more kids she decides to pop out over the next 3 years.

Plus even though they listen to me about hygiene and chores they don't listen about school. No matter what I try, short of bribing with junk food I can't get them to do their homework. But I'm a hypocrit bc I don't always do mine either, I don't have time sometimes or I'm so tired I just can't.

Is there any way to make my mom be an actual mom? How do I at least get her to stop drinking while pregnant and stop hooking up with randoms. Like the older I get the more fucked up I see it is, and the angrier I am. I don't wanna hate everything but so many days I do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c81khb/me_15f_my_mom_30sf_cares_more_about_drinking_and/,relationship_advice,3761,505,0.0

around 2 years ago my at the time boyfriend got me drunk and forced me to have sex with him, I've still got trauma from it and have been seeing a counselor. 

my sister kept on telling me she had a new man but wanted to keep it secret as it's still relatively new, I accepted that and never cared that much. 

turns out that the guy she is dating is my ex boyfriend. I'm pissed and have not spoken to her, the only thing I've gotten from here is a Facebook messenge from her telling me how I can't controll her boyfriends. 

I feel that he might be using her to get to me or using her as she looks like me. 

mum and dad are on my side but still want to be there for my twin.

User02023,2019-07-01 08:09:52+00:00,I (24M) slept with my boss (44F) of 5 years.,"Looking for advice in general, or some personal experiences to help me move forward. Also using a throwaway because I don’t want any of this on my main.

Background:

I met this woman when I was 19. I landed a solid warehouse gig where she introduced herself as my area manager. I am a fairly quick learner and hard worker, which made me effective for the job. I worked under her for 2 years, and I was one of the more reliable people in the department. Another guy (doesn’t work there anymore) and I were commonly her go to’es. She ended up transferring to another department and we hadn’t talked to each other in about 6 months. The team lead that worked with her made a couple huge mistakes and was let go, that’s when she informed me she was looking for a right hand man and thought I’d be a good fit. I was interested in climbing the ladder so I put in an internal application. I went through two interviews and an exam, and was offered the job. We were in the same department again, and worked closely together (strictly professional at this point). Any time she is in the building, I am to be there to assist and help direct work flow. Sometimes I get out on the floor and work myself. We were a great team. Shortly after I became a lead, she found out her husband was having an affair. They decided they were going to work on things and ultimately he cheated again. He told her that he didn’t love her anymore after 19 years of marriage. I saw her go through this. She was very torn apart and confided in me sometimes. There would be weeks where we would spend 80+ hours in the warehouse and she felt like there wasn’t anyone else to talk to. They had two kids together (17M) (20M). The 17 year old still lives with her. I don’t think my boss and her ex-husband communicate with each other outside of interests of the kids (college stuff, birthdays). They seem genuinely disinterested in each other.

The nasty:

I was in a couple of relationships throughout, but the one prior to us hooking up bothered her a little bit IMO. I dated this girl for a few months, and we were nothing special. She began saying things like “I hope she is treating you right” and “You can do better than that”. I thought it was a little odd but we had grown close together as colleagues and as a team so I thought nothing of it. She asked if I wanted to grab a bite to eat after work, and I agreed (relationship with girl stated above ended a couple weeks prior). She confessed that she had been feeling a certain way about me for awhile, and she thought I was a really great guy. We entertained the idea of “us” during dinner and it was funny. Mostly poking fun at the age gap. We ended up going back to her place since her son was out with some friends and wouldn’t be back until the next day. We watched a movie and one thing led to another. We started making out, wound up in the bedroom. The sex was phenomenal. We both finished and cuddled under the covers. It was early in the morning at this point and she starts breaking down in the bed. Crying but also trying to hide it and of course I ask what’s wrong. She started saying things like “I don’t know what I’m doing” and “I am old enough to be your mom”. I was pretty taken back by the emotional breakdown. I had seen her upset before but not like this. She didn’t say much more after that, she just cried for a little bit and then asked me if I was going to leave after she fell asleep. I told her no, and we cuddled until we both fell asleep. I didn’t have much to say, I was just trying to be comforting. I woke up the next morning and she made us breakfast, and we parted ways for our day off. We didn’t speak to each other until we were back at work the following day. Things were a little off but we had work to do. After our shift ends she asked to come over, I agreed. And I asked if we were gonna talk about the other night. She said we would talk about it later. Fast forward to that evening, she brought a bag with clothes/soap. I made dinner. We watched another movie, and went to bed because we had to be up early for work. After we laid down she started kissing me and we hooked up again. With the same aftermath minus the talking. I just tried to be there for her. I spooned her until she fell asleep. This doesn’t seem to bother me like it does her. I’ve wondered if it’s just aftermath of the divorce or the fact that she hasn’t been with anyone since her ex husband. We got ready for work the next morning and still haven’t talked about it.

Current:

The past two nights have been back to normal as far as both of us staying at our own places. She is wanting me to come over tomorrow night. We’ve been texting nonstop. She has been really flirty at work, and I enjoy it. I am getting ready to head into work within the hour.

 She is such a sweet person, and I admire her strength. I really care about her, but I feel wildly out of place. Almost like I have no business being in this situation. Also, little weird her kids are in the same age group as me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c7pwnr/i_24m_slept_with_my_boss_44f_of_5_years/,relationship_advice,1322,364,0.0
tellyoumysecrets,2019-06-30 00:02:28+00:00,my friend admitted to letting me be molested bc he was jealous,"the backstory is that last weekend a few of us friends were together drinking and having a good time.  when it was getting late i asked friend A if he would drive me to my car since i rode with him to friend B's hotel room.  he agrees, but then leaves the room after having a quiet convo with B and in my mind at the time i didn't think he had left completely.

well you can guess that B took advantage of the fact that i was drunk and copped himself a nice feel here and there before i was finally able to get him to let me leave.  went to the parking lot, A's car is gone.  great.  i start walking to where my car is bc i'm sure as hell not gonna go back up B's room.

i guess B called A about me storming out bc A found me and told me to get in, a while after walking.  at that point i was too embarrassed to talk about it, so i didn't even ask where he went/why he left; i just let him drive me to my car then went home.

fast forward to yesterday, friends are wanting to get together again and i'm still feeling some type of way about the situation with B so i declined to stay in and drink by myself where i won't come to with some guy's hand down my pants.  after i say no in group chat, A calls me to ask if i have other plans--basically trying to figure out if i'm declining bc i'm doing something else.  i tell him no and he asks if he can hang out with me, which i say yes to bc i'm close with A and can actually trust him.  or so i thought.

we get to drinking and i tell him about last weekend and why i was walking when he found me and why i'd been acting weird and ghosting everyone all week and told him how bad i was feeling from it.  then.  then he tells me that he'd noticed B and me ""flirting"" and was getting annoyed by it.  (he never said anything about any perceived flirting at the time, nor do i feel like i was flirting with anyone. i just wanted to have fun with friends playing video games and stupid card games while drinking problems away.)  and then he told me bout B asking him if he could dip out bc he wanted to try and ""see what he could get"" out of me.  and A actually agreed by leaving bc he was ""so mad"" and ""so jealous"" that he was never ""brave enough"" to make moves on me first...

i am still so livid.  i threw him out of my place as soon as he told me that and haven't spoken to either of them since last night.

A's been blowing up my phone and sending long messages apologizing and saying that he knows he screwed up and wants me to forgive him for making a drunk mistake--the mistake being that he left knowing B's intentions.

&amp;#x200B;

i'm not wrong, am i? for wanting to just cut them both off immediately?  i don't want to hear anyone's sob stories on why they acted the way they did, i just feel disgusted and want to move on to find better friends.

My boyfriend of almost 2 years has essentially been living a double life. I’m baffled as to how he pulled this off. When we met, he told me he was on the tail end of a nasty lengthy divorce, but that he had moved on and it would never pose an issue, and until now he was right, it never has. Last week I took a pregnancy test that came back positive, and yesterday morning I had a OBGYN visit to confirm. I was honestly ecstatic, I’ve always wanted to be a mom and my boyfriend felt the same, we talked about our future children many times even though we haven’t been together for the longest time. I was really excited to tell him that night when he came over for dinner, but his reaction was... weird. His face went pale and he looked confused, not what I expected at all, and he got up to go to the bathroom. When he came back he was really calm and really serious, and he told me that he was really afraid and didn’t know how me and our baby would factor into his life, and he made the decision to come clean. Not only is he nowhere near being divorced from his wife, who he’s been with for close to a decade, but they have 2 kids together, 4 and 6. I have no idea how I never had even a clue, he works a lot and really early, which is the reason he would rarely spend nights over. That being said, it’s not like he hardly spent any time with me. I’m heartbroken and confused and his confession left me with absolutely no idea what to do. I’m still pregnant, with his third child, and he’s still very much married. He left right after that conversation, and I’ve called and texted but the only response I’ve gotten is that he’ll speak to me tomorrow night after work. His demeanor is so cold and unfamiliar that I’m terrified he’s going to leave me to figure out this pregnancy on my own. Another part of me doesn’t want him anymore. If he’s this good of a liar, what else has he lied about? What else COULD he lie about? I also would hate to break up a family like this.

poughtydoughty,2019-06-29 18:33:06+00:00,My dad destroyed my girlfriend's camera and now I'm worried about our relationship.,"My girlfriend is a YouTube vlogger and it has undeniably been the source of some tension in our relationship, but we've been able to talk things out and make things work. My dad has especially been uptight about her being around with her camera and things really boiled over this past week when me, my girlfriend, and my family went on vacation to our Summer beach house in Lake Tahoe.

The first couple of days were fine. My girlfriend didn't vlog when my dad was around and she was being considerate of how he feels about the camera being on, but she still vlogged an awful lot when it was just me and her and sometimes my mom. But one day while we were all getting ready to go out to eat, I was in the bathroom. I won't go into too much detail, but let's just say that I wasn't having the most smooth bowel movement at the time. I was on the toilet for a while and my girlfriend was urging me to hurry up. It then reached a point where she was silent, save for some stifled giggling. I figured that she was most likely filming and trying to get some audio of me taking a dump, so I started yelling at her to turn the camera off. She claimed that she wasn't filming, but she was laughing while saying it and that confirmed to me that she was filming.

I was honestly really annoyed and disgusted that she wanted to film me taking a shit, so I finished my business, burst out the door, and started yelling at her to give me the camera. She ran away and she must've thought that I was joking because she was laughing the whole time, but I was really pissed off and I wanted to take her camera. I was chasing her around the house and things went really bad when she sharply turned a corner and ran into my dad, spilling his soda all over him in the process. He got pissed off, yelled about the vlogging, and then snatches the camera out of my girlfriend's hands. And what does he do? He goes outside with it and chucks it into the lake. My girlfriend was screaming and digging around in the water to find her camera and then my dad starts yelling about cutting the trip short and going home the next day.

We did end up cutting the trip short and my girlfriend refused to talk to anyone. She did end up finding her camera, but it was obviously destroyed and she's pissed off at me and my dad. I've tried contacting her, but she won't answer at all. I admit to being annoyed by her vlogging every now and then, but I still really like her and I care about our relationship. But I'm really worried about her breaking up with me over this. What should I do to fix this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c72uac/my_dad_destroyed_my_girlfriends_camera_and_now_im/,relationship_advice,1380,320,0.0
neilcrew1,2019-06-29 11:25:39+00:00,Caught gf sending lewd photos - BUT how do I go about acting on this...,"Quick back story, I was told by her in Feb that a guy at her work fancied her, she said she wasn't interested. Turns out she met him out of work once (as 'friends'), I hit the roof, she said sorry, blah blah, the usual. He left her work and got another job a few weeks later (unrelated). A few months later she asked how i felt if she met him to 'catch up' as he had left her work, i was not happy at all and made it known, she said she told me about it to be clear and honest, no funny business, etc. I said again, I'm not happy but do whatever because otherwise I'm 'controlling' but I trust her to make the right decision. She still met him. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point i'm ready to call time on this shit BUT - We have a mortgage. I need to get financial advice regarding this. We're not married.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward last night.

&amp;#x200B;

I caught her sitting on our sofa sending lewd selfies (lifting her top etc), however there's a twist. So obviously I've suspected this shit for months, I popped upstairs and left my phone upright on a desk near the sofa recording... And boom, played back the video a little later and saw it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So where do I stand in this. It feels awkward because I secretly filmed this (which I know is fucking weird but i suspected something, needed to know, and well.. It turns out I was correct). 

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? I can bet without doubt it will be turned on me 'having trust issues' or something and what I did will make me the fucking bad party in this. Make no mistake, I'm fuming, I blame her in this, not the guy.

jeckheck,2019-06-28 15:04:19+00:00,Update 2: My (28M) wife (25F) never calls our son by his name. Should I be worried?,"[Last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bzh814/update_my_28m_wife_25f_never_calls_our_son_by_his/) for context.

I just wanted to post an update/ just vent.

I ended up taking her to the OB/GYN who referred her immediately to a psychiatrist. We went together and we had to wait in the waiting room for quite a while. As we wait she gets increasingly restless and starts telling me that we have to leave before ""it"" happens. I asked her before what happens? And she just kept insisting that we had to leave. I thought she just didn't want to see the doctor and wanted to leave so I insist that she stay. Eventually she gets really angry cause I refuse to let her leave and asks me why I want to let him know that she's a bad mother and make ""it"" happen. I ask her who he was (psychiatrist was a woman) and what was going to happen. Instead of telling me she whispers in my ear that baby ""knows everything"" and that  baby is watching her to see whether she's good mother before deciding whether to ""transfer himself"" somewhere else. She tells me she had to be there to feed him otherwise baby will know and insisted that I take her back.  I didn't even know how to react. I could tell she was not joking. It was unnerving for me. I told her that we could see the doctor and still make it home to feed him. 

&amp;#x200B;

So when we actually see the psychiatrist, she just seems extremely normal. She lies to the psychiatrist and tell her everything is fine and that she was only there to appease me. So I recount to the the psychiatrist all the things she told me. She kept telling me to shut up through out even tried to put her hand on my mouth and then started yelling that I was ""ruining everything"".

&amp;#x200B;

She had to be admitted as an inpatient (luckily the psychiatrist and I managed to convince her to do this voluntarily) and was transferred to a mother and baby unit last week. She's still under observation.

It's been a very hard the past several weeks. I feel so drained. I go to see her every day. She is very suspicious of everyone (even her own family) and will only see me and her mother. I took the baby to see her for the first time last week  and she kept touching him and asking me whether he was ""the real baby"" and whether I was sure he hadn't transferred.  It's tough to see her like this.  But the doctor says that she's (slowly) making progress and that it's something that takes time. I feel incredibly guilty for not picking up of this earlier. I don't know how long she's been living in her little bubble. I feel pretty useless atm.

krooksandkush,2019-06-28 10:00:19+00:00,My (24F) coworker (29M) is ignoring and acting as if I don’t exist because I went on a date.,"I’ll call this coworker “W”. 

I’ve been working at this job for about 3 months now. Coming into this industry I knew that it is predominantly a male dominated industry, which is fine. 
 
About a month into working there a few coworkers invited me to happy hour, W being one of them. During, W decides to tell me he has a crush on me. I’m flattered but I turn him down because I’m not interested in him in that way and I also don’t date coworkers. He understood and we remained friends. 

Now, W is the “team leader” in the group I work with. However, the group now only consists of W and I. 

W and I became close, we would take our lunch breaks together and sometimes hangout outside of work with other coworkers. 

Last week, I had mentioned to another coworker that I was going on a date the following weekend and I was feeling a bit nervous. 

Fast forward to this week. W has been acting as if I don’t exist. He intentionally ignores me and the only things he says to me are rude. 

I brought this up to another coworker and she mentioned that he’s upset I went on a date. 

Now, this rises some issues for me since 1. W and I had a mutual understanding regarding our “relationship”. 2. W and I work so close together that now it’s just very awkward. 3. I find it highly inappropriate that he is treating me different because I went on a date, especially since we work together. 

I’m not sure where to go from here. All of my superiors are very close with him and I don’t want to step on any toes.

jovialjasmine,2019-06-27 19:39:58+00:00,[Update]- My mother’s posted a photo of another girl in her Facebook post when she was wishing me happy birthday.,"First and foremost I want to thank everyone for their kind words and advice. I was kinda torn between being angry at her and worried for her mental health and I think this should be a satisfying update.

So I flew home today and my mom picked me up from the airport. We had a good talk in the car(I drove) and it began with her telling me that she has to wear a fanny pack because she has started to forget where she puts things and keeps losing things and she can’t remember some things sometimes. So I decided to bring up the incident. She says her eyes aren’t doing so well that’s why she asked me to drive. She said she was sorry to have hurt me and she was just ashamed and embarrassed that she hadn’t recognized that the girl was not me. That’s why she got so upset when I called her out on it in public, I apologized for doing that publicly when I should have done that in private.

So I talked to her about the possibility that she might be developing dementia/ Alzheimer’s. She said she means to talk to her doctor about it but she keeps forgetting even though she has a note in her phone. I told her while I’m here I would be happy to go with her to an appointment so we can look into it. She said she’s not as concerned about losing her memory/ sight because she is getting older and she knows that it’s okay and natural part of aging. She just wants everyone to be more kind to her when she does forget things and makes mistakes. She still hasn’t confirmed whether or not she’d like me to attend her next medical appointment but I will ask my sisters about this and so they can keep an eye on it once I leave since they live near her and interact with her daily.

I still love my mom and although my mind jumped to my mom being a narcissist, that really wasn’t the case. She has done some questionable things in the past but this wasn’t her intent for this particular incident and I’m going to give her some grace and not be upset about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c69zfh/update_my_mothers_posted_a_photo_of_another_girl/,relationship_advice,1016,56,0.0

Our relationship is not sustainable and I need help.,"Its been awhile since my original post, but I didnt want to post until there was substantial progress.

Since then, not much has improved. I decided to convince her to attend out patient behavioral therapy. To my surprise, she agreed and I was so happy.

Unfortunately, she refused to attend the session last night and became violent and suicidal.  I had no choice but to get the police involved and have her committed to in patient therapy.

This was the hardest thing I have ever had to do.  I feel so broken right now.  I'm going to see a counselor in hopes that I can figure out what to do.  

I dont know how long they are going to keep her in patient yet but I pray that she takes advantage of it because I still love her and I did this because I still do.

I told myself I would stop enabling her, mainly because I just cannot sustain this life. I am physically and mentally exhausted.  My kids are my top priority but I cant take care of them if I dont first take care of myself.

I thank all of you who reached out to me on the original post and and recommended things to try. She was set to attend group cognitive behavioral therapy today and I hope that it will help her.

I want a relationship where the man is the man of the house. yes, i believe that we’re equal, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t still be a man and treat me like the queen that i am. no i don’t want new car every two years, but i don’t want you to suggest that i pitch in to help get myself a nicer engagement ring than what you’d be willing to work for. that alone tells me you don’t care enough to work hard yourself or save enough money for something that you think i would like. and it’s not about the money, it’s the thought behind it. it’s about the details of things and the care that you put into it. you told me i was entitled. you’re right, i am. i’m entitled to these things because i deserve them. i deserve to be treated like the greatest thing that has ever walked this earth because that’s how a queen is supposed to be treated. yes i want nice things, that’s because i deserve them and you either just don’t see it that way or just don’t care and i just want! more!

FuzzyTart,2019-06-27 05:43:57+00:00,I [29M] Caught My Wife [27F] Letting Our Male Neighbor Rub Lotion On Her Pregnant Stomach,"This literally happened this morning. I'm posting it here and hoping to vent and maybe get some perspective because I've been extremely upset all day and can't process this productively. My wife is 8 months pregnant with our child. We live next to another married couple who're in their late 30's. I don't like the guy. I've found him to be invasive and the weird type of friendly that almost seems to be prying and clingy. I'm not sure if that's clouding my judgement here or if this validated my beliefs about him.

I left for work, decided on the way there I just wasn't feeling it and called off. I stopped for breakfast before heading home to surprise my wife. 40 mins tops. I get home, enter from the back door and here's my wife and my neighbor sitting in our living room on the couch. She's turned toward him, fully clothed but with her shirt pulled up over her very pregnant stomach while he, facing her, is rubbing lotion on her stomach with both hands.

They both froze, before my wife asked how come I was back and then said ""(his name) stopped by to borrow the toolbox while I was moisturizing, and wanted to know if he could feel the baby so I said ok."" I told him to get out before I put him out, and he left immediately. 

I tried to stay calm and talk to her and get the whole story. Neighbor's wife is apparently infertile (first I heard of it which is amazing considering the guy never shuts up about his personal woes) and he wanted to feel the baby. That's her story and she's sticking to it. That's not good enough for me. My thought process is there's a big fucking difference between feeling a baby for 10 seconds and coming into our home and rubbing lotion on my wife's stomach. If it was some close friend of ours I might understand, but I dislike the guy and my wife has never expressed any sort of closeness to him aside from passing pleasantries, and she's not the type to let anyone she isn't close to put their hands on her. So in the span on a day the guy goes from being a distant acquaintance of hers at best to her deciding to invite him in and let him rub her? I also find it convenient that he showed up that early, right after I went to work, very shortly after his own wife also left for work. And he's never came over asking to borrow anything of mine before, yet 9:30ish in the morning and he urgently needs a toolbox?

I don't believe my wife. This is the first time my trust in her hasn't been strong enough. I don't believe her story because it makes no sense. When I told her I'd be mentioning this to his wife, she was adamant I don't, as not to ""make more of it than it is"". If it was innocent, what more is there to make? And even if nothing more is going on, I'm not ok with what I seen. I'm not ok with him rubbing my unborn child in my home without me there. I know it's her body and her choice, but I'm not ok with this. It'd be one thing to feel the baby kick, but he was sitting reclined, comfortably on our sofa, rubbing lotion on her with both leaned in to their private conversation.

I'm trying really hard to figure out how to express the fact I don't believe her story without causing stress that'd be dangerous for her or our baby. I don't want to pick a fight with her at this stage of her pregnancy, but at the same time my mind is spinning and I'm not cool with what happened. Any advice would be appreciated.

weddingdrama1205,2019-06-26 16:05:20+00:00,I am 25 and getting married. Dealing with issue around picking my “Maid of Honor” for my wedding. Friends [women in their 20s] think my brother [35/M] is a bad choice.,"  

I am planning my wedding to my awesome fiancé and am so excited. We’ve been planning the event and will be married later in the year. He has his Best Man (his brother) and groomsmen mostly picked out. I thought I did, too. We each have 6 people and I have 5 female bridesmaids and a “man of honor” which I want to be my brother. My bridesmaids think this isn’t a great idea and a few are hurt I’m not choosing them instead. Here’s why I want to choose my brother. 

My biological mother lost custody of me when I was 4 and I was put in an emergency foster situation with a family. I lived with them for 6 months but was then put back into my mother’s case. From 4 1/2ish to 6 I lived with my mother and it was bad. She was too sick, too addicted and too weak to handle a child and by 6 I was being adopted out. By some miracle, the family who took me in at 4 got ahold in the system and I went to live with them and was later adopted. The family had boys – the youngest was 16 when I got there. I was terrified of him when I got there, which they told me about recently (I have no recollection of that). I do remember him spending the summer with me, teaching me to swim, teaching me how to play games, teaching me how different appliances worked. He skipped a summer job to help our mom with my adjustment. I had eating problems, I had dental problems, I had a snoot full of health problems – including parasites. He came to doctor appointments, he also helped get me ready for school (I hadn’t started kindergarten yet and would actually never go). He and my mom would do learning activities with me and by September I was okay to enter first grade. I used to lay on my stomach and play geography games with him and he’d reward me with Riesens. We were very close, he didn’t go away to college as is tradition and instead stayed home to go to a good university locally. He’d pick me up from schools some days and from 6 to 12 I had an older brother to rely on. He eventually moved out and went to medical school (he’s such a great person for that field). 

Very literally my brother helped save my life. I was suicidal as a young kid, and through a lot of changes and help, was able to climb out. He was a calm stable influence in my life. I credit him, my mother and father with saving my life – I would never have gone to college, I probably wouldn’t have graduated high school or even lived as I was so sick. I had 4 endoscopies, 4 colonoscopies and 3 surgeries before I was 8. My family doesn’t look like me (I’m most likely Mexican and something else, most probably African-American) and doesn’t come from where I do, but they never treated me any differently than their other kids. Since the others were older and out of the home I was never as close to them as I was my parents and brother. 

My thinking is, a Maid of Honor is someone really important and I cannot think of anyone else who comes close. I haven’t even asked him yet but I think he’d do it. I told my parents and they said they wouldn’t say anything to him but thought it was a great idea. My husband is also good with it and think it’s a sweet thing to do, but my female friends were horrified I suggested it and think it’s “creepy”. If I look back on that time, it’s the happiest a person could be. Is it weird and creepy? Does it contravene some weird relationship boundary between brothers and sisters? Is it highly inappropriate?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c5rn6a/i_am_25_and_getting_married_dealing_with_issue/,relationship_advice,11177,1797,0.0

TL;DR at the bottom


Alright so a lot has happened since I put up my post and I really did try to keep this short but failed. 


Per a lot of people's comments, I checked the bottles to see if any where unsealed. I found one bottle a few rows back with a broken seal. In a panic, I took it with me to a friends and hadn't come back home until today. My friend and I bought a urinalysis drug test at Walmart which came up clear. Yesterday, I was able to go into an appointment with my PCP to discuss the symptoms. While she reiterated what you all had said that leukorrhea is a side effect along with the paranoia and fatigue, she believes that, if what I'm telling her is accurate, it is improbable that I would only be experiencing these side effects so sporadically. She recommended that I see my OB about the ""leukorrhea."" I have not been to see the OB yet.


Today I came home to retrieve the test strips I ordered. I ordered two different brands to cover all bases. These would test for drugs such as xanax, valium, rohypnal, and GHB. I also snooped around for any hidden medications per one commenters recommendation but didn't find any. 


Took the strips back to my friends house and tried several times. All came up negative. At this point, I was starting to get so aggravated with myself, feeling like it's just paranoia all along. So I decided that I should sit down and talk with my boyfriend about everything. When he got home, I sat him down and explained everything that was going on, from feeling like he's angry about the decrease in sex to the symptoms I was having to the one opened gatorade in the refrigerator. He immediately got very angry and defensive which I thought was weird because I in no way brought this up accusatorily. I was as calm as I could be but he continued to get angry and finally began blaming all of this on my lack of sex drive. He said he's been getting more and more angry. At this point, I was so frustrated that I told him exactly what I thought he was doing. I asked him if he could give me a logical explanation as to why one gatorade would be unsealed. He got angry and left without a word so I took the time to gather my own thoughts. When he came back, he sat me down and confessed to me what was going on. Apparently he had found out through a friend about a ""pink pill"" which I guess is the female equivalent to Viagara. He refused to tell me how he obtained these pills which makes me very uneasy. He said that he had been giving me these pills every so often so that I would be interested in having sex. I was rightfully livid but he kept referencing some movie where the girl was slipping Viagara into her boyfriends drink and that's why it was okay for him to do it to me in his mind. He swears up and down that the nights that he gave it to me, even though I was clearly asleep, I was still ""giving indications"" that I wanted to have sex with him. However he's giving me no explanation of what that means or how I was giving such indications.


So I sat down to do some of my own research on it. This ""pink pill"" is called ""flibanserin"". There's really not a whole lot of information on it causing sedation. So I hopped over to a medication interaction website. Like I had said, I'm taking the prozac. But I also take 10mg of melatonin and since spring had started, I've been taking my allergy medication, Sudafed Allergy. Under interations, the ingredients in Sudafed Allergy (Pseudoephedrine &amp; chlorpheneramine) mixed with this ""flibanserin"" shit causes increased sedation. Not to mention the melatonin on top of this. So, unbeknownst to him, slipping me this pill (at who knows what dose) was causing me to feel heavily sedated. He's continued to try and argue that he really has done nothing wrong, and that it was equivalent to him trying to turn me on by going down on me. But I've already told him that he needs to leave. I'm staying at my friends house in the meantime because I have no interest in sticking around someone that thinks it's okay to slip medication to people. 


TL;DR: Boyfriend was not drugging me with date rape drugs. He was slipping me something called ""flibanserin"" (female equivalent to Viagara) in order for me to get in the mood. My medication interactions with this pill caused heavy sedation. He swears that I was still consenting in my sleep but I've kicked him out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c5k3xl/update_i_22f_think_that_my_27m_boyfriend_is/,relationship_advice,16933,1474,0.0

No big deal, everybody shits after a heavy meal right. So we get home, he shits, we lie down and put on netflix and watched speed (it mustve been all the clenching bec of the goddamn movie) eventually we ended up making out and since i was on my period, I begged him for anal sex instead. He was more than happy to oblige. That was our 3rd experience with anal so it wasnt painful or anything, infact it was bomb af. So there I was feeling all sexy and shit, pun intended, and he cums in me and its all good you know, as I said, we werent new to anal sex. We go to the bathroom and clean up and when we got back to fix the bed, we turned on the lights and there my shit was, solid as gold. Just laying there. 

We are each others first experience with not only anal sex but sex altogether, and tho shitting is normal after meals, i didnt expect it to be normal during sex too. We stared at it for a while before we even addressed it. He awkwardly laughed about it and asked me to clean it up. So I take the sheets, only to find out I havent picked up new sheets from the dry cleaners yet. So we spend another minute just staring at the bare mattress not knowing what to do.

thrwayAmIReally,2019-06-25 16:08:55+00:00,My step daughter (16) is pregnant. I (31F) am the one who pays for most of her education and I want to cease. Her dad (33M) is disappointed in me. How do I proceed to make my point clear to my husband and step daughter?,"I posted in AITA, throwaway because husband uses reddit. English is not my first language. There is really no good TL;DR other than the title, but that leaves a lot of important info out, still TL;DR at the end. My questions are bolded.

**The reason behind why I pay for the education.**

My husband was a teen dad, we will refer to his daughter as An. An's mom, grandma and ggrandma were all teen moms. An is now 16 years old, and pregnant. An stays mostly with us because I am the one who pays (most of– 75%) her private high school tuition, I do so as a payback from when my husband helped me out of a massive debt during our dating years when he made 5 times what I did during that time. He proceeded to gain the international/regional direction of a big company in our country and worked there for some years before he decided to start his own company. Now I make three tomes more than what he is making, but I'm sure he'll double what I'm making within the next 5 years. It had always been my husband who paid for all of An's expenses, her mother took care of her from ages 0-13 while husband provided with money for everything and visited every weekend. We divide all of the other household expenses equally. An's mom has NOT given anything towards child support on the last two years because she insists she has no money.

When An turned 14 she wanted to move in with us to start her high school(HS) in the big city we live in. We checked on HS and since public school is terrible here, we decided to enroll her in a fancy private HS. She has always been set that she wanted to be an economist, and that she wanted to move to another country to pursue her dream and even study in the London School of Economics (just like her dad with his masters). I have been separating some money for this purpose, too. My husband and I came to an agreement that I would also help her dream to come true, but I would cease any economic help towards her tuition if she became a teen mom (An did NOT know this) and he agreed. An was not involved in this conversation because husband feared she would tell her mom and mom would take it as an offense and me saying teen moms are sluts or things I never even implied (she's that kind of person). This conversation took place two years ago... And now, An is pregnant as soon as she finished her first HS year.

**Why is An pregnant and what about the future teen dad?**

I cannot be nice about it. An is pregnant because her mother has a turd instead of a brain. My husband and I started talking to her about sexuality, contraception (I even taught her to put on a condom in a cucumber, it was awkward but oh well), orientations, etc... and actually took her to the gyn and he recommended her the pill. She stopped taking it because her mom told her she would get fat (An was a chubby child and suffered bullying because of her mom), and started using the ""cycle method"" in which she had sex some days before, during, and some days after her period. 

An met a boy her same age in some of her extra-curricular classes. He is not from a well of family, and not a bad guy. I've already talked to the boy's parents and they've agreed to pay something like $300 a month if An decides to keep the baby. That covers two thirds of a reputable daycare for 7 hours a day. We've all agreed that it's next level idiotic to have them marry each other (that seems to be the *way to go* in my country whenever someone impregnates another someone).

**What I'm planning to do**

I plan on taking the money being used towards her education and use part of it towards child support. Per month, I pay the equivalent of 1100 towards her HS (the best one in the country). Her dad has the means to either pay a not so high-end private HS, but definitely a decent one. I also plan on use the money I've been saving for her university in things like my retirement. I have not made an ultimatum towards her. My plan is to tell her that due to her having a child, I'll use the money that used to go to her education towards the unborn being. If she keeps the baby I will not pay for any private university. I firmly believe bio mom needs to step up.

My husband is telling me I need to understand the situation. I do not and will not endorse this teen mom dynasty in any way, this is the hill I will die on. I can actually continue paying for her fancy high school, saving (a lot less) for the uni, and some of the future child's expenses too, but I feel like I'll be rewarding her for being irresponsible and fucking myself over something I shouldn't. Husband firmly believes I am doing this to punish An, but I don't feel so because I'd still be giving her for child support. It's not like I'm leaving her in the streets. **How do I make him understand my reasoning? I truly don't want to be the evil step mother who has no heart and ""cut the step daughter out"", and I also believe he is thinking viscerally with what's the best for his child as he did not experience the teen mom hardships. I want him to understand why I'm not planning to give her everything in a silver plate,** even if I could make an extra sacrifice for paying child support and fancy HS.

**What is happening at the moment.**

I laid some facts down to An, gave her some articles and statistics about how teen moms are one of the most vulnerable groups of people, that this will hinder her dream of going to another country to study and that she knows the stigma it comes with. I recommended she terminated the pregnancy. An is unsure, and in my heart I believe she does want to terminate, but... her mom is ECSTATIC and so is her grandma. They have this weird belief where they think they can make it for so much better for her than it was for them because of ""all the experience"". I think they're absolute loonies; I bet they don't even have the money to pay for the hospital when the time comes. I believe they think we will pay for all of the unborn child's costs.

**I want An to understand that what she did was a mistake, that I love her and that I am not punishing her, but that it is not within my reach for us to live comfortably, pay for a fancy school that she will not be able to take fully advantage of, and have a step grandchild at the age of 31.** How do I make a teen feel all that without fucking our relationship? She is a nice kid, but takes after some of her mom's bad traits, such as feeling any type of advice is an attack or every consequence is a punishment.

I truly believe the right way is for her to terminate, not give up for adoption or raise it herself. I do not want to force her to terminate, but I do want her to see where I'm coming from. I also don't want this to fuck over my marriage, I believe dad is hot headed right now. He is disappointed in An, but he's also disappointed in me because he thinks I'm not giving my fullest as I usually do.

**TL;DR: Step-daughter got pregnant due to some belief her dead-beat bio mother gave her. I am the one who pays for her tuition but am planning on stopping that in order to give it for child support if she decides to keep it. I could do both, but I feel that's not my baggage. How do I make my husband understand this? How do I break the news to An without it sounding like an ultimatum of ""abort or I'll stop paying school""?**",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c5aswn/my_step_daughter_16_is_pregnant_i_31f_am_the_one/,relationship_advice,2158,421,0.0
dimdudeldei,2019-06-25 09:53:40+00:00,"UPDATE: I (36M) just found out my wife (33F) is cheating on me, we are in family holiday, she’s flying back home first, in 6 days","I talked to her this morning, about 2.5 days after I found out, in the meantime I collected as much evidence and photos as possible. Here is how it went:

We went out for a long walk and sat down when I told her this is going to be defying moment in her life. I told her to tell me every fucking detail because I know it all. She was obviously shocked, I was much more aggressive than I thought but I think it all came up finally that moment. She started slow but evidently told it all. When where how why. They actually hooked up after a business dinner when they both were drunk, and then she told me it all spiraled out of control. The dude has a wife himself. Her whole little fantasy world came crashing down. She suddenly saw the long term implications when I told her about ME raising our child, how much she fucked up seeing him with our kid, etc. I genuinely believe she was blinded by a fucking crush, because she broke down when she realized what she did and what it means for our families, friends, life. She was a fucking idiot to make it short. 

Anyways, we talked for 2 hours. She immediately said she doesn’t want a divorce and we should get counseling instead. She said she won’t go home and would extend the flight and to quit her job.

I told her I’ve got the divorce papers ready and I’m 99.99 % done with her and ready to call it quits. I told her  there’s NO reason why I ever should trust her again, love her or continue with her and that IF she wants to salvage the not salvageable, it will be 100% her to come up with how, why, and then execute.  Even though she massively fucked up and I am ready to continue alone, we’ve been together 12 years and I’m giving her this afternoon to think through it and come up with a plan. I told her things won’t be the same. She knows. I told her the easiest for us would be a divorce, so she has to come up with VERY good reasons as to why not. 

We are back home now and she’s miserable, rightfully so. Let’s wait. What do you think, did I do the right thing? Am I stupid?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c561jz/update_i_36m_just_found_out_my_wife_33f_is/,relationship_advice,6588,1114,0.0

I went to her told her she looks beautiful and that I like her small boobs. I then told her about the medical side effects, and told her I did not want her to do it. But then told her I would support her decision and would love her even if she had them, and would stand by her. We did some research. She then came back to me an hour later and told me she did not want to get them. She then hugged me and started crying. She told me her friend kept making fun of her for it. She said that she had been bullied about it since she was 16. She then told me she though I was lying about me saying I though her smaller boobs were hot. She kinda just stood and cried for like 10 minutes. So I guess that ended okay with her letting it out...
We are snuggled up right now watching inception, and I’m really happy she is feeling better.

Thank you everyone for your support and ideas : )

i_Shalt,2019-06-24 07:57:08+00:00,"My brother molested my girlfriend's niece and everything is as bad as you can imagine, I don't know what to do at this point?","Yes, he's in prison and will be for a long time. Meanwhile the niece is receiving therapy. English is not my first language so please bare with me.

For context my brother is a lot older than me and we never really connected, yet he was/is a mama's boy and our mother encouraged us to see each other. I obliged because our mother started developing Parkinson's disease and I didn't want her upset over her darling boy and second son not talking. I've always known my brother to really like chatting up women and people called him a 'sex pest' 'creep' or a wannabe 'lady's man' yet never in a million years did I think he would have a thing for or do anything to children. People still believe he is innocent. Another thing to mention my brother is a very confident person, calculated, and manipulative, very few people can tell he's lying.

With my gf we dated for a year, moved in together and had a generally normal relationship. My brother of course tried to hit on her multiple times and she brushed him off then told me which caused major strain with me, my brother, and mother. Especially because my brother and mother tried blaming my gf, yet I know what my brother is like and my mother is in denial about it. For a period of time I banned him away from our house. However later my gf's sister, BIL, and niece came to stay because her sister was pregnant with the second child and we were discussing leaving the niece at our place because the baby was going to require surgery and a hospital stay after birth that could last up to a month.

We decided to keep my gf's niece with us for the time especially so the niece could stay with her aunt. My gf and niece are fairly close so we thought it was a good idea especially with the baby while both parents were stressed and worried. Then my POS brother had to fuck it up like the cunt he is. My mother started hounding me over allowing my gf's family over but not allowing my brother over so I obliged under heavy supervision he was around. My brother was being mysteriously nice and well behaved, he also was buying us things, playing games with the niece so she actually did like him and was excited when he was around.

My brother then decided he was a handy man and helped with minor adjustments to the house, he would find excuse after excuse to come over to the point I was finding it partly daunting. My gf just ignored him and I didn't realise he was losing interest in my gf at time. When everything came out the signs became clear mainly after what occurred. In a very short period of time my gf's niece started becoming sad which we thought was because she was missing her parents so we bought her lots of toys, read to her, took her on trips to beach, zoo, shows, let her stay up, watch her favourite shows, and so on trying to make everything fun as possible. What we didn't notice was my brother was sometimes alone with her for very short periods of time which he used to his advantage.

It all come out when my gf noticed her niece was oddly quiet in the bath her niece is usually singing and splashing in the water, (my girlfriend went into the kitchen to get a cup or something it was only a few minutes), my brother was meant to be outside helping in the garden, I was in the garage when I heard screaming. I ran inside and my gf was beating up my brother who was trying to restrain her. I held onto him and my gf grabbed my niece and locked them in a room then called the police. My brother was saying he didn't do anything and ""accidentally"" walked in on the niece then my GF attacked hence I knew immediately he was lying. The police arrived and arrested him.

We found out my brother was actively grooming the niece then started getting physical with kissing and inappropriate touching, then my GF found him molesting my niece in the bath tub. He would use whatever minimal time he had to get to her, sometimes the amount of time he used was so brief it was like he was enjoying the thrill of possibly getting caught. With the bathtub incident he was meant to be outside and like the snake he is he waited for an opportunity to strike. It wasn't like the niece was left alone for hours on end, the door was left open so my gf could hear her while she went to get something then comeback. The niece is in primary school and can be left alone for brief periods of time. No one thought he would be doing this.

When we went to court several women came forward about sexual harassment from him, he would target women in his workplace or close by him with behaviour that he could try excuse, he was a peeping tom, and he would target women when they're drunk offering a ride home or something. It literally came off as a game to him where he pushed boundaries and limits to see what he could get away with. Shockingly he apparently developed a form of humanity and admitted to what he did to the niece saying he has never done anything to a child prior and wanted see what it would be like. Just a horrible person. 

My mother refuses to believe he did it and I went no contact with her because I'm honestly sick of her shit. I later remembered when my brother and I were children he was the golden boy and she paraded him around like a item, he could do nothing wrong and never had consequences for his actions. It's also the main reason our parents divorced because she refused to see what she was raising and wouldn't allow our father to get him therapy. I'm pretty sure she's a narcissist who raised a sociopath. I had moved in with our dad after the divorce because I hated the pair of them and before our dad died in my 20s, he told me how our relatives would always talk about how lovely and kind I am yet say they would 'keep an eye' on my brother while my dad said no matter what he did he couldn't feel love for or from my brother as if it was just missing from him. That of course scared me yet 15 years+ later when I'm in my 30s and my brother is almost 50 years old it was sort of lost on me.

Now with the relationship with my girlfriend. We have been sleeping in different rooms with limited talking. Her family basically blames me and my entire family and to some degree my GF. My gf told me she cannot face her sister because she feels as if she failed her family and ruined her niece's life when it's my POS brother's fault. I feel as if I ruined my GFs and her niece's life because of what my brother did. I'm trying to get us both into counselling/therapy while my gf has requested leave off work and I am preparing to too. After everything was said and done with my brother in prison, being home is utterly horrible and I have no idea what to do to even slightly repair this. This is the first time I've cried in years and I feel terrible for my GF's niece, gf, and GF's family. I do not know what to do next, I also keep willing I terminated my brother when I had the chance. I have never hated anyone more in my life while I think my mother shouldn't be locked up with him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c4jxwc/my_brother_molested_my_girlfriends_niece_and/,relationship_advice,7055,399,0.0
merkleyy,2019-06-23 17:31:41+00:00,A girl (18F) that I (17M) hooked up with took photos of my penis while I was sleeping and sent it to a group chat of her friends,"Hi everyone. I am a 17 year old guy who is kinda seeing/hooking up with a girl from the HS we both graduated from.

A few nights ago I slept at her house cause her parents were away and we had sex for the first time. 

When we were sleeping she took a picture of my penis. I was actually just sleeping naked as was she. I only now realize it cause I saw the flash go off and heard the phone camera sound.

I didn’t think much of it and I was also more than half asleep.

Fast forwards to a few mins ago my best friend texts me that there are dick pics going around of me and then compliments me like I’m “the man” or something meanwhile I’m freaking out. It’s like he texted me not to warn me but to congratulate me!

Anyway I put two and two together and realize that she took the picture and sent it around.

So I called her out on it and at first she denied it but then I caught her in a lie and she admitted to taking the pictures and sending them to a group chat of 5 of her girlfriends (and their one gay male friend).

I feel so violated and pissed and whenever I try to explain to someone that I’m mad and I feel this is wrong, they try to talk me into thinking that this is a good thing because “it means I got laid and it means my dick is getting “exposure” so that’s a good thing”?!?!

The girl fees no remorse and when I said I wanted her to delete them she said “fuck no lmao don’t be a pussy”. And then she invited me to come over and “fuck her again lmao” but I don’t wanna go now.

I forgot to mention I was always self conscience about my penis cause it’s on the small side (like no more than 5” on a good day). So in my head I’m thinking that everyone is probably making fun of how small it is.

I know that sending nudes without permission is not cool and starting to become a real concern when it happens to people but the reactions I’m getting ppl are saying I gotta be proud and stop complaining.

What even more frustrating is that when he’s sick, he doesn’t do anything. Gets on the couch and doesn’t move.

feelingdrugged,2019-06-22 04:45:09+00:00,I (22f) think my boyfriend (27m) is drugging me before bed.,"So I need to shed some back story to this. I've had really nasty insomnia most of my life. It's come and gone since I was only 10. I have to sleep with blackout window blinds because any amount of light keeps me up. Sometimes the sound of my own breathing can keep me from falling asleep. But even when the insomnia isn't bad, it still takes me at minimum an hour to fall asleep. Coupled with the insomnia, I've always been a *very* light sleeper. To give a perfect example, one night the power went out, causing my fan to shut off. The switch from the soft humming noise of the fan to complete silence was enough to wake me up. And I usually wake up several times throughout the night for absolutely no reason at all. With all that said, let me jump into why I think I'm being drugged.


A few months ago, I began a new medication that has seriously fucked up my libido. If I'm being honest, I've almost lost the desire to have sex completely. I still have sex from time to time, but mostly just to please my boyfriend and not because I want to. But our sex life has really plummeted. Again, most nights it takes me an hour to fall asleep after shutting off my phone. But within the past month, there have been a handful of nights where I'm sitting on my phone browsing reddit or reading when my eyes get really heavy all at once and next thing I know, I'm completely in a deep sleep. I mean within minutes. I won't wake up again until the morning. This has *never* occurred in my life but I saw it as a blessing because maybe I was finally overcoming my insomnia. 


This may be TMI, but it's very relevant to this situation. Any ladies that have ever had sex without a condom know that when you get up after the sex, all of your mans ejaculate just kinda... Falls out of you. It's really messy and gross. Well, every so often recently, when I'd wake up in the morning and start making breakfast, I'd get that same sensation. As if I had just had sex and all of this fluid is just coming out of me. A few days ago, I put two and two together. This always happens the night after I would doze off really suddenly. 


I have never ever felt unsafe with my boyfriend and he's never really pressured me to have sex. He'll get really frustrated when I turn him down but I've chalked it up to blue balls and let it go. But now I've started thinking more and more about it, figuring out logistically how he could be doing this. Every night before bed, I drink a gatorade in the fridge with my medication. If he is drugging me, he could easily be putting it in my gatorades. 


So what the hell am I supposed to do? I mean bringing this up to him is a pretty huge accusation, especially if I'm wrong. I have no idea how to address this or what I should do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c3le7z/i_22f_think_my_boyfriend_27m_is_drugging_me/,relationship_advice,10950,2051,0.0

Yup. Tl;Dr  says it all. My (35m) wife (35f) and I were married ten years ago yesterday. She has been working on a big project for the last few months. The last 4 weeks or so she has been putting in extra time, staying late going in early, to finish up by deadline. This is a career maker for her.

 I work construction. With the rain we have had we have crazy hours trying to make up time that we missed. So I work 12 hrs on the days its nice, sometimes a little longer. If its raining when I get up I dont go in. Somedays we get sent home when it starts, too dangerous. I usually hit the gym for an hour or two. Thursday we started at 6am ,midmorning starts to rain hard. We go home. I go to the gym as usual. I cut the workout short and head downtown to see wife Mehgan, to give her flowers and make plans for dinner that night if possible. We really havent seen much of each other this week. I went to bed about 9pm she wasnt home, called earlier me she is working late. Not unusual for past month. 

I stopped and got some flowers and went into her building about 12:30. Nichole was at the receptionist desk. I told her I got here later than I wanted could she put the flowers on Mehgans desk. She said ""I dont think they went to lunch yet why not drop them off yourself?"" She buzzed the door to get back to the offices. The place was deserted. I went to her office, the door was closed . I always walk in unless the receptionist tells me she is in a meeting. I walk in some guy is standing behind her nuzzling her neck, she is reaching back over his head. She is giggling only as she can. Saying""we got to get this done"".  I am gut punched. I slammed the flowers down said ""Happy Anniversary"" and walked out. I didnt hear what she said just went past Nichole said goodbye and left. Made it to elevators and out the building then my phone started ringing.

I balled my eyes out all the way home. Went into garage pulled my camping gear out of the rafters and took off. I drove about 2 hours to a State Park. I had no idea what to do . I just had to run. I hiked a trail we  have been on in the past about a 3 hour hike. I dont drink much so I had no booze, I just sat there thinking. Looking back I am glad I was in a rush, normally I bring a 45cal. With me camping, we have black bears, which generally scare off, but get aggressive if hungary or cubs around. The way I was feeling I might have ate the barrel that night. My phone was blowing up fom Mehgan so I had turned it off. I left the park to get reception turned it on to see my good friend called. I called him back. He said Meghan called him to check on me, make sure I didnt do anything stupid. We talked a bit, told him I got to think this thru, would catch up on Friday.

So while I am thinking about this, I go over our marriage from the beginning to see what I missed. We come from completely opposite backgrounds. My Grandfather raised me with my mom. He taught me about life. He had a little saying about everyhing. He told me marriage would be the hardest job ZI ever had, you had to work on it everyday. God I miss him. We did not have much,heard mom and grandpa having many discussions about bills. They worked hard and my brother and I did not miss out on anything we knew of.

Mehgan was born into money. Not overly rich but very comfortable. Went to a great college, always great clothes, new car etc. And she is beautiful 11/10 beautiful. I would joke with her if she coughed about the silver spoon getting stuck in her throat.  We met hit off started dating. I was dumbfounded how such a woman would ever be with me. We dated quite awhile before she told me about her parents and life style. Our friends called us the model couple, because they thought we were so good looking we had to be models. Families were not as kind, afraid of the differences economically would come into play. Her dad and I started to get along but her my mom took some convincing. 

She graduates gets her first job, we plan on getting married. We work out between us that we would expose each other to our lives that we live. I took her white water rafting, she took me to the symphony, we went ziplining, we went to an art opening etc. We agreed we had to experience the others interests. She was really enthused about the more physical things we did. I kinda like the symphony and such. I own two tuxes now.

I look back and do not see any red flags. Her first two jobs she quit because the men all tried to get in her pants. She was paraded out in front for photo ops. Invited to conferences when other newbies were not. At dinner at a conference a partner tried to get her drunk, then tried to force himself into her room that night. She quit, the next job the same thing, quit again . This 3rd job has women as some of the partners and none of that bs is in her workplace. She seems very happy. We seemed very happy. 

So now, Friday, I am home. I called her. Asked where she was, back at work. I being in a smartass mood said that the marriage is taking second place to her job. She responded since I would not talk what was she to do? Fair enough. She will be home in an hour. So I wait. I want to save our marriage. If I am lacking in providing then I want to fix it. I want to ask why of course but I can not accept  a IDK answer. How do I phrase this? What else should I be asking? I know I will get all emotional and forget everything so over the next few days we will be going over and over this.  What she did is wrong but please no degrading comments, she is still my wife.

ThrowemAweeehhhh,2019-06-20 15:41:56+00:00,UPDATE 2: Just found out my husband (28M) invited another woman over to spend the night while I’m (24F) away on business. How to proceed?,"Thank you to everyone who has commented on my last two posts. I haven’t been able to respond to everyone, and I’m still working through all the comments, but the advice, stories, and love you’ve shared has been overwhelming and absolutely needed. Thank you. Even the people calling me names and calling me out for not being stronger - thank you.

It hurt to come to the realization that we can’t move forward from this. He’s betrayed my trust so many times that I’d need him to verify pretty much anything for awhile, and that’s no way for either of us to live. 

The fact of the matter is that we’re both pretty broken, and have no business being in a relationship with each other, or anyone else right now. I truly don’t believe he’s a terrible person, but he has been a terrible partner. Like many of you said, he can be a good person and not be good for me. 

Last night, I chickened out. I was so scared of losing him forever that I said we should just take a break, have him fly home, and work on ourselves for a bit. There were a lot of tears, but when the conversation was over, I didn’t feel better, just... stuck. 

This morning, I realized what I’d done. I did this the last time I tried to get out of an abusive relationship, and put up safeguards so I could feel comfortable leaving. My husband doesn’t deserve to be led on, and I don’t deserve to be unable to move on. I read through more of your messages, and I can’t thank you all enough for your words of comfort, encouragement, and strength. 

The thing is, for you it’s black and white. For me, my thoughts are so thoroughly clouded by emotions and history, and I have to let that all go. The best thing I can do for both of us is to give up. 

So this morning, I did. I told him that while we could take a break and try again, it would never work. I can never truly trust him again, and he wants me to change things about myself that are things I love and have no desire to change. We’ve been trying so hard for so long to make things work that we’re just too far gone. 

There were lots of tears, but he took it well. He’s agreed to a no-contest divorce, and we’ll spend the next few days packing up our house before the lease is up at the end of the month. Some of you may come at me with pitch forks for not screwing him over, or breaking up last night, or leaving him to deal with the house alone, but that’s okay. I’ll be staying at my friend’s house until my new apartment is ready, and really focusing on just working on myself. I won’t help him pack unless I have someone with me. Much of the stuff is mine anyway, and I’d rather not leave it behind. You guys are right that my self-confidence has taken a nose dive lately. I have a lot of healing to do before I’m ready to consider love again, and I have two appointments scheduled with my therapist this week. This man is not a monster in my book, he’s a little boy that needs to grow up. We both made our fair share of mistakes in this relationship, but rather than feeling sorry for myself, I’m choosing to take those lessons and move on. I’m the kind of person who is very good at bouncing back, it’s just the getting out that’s hard. Thank you all for your help in that. I wish him all the best, and simply have no desire to harbor hate in my heart. 

**Because I know how easy it is for manipulated, abused women to go right back, I’ve talked a lot with my family and close friends over the last 48 hours. I previously didn’t share a lot of what was happening with them because I was embarrassed. Everyone always said we were  the perfect couple, and I was so ashamed of all the problems we had. I’ve informed these people that they are not to let me go back, should it come to that, in no uncertain terms. I don’t think I’ll get to that point, but I just want to be sure.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c2xkpx/update_2_just_found_out_my_husband_28m_invited/,relationship_advice,6287,399,0.0
reincarnationasTrev,2019-06-20 10:20:46+00:00,"My (26F) boyfriend (42M) wants me to have a c-section so my vagina won't be ""ruined"" for sex."," My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years and I'm 29 weeks pregnant. I love him dearly and I know he'd make an amazing father. Him and I started dating when I was in college and we stuck it out despite my parents' disapproval.

  The pregnancy was a surprise because he didn't like using condoms (he has an allergy to latex) and he didn't pull out in time. We've talked about what we were going to do and we agreed that it's best to give birth and marry shortly after. I told him I wanted to give birth naturally and originally he had no problem with that. However recently he started pestering me about having a c-section but he wouldn't elaborate on why when I asked him to.

    Last night he brought it up again but I wouldn't let it slide without an answer so finally he gave in and told me he doesn't want me to give birth naturally because my vagina will be ""ruined"" and ""too loose for sex to be good"". I am shocked at his reasoning and hurt that he sees me as a sex toy when I'm about to give birth to his child. He's justifying it by saying all his friends' sex lives where ruined because of vaginal birth and he doesn't want the same to happen to him. 

   I am upset he wants me to get a c-section specifically for that reason and I can't help but feel objectified. He still stands by his words and is insistent on getting a c-section or else he'll kick me out. What do I do from here?

How to proceed?,"First off, I just want to thank everyone for being patient while I sort this shit out. As I mentioned in my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c0hmre/just_found_out_my_husband_invited_another_woman/), I left on a business trip, and had actual work to do. I also managed to get my account banned from r/relationship_advice because I suck at Reddit, but thanks to the helpful mods here who helped me get verified. I honestly never thought my post would get as much attention as it did, and while I read through as many of the comments as I could, I needed a few days to sort through my own thoughts, because this situation may be entertainment to you, but it’s my real life, and has real, lasting consequences beyond the advice of internet strangers.

There is a lot of backstory that’s necessary to truly understand the State of Our Union, so rather than post multiple updates, I’ve broken it up into sections. Feel free to skip over what you’re not interested in, and skim what you are. TLDR; at the bottom of each section and at the bottom of the post.

# Confrontation:

Thank you to those who responded in the early hours. It was 1:30am when I posted, and I'd gotten a whopping three hours of sleep. Needless to say, I was not in the best headspace. Someone gave the advice to tell him ""I'm hurt and disappointed, I'm leaving, you need to fix this."" Someone else said to tell him that it doesn't matter how I found out, what matters is that it happened. Thank you for that, too. Both those comments really stuck with me, and I lay in bed waiting for him to wake up, typing out how I would respond to whatever direction our conversation took.

\*\*Quick side note: we've been together for 4 years, and other women have been a constant problem in our relationship. He, and many people close to him and me, all say he's not the guy to cheat. He's flirty, but he'd never cheat. He’s a long-term relationship guy, and loyal to the core. That being said, he's had a history of withholding information from me because he thinks it'll make me mad, and he doesn’t want me to be upset with him. I'm a pretty chill person, and honestly wouldn't have cared if he'd asked this girl over and told me about it. In the past, I haven't handled him lying to me very well, hence wanting to have a plan.

While I was waiting for him to wake up, I did something I’m not very proud of. Where I know he’d lied to me, and I wanted to have proof of the things he told me about her moving forward, especially where I’d be gone, and she was supposed to be spending the night, I set up his iMessages to come to my iPad. I know all his passwords, so I deleted the email alerts, and just added his phone number. I’m not proud of it, but I didn’t have cameras at home, and needed to know whether he was telling me the truth while I was gone. 

He woke up, and I decided to give him one last chance. As I was gathering my things, I asked him what he had planned while I was gone. He gave a very detailed report of his daily plans, casually leaving out anything about this girl staying the night or going to Colorado with him. I was so livid, because just the night before, we'd gotten into a pretty big fight where he said, ""And you don't trust me! I've done nothing, ***nothing*** to deserve it, but you still treat me like I'm sneaking around."" That hurt, because we've been going to therapy, and I thought I'd been doing really well at giving him the benefit of the doubt. I used to check his phone (b/c of the earlier problems we'd had) but haven't done that in months. It made me feel crazy and ashamed at the time, and now here I was, standing in our bedroom, watching my husband lie to me through his teeth.

I said, ""I know you're lying to me. I know you're not going to Colorado alone, and I know you invited a fucking 18 year old to spend the night in my bed."" And then I just waited, the silence heavy. He took a deep breath, and said he had two questions. 1) How did I know? (It doesn't matter. I know.) 2) Did I know during our conversation last night?

\*\*Quick side note: We've been having a lot of problems lately. We both have mental illnesses which are sometimes exacerbated by the other’s (he has ADHD, depression, and PTSD - and I’m starting to wonder maybe bipolar of some sort, and I have PTSD, anxiety, and a number of health issues), and he's not very good at controlling his anger. Nothing more physical than throwing things or punching walls, but it is absolutely verbal and emotional abuse. I wasn't sure if it was before, but after a recent fight we had in which I asked him to stop screaming at me so I could finish packing, he said, ""You can multitask."" Yeah, I realize he sounds like a shit person. And when he's in that headspace, he is. It's very much a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde situation, and when he's kind and calm, he's the sweetest, most loving person I've met, and that's who I fell in love with. I care for him, even at the same time as I know that I don't deserve him. So the night before, we had a very heartfelt, emotional talk, in which I told him I wanted him to be happy. I could tell that he wasn't, and I thought he should go home (several thousand miles away) for a few months to figure himself out. I told him I would be his biggest cheerleader, and that if we ended up staying together or divorcing, I would always love him, and he would always be my family. We've been through some shit, both together and separately, and we were both sobbing by the end of it. But here's the kicker: I told him that if he needed another woman to make him happy, I would let him go, and support him as a friend. End of side note \*\*

As a result, I was probably pretty harsh in my response, and said, ""No, I didn't know during our conversation last night. And now I feel like an idiot, like my husband has been fucking a teenager and I just gave him my blessing."" He tried to get defensive and said that ""It's not like that."" I got really quiet, and said, ""You're a very smart man. But if you can't see that girl wants to get in your pants, you're a fucking idiot. She texts you about her taking bubble baths, and you fucking tell her about all our problems. Her. When you won't even talk about me with most of your friends, you're telling an 18 year old about all of our problems."" He said he would cancel his plans with her, and I said, ""I'm not making that decision, you are. I honestly don't know how you can fix this. I don't. I don't care if you go with her at this point. But I'm leaving, and I'm hurt and disappointed, and you need to figure out where your priorities are, because right now? Your priority isn't your wife, it's your 18 year old crush."" He kept saying he should’ve told me, but that he didn’t want me to make him feel guilty for wanting to hang out with his friend, and that I should’ve known that nothing would happen. I asked him if he loved her, and he said that most of the time, he doesn’t even like talking to her every day because she’s so immature. 

That was it. He drove me to the airport. He cried a lot, and apologized a lot. I felt a lot of nothing. Heartbreak, maybe? But there's been so much turmoil in our relationship that I just didn't care anymore. 

***Confrontation TLDR;*** I told him I was hurt and angry and leaving, and he needed to figure out how to fix it. He told me that there was no sexual motivation to them hanging out, and that her spending the night was just so they could get an early start in the morning. He showed me texts where he said he would sleep on the couch and she could sleep in the bed (which is somehow worse to me, my bed is my space). He was very apologetic, and knew he messed up. He dropped me off at the airport, and things were still very uncertain. 

\*\*

# The Fallout

We left things the way we'd planned to leave them during the heartfelt conversation the night before. We both planned to take the 5 days I was gone to do some soul-searching and figure out what and where we needed to be happy. Then, when I got home, we'd talk it over, and make a plan.

Well, when my plane landed at my destination, and I got a text from my husband saying that he would be moved out of our house by the time I got back, and that he's going home to the east coast. He said he was sorry to leave me to manage our upcoming move on my own, and that he knew I would be better off this way. He said he was taking the car so he could drive back, but that he’d leave me all of the money in our bank accounts, except what he needed for gas. He said he was sorry for keeping the information about his friend from me, but that our conversation last night had meant so much to him and had been such a high point of our relationship, that to wake up and be accused of cheating was a low point that he could not turn back from. He said he didn’t know how to make me believe that his intentions were nothing other than company on the drive with his friend, but that it didn’t matter and he would leave me alone. 

I’ve never felt that angry, hurt, or desperate before. I was coordinating the travel of more than a dozen other people, who were on the flight with me, and it felt like all the wind had been knocked out of me. I wanted to sob and scream, but I couldn’t, because I was surrounded by people I was supposed to be responsible for. I tried my hardest to gain composure, but a few tears slipped out, and I just focused on my breathing. If I’m being honest, I’m not proud of my response. I basically begged him to stay. I’d left feeling like if he needed to leave and we didn’t stay together, it would be okay, but knowing that I’d be returning home to an empty house, not getting to say goodbye, and that he was ending things over ***text*** after four years together, was just too much for me. I sounded like a child, I said I needed him, that he was making a stupid mistake, that I deserved more than ending our ***marriage*** over text, all the cliches. It was bad. But he was determined to leave, and I had to get over a dozen people to our final destination, so I couldn’t keep messaging him. 

About an hour later, I got a text that he would at least be staying until I got back, because of our dogs. Nobody could watch them, so he’d stay until I was home, and then he’d go. We planned on having a phone call that night to talk over the specifics, but it never happened. I was too busy and physically/emotionally exhausted. 

I know (from his texts coming to my ipad, but also from him telling me) that he canceled with the girl. I know that he also invited her over (which was partly my doing, w/ the texts I was getting I didn’t want him to be alone, regardless of if he fucked her - then there would be no question) I know that he called his best friend and talked to him about everything for an hour and a half (which was very good, he is a phenomenal human being, and has a great marriage/advice). Husband seemed more calm and level-headed after that call. He said he would take the rest of the week to think things through, like we planned. 

We didn’t talk much, he texted me every day, and I sometimes responded. The week went by quickly, and I realized I didn’t want to go home. I’m not sure if that’s because of all the drama and chaos that was waiting there, or if its because I no longer want to be married to my husband. I don’t know a lot of things anymore, and I’m trying to take each day one at a time. I had a small panic attack as he was about to pick me up. I’ve had worse, but I sat outside at passenger pickup, trying to breathe oxygen that wasn’t there, and wipe tears from my eyes. Maybe it was the anticipation of not knowing what would happen or where we’d stand, I don’t know. But when he hugged me, he got all emotional that I was home, and I just… felt so far away. You know how when you hug someone intimately, it feels like your souls are hugging? It felt nothing like that, which was new. It felt like hugging a stranger. 

So yeah, now I’m home. My flight was delayed, so we both just crashed into bed as soon as we got back. I was asleep when he left for work, so we haven’t talked about anything, but I’m expecting we will tonight, and I’ll post an update then. 

I know you may be looking for more resolution, and I wish I had it. I don’t even know what I want to do yet. Part of me is ready to leave, to be done, to move on with my life. I’d want to take a good chunk of time and work on myself, but then I’d want to find someone who is transparent with me, and who understands and accepts the many parts of me that may be inconvenient, but are still me. 

Part of me wants to give him one more chance. One more opportunity to get his anger under control, communicate well, and make things work. To you, reading this, it may seem black and white. But to me, living it, it’s anything but. I’ve spent nearly every day with this man for 4 years. We’ve lived together for two and a half. We have two dogs, a house, a life. It’s hard to just throw that all away, even if it’s what ends up being best for both of us. But that’s not a decision I’m willing to make lightly or on a whim. Since I left, he’s been much better about following a routine, and he hasn’t texted the girl at all. He did say that she IM’d him at work, and that they talked there for a bit. I appreciated the honesty, but not knowing what they talked about has me nervous. If we do stay together, there’s a lot of work that will need to be done. I told him he can kiss me on the cheek, but for right now, I can’t be vulnerable or open with him, or trust him at all (because of the anger stuff and things he said to me during that fight). It’ll take a lot of time and patience, and I don’t know if he’s willing to give it. 

\*\*If you want me to read and consider your comment, please don’t throw him under the bus. He is absolutely in the wrong in this situation, but he’s also been through a lot and I understand his behavior, even if I don’t excuse it. He is ***not*** a piece of shit, even if he may be ***acting*** like one. 

***Fallout TLDR;*** Husband tried to end our marriage over text because me confronting him about his plans with the girl was too much for him to handle. He had a bit of a mental breakdown, and I told him to call her - or anyone - so he wouldn’t be alone. He did, and she stayed for an hour and a half before he asked her to go home so he could call his best friend. He picked me up at the airport, but since my flight was delayed, we haven’t talked or made plans yet.

***Post TLDR;*** confronted husband before I left. He didn’t deny the plans, but denied that there was anything sexual motivating them. He canceled the plans with the girl, but then tried to end our marriage through text. There’s a lot of backstory, our marriage has been pretty rocky lately, and he’s got some anger issues he needs to work through. He got some help from his best friend (who lives in his hometown on the east coast), and seemed much more stable. We haven’t talked much while I’ve been gone, and I don’t know where things stand yet. He did say he doesn’t even like talking to her some days, because she’s so immature. Not sure if I believe him, but he seemed sincere. We’re going to talk through everything when he gets home from work tonight, and I’ll update then.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c2l5lo/update_just_found_out_my_husband_28m_invited/,relationship_advice,2444,364,0.0
throwaway44569765,2019-06-19 17:22:17+00:00,"UPDATE: GF received a letter from a man in prison, letter disappeared before I could bring it up","[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c22vu4/my_gf25f_received_a_letter_from_a_guy_in_prison/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

Ok so many of you have been asking for an update. I didn’t expect the first post to blow up the way it did so sorry for not replying to everyone. I’ll try to answer some of your questions first and clear some things up. 

The man who wrote her is currently serving 30 years for first degree murder and armed robbery. He started his sentence in 2010 when he was 17 and is not set to be released until 2040. I know all this information because his full name was on the letter and jail records, mugshots, etc. are fairly easy to obtain since they are public record. There is obviously also a news article about his crime. My daughter was born in 2016, my gf was still in high school in 2010 and her and I started dating in 2014 so I don’t think a paternity test is necessary (though I still might get one just to have a clear mind). Also, I had no intentions on opening her mail without her permission as some of you seem to think. If I wanted to open it I would have on the spot. Others think that I’m stupid for not opening it on the spot and honestly in this situation you may be right but in that moment I chose to respect her privacy. A choice I obviously regret now. Say what you will, it’s the choice I made.

Now let’s focus on the letter. She or her mother still will not give it up. However she did admit to making her mom take it. Her mother has yet to own up to anything. Apparently she has been writing this dude on and off for 3 years behind my back. That’s about half as long as we’ve been together. She said that initially she wrote him to inform him that their mutual friend passed away which I told her wasn’t her responsibility to do seeing as how she hasn’t seen him in over 10 years; but then that evolved into a whole back and forth pen-pal correspondence. She’s been talking about me with him, telling him details of our relationship, how long we’ve been together, we live together, have a kid, yadda yadda yadda. She said she had her mom hide the note because she didn’t want me to freak out about his charges which is what ended up happening anyways. None of this sits well with me at all. 

So I told her that she or her mother can no longer be trusted and unless that letter reappears things are going to be very different between all of us. For the sake of our daughter, I am going to stay with her for now. But I am going to be moving out in the coming months and like previously stated probably going to order a paternity test. The future of this relationship is now all up to her... if she continues to gaslight me and play this off like it’s not a big deal then I am going to get a lawyer involved for custody rights. If she shows that she wants to make this work and cuts off all communication with this man and really makes an effort, then we may still have a chance. 

Say what you will, I do love her. I do want it to work out, but I do realize that it may not. She swears no one is in danger, she still swears that everything is innocent, he’s a childhood friend blah blah. She admitted she was wrong for keeping this a secret and she apologized but she still thinks I’m overreacting a bit. I don’t care though because I’m not backing down and she broke all the trust I had for her.

Today I signed up for that program that snaps a pic of all your mail before it gets sent out. Now I’ll get an email of everything coming into that mailbox. I know they don’t open the mail, but it is nice to have it all on record now because I may end up needing that later for evidence.

Throwawaymyspermazoa,2019-06-19 12:56:19+00:00,HAPPY UPDATE: Wife(F33) and I (M34) decided to try for kids last year. Found out I'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.,"https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c225le/update_wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids/

I'm sorry to drag ya'll through the worst of my insecurities.  I definitely channeled quite a bit of my negative shit into what I posted.  But hey, that's what anonymous people are good for sometimes I guess.

Anyways, we finally sat down after she got home last night.  I told her everything that was going on.  The Urologist, the money, the upcoming appointment.  I told her how, even with all her reassurances, too many suspect things kept happening.  

She agreed how everything looked, and immediately apologized.  She didn't realize how much my last exs cheating was still affecting me.  She knew I was off going into the weekend, but thought we addressed that. We talked about it Sunday, but I can get pretty internal with all these worries and not show them outwardly.  And so while she had thought we were communicating, I wasn't.  We decided to start from the beginning and go through everything together.

The money was the real problem for me. She agreed how inconsiderate it was with where my head was at to do that without mentioning it.  Apparently the prenatal visits are so structured that they want you to set up a payment plan with them right away, and she wanted to make sure it was squared away to keep the appointment.  She offered without me prompting to call them with me tomorrow to verify that, or if I really wanted we could move the money back.  She does get better rewards out of hers so it kind of made sense.

We read up on obstructive azoospermia, and it doesn't seem like they're often invincible forcefields.  It seems like only the actual absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) actually guarantees complete infertility, so it is possible for some to get through. We're going to go back to the original specialist I was working with last year and hopefully get a clearer picture.  It turns out the appointment she made was the only time they had available so soon, and figured it'd be best not to wait.  I told her I took off work to go with, and she was relieved I could join.

Once again, she said all the right things and seems genuine about getting us on the same page.  After going through each thing I was just wishing I believed her a little more before. She's stressed out with work and when she'll have to take off, but she really seemed to want to go out of her way to alleviate my concerns. She even offered an open phone policy if I needed.  We did look at the text I had seen, and it was just a girlfriend.  I declined though right now, since I don't want to be that husband.

This has really made me take a deeper look at what's in my past and how that still affects me today. Even thinking back to this weekend, it was so hard to see in the moment how much all the uncertainty was affecting me.  That level of anxiety literally makes you question what around you is real.  I think the trust but verify is the best way to put it. I was just trying to verify without any of the trust is all.  This has all put a strain on our marriage right now, but I'm feeling a bit more like we're a team again working towards easing that.

She thought that an NIPP ASAP was a great idea, as long as we also get some kind of counseling together.  I'm not big on therapy, but I can probably agree that it will most likely help.

I'm feeling a little better about everything.  Thanks again to everyone who reached out and shared their own story (Every other comment here I read was a story of a family member who was supposed to be barren and ended up popping out triplets), and most of all those who helped me try to communicate fairly through all of this.   It's time for me to hopefully be a father.

throwaway17274829,2019-06-18 21:28:02+00:00,UPDATE: My [25M] wife [25F] has 1000 matches on tinder. We are high school sweethearts.,"Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/byt7xr/my_25m_wife_25f_has_1000_matches_on_tinder_we_are/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

I finally worked up the balls to confront my wife over this three days ago, on Sunday. We went out to brunch, and after, I told her straight up that I saw a tinder notification.

She told me that she uses it as a confidence boaster, something not so surprising. She then opened her profile and showed that she hadn’t talked to any of the guys she matched with; I scrolled around for a bit, something she let me do, and found that she was telling the truth. There were only incoming messages, no outgoing. 

I told her that that made me very uncomfortable, and that I still loved her very much and that she shouldn’t be unconfident. She said that she was insecure about her pregnancy body, she didn’t think I was attracted to her anymore, she had nagging thoughts that I was having an affair (not true at all), and that she would never see another man. 

I asked her to delete it, and she did instantly. She told me that, if I was still paranoid, I had every right to snoop on her phone from time to time without permission. I told her I had no intention of doing that (I dont) because I don’t want to be “that husband.”

We’re off to couples therapy, but I think we’ll be alright. I just hope she gets her confidence back soon; she has no reason to be insecure.

TL;DR Wife insecure as I expected, used tinder as a confidence booster. Proved it, now off to couples therapy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c2854a/update_my_25m_wife_25f_has_1000_matches_on_tinder/,relationship_advice,2951,334,0.0

I showed up to the house while he was at work. (I have a key and my mom was there so this wasn’t an issue.) When he got home a few hours later he nearly crashed into my car out of excitement. 

We said hello. I asked him if he liked my shirt. He kind of confusedly said yes. I told him I got him one too, he laughed and got up to grab it. I unfolded it so he could see what it said and he just about stopped breathing. Then he took it and went into the kitchen, pretty clearly because he didn’t want us to see him cry. 

He’s still wearing it. He only took it off for a day because my mom told him he had to wash it. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c27tgq/final_update_asking_my_stepdad_if_i_can_call_him/,relationship_advice,8232,251,0.0
Fakeuser123123123,2019-06-18 02:17:04+00:00,Situation with girl (30f) I (30M) used to bully,"I have been here for a bit without posting or commenting and am looking for advice

When I was younger I was a different person. There was a girl I went to middle and high school with and bullied very hard, physically and emotionally. There was one incident where the cops got involved and the only reason I wasn’t expelled/arrested was because there was not proof. After that incident I did not see this girl for many years.

In my early 20’s I was sent to prison for 3 years for assaulting a man. Another thing I am deeply ashamed of. When in prison I introspected deeply and found sanctuary in religion. I left a better man than I went in.

A few weeks ago I ran into the girl on the street of my home town. Before that my pastor had told me to ask those who I have wronged for forgiveness. My heart sunk when I saw her and I could tell she was avoiding eye contact. I called her name and we started talking. We talked about things for a long time, and she seemed ok/smiling. Eventually I was going to leave things as they were, but she asked if I would like to get coffee. At the moment and even now I feel like denying her request would not be fair given our past.

We got coffee and ended up sleeping together, it felt great and there wasn’t much moral question as it was happening. She left the next morning and we have been texting/meeting regularly since. 
I am not on social media but I googled her name. Her Facebook picture is her with another man in a dress. I was not 100% but it looks like she is wearing a wedding dress as well. I casually asked a high school friend who uses Facebook if she is married without giving too much away, and he said yes

My head hurts typing this because I feel as though I am being tested but don’t know what to do. If she is cheating I don’t know if I should tell her husband or just ask to break things off without letting her know I know, if I do that she will resent me forever I’m sure",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c1wi3z/situation_with_girl_30f_i_30m_used_to_bully/,relationship_advice,1150,277,0.0

I was devastated to hear that. To hear that I took her to her grand parents house so many times and let them baby sit without knowing. To hear that she's held this secret for so long. I absolutely believe her, in fact some of her moods and lashing out as a teen makes so much more sense now. And she offered to show me the old entries in her private live journal account.

She still wants to share her old journal entries with everyone and I just don't know if it's a good idea. I am afraid nobody will believe her, especially now, and I am afraid she's about to bring more pain and trouble onto herself.

I am also feeling so shaken up, because the rest of my late husband's family has always been my support network, and now that is gone. I don't know where to go from here, to help my daughter, to mend our relationship with the family if that is even possible.

Where can we go from here?

I hope this write up hit all the important points. I haven't posted on here before, let me know if there is anything else I ought to include.

tl;dr My late husband's father is dying. My daughter got caught cutting off his oxygen in the hospital. She told me that he abused her as a pre teen, and she wants everyone to know.

MrAlphaNu,2019-06-17 14:22:48+00:00,[Update] My ex girlfriend committed suicide.. I am a firefighter and had to find her body,"Its been a bit over 6 months since I posted that story and I want to give you a quick update on my life. Im on mobile so I apologize if it makes it harder to read. 
 TL;DR My ex girlfriend got into an abusive relationship with a drug addict. She was dealing with depression for a while and killed herself. I am a firefighter in NJ, but go to school in NH. I received the call and conducted research to find her. I drove back down to help with the search. We found her body in the woods and she wrote me a suicide note. 


Where i left off was me upset about the situation and upset with the world, and most importantly, upset with myself. I was in a dark place for a while after that. I drank and shunned out everyone but my friends who were helping me. For a good amount of time I distanced myself from any girl who I met.

The funeral wasnt long after and Jim didnt even show up. Im not sure if he was invited, but it just shows the type of guy he is. 


I didnt feel comfortable with dating anyone, let alone even hooking up with them. It felt wrong and i was scared i would get close to someone and lose them again. The depression i felt was destructive.

My chief reached out to me not long after because I never told him how I knew her. He asked me to see a therapist and that he can set up a visit at the firehouse. I was in NH so i told him ill see my college counseling center and send him confirmation. 

I lied, i sent him a fake email and he believed me. I had this notion that i dont need help because i help people. 

After 3 months i was still depressed but i started to talk to girls again. I met this really nice girl named Sarah. We talked  and even hooked up a couple times. After a month and a half she asked if we could start dating. I told her i couldnt. I told her my story and said i dont feel comfortable being close with anyone. She took it well and still wanted to talk, but i couldnt anymore. I felt as if she crossed a line in my mind and we couldnt go back. I didnt want to be close with anyone like that again.

Fast forward another month my friend Kelsey asked if i wanted to go to her sorority formal with one of her friends. I accepted and thats when i met Kristen. Kristen was perfect, she was really sweet and a great date. We ended up talking for a while and this time i decided it was time to be proactive. I opened up to her about what happened to me and i told her i want to take it very slow. She completely understood, instead of scaring her off she helped me more than anyone has ever had.

She convinced me that avoiding therapy is a bad move, and that there is no shame in seeking counseling. So i made an appointment and went. The therapist told me about a suicide prevention org on campus that i should join and tell my story. I joined them and they had suicide prevention events where people tell their stories  to help others. 

I did my first story and Kristen and a bunch of my friends went to support me. It was one of the most touching moments of my life standing up on that stage and seeing all those people. I continued doing these events and Kristen went to every single one. 

After 6 months i told her im ready to start dating, but to understand that i may be distant at first because im not use to this. She understood. Weve been together for 8 months and shes amazing. Shes nicest and most supportive person ive ever met. 

Every time im in NJ i go to Lydias house and support her mom. On Christmas i got a crew to come to her house and deliver presents to her moms boyfriends autistic son and her nephews. 

The way i was able to get relief for my pain was helping others. And if it wasnt for Kristen i wouldnt have the guidance to do it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c1o3ou/update_my_ex_girlfriend_committed_suicide_i_am_a/,relationship_advice,19996,437,0.0

salinghigh,2019-06-16 17:00:21+00:00,UPDATE: My [27M] best friend's [27M] girlfriend [40F] just called me and invited me over without my friend there,"So I just wanted to give an update and add some context to my last post.  I quickly wrote my last post because I was looking for answers before I arrived at the house.  The TL;DR of the update is that we had a pretty innocent conversation about life in general.

So like I said before, I've hung out with my best friend's girlfriend before but it's always been the three of us.  And shes called me or texted me before, but usually it's in the context of a group thing that me and my best friend are in the process of setting up.  So when I saw her name pop up on my phone as she called me, I knew that there weren't any plans (I just was with the both of them for Game 7 of the NHL playoffs), and my immediate thought was that something bad had happened to my friend and that's why she was calling me.  So when I answered the call, that was my mindset going in and I was kind of a 'deer in the headlights.'

When I answered she asked me if I had any plans for the evening, I told her I didn't.  She asked if I wanted to come over for some pizza and beer, and hang out.  I had just got home from work, and told her that I just needed to change and I could come over.  At this point I thought all three of us would be there, but that's when she told me that my friend was still at work and wouldn't be back till later.  So to those of you asking why I would even go over in the first place, I was already pot committed.

Now to those of you wondering, I did not text my friend that I was going over.  Here's the thing.  I've known him since I was 5, so 22 out of the 27 years I've lived I've been friends with this kid.  We grew up together and he is basically my brother.  I knew what my intentions were, and trusted that he would trust me.  Nonetheless, the girlfriend did let him know that I was coming over and so he texted me when I was on my way to his house.  He knew I was going to be there.  I also have a recording app on my phone that I had ready to use so I could turn it on if the conversation started going inappropriate, but I did not have to use it at all.

When I got there, all me and the girlfriend did was talk about life stuff until my friend came home.  I feel like if anything, this was just a little bonding time for the two of us and an opportunity to connect more.  My friend is an important person in both of our lives, so it makes sense to me that his girlfriend and I should also have a good, friendly relationship as well.

All in all, I think I just freaked out a little because it could definitely have been an awkward position if everyone's intentions weren't good.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c1c4qk/update_my_27m_best_friends_27m_girlfriend_40f/,relationship_advice,2003,208,0.0
JuicyDarkSpace,2019-06-16 14:02:10+00:00,I just lost the best thing that has happened to me due to my own complacency.,"Long time lurker, first time poster. 

Also on mobile.

My gf broke up with me yesterday, saying our relationship of 2.5 years wasn't working. 

I will absolutely be the first to admit we had our share of problems. Problems that I did not seek to correct as quickly as I could, because I felt safe. I knew I was going to marry her, I knew she was going to be my wife. I put off small changes to my behavior that could have vastly increased her quality of life,(walking our dogs more, going to the gym with her, doing more around the house) without decreasing my own. I also ""knew"" things would get better as our relationship progressed because that's what we both wanted. We put off going to see a relationship counselor for almost a year, citing money as the main issue, when I could have afforded it and would have paid for it had I known it would lead here. 

I didn't listen the way I should have to her legitimate complaints, and let her consistently put more work in around the home because it benefitted me. This is something I did not realize until I was gathering my things to leave what was once our apartment, our home. She did things for me that I literally didn't notice due to laziness. I cannot remember the last thing I did for her outside of making her lunch or walking the dogs that greatly improved her life. 

I'm here saying this because I don't want this to happen to you. Maybe you won't hit the end of your relationship if you read this. 

If you are with a person that you want to be with forever, please don't be full of regret because you could have done more. Those small things that you are letting them do today instead of doing them yourself will add up and build resentment. I cannot Express how stupid I feel, over like 10-15 minutes of work a day at most. 

Even if you are having issues right now, try to let go of any negative emotions and let your person know you love them. Go tell them you love them, tell them they are appreciated, and figure out a way to improve their life. Go wash some dishes, or clean the bathroom at the least.

It may do nothing, but you won't feel the way that I do. Knowing that literally a little bit of elbow grease and compassion would have made a world of difference.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, it's been like 12 days. The long and the short of it: The truth came out. Wedding has been put on hold while ""she gets help"" and I am left to pick up the mess and deal with everyone. I need a stiff drink and a vacation. 

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of people said some things that really struck with me. The photo of the stripper seemed to be odd, and you're right, it made no sense. Why would he take a picture that was so compromising? Why would he risk possible criminal charges if someone felt he went too far? How was he so cavalier? I sat her down and demanded the whole truth. We talked the night that I posted and we talked from 6ish until 3 or 4. We went moment by moment, step by step, and I demanded to know what happened. So, here's what *actually* happened: 

&amp;#x200B;

They got together for pre-fun cocktails and dinner but ate very little. They drank and drank and then had a hotel room booked as their base of operation from which they'd change and go to a club then crash at the end of the night. They got to the hotel and everyone was drunk. Instead of cooling their jets, they wanted to have more fun. Two of the bridesmaids suggested getting topless (one is a school teacher and the other is a surgical nurse...) and then my fiancees bright idea? *Get high.* But on what you might add? Oh, only painkillers she illicitly procured during her mother's final months and had been taking to help deal. Yeah, fucking lovely. My MIL had been in dilaudid, ativan and others. They all popped a pill, finishing the bottle and then the MoH's surprise - a stripper. So, who took the pills *and drank?* Only my future wife. Yeah, the rest of them realized that was a shit idea and instead just stuck to booze. It's why my fiancee was fall-down dumb and couldn't hold herself together. My fiancee doesn't drink, so I should have connected the dots there. That's on me I guess. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reality of the stripper is that they jumped around topless, drank and laughed while my fiancee was stoned and drunk. Stripper never fingered her. She kissed him then he kissed her neck and she hugged him but he was clear what the rules were and not only did he not touch her but they are pretty sure he ended things early and left to avoid a problem. The photo was a set-up and she was wearing underwear but not much else. She then admitted she would have fucked the stripper so that I would leave her. She said that she was mad at her mother for declining treatment early on and for her father for not pushing her into treatment earlier. She was mad at the whole situation and she began to take some pills. Then she was mad she was taking the pills and wanted to put distance between us. I couldn't figure out what pills she was taking until it dawned on me: near the end her mother was in pain and they gave her a prescription that made her really sick so another was issued. I thought the pills were destroyed but I guess my fiancee didn't do that - I had no reason to assume she would lie. In the years we've been together/known each other she's drank MAYBE 3 times and been really seriously drunk only once. I didn't think she'd do that. 

So, that brings me to the texts. I ask her why, if she would have fucked that guy to hurt me, she didn't want me to know. She explained that she felt horrible guilt, didn't know what to do and realized it wasn't what she wanted and got scared that I was going to find out and leave her. Her MoH, who hired the stripper, wanted me to know about the drugs and thought she could scare her into telling me. Her bridal party were divided all wanted the wedding to proceed but half wanted her to disclose the pills she stole and the others didn't. By this point I didn't know what to do. 

I followed advice given her and said we needed to delay the wedding. She began to panic and begged me not to. She started making bizarre fucking suggestions - we could do whatever I wanted for the next year and even offered to let me hit her to get back but begged me not to walk away from us. She then said she had a problem and needed help, Her dad is a nice guy but not emotionally all that available. She said that without me she'd be alone and that despite everything she loved me. That I don't actually doubt, I think she really does love me. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what happened? 

&amp;#x200B;

She saw her doctor on Monday who immediately used the words ""abuser"" and ""addict"" and strongly recommended blood tests, medical tests and a referral to a psychiatrist. We got the name of the doctor and I guess they move quickly because by the following day she was meeting with the psychiatrist. He recommended different types of therapy. We had a ""group meeting"" and he's said my wife is absolutely an addict - she was using the prescription pills and alcohol and my fiance admitted she had been drinking on the sly for some time. She's taken a leave from her work and is in group therapy sessions, meeting with a psychologist and recuperating by focusing on diet, exercise and self-improvement. We're down to one salary (mine) and absolutely cannot afford extras, so the wedding is currently on hold. 

&amp;#x200B;

This meant that I had to have very uncomfortable conversations with everyone, including my family, her family and our friends. Her father talked to me and told me that he feels terrible. He knows he has trouble being emotionally available and said that he wasn't really there for his daughter and felt horrible. My parents are well-to-do and helped with some bills that unexpectedly came in and have been helping a lot with everything. My fiancee has been going to my parent's house to work with my mother on gardening and to do other things around the house. The bridal party &amp; maid of honor came to meet with me and bought me breakfast. They admitted that they suspected she had been taking the pills as she was a little looser with them and felt that the bachelorette party was a huge mistake. She drank way too much and they didn't stop her. I thanked them for their apology but said I didn't know what to say. They just offered their apologies and said that I was a great guy. 

&amp;#x200B;

The long-and-the-short of it is we're not sleeping in the same room. We aren't having sex. We are right now in this weird healing phase. Her team has recommended I see individual therapy which I haven't yet had the time to do. A lot of bills have come in and we've delayed the wedding - no rest for the wicked, I guess. My parents have been absolutely wonderful in all of this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fiancee and I are in a weird place. She's overly nice and sympathetic. Since she's home, she cooks a lot more, focuses on tasks around the house and has been working hard on exercising. She submits to drug tests and we have a BACTrack if I'm concerned she's drinking. I'm a lot more aware of what's going on. She's attended a secular sobriety organization and meets with them. She's in group therapy and individual therapy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I kind of feel like I got shat on again and don't have a next move planned. People keep telling me to watch out for myself, but I'm not sure what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

So that's what happened. I'm stunned and confused. Turns out people can really surprise you, and not always in a good way. I still love her and depending on how things go, we'll see about getting back to a place where we can think about a wedding. For now, I'm going to eat some bacon and try to enjoy the weekend.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c0x3ow/almost_two_week_update_fiancée_27f_went_too_far/,relationship_advice,7911,1230,0.0

Yesterday was my birthday and I got tagged in a post so I checked it out and my mother posted a photo of another girl in her graduation photos parading it around like it was me on Facebook.( more than one post)

I am feeling hurt and upset since we just took a trip together and took so many wonderful pictures together, it was a special time for me and it makes me sad that she used someone else’s photos instead of a photo of me to wish me a happy birthday.

When I pointed it out to her (publicly on the post) she just posted “lol I’m getting old” but this hurts so much because the girl is fat like I am we don’t look alike at all. the girl in the picture is darker skinned than I am has black hair (mine is dyed blonde) and the girl is in her cap and gown (I haven’t finished my education yet)

I feel as though she wants me to be this girl she saw pictures of instead of being me. I don’t feel loved and I asked her to take down the post but she hasn’t yet.

Am I being unreasonable? Am I overreacting? I think my mom should know what I look like. Am I being insecure of immature about this situation?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c0iv0m/my_mother_posted_a_photo_of_another_girl_in_her/,relationship_advice,4731,462,0.0
crazytown605,2019-06-13 20:09:09+00:00,Update My wife is going to gave sex with other men,"Sorry I posted this update in the wrong sub. Here we go. My wife and I calmed down on Sunday to discuss this mess. I had been avoiding her all week until I could get my head around it. We took a drive in the car, something we like to do for like 3 hours. My wife started out apologizing for how she presented this to me. She had been rehearsing on what to say. When it came time to inform me it just spilled out of her mouth all wrong. She wanted to bring up now that kids are grown and on their own, she would like us to make changes in our lives. She went on about not having other sexual partners etc. What she wanted to propose was that we have an open relationship, where we both would seek out others. 

I told her that I would not , could not do this. I reminded her of the vows before God, family and friends we took on fidelity. I told her how she had violated the trust that I had for her. Look I understand what she is feeling. I know she wants new experiences. I told her our plan as we had discussed many times in the past, once the kids were out that we would travel a bit. Maybe take up new hobbies, maybe some education classes etc. We never had a discussion about this. 

I told her because of the breach of trust and her steadfastly stating she is going to do this I was seeing a lawyer Tuesday to start divorce proceedings. At this point if she said she would not go thru with this I do not think I could not think she could be cheating at some point. That is where the trust comes in. I think divorce is proper, she can do her thing no guilt can be associated. I think equal division of assests, I expect to make no support payments, did not know if it was a thing in our state, its not. We will have to sell the house and each downsize. We actually had a good talk. Papers are being drawn. We hope  to get through this by fall.

I did talk to each kid individually, explained we are going seperate ways. Did not mention the lifestyle change. They can talk to their mom themselves. I will always love my wife. I will take the high road. I know many of you wanted scortched earth but I can not do that, its not me. I do want to address a couple comments someone posted on the update on the other sub. They thought I was trying to manipulate her into staying by using the marriage vows. I got to say that my religious up bringing has set my morals that I live by. This works for me. There are some that say its the 21st century no one lives that way anymore. There are many things I see others do and say that I do not agree with, but I do not try to impose my morals on them and conversly you should not denigrate what I believe. Remember my wife and I believed the same for close to 30 years, only recently has she made a change. I never held her down she was always free to chose. I believe in God and believe in my vows before him. Sorry enough soap box.

Last I want to thank all of your kind replies. I was overwhelmed. I only wish I could have replied to each and everyone. Thank you for letting me talk this out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c0apqu/update_my_wife_is_going_to_gave_sex_with_other_men/,relationship_advice,5995,471,0.0
infertylemyrtle,2019-06-13 11:40:38+00:00,"Using a surrogate, feels more like husband is having a kid with another woman.","For various reasons, my husband and I had to use a surrogate and donor egg to try to have children. We ended up finding an old friend of mine who agreed to carry out of financial need (paying student loan debt). ""Our"" surrogate got pregnant on the first round and is currently in the 2nd trimester with twins. She is not using her own egg and this was by IVF, not sex.

I've never been pregnant nor is it possible, so I'll admit I think it's fascinating and I've asked her questions. But my spouse and our extended family are taking it to the next level.

My husband asks her for updates and how she's doing/feeling constantly. He asked HER how she thinks we should set up the nursery. He's tried to offer her a massage and probably would if I wasn't around. They've talked and she wants to breastfeed for a few months which he thinks is a great idea for the health benefits.

My parents and my spouse's parents are thrilled to be finally having a grandchild and absolutely dote on this woman. She was invited to come to lunch on Mother's Day with all the women and they all but showered her with affection and said nothing to me. I didn't need emotional fluffing but I got the message loud and clear that they only view me as a bankroll for the true mother.

I'm quite frankly tired of it. It feels like my husband is having an affair and a child with another woman and I can not only not be upset, but I also have to pay 1/2 the cost. I wouldn't have done this if it I knew it was just a very expensive way to become a stepmother.

woodwash,2019-06-13 02:57:04+00:00,OMG - My wife hates me,"I'm totally at a loss for words.  Once again, my wife chose not to get me anything for my birthday - nothing.  We've been married for 27 years and I never forget her birthday.  And her gifts always cost me an arm and a leg - she has expensive tastes.  I always look forward to my birthday hoping that she actually goes out of her way and does something.  The last two years have been horrible.  So much so that I've been thinking of calling it quits after all this time.  My thinking goes as follows - if I'm not important enough for you to go out of your way and actually do something nice for me, why continue this farce?

&amp;#x200B;

What got me this year was the excuse she used. I had relatives in town and took them out over the weekend.  This left her alone to do whatever she wanted. She had an eyelash appointment on Friday and a nail appointment on Saturday.  Sunday came around and my relative had an accident that necessitated a trip to the ER that evening. She decided to go to the ER for a completely unrelated issue.  On Monday, she told me happy birthday but she didn't get me anything because everyone was too busy on Sunday. Seriously? What happened to the other 364 days she could have prepared for it? And what happened to actually making an effort on Friday or Saturday?  I was pissed - not sure if she could tell.

&amp;#x200B;

To make matters worse, on Monday she went out to a clothing store to buy new clothes.  I asked her for a simple gift card - she blew that off.  And next week she has surgery that isn't covered by insurance that I'm expected to pay.  I'm sure Father's Day will be more of the same.  I got her expensive tickets for her Mother's Day gift to see a concert in CA.  I'm already sure I'll get absolutely nothing.  It's just after all these years of giving, I'm done - this has sucked everything out of me. And I could do nothing for her special days, but then I'm riddled with guilt by her to no end.

At 5pm, I realised 70% of our cases had disappeared. Because of the seriousness of this information, we could be instantly dismissed if it got into the wrong hands. In a panic, I called him (for the first time ever in 6 months, might I add) while scrambling bits of paper and instantly shouted down the phone “MATE IVE LOST THE CASES”. Luckily, although he sent me on a wild goose chase, he remembered he had put them in his locked cabinet for tomorrow. The phone call was ended with a thanks, the phone call lasted 55 seconds. 

About half an hour later, I was bombarded with phone calls from him. I ran out of the office in a panic and picked up, where he explained that I called him about the cases at a really really bad time. A bit confused, I apologised for calling him out of hours but it was seriously urgent. 

He went onto explain that his girlfriend had since become extremely angry and accused him of having an affair with me. With his voice trembling, he said to me that I needed to speak to his girlfriend on the phone to explain who I am and why I needed to contact him, and also all evidence of emails back and forth for the last six months. I kind of laughed in disbelief and said don’t be so ridiculous, then he went completely silent and said “you have to do this for me. Please.” Instantly I went a bit cold, because I’ve never heard a mans voice tremble like that. 

I agreed to do whatever would make the situation better for him and asked if he felt like he was in danger. He hesitated, but then said “I don’t know what else to do, she’s really kicking off at me. Please don’t tell anyone about this”. I suggested to take himself away from the situation if he can and to contact a family member, friend or even the police if it felt necessary. I’m still waiting on contact from his girlfriend, but learning from personal experience of domestic abuse she will not contact me, only emotionally manipulate him into feeling like he did something wrong. 

He is a really relaxed, happy guy at work so to hear him frightened and manic has made me extremely concerned. 

What do I say when she calls? Do I send her every single email for the last six months? Do I try to talk to him tomorrow at work about it? Do I stay away from his personal situation and mind my own business?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bztvg2/i_25f_urgently_called_my_colleague_28m_about_a/,relationship_advice,4009,564,0.0

He messages her every day and she is not stopping it - we got in a fight after seeing what seemed like an inappropriate text from him.,"This is an update to a post I made a few days ago please follow the link to get the history. it is not long :)

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bz2vyd/me\_30\_m\_with\_my\_gf\_27f\_has\_a\_new\_guy\_friend\_he/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bz2vyd/me_30_m_with_my_gf_27f_has_a_new_guy_friend_he/)

&amp;#x200B;

So to bring everyone up to speed on the last post: A new guy friend messages my GF everyday - goodnight / good morning / or chatting about mountain bikes, etc.. It has been a month and I am feeling uncomfortable about it. I am thinking he has a crush on her, and maybe she likes the attention. she doesn't seem to be telling him to stopWhat do I do?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, tonight we got in quite a fight, we are currently broken up.

Last night I saw messages pop up on her phone from ""steve"" and again this morning, and again this afternoon and again tonight. The last one I saw said what are you doing tonight. sent at 8pm. My gf and I were watching a movie (the newest black mirror episode), when this message came in. She turned her phone over and proceeded to ignore it. I went to get some ice packs from the freezer to help with my spinal pain and injury I am dealing with and when I went back into bed out of the corner of my eye I see her texting him and she quickly minimizes the message screen so I can not read anything. She then leaves the room to go to the bathroom. and do not judge me for this, I have never done it in my life, but i opened her phone and saw his messages to her. They read,

Steve - "" how was your mountain bike ride?""

GF-""good SO Sweaty!""

Steve - ""haha nice how is cali? "" (her dog got stung by a bee)

GF - ""lol she is a little swollen""

Steve- ""o no :(""

GF- ""but getting better ""

Steve - ""well thats good :)""

Steve- 8pm ""what are you up to tonight"" followed by no answer cause we were watching a movie,

Steve - 9:09 pm ""I better get some this time""

&amp;#x200B;

as soon as I saw that my heart sank, I had crippling anxiety, My worst nightmare.. she came back into the room and I said, we need to have a talk and brought the whole issue I have with this guy texting her everyday. Only people that are true friends talk to you this much, I have never met this guy, and it seems like he never asks about me, and you never tell me about him. I then said I saw a message pop up from steve saying ""I better get some tonight"" - She doesnt know I saw the whole conversation. My GF said he was talking about muffins she had baked a few days ago. Funny thing is there is no mention in the conversation about muffins, nothing at all. So how would she know he is refering to that.

&amp;#x200B;

I left her place shortly after and I have been crying and struggling all night, a few hours later I get a text from her going on the attack, saying I really know how to ruin a good night, I make her feel like shit when she feels like she has to defend herself and her friend. As it stands consider us broken up. I told her she should be sticking up for me not him.

&amp;#x200B;

I really would like to know, am I being completely crazy for over reacting to this? or should I have complete trust in her? or did I make the right call?

sounds really dumb, but it hurts to much to lose someone you love.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr : New guy friend messages my GF everyday - goodnight / good morning / or chatting about mountain bikes, etc.. It has been a month and a half and I am feeling uncomfortable about it. I am thinking he has a crush on her, and maybe she likes the attention. I saw what seems like an inappropriate text and my GF is defending him and attacking me for looking at the message. Am I being an over protective controlling Boyfriend? OR is this the right call?

lilstoopidboi,2019-06-11 16:52:10+00:00,My (23 M) girlfriend (23 F) is taking it too far with her anime Discord group,"I'm really frustrated, confused, grossed out, and hurt by this situation. I don't even know where to begin. fuck.

Just as some background, my girlfriend and I started dating during our senior year in college. That was over 2 1/2 years ago. We've known each other since freshman year.

She's always been super into anime, which I think is great. I liked a few animes here and there, so it was cool to talk to her about them. However, within the past year, she joined a discord group after Tumblr pretty much killed itself. She used Tumblr to browse fan art and talk with other people about her favorite shows.

I've never been a fan of this idea since DMs always have a slippery slope, but I trusted her and didn't think much of it after she first told me. These past couple of months though, she's gotten a lot more possessive/secretive of her phone. She used to leave it laying around, or would leave it in the bedroom when she showered. Now she takes it EVERYWHERE at anytime of day. Again, whatever, this shouldn't be a big deal but I notice that she's always chatting on discord.

This morning, my suspicion got the best of me and I took a look at her discord after she left for work (her laptop was left open). A lot of it was harmless. The group shared their day to day lives in a harmless way, but their names were fucking weird. Like one was ""(Video game character) fucker"", and other names including various body parts. There was this NSFW part of the group chat, as well as this role playing chat. I saw that my gf sent messages like ""when's dinner daddy, I'm hungry. *Opens mouth and stares at (person in chat).*"" On top of that, they share erotica fan fic and talk about how horny they are together. And to top it all off, the group chat is called tiny boy BDSM, or something like that. I was so fucking grossed out, and it was hard to see that my gf was talking about how 15 year old anime characters made her (and the rest of the group) horny.

She has private DMs with others in the group where they talk about how much they care for each other and have private conversations about how horny they are for their anime. One person said ""I have more private info on other channels"" to which my gf called ""lunchtime"" so I imagine their taking their behavior elsewhere on the internet. But to be honest, I don't give a fuck about that. I've seen enough.


I don't know what to fucking do. Am I overreacting? Can I talk to her about this? What will we do if we break up? We share an apartment in the city, where prices continue to exponentially rise. We can't afford to live on our own. I know breaking up would be just as financially hard for her as it would be for me.

I have to see her after work today and I don't know what I'm going to do or say. Fuck this shit man.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bzexrj/my_23_m_girlfriend_23_f_is_taking_it_too_far_with/,relationship_advice,7846,1005,0.0

Well, we had a housewarming party that got a bit bigger than we expected, with some friends of friends we didn't know showing up. More than 20 people in total. We suspect the bedbugs came from someone at the party. We've had them for more than a week now.

My girlfriend refuses to cooperate in getting rid of them. Because she doesn't believe it's okay to do so. I'd always known she was a very compassionate person and truly views all living things as precious and important, volunteers for a few humanitarian causes like animal shelters and loves nature. But I didn't know it went this far, that eradicating pests like this is wrong. This is very extreme to me.

Meanwhile, we are getting eaten alive every night and they just keep multiplying. I'm out of patience, I've asked her many times how she can stand living with this, she just says it's ""annoying"" but she couldn't bring herself to intentionally kill anything. Even a fucking bedbug.

Today I decided I was done with this bullshit. I called an exterminator and scheduled an appointment for tomorrow. When I told her, she flipped. I said I didn't care what she thought, she could help me pack up everything to prepare or not but it was happening. Then once I went to work, she cancelled it behind my back! She texted me to tell me. She said she doesn't want to fight with me, that we should be able to ""live in harmony with each other and other creatures""!!! She also said she's really stressed due to our disagreement about it, but I'm stressed from having the bedbugs!

Now I'm about to go home to our infested apartment and confront her. Please help. I feel like my life has turned into some realm of insanity. How do I make her understand that the pest control needs to happen??

3 months ago, my dad was diagnosed with cancer, and asked us to move back home to help out with the day to day and have also been helping financially. We both have low earning professions, and have been doing our best to be helpful. Most days, we are pretty tired by the end of the night, once everything is done and my parents are asleep.

We don’t make enough to pay for hotel stays, and it’s illegal to do it in a car where I’m from. To top it off my husband has said he doesn’t feel comfortable in my parents home.  We’ve had sex once since moving in a month and a half ago. And it wasn’t good sex. It was awkward. 
I know that sex isn’t everything in a relationship, but as I’ve said to my husband, I feel like I have become more of a best friend than a wife.

I debated on whether or not to post this, since on the original post I was bombarded with hate and threatening PMs (including a doxx threat). However, a few people gave some really solid and helpful advice, so this update is for them.


I posted last Friday afternoon. On Fridays, my girlfriend gets off work at 10pm. I told her sister to come over around 9:45pm because we were going to tell her the truth. She agreed and I waited. The anxiety I felt was tremendous but I just kept reminding myself that this was all my fault and nobody else but me made that mistake.

When sister didn't arrive by 10, I knew something was up. My suspensions were confirmed when they walked in the house together at 10:15. They sat me down and explained the situation.

Sister had come clean to girlfriend, and after a brief quarrel and anger, they decided to fuck with me to see how long i would keep the secret for. Props to them, because I was completely blindsided.

Girlfriend (now ex- girlfriend) was very calm and has sister pack her a bag to stay with her. I told her my friends and I would bring her belongings and furniture anywhere they need me to. She told me she didn't want me touching her stuff and she would be moved out when I get home from work on Monday.

Lostlostlosthelpme,2019-06-08 13:33:21+00:00,"My [19F] boyfriend [19M] called me ""a walking stereotype"" because of a dance I did at this event.","This golf club his family is part of had an event. Not only did his family go, but extended family and family friends went too.

I was sitting at a table with his family. It was a nice event, but I was not the target demographic of the music that was being played. Which was okay, I still did a polite nod and smile when his parents told me about ""real music"".

Then some throwback music was being played, but it was music I was unfamiliar with (90's rock). Then they played a classic New Edition song I loved. I took my boyfriend to the dance floor and we had a lot of fun. I was already on the dance-floor when SOMEHOW a Snoop Dogg song came on. 

My dad put me on a lot of OG rappers of the west coast. We are in no way and never have been affiliated with any gangs. I have never touched a drug in my life. But when Snoop comes on, you crip-walk. It's like the cha-cha slide in our house. So I did. It was fun, the younger people were going crazy and trying to do it. 

Honestly, I love getting a chance to crip-walk because it's silly and I'm really good at it. I also throw in other dance moves in there too. But that's all it is, an old dance move with my spin to it.

When the song was done, I went over to my boyfriends table. His dad asked where I learned how to dance like that. I told him about my dad. My boyfriend looked really upset and I asked him what was wrong. He said he was fine.  We texted, got up in a bit and went outside the hall to talk.

He was calm at first, but I could tell he was irritated. He said I need to be aware of how others see me and not purposefully do shit to make things worse. I asked him what he was talking about. He his family already knows about where I live and I should have been on ""my best behaviour"". But I was a ""walking stereotype"" instead.

I realized what he was talking about and got upset. I said I was just dancing. He got mad and said I embarrassed him in front of everyone he knows and basically told his family my dad was a gang member. He said I made myself look like one.

He said I'm supposed to fight stereotypes not feed into them. Especially if I demand respect. I can't act classless.

But I was just dancing, others were attempting to crip-walk too. This doesn't include all the younger people trying to do the ""thotiana"" shit. I asked why it's an issue when I did it. He said I know why.

I told him I was going home. 

He asked me to go back inside and forget about it. I told him that I wanted to go home. Especially if I'm an embarrassment. He was apologizing and said that's not what he meant. I really could see the regret in his face.

He offered to at least drop me off and I told him I'll get an uber. He wouldn't drop the idea of driving me home and kept insisting. I said that he didn't want to be ""in a classless, gangster traphouse."" He told me not to be like that and that's not what he meant.

I told him we could talk the next day, but I was leaving. He tried following me out, but I did raise my voice and tell him to leave me alone. I feel bad for raising my voice, but no one was around and he wasn't leaving me alone. 

I'm upset and hurt. But I think he did have a point. I do see where I made a mistake, it wasn't a good idea to crip-walk at golf club, but younger people were doing all types of dance. But the dance I did have a gang name in it. I did need to be more aware of my surroundings. 

He wants to talk about what happened now, but I just need to clear my head first before going in.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/by80h0/my_19f_boyfriend_19m_called_me_a_walking/,relationship_advice,10546,1441,0.0
toughsituation200,2019-06-07 14:11:22+00:00,"UPDATE: I (21M) got my FWB (33F) pregnant and she's keeping it, I want to talk to her about other options.","This is the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bhfi57/_/

Well some time has passed.. And a lot has happened. My first post had a lot of comments and I got some PM's from people asking me what went down so that's why I'm updating.

So I didn't end up talking about abortion or anything like that because I realized it was pointless and rather insensitive. I didn't talk to her for 3 days, which she got a little upset about and I shouldn't have done that. But I needed some time to figure things out and think, because whatever I was going to decide would change my life so I needed some space, though I could have communicated a bit more (which I'm working on now).

Anyways, I realized that I'm just straight up ridiculously in love with her and have been for a while. I was stuck on the age gap, I kinda blocked the word relationship in my mind when I thought of her. Some comments really stuck with me and I decided to just trust my feelings. I ended up confessing my love for her when we finally met up and well lots of (happy) tears were shed. She was too scared to talk about her feelings because she knew how I felt about the age gap and she didn't want to make me uncomfortable. I'm very glad to say that she feels the same way. She completely lit up when I told her, I saw the joy and happiness in her eyes. She was ecstatic, I won't ever forget that. 

Every minute we've spent with each other since has been amazing. I really do love this woman, there's just no way around it. We talked so much with each other the past couple of weeks and I don't understand how it has all been so amazing. I know we're probably still sort of in a honeymoon phase right now, but damn if she isn't the one.. I moved in with her almost 2 weeks ago, I had to do some adjusting at first but we worked through it. She has met my parents, that went surprisingly well actually. They got along really well, and they both told me that they could see why we were together and that we are a great fit. On top of that they both told me in private how much they like her, that has never happened with any girl I've introduced them to. The pregnancy came as a big shock however, and they needed some time to process it because well, they're going to be grandparents. I'm an only child so it's a pretty big deal, I'm really close with my parents. They are handling it right now, they asked a lot of questions and we answered them together. They fully support us now which does mean a lot to me.

She's in the last week of the first trimester now, and she's doing really well so far. I've been trying to help her and support her any way I can, and did a TON of reading online to understand what's going on. I offered to pause school for one year, but she insists we can make it work and that I can keep going. We need to work out the details but we got some time left for that.

So yeah... I'm going to a dad. She's gonna give birth to our kid.. Still feels surreal to me, but I'm low-key kinda excited. It'll probably be very exhausting and hard at first but that's life. I'm happy that I'm doing this together with her. 

(any tips on how to support her during her pregnancy are welcome btw..)",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bxv2jc/update_i_21m_got_my_fwb_33f_pregnant_and_shes/,relationship_advice,26429,3645,0.0
RainGoddess22,2019-06-05 17:26:50+00:00,My husband has unrealistic and unhealthy attitudes about sex from watching too much porn,"We (21f and 28m) had an arranged marriage eight months ago. There's no proper sex education here in India but there's free and easy access to internet porn. I don't think porn is necessarily bad, but it's not reality 

A week after we got married, we went on an island honeymoon, I had forgotten to bring my razor to trim bikini line stubble so I asked him if he had a razor i could borrow. He asked ""what for?"" and I said so I can shave my underarms and bikini line. He looked confused then said ""but women are not supposed to have hair there"" I thought he was joking but he was serious so I had to explain to a 28 year old man that adult women really do have underarm and public hair. He was making me feel like a freakshow because I had hair on my private parts. We hadn't had sex by then, usually I just trim pubic hair, but felt pressured to shave because he seemed so offended by it

When we had sex for the first time, it was painful for me. We both had no idea what we were doing . He didn't do any foreplay - we made out for two minutes and then he went straight to penetration. I wasn't relaxed or lubricated enough so it hurt and I was crying and moaning in pain. Afterwards I asked him why he didn't stop when I was in pain, he said ""oh I thought you were enjoying it. You sounded just like those women in the porn videos"" . Then he went on to tell me that ""sex is supposed to hurt for women"" which is apparently why the porn women are always moaning/screaming. It was disturbing to me that he couldn't tell the difference between moans of pain and pleasure 

When I gave him blowjobs, he would hold my head down on his dick. I would push his hand away but it took him a long time to unlearn that. I had to get on top of him, sit on his thighs and hold his wrists down while going down on him, to stop him.  He would never return favour either. I think he felt entitled to blowjobs because in porn they mostly show that and not oral sex on women. When I told him that I needed pleasure too, ""you get pleasure from going down on me, right?"". Yes, because I have a clitoris in my throat (sarcasm)

Recently, I was on my period and suggested we try anal since I had a menstrual cup in. It's always been an erotic zone for me . He said ""why do you want that? anal is ....  punishment"" . I said ""excuse me? what are you talking about?"" He then proceeds to take out his phone and show me his guys only WhatsApp group from work and then there's porn gifs of anal sex in reference to this indian journalist that they hate. I grabbed his phone and scrolled through it, it was so toxic and demeaning, I removed him from the group.

A few other things have happened too. All his thoughts/beliefs of sex is directly from porn which makes me sad. 

I try to tell him and teach him as much as I can from a female perspective but it's so frustrating. It's depressing... he's been watching porn since he was 10 years old. I wonder if he can really unlearn it.   I know he still watches it when I'm not around for a few days",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bx59iq/my_husband_has_unrealistic_and_unhealthy/,relationship_advice,2799,366,0.0

I got out my pen and paper and started to write my note. But, then I got a text from my best friend.

She was just texting to ask how my day was going. She knows I suffer from depression and wanted to make sure I was OK. It's like she knew what I was going to do, even though she had no idea.

And just like that, all thoughts of ending it left me. It's like it just melted away. I realised that I can't kill myself, because I know that she would blame herself. She's that kind of person.

daisychaingirl93,2019-06-03 21:07:45+00:00,UPDATE: my mother (50F) asked me to travel home to wake up my brother (15M) for school,"An update on this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bvwtbq/my_mother_50f_asks_me_20f_to_travel_home_to_wake/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

Hi everyone, 
I’ve had a lot of comments and messages since I posted this yesterday and I really am so grateful for the support everyone’s given me. I’ve looked into the golden child/scapegoat dynamic and narcissism in general and it definitely sounds a lot like my family dynamic, especially regarding my mother. 

To clarify a few questions, we are from a white British/Irish background and no, my brother has no symptoms of having any kind of condition or additional needs, autism included. 

Today I spoke to my mum on the phone and it didn’t go well. We made small talk for a while and I asked about how she was and how my grandad was (who’s unwell), and then mentioned my boyfriends cat suddenly died. She laughed and said it was ironic that I cared about that more than I cared about her. At this point I was shocked and asked her what she meant. She basically went on to say I was being selfish and that I didn’t care about her or the family, that I was blaming my brother when he had done nothing wrong and that everything I was saying was all about ‘me, me, me’. She said she would call my brother Wednesday morning to make sure he’s up, which I then said I would do (in the hopes it would diffuse the situation). She said this was unnecessary and it was pointless now, the damage was done. I got angry and said I was frustrated, I didn’t know what I could to do help but I didn’t think I was in the wrong for simply being unavailable to do something my brother is perfectly capable of doing himself. 

At this point she got exceptionally angry and said I better stop talking otherwise she’d say some things she regret, and proceeded to reiterate how much she does for me that she doesn’t want to do and that if we love someone we drop everything for them and do what we can to help them. I basically said I had agreed to help initially when I would be coming home Wednesday evening, but then when plans changed to coming home the night before it made things very impractical for me regarding my volunteering and seeing my boyfriend. 

All she did was repeat how selfish I was, that she hadn’t raised me to behave like this and that she doesn’t know what’s gotten into me. She said I’m 20 now so I should be able to sort myself out, implying she was going to cut me off and not let me back home. I stood my ground and said that 15 is old enough to wake yourself up and make yourself breakfast. She said that it’s not the principle of the matter anymore, it’s that ‘it’s not what you think about it, but the fact that you should do it anyway’, that I ‘always choose to make things about me whenever she has a rough time’. She said she wasn’t speaking to me anymore and hung up, so perhaps stupidly, I called my dad. 

He just said how important it was that I say I’m sorry and that I’m wrong even if I don’t believe it, as that’s what he does to keep the peace, that I was in no place to criticise their parenting of my brother and that they ask so little of me I should always help when I can. I pointed out the time I had cancelled plans to walk my brother 15 minutes home from the bus stop, but it didn’t make a difference. I said I won’t say I’m in the wrong when I’m not, and he even agreed my solution for my brother to just wake himself up was easier, even though he was disappointed I hadn’t come over the night before. 

He said ‘we all have to do things we don’t want to do, like now your brother has to wake himself up when you could be here to do that for him’. He didn’t know that I had agreed to come over on the Wednesday evening or that I had offered to ring my brother on the Wednesday morning- it seems my mum just told him I was refusing to help and that I had said I was ‘too busy for them’. I explained I hadn’t said that and that I’d simply stated the practical reasons I couldn’t help (even though I know some people said this was a bad idea, something about JADE, I was panicking and was trying to get my side of the story heard). 

Long story short, he told me to not contact either of them over the next few days until it all blows over. I said it sounded like my mum didn’t even want me home anymore even though I move back this weekend, and he just said he’d talk to her. Sorry if this was a bit rambly and in-concise, I’m still reeling from it all. 

TLDR: my parents have said I’m being selfish and that they’re disappointed in me for not travelling to wake my brother up. They’ve said it’s the principle of the matter that I won’t drop everything to help them, when they do the same for me, even though I’m mostly independent. They pointed out how much they do for me that they don’t want to do (no examples) and that I shouldn’t contact them for the next few days. My mum implied I wasn’t welcome back home and said she doesn’t know what’s gotten into me as she didn’t raise me to be like this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bwg1n4/update_my_mother_50f_asked_me_to_travel_home_to/,relationship_advice,1138,225,0.0

&amp;#x200B;

I'm losing my mind. I posted Friday about what happened previously. I will include the original content for people to read below. I need perspective and people's opinion on where to go from here. The whole wedding is fractured.

&amp;#x200B;

After I posted my thread, I got a lot of great advice and suggestions. At around 5-something, I was hungry and went out to grab some dinner and come home. I got home and my future FIL was in the parking lot. He saw me and asked to talk. He brought a cigar and beer so we chatted. He had no idea what happened and wanted to hear it from me. I told him the whole thing but refused to show him pictures. By this point I had a lot of the photos and they were pretty rough. My FIL drank a beer, left me the rest and I ate dinner and smoked. He said he'd call later, so I turned my phone on. I had dozens and dozens of calls, maybe 100+ texts and WhatsApp messages, FB messages and emails. I sifted through them through dinner and finally got an email from my future FIL. Short and to the point. His daughter is sorry, she's a horrible mess and is going to stay with him. He's disappointed in her, her friends and this situation, to take time but to please consider forgiving her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right around 10 two of the Bride's Maids show up. They're knocking at the door and they want to talk. I let them in and we chat. They immediately start pointing the finger at the Maid of Honor, that she was the person that planned this and that they thought they were going to just have a ""girls night out."" The toplessness was a joke on the ""girls out"" and they didn't know that a stripper was coming. They had apparently had something to eat, drank a ton, went to one of the other bride's maids house and were getting changed to go to a club and were all wasted. They confirmed that my fiancée was by far the drunkest and both confirmed that the stripper did indeed touch her below the belt. Fiancée was obliterated drunk and did verbally stop him after he touched her *there*. After that, people got uncomfortable (the stripper was totally naked.....) and they left. My fiancée sobered up somewhat after water and some time between drinks and then immediately began boozing again at the bar/club which is when they plunked her in a chair. 

&amp;#x200B;

The bride's maids left at around 11 and I thanked them for telling me the truth. They felt that my fiancée had been too drunk to do much and that they were all surprised the stripper showed up. They all said it was the Maid of Honor who organized this and asked me to just talk with my fiancée. I wasn't in the mood but texted her not to engage my parents, I didn't want them involved with this and that she should keep them out of it and we'd talk. That opened the gates and she texted me on/off most of the night. I finally agreed to meet her the next morning. It was awkward, neither of us knew exactly what to say. She was crying and wanted a hug. 

&amp;#x200B;

We sat down and she basically apologized for everything, took responsibility and said that she was sorry for what happened. She agreed that she was too drunk, should have excused herself or stopped drinking and didn't know a stripper would be coming. She said that everyone was topless and she explained that there was some dancing, the stripper did his show and then pushed her on the bed and inserted her finger. She said no, he quickly removed it and no one knew what to do. MOH danced with him a bit more, then their time was up and he left. I asked about the photos and MOH and another bride's maid took photos, the MOH took the finger sniffing photo. I asked who else has photos of the event and she doesn't know but hopes MOH doesn't ""use them"" for any sort of revenge. 

&amp;#x200B;

I told her I understood but was hurt and horrified. She indicated that she talked to her father and then her MoH who basically turned on fiancée and said she did her a favor, etc. They aren't talking and as a gesture, fiancée will remove her from the wedding and we'll just have an off-balance of people in the wedding party. She hadn't slept so after a while she went to go sleep and I went and ran errands. 

&amp;#x200B;

We basically kept to ourselves on Saturday. On Sunday she made me breakfast and crawled into bed with me. I had to be clear that I'm still really upset and told her that I'm hurt, I'm disappointed, I'm not ""just over it."" She said she understood but wouldn't let this ""come between us."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting to feel bad that I'm not somehow over it and I'm not sure if I should just drop this whole thing. In the past, my fiancée has been a solid person, she's not the kind to get drunk or would have ever done something like this. I have a business trip coming up shortly that she is slated to travel with me for. She's packing her bags and looking to go. I'm not sure what to do. To recap:

&amp;#x200B;

1. She's completely and unreservedly apologized
2. She is removing the Maid of Honor from the wedding 
3. Her friends and family think this indiscretion is a one-off and to work through it 
4. She should still come on the business trip I'm going to.

&amp;#x200B;

I need perspective. I feel like a whirlwind has knocked me back and I'm not sure what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

The orginal post: 

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been with my fiancée for going on 4 years. We got engaged a little over a year ago and were going to put a rush on the wedding because her mother was sick. Her mom had smoked for a long time, quit, picked it back up, and then developed cancer. To look at her mom, you’d never suspect she was a smoker, but had picked up the habit. Her mother grew too ill for a wedding so the idea of putting one together quickly faded and instead a couple of months ago, she passed. My fiancée was devastated to lose her mom at such a young age. I offered to postpone the wedding but she really wanted to move forward with it and took to planning.

We agreed that we weren’t too interested in bachelor/bachelorette parties and instead decided we’d do something low key. Her Maid of Honor approached me about doing something more “substantive” for fiancée as she lost her mom not too long ago. I thought it was a good idea. I arranged for dinner/drinks and fun with my groomsmen. The Best Man (my brother) and my best friend booked a steakhouse and then arranged for drinks at a nice place afterwards. They bought me a nice cigar for the lounge and we had a tremendous time.

Fiancée was texting me and then her phone died. She was out incredibly late – her friends said they packed it in around 5 AM and then slept most of the morning and hate a late lunch rather than brunch. When she got home she was still hungover and basically laid in bed and drank Gatorade instead of doing anything. The Saturday and Sunday were pretty much a write-off. She was that hungover. I asked her about it and she kept saying she pretty much has no recollection after a certain point. Her friends said something similar, that she was so obliterated after like 3 AM that they carried her to a friend’s brother’s bar where they hung out while my fiancée sipped booze while splayed in a chair.

Things were fine until last night when she asked me to find something on her phone. I noticed a message come through saying my name, so yes, I snooped. It said “I also hope \[my real name\] doesn’t find out.” I scroll up and it’s a nightmare. This afternoon, my fiancée texts her Maid of Honor saying that she hasn’t been that drunk “in a long time” and her friend follows up with “I know” and a series of photos – my wife and her friends in a room – most of the women are topless, including my fiancée, and there’s a stripper. Fiancée responds “oh god. Can we not.” And another photo follows with the *stripper kissing her neck* while her friends are topless, holding booze and obviously acting poorly. Fiancee texts “I feel bad because \[my real name\] had such a tame night. He’s such a good boy. I hope he doesn’t find out.” That’s when MoH responds: “I also hope \[my real name\] doesn’t find out” and by this point has added “he’d leave you.” During their night out, someone must have used her phone to take photos to commemorate her little dalliance, because there must have been another half dozen photos on her phone. The worst being what looks like my topless fiancée laying on the bed with her friends around her and a naked stripper smelling his finger. I was horrified.

I didn’t know what to do and didn’t want to come out and say I snooped so I tried to get her to talk about the evening. I told her about our evening. She deflected, said she was drunk, and that she never needs to be drunk again and then says something how she’s not at all jealous of her single friends and can’t wait to get married. We’re getting married ***in four weeks***. I couldn’t take it and told her I knew. She freaked out and at first got mad that I snooped but then realized the gravity of the situation. She began to apologize and hid behind being drunk. I didn’t accept that and she started crying. I went to another room to cool off and I guess she texted her friend because I received a flurry of texts telling me that it was a mistake and nothing happened. After a few hours of arguing, fiancée tells me that they went to someone’s house where they all got obliterated and a stripped arrived. They decided to take their tops off and have fun. The stripper did his thing and kissed my fiancée’s neck and chest and attempted to touch her genitals but she stopped him. They tipped him and he left. I didn’t handle it well and basically said that it didn’t really matter at the end of the day and that the wedding was off. She looked stunned. I threw some clothes into a bag and told her to leave. To my surprise she left.  Her Maid of Honor texted me that I’m an asshole and I replied asking how much of the money I contributed towards their night went to a stripper putting the moves on my fiancée? I haven’t heard from her since.

I took the day off work and had to turn my phone off. My fiancée has texted evert 3 or 4 minutes. Her father called/texted and then sent me a long email. I checked my phone again about 6 minutes ago and it's non-stop texts from a bunch of people. No one on my side of the family knows. My fiancée is saying she'll do anything, she wants to come home, she's sorry. Her father texted me again to please call him and her friends added me to a WhatsApp group that basically outlines the whole night, their indiscretion and is telling me that she's sorry/they're sorry that she was too drunk and that I'm an asshole for not talking to them.

I know I eventually have to say something. I don't know what to say or to whom. I don't even know how to handle this. Not in a million years would I have EVER thought my fiancée would do something like this. She's the most stable, earnest, nice and straightforward person ever. I don't understand it. I don't know what to do here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bwe40d/fiancée_27f_went_too_far_at_bachelorette_party_i/,relationship_advice,1101,1038,0.0
forevermyfault,2019-06-02 17:38:20+00:00,It’s my[40M] fault my wife [37F] killed herself and now I’m reminded of her everyday through our kids and cruel messages.,"Sorry if this post doesn’t seem to fit on here. I am new to reddit and I was told by a very close friend that this is how she stayed sane through her partners infidelity. I will try and keep this short with as much detail as possible and advice would be helpful. 

My wife committed suicide 2 years ago, one of the biggest reasons for this is because of my infidelity. I had an emotional affair with her best friend for over a year. My wife and I were together for 20 years, we were both each other’s first with sex, holidays, living together you name it we did it all together. We had three children together, 2 boys and a girl. We had the most incredible relationship, we were each other’s best friends, we didn’t have many big arguments before the kids, we did everything to keep each other happy. We only ever thought about each other. 

My wife was the most beautiful woman I had ever met, the way her eyes glistened and her smile was incredible. After all the time we had spent together she was still the only one who kept me sane and every time I looked at her it felt like my heart was glowing. She was truly the most incredible woman. Everything about her and everything that happened with her was perfect. 

After 5 years together we had our first child, after 7 years we welcomed our wonderful second child and on our 10 year anniversary she told me we was expecting a third. Unfortunately, at the time we was expecting our third, she had told me that it was not my child and that she had a random one night stand one night while I was away for work and she had gone out with her friends while her mum looked after our children. I was absolutely distraught. My heart had broke and I couldn’t believe she would do this. However. I am a firm believer that people can change and that sometimes even the best of people can make a mistake. I forgave her. We talked about it and I understood her point of view she had only ever been with me, didn’t have a crazy teenage life and we had children rather young so she hadn’t experienced much of life. Even though I shouldn’t have forgiven her I did and for a couple of years things were incredible, it was like it used to be. We watched our children grow up through school, took them on holiday, started driving lessons with our eldest, had family dinners and did a lot of things together. 

But for some reason, after 15 years together she started getting some rather strange trust issues with me. She was accusing me of cheating and broke up with me maybe once every 3 months or so because of my ‘strange’ behaviour, I must say that at this point I wasn’t doing anything wrong it was only after 18 year anniversary that I had betrayed her. After a rough 3 years, we had no sex life, she had practically stopped any contact at all we wouldn’t text, eat together, have phone calls, sit next to each other. In general I felt like a house guest rather than a partner. 

She had a new friend, she was younger, she was 27 and I was 36, they had met at work and one night she came round for dinner with her partner and me and her hit it off. We had some kind of chemistry just from looking at one another, I did not pursue this. I was messaged by her friend first and from there we hit it off, we were messaging in secret, and I quite genuinely believe we fell in love over time. 

After a year of back and forth messages, my wife had found out. She couldn’t believe I had done this and that she loved me so much. This was heart breaking because the moment I saw her crying I felt nothing, no sadness, no remorse, nothing at all. It was almost as if I had lost every feeling for my wife after all this time. I couldn’t apologise all I did was blame her for driving me to this and that I wanted to avenge her somehow for what she had put me through. She told me to leave so I stormed out and met my wife’s friend in which on this one occasion we engaged in sexual intercourse. 

After I had calmed down, I needed to go home to pick up my stuff and make sure my wife was ok. When I got home the kids weren’t home, they had gone to their grandmas as I soon found out on a note left on the downstairs coffee table. I walked upstairs and there she was. * TRIGGER ⚠️ WARNING* she had hung herself. I will never to this day forget her face and I broke down. My heart shattered and I couldn’t face what I had just done to her. She had cuts on her arms, legs from where she had self harmed and she was just hanging there. This was the most traumatic experience of my life and I can’t seem to type any more of what happened right now my head is reliving this day. 

The post mortem determined that she had high traces of Tylenol in her system, and the doctor said this hadn’t succeeded so she must have tried self harming and then when all else failed hung herself. 

Skip 2 years later, the kids haven’t been in contact with me because they believe I murderer their mother and I receive messages from them on a daily basis telling me they wish it was me instead. 

I have no idea what to do, I can’t unlive this day and what I did. I just wish I could go back and change what I did and it would all be different. 

I know this is a tragic story and the majority of you will believe it is my fault but if you could please offer me some advice on how to fix my relationship with my children and how to move forward this would be greatly appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bvzyat/its_my40m_fault_my_wife_37f_killed_herself_and/,relationship_advice,1212,509,0.0
daisychaingirl93,2019-06-02 12:23:10+00:00,My mother (50F) asks me (20F) to travel home to wake up my teenage brother (15M),"Hi everyone,

This morning I was yelled at down the phone by my mother for refusing to travel 1 hour home and back to wake my 15 year old brother up for school. She has always babied and coddled him, to the point where he is 16 this year and she still puts his socks on for him, brings all his meals and snacks to him and makes zero attempt to help him mature. He is never left home alone, she tells him what to do and when, and both of my parents lives revolve around him. He does not know how to boil a kettle, and has never done anything independently. If he doesn't want to do something, he will have a tantrum. I would like to point out that he has no learning difficulties or anything like that that would explain this. He has just not grown up. My birthday day out to London was cancelled because he didn't want to go, and I was called selfish as a result. I am 20, I've been living away from home at university one city away for about 2 years now.  

Previously, she has asked me to come home from university to walk my brother 15 minutes home from school, at 4pm, along a route he has done 1000x before. Yesterday, she called me to ask if I would come home from uni on Wednesday to put my brother's dinner on as she is going to a funeral. A sad event, but of a relative she rarely sees who is very old and died naturally. I am not saying she shouldn't go to the funeral, just that it was not out of the blue. She had been preparing for this for a while. I said I wasn't happy about it, but I didn't have plans that day, so fine. 

This morning she calls me to say the funeral was at 9:30am so she'd be back by tea-time. I thought great, no reason for me to come home as my brother is at school. But actually she now wants me to come back Tuesday evening (late) after volunteering and a busy day. Tuesday evening is the only time I get to see my boyfriend this week, so I said no. The reason she wants me to come back is so I can wake my brother up for school Wednesday morning and make sure he locks the front door. I told her that was too much of an ask for something he can do himself, and she proceeded to call me a selfish child, and that 'we all have to do things we don't want to do' and that she has made sacrifices for me. At this point I just said I wasn't having this conversation and hung up. I then text her to explain that I don't want to come back for multiple reasons- my boyfriend, I have a busy day on Tuesday, and it's just not practical. Plus the reason she wants me to come back is ridiculous, as he is almost 16 and can easily set an alarm. I shouldn't have to travel 2 hours round-trip to wake my 16 brother up for school. 

So, am I being unreasonable? I understand she is going to a funeral, but surely this is unacceptable. I am a 20 year old woman with a life of her own in a completely different city. If my brother had to be left alone for days of course I would come back, or if something sudden happened. But he is almost 16, and will literally be at school for most of the day they want me back. He should be able to wake himself up for one day, get himself breakfast and walk out the door- he gets picked up by someone else's mum before school.

Any advice at all would help. 

TLDR: My mum is going to a funeral on Wednesday and wants me to travel a 2 hour round trip to wake my 15F brother up for school. She has a history of babying him and I'm a university student with my own life in a different city. Am I wrong to say no and that he should just set an alarm seeing as I have other plans?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bvwtbq/my_mother_50f_asks_me_20f_to_travel_home_to_wake/,relationship_advice,13263,1908,0.0
milkchocolatw,2019-06-02 07:59:35+00:00,My (27M) girlfriend (26F) played a prank on me and is upset that I yelled at her,"I was sleeping over at my girlfriend’s house and she suddenly woke me up at 3 am with this alarm sound blaring like “that’s the fire alarm, we have to get out, hurry up,” I was half asleep and fucking freaked out and ran outside. And when we were in her backyard, she showed me the alarm sound. It was from her fucking iPhone, the loud fire alarm sounding one. No I didn’t realize it sounded fake, I was asleep and thought we were gonna burn in a fire. I yelled at her because I had to wake up for work at 5 and she ruined my sleep and it was just a fucking random and pointless prank. We play around sometimes but this was unprompted. 

She got quiet and said sorry and I thought she felt bad so I didn’t push it and we went back inside. I then left to work a few hours later and texted her after if I should come over. She said no and I asked her why and said I wanted to see her because I missed her and I tried sending her some dirty texts and she texted exactly this:

“No because you hurt my feelings. You did not have to yell at me like that. It was a joke and I thought you would find it funny and you blew up like an insane person. You are a psycho and I’m honestly scared of you now. Please don’t come over. Good night”

B00TH-LOVE,2019-06-02 01:25:26+00:00,My girlfriend(F22) looked at my parent’s banking information.,"For a little more information, my girlfriend started a job as a teller six months ago at the bank my parents have used for nearly 20 years. I(22M) stopped using the bank in question several months before my girlfriend got the job and before we were together. 

Last week she told me she had looked at several accounts my parents have at the bank. I was a little uncomfortable but understood that it was part of her job until she said she hadn’t done any business with either of my parents, had looked out of curiosity/boredom.

I immediately felt that an ethical line had been crossed and told her I felt weird about it. She didn’t feel like she’d done much wrong and the subject was dropped.

Now over the last week, she’s made multiple references to their finances, giving specific details and suggesting they should be more generous with their wealth and wanting us to travel/shop on their dime. I do not have the type of relationship with my parents for that to be realistic and feel like my girlfriend is overstepping here. 

How can I explain that it feels like she’s violating my parents privacy even though it could be part of her job?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bvs5jc/my_girlfriendf22_looked_at_my_parents_banking/,relationship_advice,1036,236,0.0
expresssf,2019-06-01 20:33:14+00:00,Update to my husband wants a white name,"Not really sure if anyone is interested but we talked it out

He felt like the baby would look 100% like me and nothing like him and he was feeling left out. He said she wouldn’t feel like his baby if she looked completely like me and had a name that I chose and that he had no part in. That’s it. He’s not racist or disgusting and doesn’t want an arab baby. So I reassured him that we have no idea how she’d even look. But I know what he means. He really had to accommodate all these years which I am so so appreciative of, he did not have to do that, he could have taken the easy way out and dumped me for someone that didn’t require so much effort. But he learned to love our foods and learned literally 5 words of Arabic to show my family and impress them with lol

And he’s not racist at all, he is an amazing guy and I’m so lucky to be with him. 

So we’re gonna find our names together. If we both agree on an “American” name, it’s fine. She really is gonna be surrounded by her arab heritage so much with our big family and everything, if a name helps him feel more connected to our baby, it’s all his. 

He apologized for dissing hummus and for acting a little childish and I apologized for being controlling and not taking his feelings and own culture into account. But we are fine, we are all made up now and I love him :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bvp7kh/update_to_my_husband_wants_a_white_name/,relationship_advice,7255,818,0.0
expresssf,2019-06-01 02:12:45+00:00,My husband wants a “white” name for our baby,"I’m Middle Eastern and my husband is white. When we started dating, I told him that my culture was a big deal for me and I wasn’t sure if we’d last since I was probably gonna be more interested in someone who had the same ethnicity and values and all that. Not only that, my parents are strict Catholics and he didn’t even know what religion he was, he said he was maybe Christian or something but he wasn’t sure. He was pretty insistent that he’d try, he chased me for a while and he took me to a middle eastern restaurant for our first date. So corny but I love him. He was really open to learning about my culture and everything, he was almost fascinated with it all. Basically, my life was My Big Fat Greek Wedding - I was partially embarrassed by everything and thought it would scare him away but he seemed to love it. 

We got married and things were going well, I’m pregnant now and we were talking about our baby. Some stuff that he said just bothered me and I wanna know if I’m crazy or was it weird? 

I have pale skin and black hair and brown eyes, but green eyes do run in my family. My husband has brown hair and green eyes. He had bleach blond hair as a baby, like the blondest baby ever and it darkened by the time he was a kid. We were talking about how our baby would look and I was teasing him that she’d definitely look like me because darker features are dominant and he has brown hair too and then he brought up how he used to be blond. So I told him how you know, my hair is pretty much black so she’s probably gonna have really dark hair, I don’t think she’ll have a blond phase. He seemed kind of upset about that because he wanted his daughter to have cute blond hair but I told him it was okay and she‘ll have green eyes like him and he was like “no I’m pretty sure she’s gonna come out looking like one of you guys” ... I told him that yeah she’s gonna look at least a little Arab. I don’t even know what that meant. I didn’t wanna ruin the mood so I just continued the talk and he seemed upset in a way. 

We started talking about baby names and he had really cute name ideas. They were nice but I asked him what he thought about the names I liked and he just blurted out “can we give her a white name? She’s my baby too”. I was not giving her “ethnic” names. I brought up American names too. I really liked Diana for example, which is Arabic and I know my family would really like that and it’s an English name too. I can’t exactly go to my parents and be like “Yeah our baby’s name is Jennifer.” Not only that, I want her name to be related to my culture. Diana doesn’t sound ethnic and its obviously not hard to pronounce or anything and she wouldn’t bullied at school. And it’s a “white” name. I thought it was the best of both worlds. I would be so open to giving her whatever American middle name he wants but our baby is gonna be 50% middle eastern and 50% white, I think she should have a first name that’s connected to both cultures. 

He just got mad and said I wasn’t taking him into consideration and he wants to choose the name since I made her look Arab and I got “my part” already. I asked him to calm down since we don’t even know how she looks and for all we know, she has blond hair and green eyes and looks nothing like me and 100% like him. He just got mad and continued on and then he was like “by the way, hummus is gross” and went to bed.

hoshiseasons,2019-06-01 00:13:39+00:00,[UPDATE] Boyfriend (26M) reveals himself to be one of the worst people on Earth because I (24F) don't like his favorite film,"[Original Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/buuxxt/me_24f_and_my_boyfriend_26m_got_into_an_argument/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

First of all, thank you to all the kind people who commented on my original post. Those who told me to stick to my guns made me feel stronger and had saved me from further years of being totally stepped on. 

Like the original post said, my boyfriend and I got into a heated argument because I, a rape survivor, was incredibly uncomfortable watching A Clockwork Orange with him. 

I had left our apartment for a few days and had some time to think. I've been with him for three years now and it is almost as if this tiny little bomb caused my whole world to blow up. I've realized how many times I've put my own feelings aside for him, how many things I have missed out on because I was busy catering to his feelings.

Yesterday, I went home so we could talk. And needless to say, it didn't go well. He was still furious with me, claiming I never care about him or his interests. I counteracted this by listing almost everything I've done for him. I asked him why he was being like this, he knows what I've been through and has always been so understanding.

Cue the real person that he is coming through. He said something along the lines of ""honestly, I was just going along with it because you seem like you needed support but I don't see the big deal."" Asking me why I couldn't just ""get over it"" because it happened ""so long ago."" (I've been assaulted three times. Once when I was ten, again at 16, and then again last year. But that's besides the point, even if it happened once a thousand years ago, it would still affect a survivor.) 

He then continued to blame me for his aggression, saying he was angry because we haven't had sex in a couple weeks. (I have bad spouts of body hatred due to my PTSD and do not like being touched when I'm in this headspace.) He advised that I maybe try going to therapy twice a week instead of just once and maybe that could help. 

I didn't know what to say or what to do. I was terrified of the man in front of me. All of this over a movie? I was shocked and hurt. So, I left. His name is on the lease so I'm not in any binds with him, thank god. I packed my shit and didn't look back. 

I'm still really shaken up. I've known him for so long and never saw this coming. It was like an immediate switch flipped on in his brain. I didn't know that man who I was talking to and I never want to again.

I'm staying at a friends place for now until I make enough to rent my own. Very thankful for my steady job and even steadier friends.

Just needed to get this off my chest I suppose. I haven't really told my friends the extent of what happened. I don't know why. Maybe I'm embarrassed. I don't know.

peachesandales,2019-05-31 17:08:07+00:00,My (19F) boyfriend (22M) was taking secret nudes and sending them to his friends group chat,"I’ve been dating this guy for about a year now. It’s not a long time, I know, but I felt like we really connected and stuff like it feels like we’ve been known each other our whole lives or something. I sound so stupid, I know. I just really trusted and loved him. A lot. I trusted him with my life. A year cmon 

I went on his phone when he was in the shower to search something up because mine was in the other room and he got some notifications of his friends group chat and they were saying stuff like she’s so hot, you’re so lucky etc so I was naturally curious and disgusted to find out that they were looking at a video of ME that my boyfriend secretly took while I was giving him a blowjob. I am pretty conservative, my parents don’t even know that I’m not a virgin, and I have sex with my boyfriend and all that but he knows I do not do pictures because I don’t want them to get out and have my reputation ruined, my parents would literally kill me. I remember him on his phone, I asked him what he was doing and he said he was just checking something and then he put it away. I never fucking thought that he was taking a video 

I feel so disgusted I can’t even describe the feeling in my stomach like I want to throw up and take a shower and rip my skin off. All these pictures and videos he’d taken of me during sex like quick blurry pictures when my back is turned or short videos like during doggy when I’m not looking at him. I just feel so fucking gross. And who sends that to their friends??? That’s so weird!!! You’re sending videos of you having sex to your “bros”, that is so fucking weird. And the other guys would throw in pictures and shit too but those girls were happily posing for the camera and seemed like they knew what was happening 

I cannot even believe he would do this to me. I was still on his phone when he came back from the shower and he quickly grabbed it from my hand and said I was invading his fucking privacy. Seriously??? Your privacy feels invaded right now??? You clueless asshole. I just started yelling at him and honestly I’m not proud of it but I started hitting him and grabbed his towel. He was acting like I was overreacting and he started hitting me back. Are you fucking serious, these guys all have videos and pictures of me and who knows who they showed them to or if they put them online or sold them for money. He started saying some bullshit how his friends think I’m so hot and they just compliment me and it’s nothing bad. And you’re not gonna believe this... he said they kept pressuring him to contribute to the group chat and he knew I was way too respectable to agree to it so he had to take the pictures and shit behind my back literally. He wasn’t even saying sorry and said it was really flattering and they all think I’m so hot  

What kind of a betrayal. I wish this bitch cheated on me or fucked my best friend or dumped me over text or something not as bad as this. I have no idea how many people have seen me naked and having sex at this point and I just wanna step out of my body and throw this one out. I feel so fucking exposed like I saw those videos, I had NO IDEA what was going on, in my head I was thinking about how much I love him and how happy I was and look at what this bitch was doing 

And he texted me afterwards saying we both lost control and we should just say sorry and move on and he’ll stop doing it. And he said he was really hurt that I’d take his towel and leave him in a vulnerable state like that and he’d be waiting for my apology. He is so fucking clueless I don’t even know what to say",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bva63k/my_19f_boyfriend_22m_was_taking_secret_nudes_and/,relationship_advice,9366,1167,0.0
Gnashingmongoose,2019-05-31 14:15:57+00:00,I'm scared I won't find anyone because of my disability,"So first of all, I'm using a throwaway because this may just sounds stupid and I don't want any of my online friends to know about my issue.

I'm 19, female. I had my tongue amputated for medical reasons when I was really young, but I'd like to avoid talking about that too much because it makes me uncomfortable. Naturally, because of this I can't speak. I know ASL &amp; BSL but not many people I know do so yeah.

I'm worried this is going to affect my chances of finding a partner. I haven't ever had a bf/gf so far, and I work out to keep myself in shape and feel pretty confident in my looks. So, my main method of talking to people when they don't do sign is typing stuff on my phone and showing them. I understand this is possibly the worst thing possible impression wise and I don't know how to make things easier.

I'm so worried about being alone, and I'm scared that my difficulty communicating is going to make me unpopular, coupled with me being shy. Please, I'd appreciate any advice for how I could go about meeting people and working past this without seeming rude or anything.

hoshiseasons,2019-05-30 16:04:13+00:00,"Me (24F) and my boyfriend (26M) got into an argument about my ""lack of understanding"" of his favorite film.","Hi folks. First time poster, long time reader. 

I'll try and keep it pretty short and simple!

The other night, my boyfriend and I had our usual movie night and he BEGGED me to watch A Clockwork Orange, his favorite film, with him. I'd always heard of it, it's an incredibly popular film, but never knew the plot or anything really. 

I of course agreed. But quickly I realized that this was not my type of film at all. I'm a multiple sexual assault survivor and am incredibly triggered and uncomfortable during scenes of SA and violence. 

When I voiced this, asking him if maybe we could watch something else, he got irritated with me and told me I just ""had to finish it to really understand."" 

Again, I asked him to please turn it off. He did, very angrily, and then critizied me for not taking an interest in the things he likes. I found this to be incredibly unfair, as I have always gotten involved and excited about the things in his life. He continued to insult my intelligence and lack of understanding of the ""art of the film"" and I just left it at that.

He knows about my past traumas and has always been very sensitive and understanding about everything. I've never seen him like this and over a movie, no less. 

I'm just feeling hurt and confused and really not heard. He hasn't called to apologize or anything. It's just been total radio silence. Any advice would be appreciated.

demars123,2019-05-29 23:21:30+00:00,My friend [F19] invited me [M19] to play golf and had her boyfriend control a vibrator inside of her,"This happened yesterday. To give a bit of background, I work at a golf course and a girl I had known for years but never been friends with started working at the course. We ended up becoming really good friends and we both looked forwards to shifts together.

The other day she invited me out to play golf with her and another girl from work. I thought it sounded fun so I said yes. The day of, the plan changed and she was now bringing her boyfriend and the other girl was bringing a friend. The course only allows groups of four to go out so she told me to come with her and her boyfriend. I thought that would be fine, but going into it I was hoping this wouldn't be a third wheel situation.

  


We got to the first tee box after stocking up on drinks and immediately I noticed her boyfriend had a sleek black remote in his hand. When she got up to use her driver, she was clutching her groin and telling her boyfriend to stop while she was driving as her boyfriend was laughing. I think I caught on almost immediately as I knew she is a very sexual person, and I know remote control vibrators exist. I was in disbelief and kept playing. This continued to happen for about 8 holes of golf until by the 9th she claimed to have turned it off. It was almost constant throughout the whole round, with them discussing different levels and stuff on the remote. The whole thing was done right in front of me and very obviously, I pretended I didn't know what was going on as it was incredibly uncomfortable. Luckily by the 9th hole we had ran out of balls and had to call it. They drove me home and I left the car thinking that was one of the weirdest, most inconsiderate things someone has done to/around me.

  


Flashforward to today when I'm at work till 3 and she started at 1. It was at work that I realized how fucked up the whole situation was, and how she thought that it would okay to do that around me. When she showed up to work I was pretty cold, only really saying the bare minimum, whereas normally we would be talking a whole lot. After a bit, she asked me if something was wrong. She was was asking if something happened this morning or today, as if she thought I hadn't picked up on what had happened. I told her that golfing with her and her boyfriend was really weird. She asked what happened, and I told her ""I'm pretty sure you know what happened"". She still didn't fill in the blanks, until I mentioned the remote. At which point she said something along the lines of ""I'm sorry if that made you uncomfortable, I don't I don't know why I agreed to that, I don't know what else to say"". I asked her why she would tell me to golf with her boyfriend and her if she planned on doing that, and she didn't have an answer for me. After a few minutes of that I had enough and left to do a different task away from her.

  


I really don't know if there's going to be any recovering from this as honestly I'm kinda shocked by the lack of respect and her choice to do that in front of me. I really enjoyed being friends with her prior to this and nothing similar ever happened, but I'm truly shocked and kind of disgusted by her actions.

  


I'm curious to hear if people think I'm overreacting, or I'm in the right. Thanks for hearing me out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bult1m/my_friend_f19_invited_me_m19_to_play_golf_and_had/,relationship_advice,4462,755,0.0
throwaway9283752,2019-05-29 14:01:00+00:00,FINAL UPDATE: The fiancé (33) of my mom (34) raped my sister (14).,"A lot has happened in the past few days and I'll try to explain what I can.

On Thursday last week, I decided to tell my stepfather (my sisters' biological father) about the situation. He made the right call and contacted DCF while I was at work, and they sent a social worker over. Once my shift finished, I went outside to wait for my mom. At this point, I didn't know a social worker was at the house, and was curious why she was taking so long. 

After about 10 minutes, she pulls up really fast in the parking spot, almost hitting me. I get up quickly and she tells my 12 year old sister to stay in the car. She starts walking towards me and asks ""What the fuck were you thinking?"". From then on, all I heard was just a flurry of insults from my mother as she described how horrible of a person I was and how I was going to ruin their lives. She personally blamed me for all of the upcoming hardships they were going to have, and how I would likely be the cause of Kyle commiting suicide. She tells me I'm not going to tell the social worker anything at all. A few minutes later, Kyle starts texting my mom, apparently saying his goodbyes. I didn't know this at the time, but apparently he's had a gun with bullets all this time. My mom starts breaking down and tries to text and call him, but she gets no response. She got in the car and started slamming her head against the steering wheel, asking ""What the fuck is wrong with you?"" and ""How could you do this to us?"". She then blames me for his death, and yells at me to ""Get the fuck in the car."" By the point, my 12 year old sister is crying and I'm frozen in fear, and oblige.

The ride home, which normally takes 10 minutes, took closer to five. She was speeding and driving erratically, continuing to berate me the entire way home. She states that she has nothing to live for now, and she should just kill herself too. This just makes my sister bawling, and she starts begging my mom not to do it. About halfway, I assume she got a text from Kyle, and started calming down and told my sister to wipe away her tears for the social worker. I was texting my Dad the whole time and relaying info to him, all the while he was on the phone with the social worker. We pull up to my house and I see the social worker's car parked on the driveway. As we pull in, my mom makes me promise not to say anything, and to play dumb. I make the promise, knowing full well I'm gonna break it in the next minute.

The social worker tells me that she received a report that sexual abuse had occurred at the house. I start telling her the story, but she then tells me to wait, as she requested a police officer to come on scene and she doesn't want me repeating myself. Once he shows up, I tell both of them what had happened, and I see more cops arriving on scene. I tell them that Kyle has a gun with ammo, and who resides in the house and where they are so they can get everyone out safely. Once they get things going, I ask if I can be taken away from the house while this happens to talk more with the social worker, and she obliges, taking me down the road in her car. I give her the full story, and she reassures me it was the right thing to do, and that it was brave. A couple police officers also come by the car and tell me the same thing.

A couple hours later, a detective arrives at the scene and brings me into his car to record my explanation of the entire situation. I swear under oath that everything I say is true and it goes by smoothly. I also provide them the pictures I've taken of the evidence, and let them know that the phone with the audio is inside. Later that night, the cops start bringing our backpacks (which are then filled with clothes) to the social worker's car. Not too long after that, my Dad pulls up with his wife in their car. He said he was proud of me for what I'd done. My sisters are also released to us, and we are told to meet up at a nearby gas station for more questioning. 

The night lasts a long while. By the time we get done with all the questions, it was around 5 AM, and I got some much needed sleep at my dad's house. As of right now, my sisters and I are finishing our last week of school, and we're living with our dad until further notice. There is a legal no contact order for two weeks between us and our mom and Kyle, or any 2nd or 3rd parties. 

We are safe, and I'm glad for that fact. The court should be making a decision soon, and we should be going to grab our things later on.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/buf1dl/final_update_the_fiancé_33_of_my_mom_34_raped_my/,relationship_advice,3509,264,0.0
tomatoflavored,2019-05-29 12:21:05+00:00,[UPDATE] My (27/M) girlfriend (26/F) stopped talking to me after I found out she opened a credit card in my name.,"I decided to “grow up” and break up with her. She didn’t have a lot of stuff at my house so I put it all into a few big boxes and had it shipped to her house. I also changed the access code to both my security system and my door locks.

The day I posted last week, I called her and told her I’m sending her all of her things (after I changed the code/lock code) and we were through. She said I was making a horrible mistake, then apologized, then said we can work through it…..I told her we couldn’t work through it and not to contact me anymore. Hung up and blocked her number.

I drove to the sheriff’s department in tears but I knew I could literally never trust her again. Once I got there, the deputy was super polite and said it happens more than you’d think. He took a report and had me complete a form swearing that everything I said was the truth.

The next day (Wednesday), I wake up to a pounding at the door. It’s my ex and she’s demanding to talk. Through the door, I told her to leave, she refused, pounding on the door and crying. It took everything I had not to open the door and at least speak with her. 5 minutes straight, she’s pounding on the door pleading with me. Then she starts getting quite a bit more violent, kicking the door and yelling obscenities. Since I was afraid she was going to start breaking glass, I called 911. After maybe 5 minutes of the obscenities, she just sat down in front of the door, which was where she was a couple of minutes later when the deputy go to my house (I live kind of outside of town in a rural subdivision).

The deputy asked her if she lived there and she said she doesn’t. The three of us talk for a few minutes and I gave him the report number from the day before. He didn’t know anything about it but he asked if I wanted to have my ex trespassed from my property. “Yes I do”, which set her off yelling and got her told off by the deputy. I signed a little slip of paper and he served her a copy of the trespass warning, if she comes back onto my property, she can be arrested for criminal trespassing. 

She left at that point and I haven’t heard from her since. The sheriff’s office told me they will follow up with me as far as the identity theft charges go but that I may not hear anything for awhile. I’m working on getting the debt out of my name and so far, the credit card company is being very easy to work with, their fraud department said I should be clear of it within a month. 

I truly appreciate the support I received from the thousands of people who commented here. Along with my family, I’ve realized I do deserve something far better than the relationship I had with a manipulative, controlling woman. For anyone else who might be going through this, just call the police, don’t think twice about it, let them do their job. 

Shout out to r/stopIDtheft and r/personalfinance for going even more in-depth into everything. It made me feel a lot better about my decision. I’ll be happy to provide another update in the future if/when charges get filed or she gets prosecuted.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/budz9d/update_my_27m_girlfriend_26f_stopped_talking_to/,relationship_advice,34383,1270,0.0
readitreffi,2019-05-28 18:35:39+00:00,Update to caught my (27M) girlfriend (24F) masturbating and she started crying,"Damn I got a ton of great advice on my post, thanks guys. Reading your comments made me realize that I’m probably a dumbass and should have thought about it more. She didn’t have any trauma but her family was pretty religious and conservative growing up which I relate to, my parents were the same way and they never talked about sex or anything. But it was different in my house, they knew or assumed I would jerk off, they said little things sometimes and acted like it was completely normal. I got her before she fell asleep and asked her about it. She told me that they never mentioned masturbation or sex (we had our own ... interesting problems with that too) as if it didn’t even exist but she knew it was bad and she couldn’t ask about it or anything. 

It was good, we had a long talk about it like a discussion, we were just talking. No judgment, it was nice, I missed her. Basically she had only started doing it when she was 19 and she liked it but always felt guilty afterwards because she felt disgusting. She tried to stop and it was hard and she saw it as a big personal struggle but she eventually “quit” around probably a year later and hadn’t done it for a long time. So when we met, she was masturbation free and wasn’t lying all this time when she said she didn’t do it. 

And then when she walked in on me, she started thinking about it and just started doing it again sometimes because it was fun and she still felt guilty so when I saw her, she felt embarrassed. She admitted that her teasing me and mentioning for weeks was her projecting and trying to make herself feel better in some way. I told her it was completely fine and normal and her private business to do what she wants, no fap or pro fap. Obviously I didn’t change her deep rooted views so quickly. I tried telling her that I knew she felt gross but my view of her didn’t change at all and I still love her the same and she liked that and gave me a hug. So that’s that. She didn’t cry again but she did talk to me with her head under the comforter. I know a couple comments told me not to do this but my brain screwed up and I said that it was so hot and I wanna watch her. She felt embarrassed and told me not to hold my breath but maybe one day. We’re good now. Had breakfast together and she was fine and back to normal. 

Thanks for all the help. I knew I wanted to bring it up but all the pointers and lines really helped. We talked for a while and opened up an interesting discussion, it was good. 

Some people mentioned that she may have been thinking about someone else, had someone hidden under the covers or our sex isn’t good. That’s definitely not it lol. And just wanted to say that the comments calling her a hypocritical bitch are really fucking weird. I did not make that post thinking “wow my BITCH girlfriend has double standards, I should have continued to tease her, it’s what she deserved, she made jokes on me for WEEKS, how fucking dare she, I’m gonna get revenge”. I love her, she’s my girlfriend, not my enemy. I can take a couple harmless jokes about choking the chicken, it’s not that serious. Some of you guys have a concerning lack of empathy. And the comments about her being immature and needing to grow the fuck up and act like an adult. Again, real lack of empathy.

betrayedbywifen,2019-05-28 09:51:10+00:00,My wife tried to hide my daughter from me. Am I wrong to feel this angry?,"My wife and I are married together and have three kids (11, 8, 3). 

When I was in my 20s I donated sperm as there is a massive shortage in my country (I literally donated after reading about this shortage in the newspaper). I've always been upfront about this fact with me wife. Always. And she has always said she's okay with it.

Fast forward to yesterday I answer the phone to a girl that immediately starts nervously apologising for calling me, but that she ""had to speak with me personally."" Obviously I have no idea what the fuck is going on, so I ask her to explain what she's talking about.

Turns out this girl is my daughter (I understand it's wrong to call her my daughter when I didn't raise her, but for lack of a better word...) and just turned 18. After turning 18 she got access to my contact details as required under my country's law regarding sperm donors. She called my house last week to talk to me and my wife picked up. Apparently my wife told her that I wanted ""nothing to do with her"" and that she should ""never call this number again"" before hanging up. 

Honestly broke my heart to hear that the woman I loved could be so fucking heartless. So for the last week this poor girl has been crying her eyes out trying to work up the courage to call again, and thankfully she did so when I was home.

I tried to keep my calm while on the phone and reassure her that I did not say any of that. We organised a place/time to meet, and as soon as my wife got home later that night I blew up at her. Honestly, I've NEVER yelled at anyone as long as I can remember, but I couldn't hold it in. 

Am I wrong to think that's so severely fucked up of my wife to do? I honestly can't comprehend how she could say that. I'm not thinking straight and need some advice on how to deal with this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bty3oi/my_wife_tried_to_hide_my_daughter_from_me_am_i/,relationship_advice,14164,1818,0.0
pinksocknation,2019-05-28 05:39:10+00:00,I just saw a post on here about a 17 year old girl having a miscarriage and the comments were incredibly rude. If you're still looking at this subreddit I really hope you read this.,"I didn't get my comment in in time before she deleted her post. It's a terrible shame that people can't be more understanding simply because she was young. I know she probably won't see this and I might get down voted but I couldn't not reach out to her when she's obviously having a hard time dealing with this loss. 


My heart goes out to you my dear, I was your age when I had my first miscarriage. It's an incredibly traumatic experience and leaves you feeling like there is an unfillable void in your heart. What you need to understand right now is that this is not your fault.

The alcohol and coffee would not have had an effect on your little one at this stage of your pregnancy. 1 in 4 women will experience a miscarriage in their lives and almost all of those happen in the first 12 weeks. 

It's nobody's fault, and it doesn't mean you won't be able to conceive in the future. 

I would suggest speaking with your mom about making an appointment with a therapist to help you work through the emotions you are feeling right now. There are also support groups you can join through Facebook or different parenting forums, I haven't checked but I'm assuming you could find a community right here on reddit for women who have experienced miscarriages. You are not alone, and there are resources to help you through this.

I would just take some time to yourself over the next little while. You need to grieve. One thing that people don't seem to understand about miscarriages is there is no closure, you don't get to bury them and you don't even get time to say goodbye goodbye.

Something that may help you is having a small memorial. Some people can move on easily from miscarriages and others can't, I had an incredibly hard time with my first. My mom and I got together the few things I had bought for the baby. A little onsie and an ultrasound picture I had. I had nothing else because it was so early on, so I wrote a short letter for them. I placed it all in a shoe box and I buried it in my mom's back yard. I found it incredibly therapeutic, maybe something similar will help you. 

I'm now 26 years old and I have 2 incredible little girls, both rainbow babies. Someday you will get your rainbow baby too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/btw8jg/i_just_saw_a_post_on_here_about_a_17_year_old/,relationship_advice,1972,106,0.0

HopeBeatsFear,2019-05-27 08:08:36+00:00,UPDATE: My(20m) gf(24f) wanted an open relationship and is now mad at me and wants it closed.,"Previous post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/btfeb3/my20m\_gf24f\_wanted\_an\_open\_relationship\_and\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/btfeb3/my20m_gf24f_wanted_an_open_relationship_and_is/) 

&amp;#x200B;

So, she came home at 12am to tell me she'd completed her ""last hurrah"" and was ready to talk. When I asked her what she meant she stated she slept with someone else for the last time and she was willing to call things even. She restated the terms, meaning I'd lose my workout buddy, the sweet girl I met today, my ex who cheered me up, and a few other dudes who I now speak to casually who I've slept with. I said I wasn't sure and I had some questions for her and she was willing to at least talk about things. I asked her if the two men she'd slept with she'd lined up before and she said yes. She admitted she found them more physically attractive than me and that was her motivation for it, that she, ""didn't want to live life never knowing what it's like."" When I asked her what she meant, she meant sleeping with someone who was fit. I was a little hurt, but I knew she wasn't really ""wrong"" so to speak. I'm not fit, it's something I'm working on, but I'm a little upset that her motivation had nothing to do with exploration and freedom outside of visuals. That it wasn't the sex but my body. That it wasn't even my personality, but the way I look and how much I weigh. I'd like to take a second and point out I actually weigh less than her overall. I'm 6'2"" and 255lb and she's 5'3"" 305lb. I've never had an issue with her weight, even the things that we couldn't do as a result didn't bother me. 

&amp;#x200B;

She admitted she didn't think I could, and I quote, ""con anyone into sleeping with you"". She went on to say she doesn't understand how someone would want only to sleep with me and not the emotional stuff. I won't lie, I got mad, and I said some mean and vindictive things to hurt her because I felt hurt. I shouldn't have lost my cool and I did. I've posted the mean things she's said, so I don't feel it's right for me not to admit what I said. I told asked her how she managed to get these guys to sleep with her more than once and that lying down like the beached whale she was and gargling on her own spit was far from my ideal sexual partner but I never decided I'd rather fuck someone else because of it. Apparently it hit too close to home because one of the guys would't talk to her anymore and the other dude told her she needed to be more proactive in bed. She called me a faggot and I told at least men want me to fuck them and she started to crying. We yelled at each other for a while until it turned into me yelling at her while she cried until I left.

&amp;#x200B;

 I realized how much more hurt I was about the whole open relationship thing and really unloaded on her. A lot of you liked to point out that I didn't plan to marry her, I want to remind you all this was 9 months into a relationship at 20 years old that I said yes. I'm not the brightest, but I don't think normally 20 year old men are planning to marry someone that early on when I don't have any real money or my own house and my car is a beater. I genuinely cared about her and before this I was planning to get an apartment with her. I'd saved up money and took her somewhere nice every month despite not having a lot of money. I'd participated in the relationship in ways I'd never felt compelled to before until she asked for an open relationship. I stayed up the first night alone crying because she didn't come home and she had the dude pick her up from her place while I was over and asked me to watch her place while she was gone. I kept thinking about if she got pregnant with someone else's kid and it tore me up. I didn't even feel like a man anymore. I said the next few days my ex messaged me, but when I look over the text and call logs it was two full weeks of me just going to work, coming home, and going to bed. I was hurt that my ex noticed how broken I was over this and that my girlfriend had bragged about how much fun she'd had her first night. It was a deep visceral pain that I buried with sex and I was so damn mad she had the audacity to be hurt over it. How dare she hurt me like that and then get mad at me for just to regain my confidence and make the best of things. I was furious, and it all spilled out at once. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm home, my roommate is home and he's making some cake and tea for us to eat and talk because I'm a mess right now. My workout buddy is coming over and offered to sleep (like, cuddling, not sex) with me tonight because he knows how much I was hurt about this. He's actually pulling in the drive way right now. 

I'll try to respond to comments but I don't know how much longer we'll be up.

HopeBeatsFear,2019-05-27 00:28:53+00:00,My(20m) gf(24f) wanted an open relationship and is now mad at me and wants it closed.,"So, me and my gf started dating roughly a year ago. It's a grey spot as to when we really started dating or I'd give an exact date. 

So, three months ago, my gf comes to tell me she'd like to have an open relationship, experiment a little, etc. She's only slept with one guy before me, she wants to know what's out there, yatta yatta. Yeah, I was hurt, I expressed that I wasn't super keen on it, but she insisted. I figured she probably has someone lined up, and it's not like I plan to marry this girl, so whatever. Be free.

I lamented for a few days until my ex messaged me. She wanted to meet up, get some closure, cool beans. We go out, we talk a bit, she just got out of a relationship and I explain I'm apparently in an open one. She gave me a semi-pained look because she (and my gf) are aware of how much I value monogamy. We stayed and talked for a few more hours, I went to her place things almost got intimate and I stopped her until she mentioned it was an open relationship now. I nodded and didn't really not want sex, so we did it.

It really restored my confidence and helped me start to get into the open relationship thing. I'm a bi top so I ended up reinstalling grindr and haven't had a night where I can't find somethibg or someone to do. My gf and I occasionally had sex, and we still spoke to each other and stuff, but I never really mentioned who or how many people I was sleeping with. Afterall, she said this was about freedom, and I feel free as a bird. I still get to experience emotional comfort, affection, etc. With my gf and try new things and meet new people. 

About two months ago I stopped feeling so depressed all the time and I started to work out more since one of the guys I've been sleeping with is really into yoga and cardio and asked if I'd like to get into it. I've lost a little over 20lb since and I'm still overweight but I physically feel much better. 

Today, my gf shes really happy about the way things are and I couldn't have agreed more. I gave her a kiss and got up to go meet up with a girl my ex introduced me to. She really sweet, cute, overall a very fun person. The only other girl I've slept with since this started was my ex. I learned today I'm into a new kink and left after it was over. I walk into the house and gf is all over me. I start to undress, she start to give me head and stops 3 seconds in and asks me where I'd just been. I explain what happened and she gets up  and tells me when need to talk. 

I get dressed, sit on the couch with her, and she asks me if I've been sleeping with other people. I was like, yeah no shit it's an open relationship. She asked how many and I said I wasn't keeping track. Apparently that's the wrong fucking answer because she burst into tears. She's only slept with two other dudes and it was just so she knew what her options were. I explained that she was free to do that and during that time I explored my options as well. She asked how many women I'd slept with. I said 2. She got mad and started screaming at me as to how I could lose count at two. I probably should have shut up right then and there, but instead I said, ""Because I'd have to add the dudes in."" 

She went to the bedroom and cried for a while. About an hour ago she came out and demanded I: close the relationship, never speak to anyone I've been sleeping with again, and never talk about it again or she'd leave me.

????? I genuinely don't understand what she expected. She knew I was bi when we were just friends of friends. Why does it matter who I sleep with? I was genuinely enjoying being free like she told me to and I assumed she was too. It's not like I slept with her friends or anything, it was mostly dudes. And as much as I enjoy her companionship, I like the freedom this entails and I like having someone to work out with. I like learning about what I enjoy sexually. I'm having fun the EXACT way she asked me to. It's not like she wasn't sleeping with those guys frequently, so I don't get why she's upset.

My gf who I've known for basically forever (been official since I was 14) is having my baby. Everyone especially my parents keep telling me I fucked up big and my life is over. They say I'm a loser and I'll never get anywhere in life. They say I'll never be happy again. How true is that?

I keep telling myself there's gotta be good things about babies otherwise people wouldn't keep having them since lots have them in purpose. 

I'm pretty much freaking out at this point. I have a fuck ton of mixed feelings about the whole thing. Obviously I don't want to be a dad BUT Im gonna be. So it is what it is. 

My parents are being difficult and not making things easier, in fact making it worse. Since I told them she was pregnant they said since I'm making adult decisions I now have adult responsibilities. They make me pay rent, part of hydro/cable/internet/water etc. I have to buy my own food and anything I need. I have a part time job but they now take the entire paycheque and are insisting I'm in the negative each month and owe them a couple grand. I have legit not been able to buy a single baby thing cuz of them.

I desperately needed shoes but since they take all my money I had none. I was wearing little bros shoes since he's cool but they're too small. Gfs parents bought me a new pair since I got an infected toenail from being squished. I don't want to owe them too, JC.

Anyway. I'm leaving home once school is done in June. Gf's parents said I won't have to pay them rent as long as I help with the baby and contribute with that.

My parents say they'll sue me for the money I owe them. Can they? When I get mad they just say I'm an adult and I get adult consequences now.

Okay so I'll briefly explain what happened. My girlfriend's (they're identical twins) sister would be coming over last night around dinner. I woke up (sleepy and hungover) and went to the kitchen, and saw my girlfriend standing there. I came up behind her and hugged/groped her. This is normal for us, I didn't think twice about it. I kissed her neck, basically pushed my morning wood into her ass and half made out with her from behind. This lasted maybe 5-10 seconds. I checked the fridge and started talking to my girlfriend, but she wasn't responding so I turned to look at her and I saw my girlfriend's sister standing there. I was horrified and SO embarrassed. She laughed it off and thanked me for my 'warm welcome'. I quickly apologized and went back to bed ASAP. I couldn't look her or my girlfriend in their eyes, I was mortified. The sister acted like nothing happened, and I was stressing the fuck out.


I told the sister I was going to tell my girlfriend, but she insisted I didn't tell her and that it would only cause trouble. Didn't wanted to go against her, and she promised she wouldn't tell my girlfriend so I kept quiet but still felt conflicted. I was very glad sister wasn't PISSED at me, we were both going to forget about it. Cool, so today we were going to have a family dinner at their parents place, but my girlfriend and sister got into a huge fight. My girlfriend refuses to talk about what and why, but she's fuming. They screamed at each other when the sister left, I've never seen them fight in my life because they're very close. I suspect it has something to do with what happened between me and the sister, but I don't see why she would tell my girlfriend. Now I'm freaking out EVEN MORE. My girlfriend isn't mad at me as far as I can tell so I don't know what she knows. I don't know what the fuck is going on or what to do. I got a text from the sister saying we need to talk, which fueled my anxiety to the max. I'm dreading going over there. I feel like I can't function or think, like something terrible is about the happen. Anyone with some wise words or wisdom?

cincy4483,2019-05-26 12:21:25+00:00,I took a DNA test just for fun and found out my dad isn’t my dad.,"I [25F] took a DNA test just for fun (the type that you spit in a little cup and then get emailed with your results). When I first got my DNA results back, I was really confused because I knew my dad’s heritage, and the results weren’t matching up with what I was told. I was looking around on the website and discovered DNA matches. I saw that I was matched with people who had my mom’s maiden name (which makes sense), and my mom’s ex fiancé’s last name. My mom did have a fiancé when she met my dad, but ultimately ended up marrying my dad. There were points in my childhood when she would still see her ex (for instance, they worked together for a while). 
My family always says that I got all of the recessive traits because I don’t look like the rest of my family, but I’m now realizing that I look like my mom’s ex. I don’t want to break up my parents marriage, but I feel so sad knowing that my dad isn’t my “real” dad.

I was absolutely bullshit that she would bring him around not only my kids but her own grandchildren as well. He has stolen money at almost every family gathering we’ve ever had.

thro-wawa-y,2019-05-24 10:37:49+00:00,UPDATE: I [22F] just found out my boyfriend [27M] has been having sex with me when I'm sleeping after I've taken sleeping pills.,"(Previous post can be found here)\[[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/bovqbj/i\_22f\_just\_found\_out\_my\_boyfriend\_27f\_has\_been/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bovqbj/i_22f_just_found_out_my_boyfriend_27f_has_been/)\] but the TL;DR is in the title. I have really bad insomnia and often take pills that knock me out completely. I'm pretty much dead to the world when I take them. Recently, about 2 weeks ago, I found out that my boyfriend would have sex with me while I was knocked out despite me saying that I wasn't up for sex before I fell asleep. I woke up that day because I was feeling unwell for different reasons and hadn't taken my insomnia pills. He didn't see what was wrong with him doing what he did.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the update. after I found out what happened, I went to my older brother's house and have been staying with him since. I'm so incredibly lucky to have him. It was from his house that I made the last post. After that post, I was replying to the comments until I fell asleep. The majority of them told me that my boyfriend was raping me and that I need to break up with him and report him to the police. That was something I didn't wasn't to have to do. When I woke up in the morning, I had almost 600 more replies and I got really overwhelmed and had to step back and decide for myself what I was going to do. So that is exactly what I did.

&amp;#x200B;

I had decided that everyone deserves a second chance. I wanted to talk to my boyfriend explain why I wasn't okay with what happened and why it was wrong. I went into that conversation with every intention of staying with him and giving him a second chance.

&amp;#x200B;

So I called him over a little over a week ago so we could talk. I started to explain everything to him and why I had to go away for a while. The conversation was going okay at the beginning. But then it took a turn. As soon as I brought up the fact that I wold him no to sex before I feel asleep but he did it anyway, he kinda snapped. He started yelling. He started throwing things. Telling me that he knew I was insinuating that he had raped me. Saying I was accusing him of something very serious. I hadn't said to him that he had raped me. I hadn't even gotten the chance to tell him that I was going to give him another chance. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then things took a turn. In my last post, people were accusing me of attention seeking. I don't want to come off that way so I am not going to disclose what happened. I'm still trying to process everything and wondering how I could be so wrong about a person. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to say thank you to everyone who commented and messaged me on my last post. You have no idea how much it meant to me to have your support, especially when my boyfriend was trying to convince me I was the one who was wrong. I'm sorry I didn't listen to you guys. I was wrong. But I think what happened would have happened regardless of what decision I had made. Maybe it was better that way because now I know for sure. I don't know what is going to happen in the future, but for now I'm living with my brother and trying to get my life back in order. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again, thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bsfbde/update_i_22f_just_found_out_my_boyfriend_27m_has/,relationship_advice,13210,1008,0.0
kinjio,2019-05-24 00:45:50+00:00,Am I a horrible dad (35m) for being embarrassed of my son (16m)?,"Before I start I want to say I love and would die for my kid. He's the reason I get up every morning. I've really been struggling with some shit and don't want to talk about with people I know.

My kid is a good boy. Nothing like his dad when I was young. I was always into all sorts of trouble and had him young. I got my shit together because or him. Won't get into the nitty gritty of it but he very literally saved my life by being born. I was headed down a dark path. 

Anyways, he's had a tough go of it. We've never had much money and he's never really had many friends. He's very out there. You know, flamboyant. He's not at all the kind of guy I've ever been around or have raised him as. I tried to dissuade him from some things when he was younger. He's a stubborn kid though, he knows what he wants. I'll give him that. There's no stopping him when he really wants to do something.

He's into theatre and dance. Does makeup. Into fashion. Sometimes girly. He watches a lot of James Charles and Jeffree Star. I'm 99.99% sure he's gay. He's not said as much but at this point it's obvious, plus he and this other boy he brings around are not at all as subtle as they think they are.

I don't get why he is the way he is. I don't want him to be this way. I never got the hockey playing, fishing and hunting sort of son. He was always into what he's into and I've got his back because I'm his dad. What's eating me up is this little bit of shame I feel. Like when we go out people stare. Some people laugh. He gets picked on a lot at school. He will come home in tears and sometimes even roughed up. He won't change. He's making himself a huge target.

I get a lot of comments from my own family, especially my dad. He's said some derogatory stuff to my kid every once in awhile. I shut that shit down. I don't get what my son is doing. Don't even know if I agree with it, certainly don't like it, but I'm not going to let people make him feel shit for whoever he is.

Still, when he begs me for money to get his nails done a part of me cringes inside. When we go out and he's all ""glammed"" up I can't help but feel a little sick inside. Like why the fuck is he doing this? Why does he need to be this way? I hate to say it, I feel so much secondhand embarrassment. When my friends talk about their own sons and what they're into and up to, I feel legitimately embarrassed talking about mine. I never bring him up and try to brush off questions anybody asks. I part of me also really wishes I had the kind of son my friends have. They have great bonds and spend a lot of good quality time together. My kid and I have no common ground.

I know he can feel my discomfort when it comes to certain things. I've probably said things I shouldn't at times. I want him to be who he is. I know I'm the problem here, not him. I just can't help how I feel. 

He's just so beyond my realm of understanding. I don't get the appeal of being gay. I don't get the appeal of makeup and fashion. Fuck me, I don't get anything about him at all. 

I don't really know what I'm asking. Maybe this is more of a vent since this shit has been eating at me for a long time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bsak75/am_i_a_horrible_dad_35m_for_being_embarrassed_of/,relationship_advice,1726,465,0.0

He asked for an open relationship and now he has a FWB, but he's upset with me now for recently finding one as well.","My boyfriend and I have been together for over 5 years and a couple of months ago he told me he felt like he wasn't completely satisfied in the bedroom. I was pretty hurt by this but I can understand it because my libido has been very low due to the stress of my job. I asked him if he was just interested in trying something new and that's when he proposed the idea of an open relationship. This really hurt my feelings, but I didn't say no because I wanted to please him. I told him okay, but that I didn't want to hear about the sexual exchanges he was about to have. We agreed to keep things to ourselves if we got involved with anyone. 

He has a FWB relationship with a girl he met on an app now. He told me that without going into detail about their relationship and I kind of just acted like she didn't exist until recently. Recently I met up with a guy I used to go to school with and we went out for drinks to catch up. We ended up hooking up that night and since then we've continued having sex. He's introduced me to new things and I really enjoy the sex honestly, it's better than the sex I've been having with my boyfriend. 

I still love my boyfriend but the reaction he gave me upon finding out about my sexual relationship with a guy from college has me kind of upset and angry with him. He asked me if I had been seeing anyone else sexually and I told him yes without giving any details. He **begged** me to tell him what my FWB does to me and how exactly I please my FWB in bed. I told him I wasn't going into detail because that was what we had agreed on. He asked me if the sex was better than our sex. I told him honestly, but without detail, that I enjoyed sex with my FWB more because we had been trying new things.

He basically blew up on me and told me I'm not allowed to have a FWB. I said to him, ""well you have one!"" and he responded to me with ""this isn't about me, this is about you being a slut."" Truly unbelievable.

gonecruising,2019-05-21 23:53:31+00:00,Update My girlfriend gone a singles cruise,"TL:DR I had posted a few days ago that my Gf and her BF(f) had planned a cruise but neglected to tell me after many months it was a Singles cruise. The BF's boyfriend and I had planned to surprise the girls by flying to Florida meeting them at the ship and spending that night with them. As I was looking for when the ship would arrive I found it was a Singles cruise. I questioned whether Reditt thought this was cheating. Lots of different opinions. But the gut is all ways right.

After listening to many responses and learning how cruises work, we decided while it would be a great surprise the logistics probably would work against us as for as spending much time with the girls as they would be tired and rushed getting to hotel, dinner etc. And expensive. We decided we would let them enjoy their time. They came back to port Sunday, spent the night in Florida, flew home Monday pm.

I went to work as usual. Got home about 5pm. Came in the house a note from GF that she was taking a nap at 4pm not to let her sleep past 6pm but could wake her any time. I let her sleep and would wake her at 6. I thought we would just order something from a local restaurant. My phone was out in my truck, so I grabbed GF from the table. We do this all the time.

As I was placing the order she received a text from a woman's name that wasn't familiar. I know everyone she knows. The message that appeared said ""Thanks for a great week. I opened the text. It went on more about the great time they had and how close this person felt toward her and could not wait to see her in a couple weeks when they got over that way. Then asked if Gf could send some of her pictures. Now curious I opened her photos. There were many with BF,of the ship of some stops at different ports.  I found selfies with her with a guy about a dozen mixed in. There was one with them face to face their shoulders were bare taken in a I am assuming a room on the ship.

My stomach started lurching, I thought I was going to throw up.  I answered back ""Which ones"", came back ""of us"". So I said ""You want just the nice ones or the naughty ones"". Now this would sound exactly how Gf would talk, she is very sweet. The answer came back "" oh I want nasty if you got them"". So playing along I answered back"" I need nasty from you"". A few minutes later a dick  pic is received with ""how's this?""

I quietly go back out to my truck to get my phone and call the phone number. A guy answers. I asked for the woman whose name is appearing on the text. He says ""sorry wrong number"". I go back to her phone take a selfie and send to him a text with ""here it comes get ready"" I send the selfie with the caption ""I am her soon to be ex BF, you can pick her up with in the hour because she will be on the street"". I blocked him on her phone and went back into the house.

I woke her up. She still sleepy was all lovey, how she missed me etc. Big smile on her face vanished when I held up her half naked selfie. She started immediately stated yelling and crying how wrong it was of me to look through her phone. You can probably repeat the conversation from all other cheating posts. We argue loudly, then she starts to leave. I just said,""you can pick your stuff up by 10pm I
 will have it all packed up. Leave your key on the table. I am going to the bar be back after 10."" I then called my work buddy who is BF boyfriend told him what happened and to check her phone.

She really only had her clothes as the house is mine and furnished before she moved in 5 months ago. I piled them back into her suit case, trash bags and I found   a box for her makeup and hair stuff even packed her shampoo and anything else was hers. I never went to the bar but did go pick up our meal, did not eat it though. I drove around most of the evening. She started calling and texting around 8. Finally I just blocked her calls. I parked down the street, she back about 9 went into the house and took somethings. When I went back in she took enough to go to work the next day. She left a letter apologizing wanting to meet and talk, she would stop by tomorrow. I do not plan on coming home until real late.

So reditt after half of you thought I was off base thinking she was cheating I am not happy to be proven my gut was right. You can roast me for going through her phone but I was happy to have her home and could not wait for her to tell me about her vacation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/brhq4c/update_my_girlfriend_gone_a_singles_cruise/,relationship_advice,16138,1614,0.0
tomatoflavored,2019-05-21 13:40:44+00:00,My (27/M) girlfriend (26/F) stopped talking to me after I found out she opened a credit card in my name.,"We’ve been dating for about a year now, though we still live apart. Two weeks ago, I received a phone call asking if I was trying to use my credit card about 200 miles away. I immediately said no and to lock my credit card. They did and told me they would re-issue me a new card. Awesome customer service, seemed like they were saving my ass. Last week, I noticed an automatic payment I have tied to my card went through, I thought that was weird so I called my credit card company. They said there was no sign of fraud on my account. WTF.

I thought about it a bit more and my girlfriend has family in the city where they blocked the transaction. I checked my credit report and there it was, a credit card I’ve never seen before. My name is on it but the address is my girlfriend’s house. When I talked to her about it, she said she’s never seen it and knows nothing about it. Yesterday, I was able to call the credit card company and get a list of charges….almost all of them are places she frequents, same hair salon, same restaurant, same coffee shop, same supermarket, everything.

She came over last night and I called her out on it and showed her the list of charges, it adds up to more than $4000. She still denied everything. I told her it wouldn’t be hard to get surveillance footage of the person using the card, especially at the supermarkets, and she absolutely went off on me. She called me controlling, jealous and an awful person for blaming her. She left and texted me to call her when I’ve “decided to grow up”.

TiAraFU,2019-05-21 04:20:00+00:00,My adopted brother feels as though the family doesn’t love him,"

My parents have 5 kids. 27F, 26M, then me and my twin and our adopted brother are all 23, and we are 23F (me) then two 23M’s. 

John was adopted when his bio parents who were close friends with our parents died when he was a few months old.

So this has been a slowly building thing for years now but really got called to everyone’s attention I’ve the past 5 years. 

I remember growing up with “John” normally as any siblings would and all of our other siblings say the same. We played we fought we made up we broke our parents’ shit. 


The past 5 years have been somewhat strange. At first we thought it was just John being John but now after I’ve spoken with him we discovered it was more than we thought.

First off, John left the day he turned 18, which was a surprise because he had good grades and everyone assumed he’d go to college like the rest of us. He graduated one semester early and left the house on his 18th birthday which was a shock to everyone.

He earned money doing chore work for our dad and uncles and had bought his own car and apparently saved enough to get an apartment. It was weird and my parents were sad but more than that they were proud and happy for him. 

Dad offered John money to help him start out life on his own but John refused and said he’d be fine. 

My parents were insanely proud of John. They’re not typically the “brag on my kid” kind of people but they were telling everyone how independent and responsible and mature and fearless John was. 

Now it’s important to note that us siblings were always fairly close. I cried the first night John was gone and wanted my dad to figure out a way to make him come back because I was scared he die or something.

So when the communication suddenly was almost nothing, it was weird and we missed him but our parents said that he was busy working and taking care of himself and that when he’d settled and figured things out, he’d be back to his normal self.

It never happened though and he also stopped really talking to them. He’d talk to us around birthdays and holidays but even then it was strange. He always tries to meet up with siblings for dinner or drinks on birthdays, always visits our parents “very quickly” on their birthdays and mother’s/father’s day, and on Thanksgiving and Christmas, he is in and out. 

For example, our older brother was the only one there when John was there for or mom’s most recent birthday and he said John was “very clinical”. And that it felt more like a soldier was paying respect to a commanding officer than anyone visiting their parents.

One thing about this that stood out was that John talked to our mom and dad and brother about a lot going on in his life. Apparently he’s got a girlfriend and just got s dog and has a great new job in construction.

No one knew any of this and Dad cracked a joke about how they were terrible parents because how could they not know anything about what was going on in one of their kid’s lives. 

After John left our mom looked sad and when our older brother asked her what was wrong she said that it felt like John didn’t want to be around her and that she missed him before she refused to say anything more about it.


So our older brother started a group chat with everyone but John to ask about if any of us had noticed anything wrong with him. Wed all talked about how distant he’d been over the years but never like this talk. 


At the end of it, we all arranged to meet up with John and try to talk to him to make sure everything was okay.

It took some effort to get him to open up but he finally did and what he said has really rocked our family. 

He said that, “I’m not their real son.” We all immediately tried to reassure him that mom and dad love him and we do too but he had all these stories about how mom and dad treated him differently. 

There were lots of examples. Things like older brother would hug or kiss mom on the cheek but she’d push John off if he tried the same. Dad would happily talk Sports with anyone, but would be short with John. Our grandparents were never excited to see him, aunts and uncles not interested in him or his hobbies or what was going on at school.

One incident where dad asked each boy to go on a hunting trip and never asked John until they were leaving and when he did finally ask, you could tell dad was annoyed (and my brothers did confirm this one because they thought it was weird how dad acted too). When John said he was fine with not going they said dad looked happy about it. 

John would ask for help with school work, mom or dad would say they were tired or tell him to ask teachers but they’d stay up with the rest of us.

You get the idea. There was a lot of stuff and enough of us witnessed it that we don’t think he was misremembering things or making them up. 

John wasn’t bitter or angry about this. He said that he understood that they wouldn’t be able to love him the same way they loved us and that, “it would be inhuman of me to ask that of them.” Which broke my heart.

He said he refused the money from dad because he would have felt badly about him using it on him instead of his “real children” 

He said he will always love them and respect them and be grateful for their sacrifices for raising him, but that it was too painful to be around them for too long because he knew they couldn’t be what he wanted and that he couldn’t be what they wanted. 

Our oldest sister was impassioned by this and told my parents about it. It was a shitshow. Mom crying, dad punching a wall. They’re both ashamed and hurt and insist that they love him just as much as they do therest of us.

Now that John knows our parents know he’s upset and is apprehensive about coming around, which is understandable. 

We love our brother and our parents love him too and we all miss him. How do we fix this?

cafinerou,2019-05-20 23:43:07+00:00,My (18f) parents are disowned me and kicked me out because I accidentally got pregnant,"This entire situation blew up so fast in my face that I'm still reeling.

I should probably preface this by saying that my parents are extremely strict Asian immigrant parents. It's always been education and academics before love and support. I grew up being physically beat for getting a single ""B"" grade on my report card and having to give my mother my passwords to all of my accounts. Nevertheless, I obeyed their every command. I graduated just last week in the top 10% of my class and am going to Brown University on an almost full-ride (more on that later in regards to the current situation) this fall. 

Following my college acceptances, I probably breathed the biggest sigh of relief in my entire life. My parents finally had nothing to complain about since I fulfilled their biggest dream for me: ""to get into an Ivy League school."" All was good for about a month. My parents finally stopped reading my text messages, tracking my every move, etc. I was free to go out with friends, spend time with my *secret* boyfriend, and just enjoy being a high schooler. 

My boyfriend and I have been together since last summer, so almost a year now. My parents had their suspicions about us in the beginning but I brushed it off and faked my way into making them believe he was just a friend. But after I committed to Brown and they seemed happy enough, I became more lax about hanging out with him and I think they figured it out. 

We started being sexually active in December but have always been incredibly careful about using protection. The only time where I'm not 100% sure we were careful was during spring break when we went to Mexico with a couple of our friends and got drunk and had sex. It would make a lot of sense if that's when it happened. Now, I fully understand that we were both stupid and should have exercised a lot more caution. It's our fault completely and I'm not saying otherwise.

Fast-forward to about a week ago. I'm starting to get weird period-like symptoms, but no period. At that point, I honestly just knew. It was like this weird gut feeling and I freaked the fuck out. My boyfriend was incredibly supportive and drove me over to his house where he'd already gotten tests and had me take two of the pretty expensive ones. All positive. I broke down and cried for hours. 

When I got home, I was still visibly upset despite trying my best to hide it. But I wasn't acting carefully or thinking rationally because of everything that happened. I spoke to him explicitly about the situation over a messaging app that my mom has my password to. In retrospect, she definitely suspected that something happened between me and him (probably a break-up) so she logged on to read our messages. 

The very next day, I wake up to the sound of my mom lugging all of my stuff out of my room and throwing it onto our lawn. I get up and ask what the fuck she's doing and she's crying and calling me the nastiest stuff in Chinese like, ""You're a whore, just kill yourself,"" or, ""I should have gave you up for adoption you useless piece of shit."" And other completely ridiculous things like, ""Now you're a prostitute and no longer a virgin, no good boy will ever want to marry you now."" 

I was begging her to stop but the more I did the angrier she got. She was breaking the majority of my stuff, tearing up my work/papers, smashing my photographs, etc. All I could to was call my boyfriend and have him pick me up. 

It's been three days since that happened. I've picked up all of my stuff, at least the stuff that isn't irreparably damaged. My mother or father is not returning any of my calls but continuously sends me brutal text messages about how much of a failure and disappointment I am and how I turned into a prostitute. She also communicated that she will no longer be paying for my education at Brown and that I will never be allowed to call her my mother and have any interaction with her. My yearly tuition not including personal expenses is around $15,000. I have about $10,000 in my own personal checking account from just working a few jobs throughout high school. However, that's not counting the birthday money I've received and the money that my grandfather left me when he passed. Those are in a separate account being controlled by my mother. There's about $75,000 in there and I have no idea how I'm going to get it back.

I'm currently living with my boyfriend. His parents are at a complete loss as to why my parents are behaving this way and I am so ashamed. They've been nothing but supportive of us, even going as far as to offer to pay for whatever choice I end up making about the baby. We've both decided that I'll get an abortion and he's currently working on figuring all of that out while I'm still worrying about my entire fucking future. 

I don't know why but I just feel so incredibly alone at this moment despite having my boyfriend and his family. I can't my best friends because I don't want this to spread and I obviously have no familial support. I'm just so lost. What should I even do at this point? 

TL;DR: Strict Asian parents disowned me and kicked me out of the house after snooping and finding out I was pregnant. They've cut off all contact and refuses to pay for my college tuition. I fully plan on attending Brown this fall after getting the abortion, but I have no money. I'm at a complete loss as to what to do.

yelsewhael,2019-05-20 17:36:35+00:00,"Gave a kidney to my cousin, he thanks god","Six years ago today I donated one of my kidneys to my cousin. It saved his life. I did it because he needed it and I'm fine with one. But when he talks about it, mostly on anniversaries like today, he says ""God is good,"" and ""thanks to God."" Fine. He can do that. But I don't believe in God, and I feel that saying that undermines the fact that I independently chose to give him part of my body. I don't think he means it maliciously. The whole family talks about it this way, actually, and it is really getting to me. I am not close to my cousin but I feel that giving away body parts is a big deal. Do I just let it go? Partly I think I wanted to do this to show that atheists can be kind, that you don't need God to do good things, to be good.

Coolbox55,2019-05-19 15:56:11+00:00,"I (19M) visited a sex worker (21F), we only talked and really clicked, now I'm left confused.","

This is kinda embarrassing to write out, but I decided to book an appointment with someone for the first time. Some relevant info about me first I guess. It's Legal here (The Netherlands).

I'm 19 y.o. dude, extremely introverted and I just suck socially. I've been going to the gym the past year as a way to improve myself and gain confidence. I look muscular now, but the confidence is still nowhere to be found hah.. I've gotten interest from women but I basically can't function when it comes to flirting or whatever. I've had a girl ask me out and I just froze, I don't know what's wrong with me honestly. I don't pick up on signals and all that either.

So I had the great idea to visit a sex worker instead, so there would be no pressure and I could talk freely. Took me a long time to go through with it, but I found a 21 year old girl who's bio really spoke to me and obviously she's really beautiful too. She offered Girlfriend Experience and mentioned that she's open to all ages, so that's what I wanted basically.

Went over to her place yesterday, and I had booked for an hour. She opened the door and I felt intimidated, but we did click. She has a very bubbly personality and is absolutely stunning. We sat down together and it was quiet for a bit as I was trying to relax, and I told her about my lack of experience and that I didn't necessarily come to sleep with her. I don't mean that I want her to be my therapist (I have one already lol) but just to practice conversation and stuff. She said that she could tell, and that I had nothing to worry about. We just laid down on her bed and started talking, for talking to a a complete stranger the conversation flowed surprisingly well. She's doing this work besides her study. At one point she told me she had never seen someone like me, and that I had no reason to not be confident in myself. We got into some pretty personal stuff on both sides, and we just kept on talking and talking. We both had a huge smile on our faces, and we both teared up once and comforted each other. I've never opened up to anyone like that outside my shrink. But it just felt right, and for her it did too apparently. I certainly felt like I connected and chemistry if that's possible.

Meanwhile an hour had passed. When I noticed the hour was done I was getting ready to leave, but she told me to not worry about it and stay. I figured if she really wanted me to leave she wouldn't have a problem with telling me, so I stayed. She brought out some weed, and we got high and had an amazing time together. We laughed a lot and it felt like I had known her for years. She said she was happy to have finally met me (?), but she seemed really sad at the same time. Over 2 hours had passed and I had to go because of a dinner with family, she asked me to stay but I really couldn't because it's my grandma's birthday. She gave me her real phone number and insisted I messaged her tomorrow. I told her I would, and we hugged and kissed when I left and that was the only intimate thing that happened. As I was walking back to my house I noticed she had put the money in a pocket of my jacket, which is weird.

So I went to family dinner and I was completely out of it. Partly because I was still high and partly because I was so confused about what had happened, I realized I liked her. My family knows I smoke to deal with my anxiety so they didn't really think much of it. But I'm still left feeling confused.

I still haven't texted her and I'm afraid to do so, and I already feel bad because it's around dinner time here now. This all makes zero sense, this isn't what I had expected. This isn't what I had in mind when I went to the appointment yesterday, and I just don't know how to feel or what to do. I think the weed played a big role, and I don't want to be the same old weird dude. Sigh. I'm sorry if this is long but I just feel like shit.

TuffVolcano,2019-05-19 13:57:21+00:00,GF and I (26M/F) got into a huge fight over a keyboard. Thinking about ending things based on her behavior. (X-post r/AITA),"So, my GF and I (both 26) got in a fight about this two nights ago, and she's making it seem like I'm being an asshole. We've been dating for ~4.5 months.

&amp;nbsp; 

My girlfriend has a ~2013 Lenovo laptop that has seen better days. As it stands right now, among some other issues, her keyboard totally doesn't work. Because of this, she always uses a small bluetooth keyboard with her laptop.

&amp;nbsp;

She had texted me the next morning saying that her wireless keyboard had stopped working as well. We had already planned for me to stay the night at her place after I got off work, so I offered to stop by my place on the way to grab her a keyboard, as I have a few extras.

&amp;nbsp;

When I got to her place, she was eagerly awaiting the keyboard, which makes sense, as she wasn't able to use her computer for most of the day. But when I handed her the keyboard, she started getting really quiet and pouty. A bit later, when I asked her what was wrong, she said she thought I'd be bringing her something nicer, like the keyboard I have at my desk.

&amp;nbsp;

The thing is, I have a really nice keyboard at my desk. I'm a programmer, and I love this keyboard so much that I also bring it to work with me. I even have specific macro profiles for it that definitely improve my workflow.

&amp;nbsp; 

For context, I had an extra Amazon Basics keyboard lying around, still brand new in the box. My personal keyboard, which I've had for years, is some variant of the Razer Blackwidow.

&amp;nbsp; 

Anyway, she was apparently expecting me to be 'selfless' and let her use my nice keyboard while I used the Amazon keyboard. She was upset that I didn't ""value her enough"" to lend her my nice posessions, and left her with the ""cheap $10 keyboard"" (her words). She said if the situation was reversed, she'd lend me the nice keyboard. I explained to her that I have my keyboard specifically set up for work, and because I'm so used to it, it would hinder my ability to do work if I didn't have it.

 &amp;nbsp;

We continued to argue about it. Things really came to a head when she boldly claimed that if I wasn't willing to lend her my nice keyboard, that I ""should have bought her a nice new keyboard if I really cared about her."" This is when I got really mad. I told her she was acting like an entitled, spoiled child and that she should have been grateful that I went out of my way in the first place to grab her the Amazon keyboard. She started crying and asked me to go home. I left, but I still gave her the Amazon keyboard to use. I was far more upset at the principle of the situation than the keyboard itself.

&amp;nbsp;

So now she's calling me an asshole for both not giving her my keyboard AND because I called her spoiled. We're going to meet up tomorrow to talk about this in person because I refused to continue this silly argument over text.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm thinking about ending things with her, as I feel like this is her showing me her true colors.

TL;DR: GFs keyboard broke. I lent her one of my extras, and she got upset that it was a 'cheap' keyboard. I called her spoiled, which infuriated her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bqh813/gf_and_i_26mf_got_into_a_huge_fight_over_a/,relationship_advice,4588,704,0.0
benreeze3,2019-05-19 07:09:44+00:00,My (M22) girlfriend (F22) has a guy friend that makes me uncomfortable.,"So to start off, we have been in a LDR for the past 2.5 of a 3 year relationship. We see each other every other week, or 2 weeks (only a 3 hour drive away). 

So, to start off, my girlfriend is moderately introverted and has some issues with making friends. About 6 months ago she started chatting with a guy online that they share a common interest (playing video games). The first 3 months, they just we getting to be better friends and the really hit it off. I didn’t realize to the extent that this friendship had grown up until about 3 months ago. They text/communicate everyday (on multiple different platforms), they’ve talked on the phone, and play video games together. When we are physically with each other, she’s texting him, everyday. And at this point, I feel like she’s hiding it from me due to her knowledge of my feelings.

At the beginning of their friendship, I noticed that she had more of an ambition to play video games with him than me. Which rubbed me the wrong way, being in a LDR, it was a way for us to feel closer to each other. This was the start of this issue that has just grown tremendously. We talked about it, and I expressed my feelings that I felt like I was getting replaced because I felt like she would rather spend time playing video games with him, or texting with him than me. As things progressed, it became a very contentious aspect of our relationship for more reasons, primarily due to my growing insecurities that we never fully addressed/understood by her. So about 2 months ago, he finally admitted that he had feelings for her, and that it wasn’t something that he wanted to happen, but did. At this point, I though it would be a good time for her to take a break from the friendship, but a different idea arose. They both mutually agreed to pretend it never happened, and that’s what they did (despite me stating my views). I was very uncomfortable with this decision because I felt my girlfriend was provoking his emotions by not allowing them to be dealt with properly. 

It got to the point where he can’t come up in conversation because either I get jealous, or she gets defensive. I still wholeheartedly believe that he has feelings for her, but my girlfriend refuses to acknowledge it. Being how contentious the subject has become in our relationship, I feel like she is hiding aspects of her friendship from me to spare us from a fight. No matter how I’ve tried to approach a resolution, it never seems to be something that is understood. At this point I feel like I’m becoming so paranoid of their friendship and talking about because the arguments have only gotten more frustrating on both sides.

At the end of the day, I love this woman, so much. But the longer that this situation goes on without any sort of resolution, the further I feel us drifting away. I don’t know how to express my feelings any more than I already have, and it feels like almost nothing has changed. I’m out of ideas and need help!

TLDR: girlfriend has a guy friend that likes her and it’s pushing our relationship apart.

EDIT: He lives over 5 hours away by plane, so I’m not worried about physical cheating by any means.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bqdz10/my_m22_girlfriend_f22_has_a_guy_friend_that_makes/,relationship_advice,5342,960,0.0
Bu4w325rn,2019-05-18 17:04:06+00:00,My (22M) girlfriend (22) has transitioned to male and now I feel trapped in the relationship,"  

Before I begin let me just establish this. If I say ""she"" then I'm talking in the past/before and if I say ""he"" I'm referring to the present/now.  I am male, and they shall also be hereby known as X. 

A bit of context. So I met X in high school, we were both 15 when she moved to town and we hit it off immediately becoming good friends. We were quite comfortably platonic till university. We went to different ones in the same city (her for art me for engineering) and in second year none of her mates had space in their flats so she moved in with me and a couple of my mates. It was in this year we got intimate and grew to truly love each other. I am now in my 4th and final year, X is looking for work and we both live alone together. Our relationship has been steady since then. 

Now, X has struggled with depression and anxiety since she was young, and while I can't pretend to know what it's like (my head is mercifully clear) I've always tried to be supportive. Whenever she was suffering badly in her first year at Uni I would come over to be with her. We'd eat a pizza, play mario kart and I'd act like everything was normal and alright. She said it helped and I was really glad about that.

But here's the thing. About 2 months ago she had a really rough spot, worse than she had had in the past and eventually one evening told me that she didn't feel right as a woman and needs to start presenting as a man. She had been so down over the last week because she didn't want to tell me for fear she would lose me. I'll be honest I didn't really know how to take that one and after an agonising silence I hugged her, said I was there for her and would be supportive. I reasoned that this was a person I loved, so that shouldn't change. Plus I figured from all I had ever heard about transitioning this was going to be hard and I didn't want to make it worse by being un-receptive. From there it was an evening with a lot of crying and a lot of talking but all seemed like it would be alright.

So over the few days *he* seems to feel significantly better. A couple of days later he made a post about it on facebook and got almost nothing but support. His parents are fairly progressive and, I mean, his art school buddies seemed overjoyed. He blocked anyone who left laughing emotes or snide comments, but there were very few of those. I got a few comedy messages from mates but overall it seemed to be accepted by his social circle. Later that week he got a haircut, and I took him to get some new clothes. He also started deepening his voice a bit, though it took him a while to settle on one.  He continues to have a fair amount of struggles with it in day to day live, not everyone in the world is receptive and he is still getting a lot of mis-gendering but it has been going better than I was expecting. The whole experience has given me a deeper compassion for the hardships that come with being trans. 

However, here is the thing. I'm pencil straight. I have gay family members, I grew up thinking it was normal, I even had a night in my wild first Uni year where I got with a guy who was hitting on me but it ain't for me. Over the last 2 months as he has continued his transition and has even started looking into surgery I have felt the spark of sexual attraction fade. It has become a running joke with most people I know that ""X turned \_\_\_ gay"" and I hate to admit it but it has started really getting to me. It doesn't help that he doesn't want anything done in the front due to it not aligning with his gender and I don't like anal (giving, and there's no value for either of us in me taking). I still like him, we still have a good rapport and I do want to be supportive, but I see no future in this relationship any more. My problem is I'm scared of what will happen if I try to break up. So much of his fear about coming out with this was about losing me and what will people think of me when the story is inevitably paraphrased to ""he broke up with him because he was trans"". Both our names are on the lease, but neither one of us could pay for the place alone. Hell, I asked my parents what they thought and they said I should try to be a little more open minded and stick it out, it could just be a rough patch and that I'm struggling to adapt. But it's not, I admit it's on me but I can't see my feelings changing. I have talked to a few of my close mates and they basically just say ""glad I'm not you"" jokingly and try to move the conversation on. I just don't know what to do now and I'm feeling trapped in this relationship. What the hell do I do, how do I approach this with him and how do I end the relationship without hurting him and ostracising myself",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bq67iq/my_22m_girlfriend_22_has_transitioned_to_male_and/,relationship_advice,2747,463,0.0

Thanks everyone for some super helpful suggestions for a range of different scenarios. Not so much thanks to the many people who inboxed me asking for photos... 

My boyfriend and I went abroad to a wedding this past weekend, a family friend of his, so with a lot of his family and friends. I was a little worried about it because it seemed like a prime time for people to be commenting on our relationship. Well, I wasn’t wrong. Most comments were pretty well intentioned (from his friends and family), but I actually find these almost harder to respond to than the blatantly rude ones because it’s hard to strike a balance between polite but still letting them know it’s inappropriate. I went with what a lot of people suggested and just turned it back around (when someone said ‘how’d you snag this one?’ I jumped in with ‘I was just lucky, I guess’). As people were drinking there was one or two slightly more rude comments. One guy said (jokingly, but still) ‘damn, what’re you doing with this guy!’ so I pulled my bf into me and said gave a sly wink and said ‘oooo, that’s between me and him’ which everyone laughed at. 

Anyway, we ended up having a big discussion about it. He said he’s getting used to it and trying not to let it really bother him so much, and that I shouldn’t be offended or upset on his behalf. Pretty sure this is the man I want to marry so we’re just going to have to find a way to get overcome it. Was good to hear in some of your comments that it just becomes a non-issue after a while.

ConverseShark,2019-05-17 01:06:29+00:00,Update on the boyfriend not wanting to wear a condom,"First I just wanted to say thanks to everyone who commented, y’all helped a lot! Sorry about any grammar mistakes, on mobile again. 

So, I took the advice and talked to him. I stood my ground, and gave him an ultimatum: condom or no sex. He tried pushing it abit, saying “trust me babe. I’m not gonna get you pregnant. Why won’t you just trust me?” He thought I would just cave in to him, like I had done before. When I didn’t cave, he said “fine. No sex.”  There was no flirting, no teasing, and nothing sexual for the next few days. I’m guessing he thought I would cave but I can be a stubborn little fuck when I want to be- and I wanted to be one right now. 

I’m guessing he had his first “oh shit, she’s serious” moment when we were at his place, just hanging and he started teasing me. Little kisses here and there- his way of trying to get me a bit hot. He went about kissing my neck, and tried to slide my hands down his pants. I stopped him, backed up a bit, and asked “will you wear a condom?” He looked shocked for a second, gave me a weird look, shook his head quickly and said “no”. I gave him a grin and said “okay. No sex then” and hopped off the bed. The look on his face was priceless!!! 

He was grumpy for the rest of the day, and tried again the next day. Before anything happened, I asked him, “will you wear a condom?” And got the same answer. I gave him the same answer that I did the day before. 

The next day he gave in. Said he would wear a condom. 

Thank you again if you commented on my other post. Y’all gave me the courage to stand my ground and I’m proud that I did:)

AlternateAlbus,2019-05-16 22:41:43+00:00,I (24M) am thinking about breaking off the engagement to my fiancee (24F) who has let herself go.,"Fiancee (24F) and I (24M) have been together for the last 7 years. When we first started dating (senior year of high school), we were both fit. At the time, I was 6'2"", 190 and she was 5'5"", 155. 

By the time college graduation time, I was 6'3"", 205 and when she graduated she was 5'6"", 230. This was in December of 2017.

I know people are extremely sensitive about weight and I know I'm going to get all the comments calling me a pig, a loser, etc., etc. But physical attraction is huge in any relationship and it's beginning to affect mine.

Anyways, I still was in love with who my fiancee was as a person and I was still confident that she was going to get her weight under control. So last September I proposed to her. Our wedding date was set for January 4th, 2020. But now I think proposing might have been a mistake... 

Around December of last year, I began to second-guess my decision. She hasn't lost any weight from the time she graduated (still 230) and she's really lazy and unmotivated to work out or diet. We've had 4 huge arguments about her weight since the engagement (with probably 5 more before we got engaged as well). After each argument I think I've finally got through to her, but the weight stays on or gets worse. 

Over the last several months it's got to the point where it's almost hard to look at her because her now pronounced double chin and gut are just so unattractive to me. And this really, really, really scares me. It also makes me feel like I'm some judgmental fucking piece of shit. Here is this woman who has given me all of her love and who I've spent 7 long years with, and I'm picking her apart with my eyes every day. It hurts to lose physical attraction like that with the one you love. It's like I've worked so hard to build this relationship with this woman, who at one point in time I was *so* attracted to physically, only to have it begin to crumble. It's an awful, nagging, self-hating feeling that I feel each day. But I feel trapped. I can't escape this feeling that I'm no longer attracted to her. I wish I could just see past the weight gain, but I just can't anymore. And I've made it 100x worse by proposing to her. I've made our relationship that much more public and it kills me to think of how publicly embarrassing it would be for her if I called off our engagement. 

It's like half of me is like ""You idiot, LEAVE NOW, before it becomes legal and that much more messy. You aren't attracted to her anymore and it's not going to get better."" 

Whereas, the other half of me is thinking ""She's such a loving, caring woman, who you've spent so many great years with. Can't you just be happy with her? Plus, do you really want to set off the social atom bomb that is calling off the engagement?""

We have 7 1/2 months until our wedding so if I'm going to do this, I know I NEED to do it soon. I wouldn't want to call it off any later than 6 months prior to the wedding (July 4th).

So I made a mistake tonight..and I'm ashamed of myself because this was completely out of character for me..but now I need to fess up. I'm going to give a bit of context and then sum up my questions underneath.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend left her laptop with me because it died and she needed me to try to recover family photos and documents from the last 7 years that would have all been lost. While transferring the data I was popping in and out of folders to make sure everything was being captured, when a particular phrase on one of the screenshots in a photo folder caught my eye..something she says to me often and we've come to sort of associate the phrase with us. The screenshot was her confession of love to someone she was with before I was around, ending with that quote, our quote.

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't leave well enough alone..and the next thing I knew I had opened up her internet browser..sure enough facebook was logged in. and I searched that phrase in the conversation history. There were..more than a few results. I read through some of them, more than I'd like to admit. I couldn't believe how many guys she had dated before me, she had never hidden it from me. I knew she had dated alot more people than I had, but the number of guys..I wasn't expecting it. Many of them she had said similar or the exact same things she says to me. Some conversations she had even sent out the same ""intimate"" photos I received from her when we started dating. (some of the guys were within a short span and didn't last very long) I'm a little hurt to be honest. Alot of the things I thought were exclusive to us were not, is this normal? I've always intentionally avoided saying things I used to say to exes.

&amp;#x200B;

That aside, I know I messed up. I completely betrayed her trust by going through all those conversations and I need to come clean about it. On one hand I'm a little hurt..on the other I shouldn't have even known about this.  How can I discuss this with my partner in a healthy way? Is it fair for me to feel a little hurt at the same time?

&amp;#x200B;

 TL;DR I snooped through my girlfriend's facebook chats with her exes and realized she says the exact same things to me that she said to all of them, and I feel bad for violating her trust and need to confess to her what I did.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bpb6eg/i_22m_crossed_a_major_boundary_how_do_we_21f_talk/,relationship_advice,4748,855,0.0

It is annoying, however, that people comment a post is fake but it is still upvoted? I know people want entertainment but this is for relationship advice and it means that when people with less interesting lives need advice, they’re almost completely ignored because someone decided to post about missing socks.  
Stop it. There are legit subs for writing, r/writingprompts, r/nosleep to name a few. Don’t use an advice sub because you want karma, and don’t give karma when the story is obviously not real. I mean, most of the time the crazy stories that get posted here just have joke comments anyway. So they’re not even getting advice if it IS real.

Throwaway16644432,2019-05-16 03:29:26+00:00,I (m27) think that my girlfriend (f26) did something horrible.,"My girlfriend becomes hyper focused on things to a fault.  She will literally neglect everything and everyone in her life until she gets what she is focused on, or until she gets bored and moves along to the next thing.  I used to think it was cute, until it started negatively affecting our relationship on an almost monthly basis.  If she decided that she wanted something (a new pet, for example), she HAD to have it and if I attempted to convince her that she didn’t need it or to wait, I was instantly attacked and accused of being unsupportive, controlling, abusive, etc.

I thought that was the worst of it until this week.  A few days ago, my girlfriend decided she didn’t like my car (a reliable 2004 Jeep that gets us safely from point A to point B), and wanted to get a new one.  We are a single car household, and have two children.  She wanted a car with more space, and was relatively new.  It was absolutely not in our budget.  I’m the only one that works in our house.  She has never had a job, and could not afford to make payments on her car when her mother stopped paying for it, so it got repo’d two years ago.  I voiced my concerns about our budget, and told her that I’m already working 50+ hour weeks with an hour commute each way; I literally had no way (and no reason) to come up with that money.  She exploded, called me financially abusive, said that I kept her locked up in our house all day (I’ve spent the last four years attempting to help her get a job.  I would have loved nothing more than to see her find success in a career *outside of our house.*)  I put my foot down and told her it wasn’t going to happen any time soon.  I thought this was the end of it.

The next day, she latched on to that same idea of a new car, and mentioned a “funny, but actually pretty clever idea” that she saw in a mom’s group on Facebook.  I was still trying to at least hear her out at this point, so I asked her about it.  The post suggested crashing your car (on fucking purpose) in a way that would minimize risk of injury, and maximize risk of totaling the car, all while appearing like an accident that insurance companies would cover.  I was fucking dumbfounded.  I thought she was joking.  She immediately got offended and was adamant that it was a good idea, plus if I ended up getting injured (yeah, somehow I became a part of this fucking plan without even knowing it), I could sue for damages because my dad is a personal injury attorney.  I was scared, insulted, livid at the fact that she would suggest something so reckless and inconsiderate towards my safety just for a *chance* at a new car.  

Days passed, and I thought that was the end of it (nope).  Yesterday morning, she takes my car to drop off our daughter at school.  An hour or so later, she still isn’t back, and I started to get worried.  I received a call from the local ER saying that she had been in a car accident, but was in stable condition and they needed me to get there soon.  All I could think was “holy shit, I really hope she’s ok.”  I didn’t even stop to remember our conversation from the days before.

When I arrived at the ER, something seemed off.  The nurses were very short with me and her, and a police officer was trying to interview her for the accident report.  I walked in to the room, and she seemed so happy to see me, and I was relieved that she was ok.  After I talked with her for a bit, the officer asked me to step outside.  His next words hit me like a fucking brick.

“Has your girlfriend ever threatened or attempted to commit suicide?”  I was shocked.  “No.  She hasn’t.  Why?”

“Does she have a history of seizures?”  Again, no she didn’t.

“There are multiple witnesses that state she flew through an intersection and slammed into the other car head on.  The two other people in that car were a mother and her little boy, and they’re both in critical condition upstairs.”  My jaw dropped.  

I’m sitting here in the police station about to give a statement that will probably end up putting the mother of my children in a psych ward or behind bars for years at the least.  I have no idea what to say, or how to approach this.  I feel responsible for everything that happened, but I had no idea that she would have taken everything this far.  

I don’t know what to do.  Part of me feels guilty, and a bigger part is just disgusted with her.  How am I supposed to handle this?  I absolutely can not be with her anymore, and fear for the safety of my children around her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bp7phd/i_m27_think_that_my_girlfriend_f26_did_something/,relationship_advice,17202,2980,0.0
awillis0513,2019-05-15 22:32:01+00:00,My (33F) divorce from my husband (35M) of two years is official today! I just thought I’d share some tips I could have used before I got married...,"As of 3:10PM today, my divorce is final.  My ex-husband showed up in shorts, wearing a beanie to cover his unwashed hair, and a t-shirt that was too small.  I separated from him after he refused (yup) to get a full-time job.  Here’s a few pieces of advice I could have used:

1.  Your spouse isn’t going to change from the person they were when you were dating.  If they were lazy then, they’ll only be lazier once they nail you down.
2.  If your significant other has a sloppy house, they’ll just make the one you share sloppy.  This was a huge pet peeve for me.  My ex had a disgusting home before and I should have known what was coming to me.
3.  Hygiene matters.  Hence, what I have written above.
4.  If ambition matters to you, don’t accept less in your partner.  I’m a financial advisor who has always worked hard.  I resented that my ex wasn’t interested in doing more than teach a handful of guitar lessons a week between smoking pot and playing video games.
5.  If your family and friends don’t like your partner, then there’s a reason.  Seriously, I wish I had listened to every one of them.
6.  Don’t marry anyone who won’t get out of bed before 2pm who doesn’t work third shift.  Seriously...seriously.
7.  If you’re not sexually attracted to your partner, don’t overlook this.  I loved him and thought hat was enough to overcome this factor.  Guess what, it wasn’t.
8.  Understand what you deserve and don’t settle for less.  I have had issues with this historically.  It won’t happen again after this.
9.  If your partner only talks about themselves, that’s a huge sign of their ability to be in a relationship.
10.  If your partner’s parents are always making excuses for them and always giving them an out, then run for the fucking hills.  They have been enabled to fail their entire lives.

Good luck out there ladies and gents.  Don’t make my mistakes!",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bp4m4n/my_33f_divorce_from_my_husband_35m_of_two_years/,relationship_advice,1390,121,0.0
HorrorPreference,2019-05-15 20:54:02+00:00,My [36M] Wife [35F] Slept Her Ex After Their Son's Funeral. I Need Advice Handling The Fallout,"My wife and I have been together for 5 years. My Stepson (12) had been battling illness for almost his entire life and recently lost his fight. I loved him from the moment I met him and it feels like my world is falling apart. With the costs the last few months of his life adding up I had taken on more hours at work to provide for his needs as well as pay for therapy both for my wife and I to learn how to remain a unit and support each other during this time as well as individually.

My stepson's biological father didn't often see his son nor does he generally get along with my wife, mostly just coming whenever he felt like it and taking him out for a few hours. I disagreed with this, but my stepson loved his father and it wasn't my place to try to separate them so I did my best to just be a good parental figure to him as well. He attended the service and seemed heartbroken. My wife spent a lot of the service with him and they consoled each other, which I do understand the shared connection as parents but it hurt as I'm also struggling greatly and felt like a parent to him as well. I had planned to discuss it with her after the dust cleared, because I wasn't going to prioritize my feelings at such a time.

That chance never came, because a few days after the service my wife had told me her ex wanted to meet up with her to discuss their son's belongings, photo albums, etc. Naturally I had no problem with that, as I had already kept the things that were sentimental to me. Long story short, my wife came back in tears and confessed that while at his place, they slept together and it wasn't planned and begged forgiveness.

I already know I have to leave. My mental health is hanging on by a thread, and the loss of both a child I considered a son and a betrayal by the only person I had to lean on is too much. But I also know that grief makes people to stupid things, and everyone handles things their own way. If I'm in this much pain, I don't know how she copes with how much pain she's in. I know she didn't intend to hurt me, and that she's a good person who was hurting and looking for comfort, so while I know myself enough to know for my own sanity I can't stay in this marriage, I love her enough to want to be a friend and continue to support her emotionally. 

My question is people who have left their spouse, especially during difficult times, and remained friends, how did you do it? What steps did you take to end the romantic relationship with no bad blood and transition into a different type of relationship with them? She's extremely vulnerable and feels completely alone, how do I leave someone in that position and tell them I want a divorce while still making it clear I care for them and am willing to be a friend in their time of need? Lastly, if any of you have ever lost a child, how did you start to heal?

TL;DR Lost my stepson to illness. Wife and biological father slept together. Looking to leave on good terms while still being supportive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bp3esw/my_36m_wife_35f_slept_her_ex_after_their_sons/,relationship_advice,1039,547,0.0

So, I tried it. I thought that maybe I was being too close minded and so I went for it. It went fine, but it still really isnt my thing. But here's the bad part.

She didnt like it at all. Even though we were slow, used condom and lube, she said it was uncomfortable. This would be fine, and something that we could move on from, but she is blaming me. She says that I sabotaged it because I didnt want to do it. But i didnt. I did it exactly how she asked me to, in terms of speed, how hard i went, plus the amount of lube used. She was really the director here. But somehow it's my fault she didnt like it.

Im pretty livid about this. I went out on a limb to try something i didnt want to, just to make her happy. And I feel like after all that she is finding a way to make this my fault. It feels like she built this up in her head too much, and since it didnt live up to it she assumes I ruined it on purpose. We had a fight over this and we broke up.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/bebicq/my\_22m\_girlfriend\_20f\_tried\_to\_catfish\_me\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bebicq/my_22m_girlfriend_20f_tried_to_catfish_me_on/)

Hello again, since the last post I had decided to defer any action until after my exams, to try and minimise the chaos from any fallout, for any parties involved. Things didn't quite go the way I'd planned though.

It amazes me this happened again. So recently on instagram, I'd been liking a lot of pictures to do with lego. This happened to gain me a lot of followers from lego fan accounts, and I'd mentioned this to my girlfriend about how strange it was. Then just 5 minutes after telling her another account follows me, with a username along the lines of 'legoaccount'. I literally watched the account form in front of my eyes as it followed me and liked a series of my pictures. Every time I checked the profile, it had more details suddenly filled in - profile picture, bio, etc. It followed the exact same format as the fake twitter account, praying on a hobby of mine she doesn't share, with a bio saying they'll post new content soon, looking to make friends, and messaging me saying they liked my stuff and wanted to chat. I reverse image searched the instagram profile and found it was from a girl off tiktok. Of course, it was almost certainly my girlfriend who made the account, so I just ignored the accounts messages. The messages from the account got more and more extreme, calling my girlfriend a slut and sending full naked pictures. I logged into the legoaccount from my girlfriend's password I knew, and sure enough it was her.

That night she must have felt particularly bold, because around the same time I got another account popping up on twitter, this time targeting coding. This time was even sloppier than even the instagram account, and I was getting so sick of these endless fake accounts, so I just said ""hi &lt;girlfriend's name&gt;"" and the account instantly blocked me. I checked instagram and that account had blocked me too. Then my girlfriend messages me saying she keeps getting emails from her account, and asks if I tried to log in. I just explained that I knew she'd been setting up fake accounts, and asked her why she did it. She IMMEDIATELY starts accusing me of things.

For backstory, the reason I knew her password is because a close friend of hers had her password and was logging into her accounts and stealing private pictures. Of course, since telling her I was logging into her fake accounts, she accused me of logging into her main accounts (which I hadnt), and being as bad as her friend that was stealing her private pictures. She accused me of being insensitive to the harm that caused her, and said how she couldn't believe that I didn't trust her, so much that I'd think it was her and log into her accounts. She even accused me of checking if the accounts were her so that it would be ""clear for me to flirt with them"". At no point did she acknowledge how unusual that behaviour was. She asks me to block her, and I don't, and then the conversation moves on to her saying how I don't care about her and how one of her other guy friends is the only guy that compliments her. This is between exams, so I didn't want to kick up so much of a fuss, but I was astounded that she still acted like she had done exactly 0 wrong.

It isn't brought up again for a couple of weeks, until about two days ago. Mid conversation, she had been saying there's probably lots of girls in my instagram search history, and I said the only girls in my instagram search history were from when I was reverse image searching the fake accounts. She immediately jumps to saying that I saved nudes, because I had to save pictures to have performed the reverse image search, and she said how the profile pics were lewd (the profiles that I saved weren't). She accuses me of having the nudes still saved (I actually deleted ALL pictures I used for reverse search, none of which were nsfw) and she accused me of getting off to them. She even questions me using plural ""accounts"" and says she only had 1 account, even though I managed to log into at least 2 with her password. She keeps repeating this point that I was saving nudes (I wasnt), to completely deflect from me saying she set up fake accounts. She says to me she would rather be catfished than to find out her bf has been saving other girls nudes. 

The only way she shows any form of remorse, is to say that we were BOTH in the wrong. She tries to deflect the conversation to say about how sad she is etc and I say to her she's changing the subject, which she then accuses ME of changing the subject because I keep insisting I didn't save nudes. The conversation ends with her saying she's going to talk to one of her friends that actually acknowledges her feelings, and then she ignores me for the rest of the day.

No apology, no real acknowledgement, no explanation. Consistent lies. I'm at a loss here, guys. How can I get through to her? Is there even any point?

husfluga,2019-05-14 19:01:31+00:00,My (F28) boyfriend (M33) says he’s disgusted by my body hair and I have to laser remove it and pay for it or else he’ll leave me. He says I’m not taking his happiness into consideration and if I can’t sacrifice this for him what else won’t I be willing to sacrifice down the road.,"I’ve been dating my boyfriend for 14 months. A few days ago he confessed he is disgusted by my body hair and wants me to get laser done on my forearms, private area and legs.

At first I said no because I accept my body as it is and he’s never expressed any complains about my hair before. Tbh you can’t really see my forearm hair, it’s just a bit of very subtle blonde hair, I wax my legs once a month and groom my private area as often as needed. I’m not even a hairy person.

He elaborated on how it disgusts him to look at it and gags at the thought of touching it. At first I thought he was looking for a dumb excuse to break up but he was dead serious about it.

So I agreed to compromise and bleach my forearm hair because I don’t want to wax or shave it. He said even if bleaching it would make the hair practically invisible he’d still know it’s there and feel disgusted about it. He told me I had to get it permanently laser removed as well as my crotch and legs. I said I don’t mind having my legs done with laser, but I’m not even sure they can fully and completely remove all of the hair in my crotch area and while I don’t mind temporarily fully shaving/waxing it if that makes him happy, I don’t want to have all of it laser removed because that’s my choice and I don’t feel I should be pressured into doing it.

I compromised and agreed to at least think about lasering the crotch area but if he wanted me to laser remove my forearms and legs it was only fair he’d pay for it.

He refused saying it doesn’t cost that much and since it’d be a permanent improvement on my body and I’d be the one benefiting from it, I should be the one paying for it. I took offense to these comments because I don’t consider lasering body hair an ‘upgrade’ or ‘body improvement’.

I asked again if he was looking to start a fight to break up because the situation seemed too bizarre. He said if I wasn’t willing to sacrifice something this silly to make him happy what else wouldn’t I be willing to sacrifice further down the road? He said he loves me and wants to build a future together but I’m not taking his happiness into consideration and this is a deal breaker for him.

This past few days –we don’t live together- he’s been sending me messages with quotes from different laser hair removal salons and telling me to make a decision already, and that I’m the love of his life but I have to learn to budge to make this relationship work.

To be honest this whole thing has greatly put me off him and I’m reconsidering if this is the person I want to be with. I feel pressured to change something about me he’s –and I- never had an issue with and I feel he’s given me an ultimatum to chose, I either laser my body and pay for it to please him or he leaves me.

**TL;DR** Bf wants me to laser remove all my body hair -and pay for it- or else it's a deal breaker because it means I'm not willing to sacrifice for him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bon0vx/my_f28_boyfriend_m33_says_hes_disgusted_by_my/,relationship_advice,2179,1297,0.0

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to wait a few days before I updated you guys, just because it was a first date and we didn't know each other previously. I wanted her to still be talking to me for a few days afterwards.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I picked her up from her house and I was in awe of how beautiful she looked. She got in and we figured out where to get fro yo, and when we got to the store, she asked me to read all the flavors to her. Of course, I did, then grabbed us some sample cups. She got pistachio, lavender blueberry, and either vanilla or classic tart. She left the last one a secret to me. I got classic tart and the lavender blueberry with some blueberries on top. We started the conversation on our frozen creations and delved into deeper conversation. Unfortunately, there were some loud little kids so we could barely hear each other, but we still enjoyed each other's company.  We got back in the car, and I went to drop her off, and she invited me in to watch a movie! She wanted to spend more time with me, yes!! She handed me the remote and said to pick whatever, so I picked one of my favorite scary movies, and started it. During the opening scene she brought up the fact if I've ever been around someone who couldn't see. I told her no, and we kinda got back into the movie, bringing up odd conversation here and there. After the movie, I went home, pretty giddy from the experience.

&amp;#x200B;

We're still talking, thankfully, and we're planning on when to meet up next. She's just sick right now, so it's hard to plan around that. I'm excited for our next date!

TLDR; The date went amazingly and we're planning for date #2 and I really had nothing to worry about in the end.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/boj8kp/update_i_19f_have_a_date_19f_tonight_shes/,relationship_advice,6157,412,0.0
throwawaymyl1fepls,2019-05-13 22:48:00+00:00,UPDATE2: My GF was raped and became pregnant. I broke up with her after she decided to keep the baby,"Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/

TLDR: My GF was raped. Wanted to abort. Talked to mother. Decided not to abort. I left her. 

Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blird0/update_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/

TLDR: GF calls me, reveals Mum made her not get an abortion because GOD CARES. She wants me back and arranges for abortion she wanted all along. Some of Reddit think I'm a baby killer.


I was hoping to post here again after the abortion (still scheduled for two weeks time), but I thought I should provide an update on some recent events from a Mother from the pits of Satan's rectum.

On Saturday, I answered my door and stood face to face with two police officers. They asked me if I was who I was, and I replied I was. They then said they were looking for my GF. I called her over, and the police officer said that he needs to have a word with her.

The officers then split, one taking the GF to the living room (we let them in) and the other took me into my bedroom.

The officer who took me started asking me questions about how long GF had been here. If she had any contact with anyone else. If she had left the house at all...and a few other questions. I answered, and then asked what this was about, but the officer just said they received a report to check in on GF. I asked who reported, and the officer said he couldn't say. 

After a while, the other officer was done, and they both left. The moment they left, my GF told me that she was outrightly asked if she was in danger, and if I had been hurting her. She was also asked if she was being held against her will. She said no to everything, of course. She said that the police received a call from her Mother saying she might be in danger, and that I could be abusive her.

I was fucking livid. I immediately said I was going to press charges against her - for what? I dunno. Harrassment probably?

My GF begged me to not, and said that it would all just blow over, and that she just needs time to ""calm down"".

Wtf? She sent police to my house to get me arrested. How is that sane thinking? I could lose my job if I was arrested and charged. What the hell is she thinking?

I told GF that if the Mother does anything like this again, I will definitely press charges. So the GF decides on Sunday to talk to the Mum to not do anything like this again.

They had a conversation for about 2 minutes, then I start hearing sobs. Immediately, I walked into the room, saw my GF was crying, still holding the phone against her ear. 

I plucked he phone from her hand, and held her for a bit as I heard ""hello?"" From the phone. Then I put it on me, and said ""you're a disgrace of a Mother"" and hung up.

Then I held the GF for what felt like an hour before we started talking.

Apparently, the Mother was telling GF how if she continues with the abortion, she will never see the Mother again, or her brother, or her deceased Father (who is in heaven, even though he died a drink violent alcoholic who beat GF, but hey, repent your sins at death, amiright?) because GF would be going to damnation.

I told GF that if she was going to hell, then she should save me a seat, and we'd be nice and toasty together. I love her smile.

What do you think, if anything, should I do about the Mother? No doubt my words to her will have some reactions.


Response to some people from previous threads and PMs after thread was locked:

1 - Abortion was never an option. GF was adamant she wanted to raise the baby, influenced by her Mother. And if you suggest adoption anyway, then you truly do not understand just how taxing a normal pregnancy is, let alone one dipped in a beautiful cocktail of rape depression.

2 - You can believe my GF cheated on me if that makes you feel better about your lives, I suppose.  Just FYI, the pictures and roommates report showed she had a bloodied nose, black eyes, cuts and bruises against her arms, hands and knees, torn coat and top, bruises around her neck.

whataboutthekids,2019-05-13 09:28:58+00:00,Update. Caught my wife cheating. What about her kids.,"TL;DR I informed the ex that we would divorce and made arrangements for visitation.

Sorry this update might be jumbled I originally updated in the wrong sub. This is the umpteenth time I have written this out, each time it's shorter. I not sure how to cross post so I am retyping, bear with me. Last week was a busy week with daughter grad., moving her home, kids sports starting, lawyer, and the first face to face with wife. 

Got home Sunday, put daughter's stuff from apt. In garage. I get a call early evening from 14 yr. old. ""Dad what's going on. No one is talking to us. Mom and grandma are crying grandpa's yelling. Is this because of what I told you?"" I assured him that his mom made a bad mistake, that he had nothing to do with this mess. He asked if I was packing up there stuff because he saw the Uhaul in the driveway. I explained what happened and that all their stuff was remain there.

Monday and Wed. were sports nights. Family sits in bleachers while I stand behind home plate backstop. My usual spot since I don't see eye to eye with FIL. On the way across the field the oldest stops his warm up and rubs over to me. We hug and talk a few minutes then send him back. As I get my spot I have a 10 year old crash into me at full speed. I bend down hug and kiss him all over as he is squirming away. My FIL asks if we could talk. We step away from earshot. He apologizes for the way he has treated me in the past and that he was wrong. Well a little late but I accepted and said I knew that it was hard thing for him to do. He invited me to sit with them, I declined. He asked if I wanted to talk to wife. I said Thursday would be better, do we set tinne and place.

Tuesday comes meet with lawyer. I told him the whole story, he knew from his partner but wanted to hear from me. He asked what I wanted to do. I wanted to stay with the boys then stay married. The boys were most important.  He stated in his experience that the marriage would be a charade and not good for the boys. We could work out a visitation if wife is welling. As far as support he said I could do what I wanted for the boys. Not to give her anything for me to control. The prenup was solid, she violated conditions, no support. He cautioned though that judges around the country have in some instances ordered child support in my case due to being in their lives so long. He did not think our judges have ruled that way in tgge past but you never know. He was sure her attorney would seek support. He suggested that we try to agree on everything we could before court, the the judge would look favorably on us.

Before leaving he told me that every Monday morning the partners meet to discuss new and on going cases. My previous attorney started out describing everything. Each partner has a specialty. Estate Planning/Elder Law, Criminal, Liability, Family. Later in tgge pm the criminal lawyer meets up with my attorney. After the meeting he called a contact in the prosecutors office. The $15000 did not seem right. How do folks in the middle class have 15000 in cash laying around. Turns out ex did not abandon them he was in jail. He was released 3 yrs. ago, when Feds were releasing nonviolent criminals to ease overcrowding, etc. He was sure the police would be interested if he was back and practicing his profession again. But he did not have any other info but the jail time.

Thursday I meet with with and FIL. I asked if they minded if I recorded so there would be no misinterpretation latter. They agreed. Before we started wife wanted to talk privately.  FIL moved to another room. Wife started to apologize. I cut her off. I said before you say anything know that I know a lot more than you think. I asked how long the sex, she said the one time. I told her the video shows that is not true. I played a clip of her dusting the TV. She never saw the camera. I know it was only a few days but she was going to lie so I was too. She thought it was part of the video game. It's not big but it is obvious on top of tv. She admitted since March almost right away! I told her no more lies! I told her of the family secret, that he was in jail not running away. She admitted to this also. I asked how long in contact, since Feb. I asked if she met up anytime before him appearing she said no. I then told her he had been out for 3 years.  The look on her face told me she did not know.

We get FIL back in. Turn on recorder. I asked if she had a lawyer? No. Told her to get one because a divorce will happen. They both asked if something along reconciliation could take place, I said no. I said I wanted the boys, she could live with ex. I told her when speaking privately that ex tried to sell me the boys. I repeated for FIL. We settled on the boys could see me anytime within reason, she would not keep me from them. I said I would provide at my choosing. She would get no support. I did not want her getting the boys to ask me for things, they would be honest if I asked.

There you have it. One last thing, redditors the wife and I are avid readers of this site. We have our favorite subs. We would read and share, it was a thing we did together. She has read my post as she figured it out and she read every reply you made. She stated you ""savaged"" her. You said many things I only wish I could have because I did feel it.

backfromdeployment,2019-05-13 09:20:11+00:00,I'm 24M Soldier in the Army and that recently came back from an overseas assignment and my 23F wife gave birth to a black baby.,"Both my wife and I are white. 

  
I was assigned to Korea for 1 year, I did do a mid-tour visit back to the states to see my wife. We did have sex during this time. Shortly after I returned to Korea to finish out my remaining 6 months my wife informed me that she was pregnant.  I was legitimately excited about the prospect of being a father. Even invested in all the essentially baby stuff, my mom even went so far as to move in with us to help my wife especially as I was in Korea.

&amp;#x200B;

On Saturday my wife gave birth to a healthy black baby. My wife is saying the baby is mine and this is just weird way of how nature work but what I suspect really happened is she sleep around on me when I was overseas with a black man and he got her pregnant right around the time I came back to the states. 

&amp;#x200B;

I told her if she really believes this baby is mine then I want a DNA test to prove it, she countered with ""I should trust her"" i'm sorry but we are both white as can be, our parents are white, there isn't a hint of black in our family and after googling the possibility is basically seems its impossible for two white people to produce a black baby (as logic would dictate) 

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure what to do, currently sleeping on a buddy couch. Part of me still loves her, part of me hates her for cheating on me, the other part really hates for doubling down on the lie...my parents were there...her parents where there. Everyone was shocked when the baby was born.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bo17ki/im_24m_soldier_in_the_army_and_that_recently_came/,relationship_advice,1033,182,0.0
LunarIrelia,2019-05-13 08:27:11+00:00,I had sex with my best friend of 17 years last night,"Okay so, my best friend (22M) and I (21F) had sex for the first time last night. We've been best friends for 17 years. Never kissed, held hands, I can probably count on one hand the hugs we've had, basically we've always been like brother and sister. 

We used to have sleepovers every weekend when we were kids, now that we're young adults it's more like once a month and it's always been super natural for us, I mean it still is but I'll get to that.

I have no idea what came over us last night. We went out for drinks and he crashed at my place, like we always do. But this time (TMI) we started to touch each other and ended up having super loving sex. I mean, I would take a gunshot for this guy and he would do the same for me. I have never felt so loved like I felt by the way he touched me. It was a very wholesome situation haha.

Anyway, now im sitting here kinda stressed about where this will lead and the more I think about possibly losing him the more I feel like a complete idiot.

I don't actually believe I'll lose him, because we're so close. But I'm nervous for what comes next, what to say, what to do and in what order..

Important info about us: we're very chill with each other, we're not jealous people, we have a life time of inside jokes and way of acting with each other (We act like we're still kids) and our families are like one. We're from scandinavia (the rules said I had to put location).

So my questions are; what do you think i should do? 
Should I say something at all?
Have you gone through something similar and if so, what are you now?

Thanks for anyone who answers in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bo0tdt/i_had_sex_with_my_best_friend_of_17_years_last/,relationship_advice,1583,311,0.0
wife-,2019-05-13 03:59:29+00:00,My (23F) husband (36M) will only eat “kiddie food” and it’s ruining our relationship.,"My husband will only eat chicken nuggets, grilled cheese, and spaghetti-o’s. That’s it. When we go over to friends’ places he’ll actually bring some spaghetti-o’s to heat up in their microwave instead of eating anything else, even if our friends cooked a wonderful meal.

If we go out somewhere to eat he will only order chicken nuggets off the kid’s menu. If they don’t have them, he just won’t eat.

If I try to cook literally ANYTHING except one of his three food groups, he will claim he’s allergic to some random ingredient instead of just outright saying he doesn’t want to eat it. He’ll then try to guilt me for “forgetting” his allergy. Spoiler: We’ve been to the doctor and he’s not allergic to anything.

My husband just turned 36 this month. His food habits were sort of cute/acceptable when we were both in college and eating like trash, but now I’m genuinely worried about his health. I also find myself avoiding any sort of dining situations with our friends, which is so much harder than it sounds.

I’ve tried talking to him about his eating habits and just he brushes me off. Since I don’t cook his meals (the only victory I’ve had in this situation) he doesn’t think I have the right to “dictate” what he can and can’t eat.

I’m not his mother. I’m his wife. But I just want my husband, the man I love, to be healthy.

He started getting really into Twitch, which is fine; he can use his free time however he wants. However, in the last two weeks he has begun saying memes (I assume from Twitch) in real life and it is getting really annoying. For example: the other night we were out at dinner and a waiter dropped a plate. I turn to him to say ""oh my!"" and he looks at me with a straight face and says ""let's get some F's in the chat"". When I asked him why he said that, he replied ""it's a meme, you dip"" (which is apparently another meme). It's starting to feel like I am dating a 16 year old. I also have reason to believe he has begun donating to streamers (no idea if gals or guys).

sillybananna,2019-05-12 10:57:00+00:00,My boyfriend has a crush on my best friend.,"Okay, guys, I don’t even know where to start this whole day has been a whirlwind. I apologize as this is going to be a long one. Obligatory apology for formatting as I’m on mobile. 

Last night my on/off boyfriend came (uninvited) to the bar I was at with my friends. He was clearly coked out and half-in-the-bag. The first thing he said to me was “let me know if anyone here touches you, I’m in a fighting mood.” ?! What. I’m just trying to have a good night with my friends, why did he feel the need to show up here? 

A couple hours later, after many alcoholic beverages, me and my best friend decided to go over to his house with his friends for a night cap. Stupid, I know. We ended up staying all night, I stayed over because I left my house keys in our DDs car and my friend, I’ll call her Emilia, left late in the morning. 

In that time, him and Emilia had had “life chats” and he had spent most of his time ignoring me to talk to her. At one point when we were both washing our faces to take off the days’ makeup, he told her she had perfect skin and it didn’t even look like she took anything off, looked at me in the mirror, then followed her back into his room. I have struggled with acne for almost ten years. I’m twenty now. He knows I’m insecure about my skin. 

Anyways. After everyone else had gone home, I was left to take care of his drunk ass for hours until I finally just went out to the living room and fell asleep on the couch. I was rudely awakened moments later to him yelling on the phone, I asked him not once, twice, but three times to please talk in his room. He hung up and yelled at me saying I was keeping him from talking to his dad. ?! 

I got up and went back into his room and fell asleep. This time he woke me up telling me he needed to say something. “Look at me, *look* at me!” Then he tells me that he has a crush on Emilia, keep in mind this is their first time ever hanging out, and that she is the only person who’s ever listened to him or connected with him in that way. 

I can’t stress enough how much I have done for this dude. We have been on and off for **THREE** years. I have stayed up all night with him during his coke binges and supported him through trying to get clean, listened to his endless rants, gave him a place to stay when he didn’t have one, driven him to and from work for months when he didn’t have a running vehicle, used my CAA when his vehicles have broken down, picked him up in the middle of the night..... the list goes on and on. But I apparently have never listened to him or connected with him like Emilia has. 

Earlier this evening she texted me saying she hadn’t even opened his [message](https://imgur.com/a/zKlRFTU), I didn’t even know he had messaged her. I honestly don’t even know what to say about it, I’m kind of just baffled that three years of being together and all the time I’ve spent taking care of him has been all for not. That he can just throw it all away because he has a drunk crush on my *best* friend. 

Here is the part where I ask you, dear redditors, for advice. What do I do? I’ve already broken up with him, blocked him on everything, me and Emilia will remain friends of course but, how do I cope with the fact that the person I thought would always have my back, dropped me for her? How do I keep from resenting her for it? She is one of my favourite people in this world, I know that this is 100% not her fault, I just don’t want my emotions to take a toll on our friendship. Lastly, what is the best way to move on? Please share any stories you think would help or make me feel better. 

If you actually read this whole rant, thank you so, so kindly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bnnrut/my_boyfriend_has_a_crush_on_my_best_friend/,relationship_advice,5521,707,0.0

whazuu,2019-05-11 23:43:02+00:00,"I secretly had my aunt pick me up while on vacay with my bfs parents because they got us our own hotel room to ""do what adults do"". He's upset that I thought he was going to ""hurt"" me if we were alone.","The four of us are 18/19 finishing up freshman year of college.

We were having dinner together, (first time our parents were meeting) and they invited me to go on a trip with them to celebrate their two kids surviving freshman year of college (so did I). They told us I'd be sharing a room with their daughter and don't have to pay for a thing. Ofc I said yes.

When we were there, they got three hotel rooms. One for me and my boyfriend, his sister and her bf, and the two of them. I asked if I was staying with their daughter and they said no, and gave us condoms. Instead of being even slightly embarrassed or surprised, my boyfriend had a huge smile on and put his arms around me. Apparently they just told my parents that to give them some peace of mind, and they expected us ""adults to do what adults to"". I get that. But we aren't adults who do that. We've had that conversation more than once. He knows my boundaries. I'm far from ready for sex and I've never slept in the same bed as my boyfriend. He knows that and we've never made it past making out. I went on that trip thinking I was sharing a room with my friend, I didn't even know her boyfriend was coming until the VERY last minute. I had no clue about the arrangements, but everybody else did. I wouldn't have gone if knew this was the case because it's something I'm not comfortable with. 

I asked if his sister if we could share a room and she basically said no because...they had their own hotel room. At this point, I texted my mom asking her what to do. She offered to have my aunt (who lives there) pick me up and I said no. When my boyfriend said it was going to be a special night, I changed my mind ab my aunt.

I know I should have talked to him, but I didn't feel comfortable with that. It was too awkward and I felt pressured by literally everybody in that moment. It was like everyone expected us to have sex. The private room, condoms, out of state. I didn't have the courage to tell my boyfriend in our hotel room, with condoms his parents gave us, that we weren't having sex. How were we supposed to sleep in the same room that night, after that convo? What if he got mad at me? Where would I go? I just didn't feel like I was in the position to say no. He's never made me feel pressured, but we've never been in that position.

The entire night, the four of us (my bf, his sister and her bf) were up in our room just talking. I kept making excuses for them to stay and not leave, because I didn't want to be alone with him. I know he would never do anything I'm not comfortable with, but I didn't want to sleep in the same bed as him, and I didn't want to have that conversation. I also had NO idea what his expectations were, seeing that we were sharing a room. But HE kept on finding reasons for the two of them to leave. **It was a back and forth of him finding reasons for them to leave and me finding reasons for them to stay.** When I got a text from my aunt saying she was close, I told them that my something happened with my grandmother so my aunt was going to pick me (they live together).

At first I felt awful. They spent so much money on me, while I ditched and lied to them. 

This morning, I texted him that I freaked out about the room stuff. 

The fact that I was ""too scared"" to be in the same room as him hurt him. He got so mad and upset that I thought he would do something ""bad"" to me if we were alone. Neither of us said the word, but we knew what he meant. I told him that's the case. But I still felt so pressured by everybody (including his parents) to have sex. I wasn't even ready to sleep in the same bed as him yet, that's a big deal. 

I asked him if he wanted to have sex that night and he said he did, but I could have said no. I asked if he would have been mad, and he said he'd honestly be a little disappointed but that was okay. He was going to respect that. 

He repeated that I could have said no. But how could I? I was on a vacation I didn't pay for, stuck in the hotel room I didn't pay for, with condoms he was excited to receive. I felt trapped. There was so much pressure on me. There was no where else I could go. If I did say no, how am I supposed to be comfortable sleeping next to a very disappointed 18 year old with blue balls? I told him this. 

I just got mad about the fact that I was lied to about the room arrangements. When I was packing and getting cute summer fits there was time to tell me what's up. But nobody did until we got there. 

He's VERY hurt and mad about the fact that I thought that this was planned to trap me so he could ""hurt"" me. He's hurt and mad that I had no faith in him. 

I didn't say it out loud...But maybe that was in the back of my mind, but it was about being cautious. I know girls and have heard of girls have their own bfs and husbands ""hurt"" them like that. I was just being safe, it's not that I don't trust him. Either way, that wasn't one of the main reasons I left. 

We said we'd talk about this when he's done his vacation. Idk what to do or say here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bnimde/i_secretly_had_my_aunt_pick_me_up_while_on_vacay/,relationship_advice,2234,805,0.0

I was using his laptop when it kept getting notifications alert when his friend messaged him, my bf was logged in to his Fb account. I fucked up by getting curious and by looking through his conversations. Major fault on my part and i feel extremely bad about it. But while i was reading i stumbled upon him and his friend talking about me, from 2 weeks ago. For your information, i suffer from severe clinical depression and because of that i struggle almost everyday. My Boyfriend and his friend talked about my self harm issues and literally laughed ( a lot of hahaha) at my condition and his friend also called me a loser. They also followed up by saying my bf has had sex with me already so theres nothing left to take away from me anymore and that my bf should end it (relationship) asap. After reading the messages i am so hurt and in a lot of pain as I love him so much. I shared every part of my life with him because i trusted him but he has discarded all of my feelings. I find it disgusting that they were lauging at my sucidal thoughts and i literally feel so shit. My bf is not here yet so after having a mental breakdown and calming myself, i am writing this post. I have printed the conversations using his printer and am planning to leave it on his bed for him to see when he comes back.I plan to just leave and delete his contacts as well as block him from everything and anything. I dont think he deserves an explanation from me and i feel the document i have printed out is enough for him to understand what has happened. I am in a lot of pain because i truly did love him and still do. therefore a part of me wants to sit down with him and talk about how the things he has said is hurtful and had caused me alot of harm but i know if i do that i will crumble and stay with him because he will for a fact profusely apologise. i also dont want to be an asshole by ending things without a proper goodbye as we did share a lot of good memories aswell and feel that i should let him know a piece of my mind before ending it. I also would like to apologise to him for reading his personal messages which i know i should not have done in first place and regret it a lot.

dunnowhatt0do,2019-05-11 16:06:25+00:00,[UPDATE] Ex [29F] who dumped me [26M] because she thought I cheated now wants to get back in touch,"I decided to give my ex-girlfriend that one meet up, for her sake. I honestly wasn't expecting to gain anything myself from this. But I still remembered how much I cared for her, so I figured I could do this one thing and we could both move on with our lives. Meeting her in person though, that was a whole different thing. I don't know how to describe this feeling, but it was quite like anticipation, like when you're just expecting something to happen, and don't know if it's good or bad. Now that I look back on it, I know I was hoping for good. 

We talked a great deal when we met and ended up staying out for hours. A great deal of it was her sincerely apologizing for not believing me and breaking up with me over the phone without even giving me a chance, but in truth, I couldn't blame her and told her as much, since these were all people she grew up with. She didn't really have a reason to not believe them, since they never did this sort of thing before. This was followed by some shit talking of her former friends, that was kind of nice and we ended up having a few laughs over it, even though I could tell she was sad by what happened. She's only got two friends now, an older woman from her workplace and a girl her age from a hobby workshop. They seem to be good for her, from what she's saying, but she admits that  occasionally she misses what she had with her previous friends, if not the people themselves. 

I really did end up feeling better from that one talk and when the time came to go our separate ways, she asked me if I would be open to talking with her more in the future. Alice was upfront about her hoping that there might still be something between us in the future, but she wasn't pushy about it. Anyway, told her I wouldn't know, but also told her to just talk when she feels like it and I might or might not reply. Exchanged numbers and that was it for the day. 

Without dragging this out any further, we started dating again. Talking ended up bringing back how I used to feel about her, but I was holding back for a lot of the time and she was very patient with me. Never tried to push too much, never tried to just pick up from where we ended. It's basically dating like we've never dated with each other, in some way. Not sure if I can describe it properly, English isn't my first language. I guess it's got that good part of where you're getting to know someone and actually enjoying doing so. A lot of talk about trust has been had. 

Just a few days back was when after a night out she invited me to her place. I knew what this was about obviously, but I wasn't 100% sure. I guess I was just being cautious on some level. Alice seemed to sense it and let me off with some words of how I might need some rest for work in the morning, so she'd understand. I can't really tell you how that made me feel exactly, but it - it just shows me she cared. She cares and I went up with her and it was something I really fucking missed. It's not just two people together. It's her and me together. So yeah, we're together, we're dating and we're taking it a bit slowly, but I'm happy and she's happy and things aregood. 

**tl;dr** We met, talked a lot, then talked some more after that. Started dating again and I'm happy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bndoog/update_ex_29f_who_dumped_me_26m_because_she/,relationship_advice,1965,134,0.0
f-lyingburrito,2019-05-10 19:40:59+00:00,My entire family is angry at me [F32] because I told my sister [F33] I'm pregnant. They didn't want me to tell her because she's done IVF twice and didn't work for her. They wanted me to wait until my baby is born to tell her so it doesn't hurt her feelings,"I love my sister and I know she's always wanted to get pregnant but had trouble conceiving so she tried IVF twice in the last couple years, although sadly it didn't work for her.

Since her first failed IVF try, my parents decided it was strictly forbidden for anyone to mention anything baby related. Whether it was me wanting to start a family with my husband, or learning a friend got pregnant. If it was baby related we were told not to tell my sister because it'd hurt her feelings and make her feel bad.

I obliged out of respect for my parents, but I disagree with this because way of doing things. The world doesn't stop, people will still get pregnant, just because she can't have a baby yet, why should everybody walk on eggshells not to accidentally slip someone they know is pregnant? 

During a family dinner my brother accidentally mentioned how one of our school friends was having a baby, my sister heard it and started crying saying why did he have to rub it on her face when he knew knowing that would make her feel bad. She made a scene and stormed off crying. 

Our parents got super angry at him and went on a tirade about how we couldn't mention babies at all for our sister's sake.

Now 4 months ago my husband and I learned I was pregnant. I told my parents and they didn't seem to care as much about as about making sure I didn't tell my sister.

I told them it was stupid because I'd start showing soon, to what they replied it was best if I avoided hanging out with my sister until my baby is born, because then it's unavoidable, but in the mean time we can spare her the pain of knowing I'm pregnant. 

We had a huge argument over it because I don't feel like hiding my pregnancy from my own sister just because her precious feelings might get hurt. She has to deal with it, babies are still being born every second and she can't make the world fit to her needs just so she 'doesn't suffer'.

I don't want to cause her any pain but why can't I share the news with her and openly talk about it?

So after 4 months, and with a visibly pregnant belly, I told her today. She was **not** happy. She turned it into me purposely trying to make her feel bad and said she would have preferred not knowing. 

I was like, how do you expect me to hide this belly? And why shouldn't I be allowed to talk about such an important change in my life just because protecting your feelings is more important than me sharing my joy?

So again, she started crying, didn't even congratulate me and stormed out. (we're both in our mid 30's). An hour later my mother shows up at my house saying I'm selfish and self-centered I only care about me and I went against her wishes and told my sister about my baby just to make her feel bad because I'm jealous of her.

She went fricking nuts on me and made me feel like shit. She said she's gonna need a long time to forgive me for this and how I'm always ruining things.

My husband asked her to leave our house but instead of leaving she got offended and started cussing at him, he then grabbed her by the arm and physically removed her from our house and told her she's not welcome here.

Of course then I got a shitload of angry texts from my father and the rest of the family so we've blocked every single one of them from our phones and social media.

I'm devastated.

**TL;DR** I'm pregnant and my family got very angry at me for telling my sister about it. She's had failed IVF and nobody is allowed to speak about babies so she doesn't get upset",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bn2rsx/my_entire_family_is_angry_at_me_f32_because_i/,relationship_advice,1404,372,0.0
Whyalwaysmedammit,2019-05-10 18:37:22+00:00,"My[38m] wife [24f] of 3 years, took my daughter[14f] to visit her parents in Russia. Wife doesn’t want to come back","Like above. Sorry for ranting and any grammar errors I’ve been sitting in an airport for over almost 9 hours and making a lot of calls and had a bit to drink. Also this is a throwaway so I don’t completely dox myself. 

My wife went to visit her parents who live in a small suburb outside of St. Petersburg, Russia. 

My wife herself was born there, and came to the US when she was around 18 years old - when we first met. (This is NOT a mail order bride scenario or anything of the sort). I was finishing my up my post-grad, she was starting her undergrad - one thing lead to another and here we are. 

As she was a student when we first met, she did not anticipate meeting me and us getting so deeply involved - so she never planned on staying in the US. It just kind of happened that way. (She entered on a F1 visa then a k1 visa now she has a green card). 

Understandably, she misses her family a lot, though for the most part we’ve been extremely happy together, minus the standard few squabbles here and there. 

3 years ago we had two wedding ceremonies, one in the US with my family and one in Russia with her family and a mix of my immediate family. 

Until last week she hadn’t seen her family since the wedding due to her finishing up school and helping out my daughter, as I have custody. 

As school wrapped up for her, and as a graduation gift, we decided it’d be a good idea for her to go visit her family for a week. She wanted to bring my daughter with her - I initially was opposed to this - but I caved and let her bring her(my daughter wanted to go) 

Through her trip she hasn’t been too much in contact with me aside the occasional message on WhatsApp and photos etc. which is understandable - she’s on vacation and I don’t expect constant alerts, but I would have liked a little more of an update. My daughter has been texting me almost daily and showing me photos as well. 

Yesterday morning I had texted my wife that I’d be there to pick them at the airport at the time she had told me the flight arrived. She read the message but never answered. I told my daughter the same and she never responded. I assumed they were just busy and left it at that. 

I had a hellish day at work so I went right to bed so I could be up early to go get them. 
I wake up today stupidly without checking my app and go to the airport, the arrival time comes and I look at my phone to message them. I see about 60 messages from my daughter panicking starting nearly 15 hours ago saying that she missed her flight and doesn’t know how to get home. Confused as shit - she tells me my wife basically told her how to get home and then dropped her off at the airport. 

 Panicked I reach out to her and blow up her whatsapp. She finally answers and sends a long 3 paragraph essay on how she has missed her family so much she doesn’t want to leave them and she wants to stay longer. 

Pissed off that she waited to tell me this, she left my daughter alone at an airport in another country, that I took off work to come today to get her, and how this is so last minute - I go off on her through text. She tells me off and stops answering me. 

I reach out to her mom through WhatsApp (who doesn’t speak English at all) and using google translate ascertain that she wants to stay for another month for her brothers birthday party. Her mom said she didn’t know this was going on and went to the airport to go help my daughter get back safely. 

Panicked I go to reach out the US consulate in Saint Petersburg only to find online it was shut down in March and the nearest is in Moscow. I reach out to the Moscow one and luckily get almost an immediate response and they were a HUGE help in getting my daughter on her correct flights. Even having someone meet her on the connecting airport to help her to the right terminal safely. 

My wife still hasn’t answered me since our blow out. And her mom said she hasn’t seen or heard from her since this morning.

What the hell am I supposed to even do with this? The lack of responsibility and carelessness she showed is astronomical to me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bn1zq2/my38m_wife_24f_of_3_years_took_my_daughter14f_to/,relationship_advice,15995,2483,0.0
throwawayformay15,2019-05-10 12:53:18+00:00,[UPDATE] [24M] [24F] I owe this sub a LOT!,"Original post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bmi8cz/my_24m_gf_24f_is_unusually_buying_new_bras_and/)

I have taken sick leave today. I just wanted to say a huge thanks people who have commented to my post from yesterday. I wanted to let you guys know that I have read each and every comment up until late last night. If it wasn't for your awesome responses, I would have never even dared to ask her about her behavior in first place or she would have never come back home early to confront me about this, after viewing that post on reddit.

I was able to get some sleep. Yes, I’m at my brother’s place, while she is staying with Karen (who is her sister btw). Karen reached out to me late last night and asked if we could meet early morning at a coffee shop and chat. So I did. We talked a lot about what happened yesterday. Since she partly confided in Karen about why she did what she did, here are some key takeaways.

- She doesn’t know why she began sleeping with this guy in first place. It just happened.
- She feels terribly sorry for what she did to me and hopes we can work things out.
- She has already broken up with that guy a week ago. She felt it was wrong and there’s no excuse for it.
- She asked Karen to buy stuff from VS using Karen’s cc because she felt it would be awkward to explain it to me if we were to review her finances (we used to do that together to cut her expenses and pay up aggressively towards her student loans).
- She claimed that sex with this guy was completely carnal and that there were no feelings or affection involved. She said she got lured by this because her new responsibilities were way too overwhelming for her. But again she maintained that she didn’t know why she started sleeping with this guy in first place.

I don’t think I want to know who this guy is or whether it was him or her who made the first move. Thinking about it is so fucking depressive. I should have noticed how she was able to maintain her body in spite quitting gym late last year? That being said, I still don't understand what must have made her impulsively sleep with that guy and jeopardize our relationship in first place. I think I'm gonna eventually weigh in those reasons before I decide as to what to do next.

I have been trying to assess if I could have picked up any cues that are otherwise typical to a cheater. And it’s so strange that she hadn’t had any of those characteristics. I mean the fact that she confessed she was able to convince her coworkers that she goes to gym across the street instead of using the free gym at her workplace by itself is so infuriating. I don’t think I would have ever doubted her cheating on me, because you don’t see those cliched “staying late after work” or “texting someone constantly” symptoms when she was around at home. I think if I try to understand what made her to get in bed with this guy, I’ll just get myself deeper down the rabbit hole.

Karen also said that even she couldn’t truly understand what was going in her head when she decided to have this fling with a completely unknown guy and put our relationship at stake. Though Karen did make a full disclosure that my gf once cheated on a guy as a teenager back in high school and things turned out ugly back then. I was a bit surprised since I didn’t know this before. We both knew our relationship and/or dating history midway in our relationship, but not this. That was quite a long time ago. And btw, Karen is a sweet lady - she even wrote each of us a letter before we guys moved-in together.

This is so ironic. I lurk on reddit via my main account to get updates on r/apple and r/macos, while my gf used to thoroughly read r/twoxchromosomes. She would sometimes read out a post here and there, asking me what do I think about some post on reddit from a guy’s perspective, entailing into one of those small talks. I would have never imagined that our life would be one of those relationship questions, to be a topic for small talk amongst other redditors or couples here online.  

Nonetheless I truly appreciate your responses. I would have dragged this thing for days or even weeks, getting more and more worried (and obsessed) about my gf behavior. See, when you move-in together, no one ever tells you what boundaries to set and what things to avoid.  I think I made a mistake there - maybe I should have checked on her time and again to see if something had been bothering her at work. I think first time living with someone that aren’t your parents or drunk dudes back from college, is always awkward and wonderful at the same time. Don’t take it as an advice but as a takeaway from my ill-fated experience,

*Just ask your SO time and again if he or she has anything to share that’s bothering her or him.*

I know this sounds like a dumb thing to ask, but when you are new in a relationship or have upped your relationship status, we tend to worry more about getting the dynamics of relationship or new arrangement right, instead of worrying about feelings of that person. I expected that we might get bored of each other one fine day as we grew older and I might end up buying candles at Target to spice things up. But not this. 

When she was drained back from work after her promotion (before we moved-in), I seriously thought it would be better if I give her own time and not bring work talk during dinners or when we hung out together. Little did I realize that this could have made her look for comfort elsewhere. I can also affirm that I have been around her as long as she needed me, but I guess we were both busy complementing each other in our apartment by who gets to do what to upkeep of our surroundings, groceries, social responsibilities … instead of just being in moment and listen to one another.

I just picked up my car and got off from my meeting with Karen at coffee shop. I have the remainder of this weekend all to myself. While my brother and his wife have been incredibly supportive, I though of getting myself checked-in to the first available counselor, even if that’s just one time. I haven’t told any of my friends or coworkers about it. So it’s gonna be social life as usual, unless I come to a decision as to what to do next. It’s like you are fucking pissed off for having your trust shattered but then you have need to walk through those broken pieces to get out of it, without getting yourself hurt.

So now our apartment stays deserted while I figure out what to do next. Sorry for the ramble. But thank you, again.

TL;DR Thank you kind redditors of this sub. If it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t have the courage to confront my gf. And if it wasn’t for this sub, my gf would have never come forward for confession leaving work midway. All I can say is that this sub gives a new perspective to all things relationshipy, that one might be too afraid to ask people IRL.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bmxx68/update_24m_24f_i_owe_this_sub_a_lot/,relationship_advice,1097,337,0.0

She kept up with me till now to support her boyfriend[?M],"My wife's friend called me yesterday. She told me that she's been feeling guilty about something for a long time and she couldn't take it anymore. She basically told me that my wife's been cheating on me for the past 10 years and the money she's taking from me; she's been using it to pay for her boyfriends bills as he's jobless. She even told me that my daughter(let's call her Alice) isn't mine.

I straight out told her that I don't believe her and that she's most likely lying. She send some photos of my wife with some guy and in one of them they were kissing. Alice was also with them in many of the photos. To give some background, Alice is 8 year old and she stopped calling me dad since she was 4, I scolded her at that time but my wife got in between and told me she's just a kid and she will understand later. I didn't understood at that time but now I realised that my wife had been intentionally keeping Alice away from me all these years and now Alice doesn't even talk to me nicely. 

I provided my wife with as much as I can afford and always used to cut corners at my end to meet her requests whether it be any materialistic thing or money. I provided for my daughter in any way  possible for me and give her the best I could. 

I am currently feeling so betrayed and hurt. I haven't confronted my wife about this as she's at her mum's house with Alice. I don't want to talk about this at phone.

UPDATE: The date went really really well! Nature helped me out a little bit and it was extremely nice out. The drive was about an hour to the falls through a pretty remote part of Oregon and was super scenic. We only saw two other cars. When we got to the falls we were the only people. Chinook Salmon were attempting to leap up the falls so it was definitely a cool thing to watch. The bottle of wine came out early and we consumed the entire thing sitting at the bottom of the falls. I kept our picnic simple and made her a sandwich. I think I did good by bringing whole vegetables, a cutting board and knife and half ass chef'd it up in the woods. We stayed until it almost got dark. 


I did another smart move by having our meeting spot be at this Indian Casino. She said she had never gambled in her life so I brought her in and we had a drink and I gave her 20$ to spend. She found this bee slot machine (my last name has Honey in it, so the bee was appropriate) and ended up winning $150! At that point it was getting pretty late so I walked her to her car gave her a kiss and said goodnight. I am going to see her this weekend again.

Wife and I have been married for 4 years, together for 12. Last month, my entire life was upended by my brother( older ) and my wife. My brother was my hero. He was there for me when my parents abandoned us. He was there for me when I struggled with depression. He's like a father figure to me. 

So my brother called me and asked me if he could come over and meet me at my office. He told me that it was very important. We met up for lunch that day and he told me that he did something terrible and he was really sorry. He told me that my wife had sex with him before we got married because she claimed that she was really stressed at that time and he was drunk. 

Apparently, my wife contacted him recently and told him that our daughter could be his. And he also started suspecting it. I was really shocked by this revelation. Because my wife never told me about this. And I never imagined she would cheat on me.

But when I confronted my wife, she started crying and told me that she was raped by my brother before our wedding and she ended up getting pregnant with his child. She didn't realise it at that time, and she didn't want to hurt my relationship with my brother, so she decided to hide it. But my brother claims it was consensual. 

We ended up getting a paternity test and it was revealed that my daughter is not mine. I just want to kill myself. My brother told me that he would pay child support and take responsibility for the child. Wife claims that she was raped and she doesn't want my brother in our lives. 

I'm really torn. I don't think my brother is a rapist. But I'm also having a hard time believing that my wife cheated. Also, she never told me this. She had a normal relationship with my brother all this time. Idk what to do now. I think I'm just leaving.

ughhhelpmepleaseee,2019-05-08 05:45:38+00:00,(UPDATE 2) My Roommate's (21F) Parents keep Letting Themselves into My (21F) Apartment with the spare key she gave them.,"Okay guys, I'm sorry for updating you guys late and for the super long post, but I want to make sure I get important details in there. 

No TLDR, gotta read it. 

I THINK RM IS CRAZY and needs a MH checkup. Seriously. I am very worried for her wellbeing. 

When I left my apartment yesterday to go to my parents house, I forgot to take my credit card. I walked back up to my apartment, and R was studying while RM was watching TV. RM asked me where I was going, and I told her ""away from you."" I guess that pissed her off, cause she got up and started yelling about how bad of a parent my mom is by teaching me how to ""go around the city with different guys"" and ""talk back to adults."" I was so frustrated, I ended up cussing her out. 

This got her really really mad, and she ran to the kitchen and grabbed a wooden spoon from one of the drawers. 

This crazy bitch was gonna hit me with a wooden spoon. I ran out of my apartment as fast as I could to my car, and I honestly could not stop laughing. This was insane. 

My mom was home, along with my brother, my brother's girlfriend, and her parents. I told them everything that happened, and no one liked what they heard. My mom called my dad to tell him what happened, but he was in the middle of a surgery, and she didn't want to distract him and we waited for a couple of hours. As soon as my dad was out, he called us and my mom told him everything. 

When my dad came home, he hugged me immediately and started crying. Me being called a prostitute and a slut was too much for him to handle. I've never seen dad cry before, and it hurt me so so bad. 
My mom called RM and RD and R to come over to talk. They came over immediately (they probably knew something was up from the tone of my mom's voice, she was so close to growling). 

Mom was being petty though, when they came home, she didn't allow them inside. She made them stand on the doorstep the whole time, and I could tell this was pissing RM off. Some points of the confrontation:

1. Why are you calling my daughter these names?
RM: I didn't say anything. She's making        up lies. 

2. Why are you even in the apartment that much? You told us that you go there once a month to check on R. You also said she visits you every weekend?
RM: The kids don't know how to cook, so I help. Also kids are busy studying so they need it. 

3. Why is a 50 year old man in my daughter's apartment?
-no answer-

4. Why are you going through my daughter's stuff? Why does she need a lock? Why are YOU limiting my daughter's times with her friends? 
-no answer-

*I shall also mention that Roommate's dad was SITTING IN THEIR CAR ON THE DRIVEWAY DURING THIS WHOLE CONFRONTATION*

But things got heated up really quickly. RM started insulting my parents:

- She said my mom is a bad mom because she never disciplined her children.

- she said I am unruly and that the clothes I wear are despicable (she brought up clothes a shit ton, like this lady is really offended by my fashion sense). This annoyed my brother, and he showed RM IG pictures of R wearing more revealing clothing than me, and sitting on boys laps. RM shut her mouth about my clothes immediately. 

- She then proceeded to try to insult my parent's professions by saying they have ""God Complexes"". This pissed my brother off to the brink, and he replied with "" you own 3 subways and are almost broke, but we never say anything about it."" This pushed RM OFF THE EDGE, and she leaned in closer to my brother and attempted TO SLAP HIM. 

This lady tried to SLAP my 24 y/o brother IN FRONT OF MY PARENTS. 

They argued more, and my mom asked where the dress was again. This time, she walked away to their car, and pulled my dress out of her purse. She came back to where we were standing AND LITERALLY THREW THE DRESS IN MY FACE.

My mom had no more patience left, and back Slapped RM across her face. I've never seen my mom raise her hand on anyone, and I burst out laughing. Even my dad had to walk back inside to keep himself from laughing in front of RM. RM started crying and said she was going to call the cops on us. 

When they left we had a big discussion:

First, Roommate's dad asked my dad and mom the past weekend if he could pay HALF of R's tuition next year. Like wtf. WTF. My parents were so confused. My mom said after this request, her ""mommy senses""started kicking in, and she felt something was wrong. 

My parents were angry that I never told them about this before. They said that they got me that apartment so I could do what I wanted. They wanted me to be able to have friends over, have a place to chill, and have a place without parental influence. 
However, they are very proud and happy with the way I dealt with the situation, and said calling the cops would unnecessarily escalate the situation that could be solved by talking. Thank you all for the advice. I appreciate it alot. ❤

They were mad at my brother cause they said he shouldn't have shown those pictures of R cause now she has to deal with that trouble at home. 

My parents agreed that letting R live in my apartment without consulting me first was wrong on their part. My parent's started the eviction process today. 

Anyways, it may be hard to believe, but I do stand up for myself a lot. It's just that in this situation, I didn't want to do anything that would offend my parents because I had respect for their friendship and I didn't want to ruin it or do something that would embarrass my parents. I learned from this, and I have growing up to do, but now that I know I have support, I won't worry about petty shit like this later. 

I also don't want to live alone so one of my best friends from high school is gonna be my new roommate(no, she isn't Indian). No one is living rent free in this situation. 

I would also like to say that even though I wasn't friends with R in high school, living with her for 2 years did help me make a bond with her. Idk if we can be friends after this, but it feels bad losing a friend. 

Also my parents are liberal ass Indians. They have lived her for over 40 years. They didn't want to spy on me at all. They don't mind me wearing skirts or tube tops or having guy friends over. 

Edit 1: I forgot to add, for those of you guys who think that my parents paying my rent and tuition doesn't make me an adult, I don't think it does. I'm so blessed to have parents who want to make sure that their kids graduate without debt. Also, it's my parent's money. They'll do what they want. This gives me no excuse to have a GPA less than a 4.0, Js. 

I included most of the important points. If something doesn't make sense I'll reply in the comments.

throwawaymyl1fepls,2019-05-06 22:38:25+00:00,UPDATE: My GF was raped and became pregnant. I broke with her after she decided to keep the baby.,"Original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/?utm_source=reddit-android

I'll post the update first, since there has been some change since I last posted, and I need some serious advice this time. Then I'll respond to some general points made from the last thread, and the ton of PMs I received.

Yesterday, I received a call from my GF. She was crying, and she begged me to listen to her. I told her that I still care for her, and that I'll obviously listen to what she has to say.

She told me that a few days after I told her we were done, she called up her Mother to talk about this. Apparently, what happened before was that she was pretty much decided on aborting, but then when she spoke to her Mother, her mother told her that under no accounts should she abort, and that I was actually manipulating her to do so. Her Mother went on to say that if she aborted the child, she would no longer consider my gf as her daughter. 

After I left her, my gf called her Mum up to talk about what went on. My GF said that she desperately wanted to abort the baby, and her Mother again said that if she does so, this is the last time they will ever speak again. My GF said she broke down on the phone, and her Mother kept asking her what she will do. The conversation then ended when my GF said she didn't know.

Then she started texting. After a few hours of thinking, my GF sent her mum a text saying she was going to abort. She was then blocked.

My GF then called me, and told me everything.

She will be having an abortion in 3 weeks.

I discussed this with my GF, and we both completely agreed that I had not manipulated her in any way, and that she appreciated that I out my foot down, because had I not, she would have had a baby who would remind her of the worst time of her life. (Her words, not mine)

She further went on to say that I am the best thing that has ever happened to her, and that she knew that even if she no longer had a Mum, if she had me, she could get through this. I broke down at this point.

I love her so much. In truth, I probably would have gone back to her and raised the baby with her, even though I knew I'd resent it. I made the original thread to get some backing rather than anything, to see if I had made the right decision.

I'm so relieved things had turned out the way they have. 

Also, screw any Mother who places religion over their own child. Friggin lunatics.


Now to respond to some of your points from the last thread:

1: No. My GF did not cheat on me. I am almost certain about this. Not only because she had the conscience of a fragile angel, but also because we both know each others' schedules really well, and we often talk to friends who can corroborate timings. Moreover, her roommate took photos of my GF after she came home assaulted. It's not ""rough sex"" as some of you dicks put it.

2: I don't give a rat's arse if you think abortion is a sin or the killing of a baby. Come and raise the baby or give us money to raise the baby or hire us a live in maid to tend to my GFs every need while she pregnant if you're so sanctimonious. Talk to the talk, then walk the walk you wanking tit-baboons.

3: My GF was absolutely clear she wanted to raise the baby (probably influenced by the Mum).

4: Thanks for all the people telling me I did the right thing. It was really difficult. I'm very glad it turned out the way it has though.

5: To the people who PM'd me telling me I'm a monstrous baby killer - I fail to see what my hobbies have to do with this issue.

ughhhelpmepleaseee,2019-05-06 17:43:12+00:00,(UPDATE) My Roommate's (21F) Parents keep letting themselves into my (21F) apartment with the spare key my roommate gave them.,"I update about the situation. Sorry it's long.

RM= roommate's mom   R=Roommate

I came back from my morning run around 7 am this morning, and RM and R were in the kitchen making some coffee. She has never been there this early before. 

I decided to talk to them about everything prior to going to class. I atarted off with ""hey auntie, can we talk?"" (In brown culture everyone is called an aunt) and these are some points I listed:

1. I appreciate that she has been cooking and cleaning, but I want to do that on my own. I love to cook and felt that I was never allowed in my own kitchen. I also told her that I want to do my own laundry and clean my room myself. 

2. I don't want her in my room. I reminded her that I talked to her about this when it first happened, and that's why I put the lock on the door.

3. I told her that if she wants to be with R, to let R text me and lmk that RM would be in the apartment. 

They expressed understanding and I hugged it out with RM. 

Before going to class, I put a load of laundry. My friend is having a birthday dinner today, and I decided to wear this cute white dress with an open back (my mom even got me this dress since she thought it was so cute) and tossed it in the washer so it could be fresh for tonight. I asked RM multiple times if she was planning on doing laundry today, and she said no. I told her that I would be back around 1, and she can do laundry when I finish mine later this afternoon if needed (I didn't want her touching my clothes). She was okay with it and said R didn't have laundry today. Cool. I left feeling really relieved, but I still locked my bedroom door. 

I got back to my apartment about half hour ago, and I couldn't find my white dress. As soon as I came home, R looked nervous. My clothes were in the dryer, and I didn't do that for a fact. RM states that I put them in the dryer and just forgot. Ughhh. I locked myself in my room, and I know she probably took the dress as it was something she wouldn't approve of.

When I was in my room, I heard RM talking to R in our language, she told her daughter something along the lines of ""idk why she's freaking out about that dress. In India, escorts and prostitutes wear those kinds of clothing."" And she went on to tell R that I won't find a husband wearing stuff like this.

I honestly think she wanted me to hear all that.  is she is seriously just being a passive aggressive bitch to me rn? I'm trying so hard not to break down and cry. 

I'm heading over to my parents right now and I'm telling them everything when they come back home tonight. I'll keep you posted.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blf7xp/update_my_roommates_21f_parents_keep_letting/,relationship_advice,19208,1461,0.0
cutofflittlesister,2019-05-06 12:44:53+00:00,Am I (29M) justified in remaining cut off from my sister (28F) to the extent that I have? Family is starting to ask that I mend fences...,"My sister is a lesbian. My ex girlfriend and fiancee of 6 and a half years realized she was bisexual. My sister and I were close and I mentioned this to her. That said my sister is someone who basically enjoys screwing around and then ditching her partners after she's had enough. Under the guise of basically giving my girlfriend advice she did her thing, seduced her and slept with her.




I found out because when my fiancee was acting weird I ended up snooping and seeing a shit ton of messages and a number of dirty pics exchanged. As far as I know their affair went on for a few weeks before I found out. I blew up at both of them, ended things and have not spoken to my sister in 3 years. At get togethers I don't acknowledge her unless it's to be an A-Hole to her. But she's mostly dead to me outside of snide snappish remarks. We used to be thicker than thieves and what she did cut me deep. I knew she was a skirt chaser but I never imagined once she'd go for my ex at the time. 



I'm not as angry as I used to be but it's the principle of the thing for me. She had some health scares within the last year or so and recently she got into an accident. It's been a rough period of time and my parents, a couple grandparents and two of our siblings have asked me to maybe put aside our issues as her health is more important. I told my brother to let her f*ck his wife and see if he'd be saying the same thing. 




She's started asking for me a bit more which I know through my folks. On the one hand it's entirely possible she might be dead within a few years and I'm not sure how I feel about that but on the other, it's like I said, we were always super close and she committed probably the worst sort of betrayal ever. It's not like we were distant siblings where maybe I'd understand because we had no sort of relationship but we were best friends. I was the first person she told that she thought she was a lesbian back when we were teenagers. She was that annoying sister who followed me around a lot and generally tried to spend lots of time with me. We saw movies, played video games, went cycling and did other things together. She went into dental school because of my encouragement. I'm just trying to give an idea of how close we once were which should help whoever reads this to understand how much what she did hurt. 



So am I justified in remaining cut off from her? Should I try to mend fences given her situation? What would you do in my place? 




TL;DR Lesbian sister seduced my girlfriend of many years when she admitted she was bisexual, we haven't really spoken in years and after a number of health scares over the last year my family has been asking me to maybe extend an olive branch, she's also been asking for me",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blbpkd/am_i_29m_justified_in_remaining_cut_off_from_my/,relationship_advice,1437,548,0.0
lilpinkie,2019-05-06 02:04:32+00:00,UPDATE: My (17F) stepdad (51M) has been sleeping with my sister (24F),"Original post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/bh4qad/my\_17f\_stepdad\_51m\_has\_been\_sleeping\_with\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bh4qad/my_17f_stepdad_51m_has_been_sleeping_with_my/)

So I realize that in making this update I'm going to skipping over a lot of what happened in the past week because it's too much for me to type out and I doubt anyone would be willing to read all of that, so I'm just going to lay out what I know now about what happened and if people have questions I can try to answer some. At this point my sister and mom are the ones who need advice and support more than I do but they keep telling me I shouldn't be as involved as I'm trying to be. I'm mainly making this post because there were some genuinely concerned people in the comments (which I really appreciate) who asked for updates, and I also just wanted to give a big fuck you to all the people who brushed this all off as my sister just being a slut with daddy issues. 

I also want to clarify something that is extremely important that a ton of people seemed to miss in the original post: Shaun is NOT my sisters biological dad. My sister's dad is someone my mom was with once casually and I don't know much about him, but I think my sister keeps in contact with him a little bit now. My sister and I have different dads. My dad passed away and Shaun is not related to either of us. 

Also if one more person feels inclined to make a joke about this sounding like a porn plot you can fuck right off. You aren't funny and it's really sickening for someone experiencing this to read, ESPECIALLY the ones saying that he's coming for me next. What's wrong with you..

Anyway. So the reason all of this came to the surface is because my mom was in the kitchen cleaning up that night, and she grabbed his phone to look something up because she didn't have hers on her and the last thing he had open was his photos/videos. She said she saw that he had a folder of ""inappropriate sexual videos"" of my sister on his phone and she was sure that he was the one who took them because they were in our basement. 

Before she talked to my sister all she knew was that my stepdad had these videos and that it was obvious my sister was aware that she was being filmed, it wasn't like he hid a camera somewhere. When she confronted my stepdad she said he stumbled over his words a lot and it took him awhile to give an explanation, but when he did it was obvious that he was lying. 

I made an update about this in the comments a few days after the original post but I know a lot of people missed it: All my mom told me the first time I saw her after this whole thing blew up was that the situation was complicated and she didn't seem upset with my sister. I had also overheard my aunt say something like ""this is what happens when you agree to have an open relationship"" and my mom got really angry. She ended up telling me about this a couple days later, but apparently she and Shaun have had an open relationship because my mom has endometriosis and I guess she can't or doesn't want to ""be as intimate"" as Shaun does, so she told him he could see other people as long as she didn't become aware of it, he didn't develop feelings for someone else, and it didn't hurt our family life at all. 

My sister ended up coming to stay with us at my aunt's house last Monday, which is when she ended up telling my mom and I what happened. It took her awhile to get the words out because she was crying so badly and it seemed like she didn't know whether or not to say it, but basically: 

Shaun offered to help my sister pay off her student debt if she let him film these videos. She ended up dropping out of school because her anxiety and depression were getting really bad, but she had been in and out of school for the past couple years and had taken out a lot of loans but didn't get her degree so the jobs she has aren't enough to pay them off. One of the only things she talks about is how stressed she is about money and paying off her debt. Apparently Shaun offered to help pay some of it off himself but said she needed to do her part too, and he told her that he knew how she could make money by selling/posting the videos. He would handle all of that for her, he just needed her to trust that he knew what she needed to do in them. 

I don't know the extent of what she did in them/what he did to her, but at one point she said he had first told her he wouldn't touch her, but after the first few times he started to get physical and threatened to stop helping her with her payments if she didn't. My mom cut her off at this point and said she didn't need to say any more about it, gave her a hug, and they both cried for awhile.

I've talked to my sister privately a few times and she said from what she can tell Shaun has taken all of the videos down. I guess at some point when we were at my aunt's he came back and got some of his stuff, and my mom has since changed the locks so he can't come back in and we're not sure where he is. My mom said my aunt had been in contact with him the day or two after this all blew up and she told him to stay away from us and to get his things and leave, but hasn't heard from him since. We're living at home again until my mom figures out different living arrangements for us, my sister is sharing a room with me, and my mom sleeps in the guest room.

My sister told me our mom is trying to take legal action against him but my sis doesn't want her to because she feels like doing so will make this public and she just wants it to go away. My mom has also tried to get my sister to see a therapist, but my sister keeps saying she's fine and would rather put that money towards her loans. For the past few days everything that's been said about it is just between my mom and my sister, so I don't know if anything's changed, but it seems like they're trying to just not talk about it and focus on finding somewhere we can afford to live that's near my school and my mom's work. 

So I guess the only advice I can ask for is: is there anything I can do to help my family right now? And does this seem like something they should/can be taking legal action about?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bl64o0/update_my_17f_stepdad_51m_has_been_sleeping_with/,relationship_advice,2411,307,0.0

HursHH,2019-05-05 17:11:47+00:00,My sister had her Gender reveal party same day and immediately following my wedding.,"I don't live near ant family except my grandparents who are in the next town over and all my family lives spread out across the country. So when I was getting Married last week we had the wedding at my house and invited every one here to celebrate with ua on our wedding day. The plan was wedding at 3. Reception at 4 and after party at 7 or 8pm. Everyone was invited to all 3 parts well ahead of time. The after Party was set up so that we could actually spend real time with our friends and family instead of all the stiff formalities of the reception. 

Wedding and reception went great. Then it was time to head inside for the after party. Half the wedding left including my entire family. Not sure  single member of my family stayed. The next day I found out that my sister had planned a gender reveal party at my grandparents house for the same day as my wedding. And NOBODY told me. Nobody bothered to ask if I wanted to go. Nobody showed up to my party. Nobody even apologized for not coming. I had wanted to spend quality time with my family but instead they all just left. They had all flown in just for the weekend so I didn't get to talk to them before the wedding as it was all hectic from wedding prep. Then they flew out the next day. 

Now I don't even know how to talk to them im just so mad.

PattyBates88,2019-05-05 06:42:02+00:00,"Left my girlfriend at a bar, did I do the right thing?","I should preface saying my girlfriend is a mean drunk when she gets really/blackout drunk. It happened a while back, got got so drunk she couldn't stand at a party. I had to call an uber and carry her to the street where she caused a huge scene (people staring and laughing). Had to carry her in the Uber, where she puked everywhere, then carry her home while she was puking all over the place. After that she promised she would never get drunk like that again.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to tonight, almost a year later, we went out to an event. She was pounding drinks before going and by the time we got there was pretty drunk. I warned her to take it easy. She didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

The plan was to watch the concert, get some food, then go back home. Instead she meets up with some old friends (these people seemed like real party people and immature, I'm 30). Blew off our plans. I follow them to a bar....where she's stumbling, tripping, slurring and ignoring me. I'm sitting there and watch her start feeling up some other guy right in front of me. I said fuck it and went outside for a while. Came back, she's doing the same to another guy. I told her what she's doing and how it made me feel and how it was disrespectful. Then she goes on getting mad at me saying ""I wasn't making myself present"" and ""they made themselves present for her""

Simple_Transition,2019-05-05 06:00:50+00:00,"I think I crossed the line in my wife and I's ""open marriage"".... But I'm struggling to empathize with my wife","My wife basically forced me into a temporary open marriage a 5-6 months ago. We recently both turned 50 and have been together since college. She, I guess as part of a mid-life crisis, was lamenting the fact she had never been with any other men. So proposed a temporary open marriage so that we could both experiment, and then ""close"" our marriage for good.

Obviously very few men will take the news ""I want to sleep with other men"" well, and so I refused at first. But she made it clear that if I didn't agree we'd have to separate, and so I went along with it. After all, it's going to go both ways, so what the hell. Maybe I'll enjoy it? Besides, it was only going to be a temporary arrangement.

So she starts matching with guys on tinder, going out to bars, etc. I don't know how successful she was as we had a rule of keeping it out of the house, and quite frankly I don't want to know. I ended up matching with lots of younger girls who are into older guys. They were very attractive, but the sex was boring and not enjoyable. I mean all of it was basically them just laying there and me doing all the work. Not nice.

Anyway at this point I figure I should just see some escorts since the experience  is probably going to be more enjoyable. So I ask my wife if it's okay for me to see some escorts instead. She agrees provided: (a) I always use protection (duh) and (b) I keep my spending to a minimum.

Now to cut a long story short, I ended up becoming a regular client to this one girl. She's a college student working to pay her student fees/living costs. We kick it off and her ""fees"" become less and less as time goes on until we're actually going on dates and stuff and no money is involved anymore. It wasn't really a single moment, overtime I just stopped being a client and started being something else to this girl.

Wife finds out after reading my phone and is accusing me of having an emotional affair with this girl. This girl in turn finds out that my wife knows, and is telling me to go steady with her (saying she'll quit sex work for me). I know I should choose my wife, but honestly, I find myself looking thinking:

1. Our kids are all grown up so they're no longer a consideration in staying together

2. I'm not sure if I can still love my wife the same way after she coerced me into an open relationship so she can sleep around.

3. Despite the age difference, I get along with this girl so much more... Her body/youth is obviously a plus too.

2 months ago, my GF was raped. It was done in a park. She didn't want to report it and went into a full breakdown, wouldn't speak to police, go to hospital etc. I couldn't force her, so I just stayed with her.

She was, obviously, in a really shit state since, and I've been with her, by her side, listening to her, helping her. We went to therapy, and she knows I'm there for her. She has a history of depression, and I've been really worried.

Last week, we found out she was pregnant. I was abroad for 2 months before the rape on work, and can back early to care for her. So the baby definitely isn't mine. She is 100% sure it's the rapist's.

So we had a discussion. She is a devout Catholic. We initially decided on a abortion, but after she speak to her Mother, she has decided to keep the baby, saying that isn't the baby's fault.

I flat out told her that I would not help raise a baby of a guy who raped her. She cried and begged me not to leave. I told she is the one making the choice - either she keeps the baby and I leave, or she aborts the baby and I stay. I would not let this go.

advicethrowawaystuff,2019-05-03 15:36:49+00:00,Should I (21 F) uninvite my (28 F) Sister in-law from my wedding for making my mom cry?,"A bit of background; I’ve never gotten along with my SIL (Sister in-law). I’m very nerdy and she’s extremely materialist. She’s constantly boasting about “basically being a Beverly Hills house wife because I have a certain standard of living.” Yeah, we’ve never been close to say the least.

Here’s where the drama comes in. My wedding is next month and we’ve been planning it for a year without a hitch. Or that was that case up until a few days ago. I got a phone call from my mom hysterically crying. I flipped and tried to calm her down, I didn’t know what was afraid something happened to my dad. Turns out my SIL called my mom and basically said, “if you don’t pay for us (Her, My brother, her mom, and their two kids) they won’t be coming to the wedding. Why is this such a big issue? Because they’ve known about the wedding for over a year and have gone to Disneyland almost every month, even when my brother was unemployed. They don’t even live in California.

This call also came TWO DAYS after they bought a brand new hot tub. My mom really broke down on the phone because she was going to get a new credit card to pay for them but my dad flipped and said no. You think that would be the end of it but NOPE. My brother called my mom shortly after and absolutely ripped into her. “How dare you make my wife cry?!” My SIL had called my brother while he was at working saying that my mom was being awful to her and all sorts of things. 

I’m really at my wits end. This has just been eating away at me for the last few days and I thought it had blown over... until yesterday. My mom called me crying again. I was beyond furious at this point and asked what happened. My brother texted her saying they would be coming but there was a catch. They would be staying at my parents house for an entire week and using their vehicle. Apparently, my wedding isn’t enough for them to make the trip so they decided to go to some theme park for a few days while they’re there. The problem is that I’m staying with my parents with my maid of honor during that time and there is absolutely no room for all of them to stay too.

I’m so heart broken over this. I hate what my SIL has done to my brother. He has never acted like this before, we used to be really close. Part of why it’s eating at me so bad is because I have another brother who can’t attend because he’s stationed overseas. He tried everything possible to get vacation time to come too. So I have one brother who’s dying to go but can’t, and another who absolutely has the means but... it’s just not worth it to go without turning it into some elaborate vacation.

Should I uninvite them or grit my teeth and deal with it? Should I confront my SIL and brother about their behavior, maybe try to talk things out? If I did uninvite them I know they would never talk to me again and I would never see my nieces again. My fiancé has had to hold me back from ripping into my SIL over thing entire ordeal. He doesn’t want them to go either but I’m afraid if I do it will tear apart our family.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bk9uii/should_i_21_f_uninvite_my_28_f_sister_inlaw_from/,relationship_advice,5732,867,0.0

He blamed me and thought I gave it to him.

A few weeks ago, 4/5 months after telling him I knew about the messages, he finally admitted to sleeping with someone else, and now he’s doing everything he can to make us better and to have a ‘healthy’ relationship. Everyone at work knows about the cheating, everyone on both sides of our families know.

And here I am not wanting to make this work, not wanting him at all. I’m actually repulsed by his touch. His side of the support system thinks I’m being unreasonable for filing for divorce, not wanting to make this work, or try to get back to how we used to be. But after me begging and bawling in front of him asking for answers he still didn’t give it to me. Only when his counselor was at our house, he told me. In front of him and his wife.

Anyone have insight to this situation? Am I being an asshole? I feel it’s justified, and I’m not happy with him. I wasn’t happy with him before all this started either. Was I going to leave him? No. But this is a deal breaker for me and he knew from the beginning of us talking what my stance on cheating is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bk7lxj/husband_finally_admits_to_sleeping_with_someone/,relationship_advice,1741,245,0.0
cxpcxkke,2019-05-03 10:21:04+00:00,My girlfriend[17f] keeps waking me[18m] up in the early morning and it’s driving me nuts,"We have been in a relationship for about half a year now but this is becoming a serious dealbreaker for me
She thinks i always sleep too long so she decided that she would wake me up, problem is that she decides when that is and that is usually when she wakes up. Her parents own a bakery and she helps out sometimes so she usually goes to bed really early and wakes up at around 4 in the morning. She decides that it would be fun to wake me up by spamming my phone with messages and calling me a bunch until i wake up. At first it irritated me but now it’s becoming unbearable because she does this every night. I go to sleep late and i would usually wake up late because of school and my job. About 2 weeks ago i turned off my phone to avoid the message spam and she got mad at me and was saying things about how i was neglecting her and that she felt like i didn’t love her.
I talked to her about it and she told me in a children’s voice: “aww do u need sleepie weepie tired boy”. It felt like she was mocking me?
Sorry for the rant but when i come home from school i go straight to work and after work i go to sleep so i always sleep late at night, which usually wouldnt be a problem because my classes start just after lunch.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bk6typ/my_girlfriend17f_keeps_waking_me18m_up_in_the/,relationship_advice,1635,465,0.0
BlueLiner58,2019-05-03 04:28:10+00:00,PSA: Don't EVER think you're not good enough for your partner,"I see posts on here fairly often where people say they're not good enough for their partner. Maybe your partner has a better job. Maybe they make more money. Maybe they have more friends. Maybe they're more outgoing. Maybe they're an extrovert and you're an introvert. Maybe they're considered ""out of your league"" by others. Maybe they're in better shape than you. Maybe etc. etc. etc...

&amp;#x200B;

STOP THINKING LIKE THAT.

&amp;#x200B;

They are choosing to be with YOU. They spend their time with YOU. They go to bed at night with YOU. They kiss YOU. They love YOU. Clearly, there is something about YOU that keeps them coming back. Embrace how they feel about you. Don't question it. Don't lie awake at night torturing yourself with negative thoughts. Realize that YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH for the love and attention they give you. Hold your head high and be proud of the way they feel about you.

&amp;#x200B;

ALSO, if this didn't convince you that you're good enough and you're still stuck in that way of thinking, NEVER tell them they're too good for you. You'll eventually convince them that it is true, which it ISN'T.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bk4dx3/psa_dont_ever_think_youre_not_good_enough_for/,relationship_advice,1450,126,0.0
TheGoodWife33,2019-05-02 17:51:10+00:00,I (33f) found out that my husband (34m) has a mistress (20f) and I honestly don't mind which has me questioning my sanity.,"He doesn't know that I know and I'm not sure whether I should confront him or just look the other way. I'm not angry or hurt or upset. Maybe a tad jealous but otherwise I'm honestly not bothered by it. 

It is understandable given our dead bedroom situation. We have only had sex a handful of times in the past year. He has always had a high sex drive and I'm just not in the mood for it most of the time.  The  birth of our second child caused significant tearing resulting in painful sex. I've also gained around 50 lbs from hypothyroidism and the pregnancies. My husband's a very good looking guy and works out at the gym most days a week. 

I'm probably more relieved than anything else. At least he is getting his sexual needs met. We've been married for ten years and have two kids under 5 and overall we have a good marriage other than the sex so I'm 99.99% confident that he isn't going to run off with her. Even if he is spending a little money on her, it's really not my business as long as he provides for us, which he does very well

I'm surprised by my reaction as well. Am I normal?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bjxx3o/i_33f_found_out_that_my_husband_34m_has_a/,relationship_advice,1883,433,0.0
Nitsuga_zitro,2019-05-02 16:26:25+00:00,UPDATE: Just found out my F(28) fiancé M(30) inseminated his friend without my knowledge,"Hey reddit thanks for all the messages and concerns sorry I couldn’t update last night but I was physically shaking and crying and I just didn’t have it in me. 

So basically last night I went over to the apartment and Peter let me and my sister in. Immediately I could see that he was annoyed that I brought my sister. AND NOW I see why. 
It’s hard to admit for me but my relationship with peter has been sort of a sham. Through conversations with my sister I’ve come to the realization that I don’t value myself enough and don’t give myself what I deserve and this is most evident through Peter.
Peter is a good looking guy with a good job and he’s always making people laugh when we go out but behind closed doors he’s self destructive mean and somewhat abusive. I realized this only by telling my sister about things that I thought were normal (e.g. he often slaps my hand or my head fairly hard when he’s frustrated about me doing something wrong) 
From the outside he seems perfect and I have always only cared about that but it’s not worth it to have a husband everyone loves if he’s so fucking mean to me. 
I honestly don’t care to go into detail but we talked for hours and hours and I don’t remember much but the takeaway was he cheated on me 4 times a couple months ago while I was dealing with the passing of my mom. It hurt really fucking bad and while we were talking I kind of just slowly fell into silence while my sister and him argued back and forth. There was not artificial insemination he just had sex with her and when she told him she was pregnant he said he “didn’t think she was serious” but I think that’s a lie. I feel so sick and disgusting and I’ve never felt less confident in my life. I need to stop letting people live my life for me. I’m typing this from my sisters house and I’ve DECIDED this is where I’m gonna stay until my lease is up and then I’m going to go get my things from my apartment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bjwxko/update_just_found_out_my_f28_fiancé_m30/,relationship_advice,6990,332,0.0

Turqouisemoon,2019-05-02 08:20:18+00:00,Husband told me the reason that he looks at other women is because I’m a whore.,"If you guys have been following the last few posts, our marriage has been horrible for the past year. F(32) M(33). I’ve been a faithful wife. Loving, affectionate, work 2 jobs to make ends meet. Sex/bj at almost anytime. Anything my husband wants, he gets..anything to keep him happy. BIG mistake!! He now yells at me, insults me and uses me for sex. He has a wandering eye and has been watching a woman at work. (We work at the same company.) I’ve noticed his eyes repeatedly on her during a meeting and it’s been hell for the last few weeks. We got into it again about this girl. He finally says “Okay, fine...yes, I’ve been looking..” I asked him angrily what made him so comfortable to be looking at another woman like that. He told me it was because I was a whore... the reason why he said this is because we broke up about 7 years ago before we married. He hooked up with others, I did the same. We eventually got back together later. Now, it’s years later and he brings this up and calls me a whore. He has since apologized, and says that I didn’t deserve that. That he said it because he was backed in the corner and was losing the argument. He told me he’s bored with us never going on dates much.I’ve worked so hard to give him a happy marriage. I don’t even acknowledge other men. I’m seriously thinking about a divorce. He’s made my life hell all year with his demands, screaming and constant insults if I dare tell him no. I think the word “whore” is unforgivable especially after all I’ve done to keep him happy. The insults just keep getting worse. Is this marriage fixable?? I want us to work out so bad, but I no longer think he deserves me.

WebCap67,2019-05-01 22:45:56+00:00,"I (20M) recently got into my first relationship with my girlfriend (21F). She's on her period, made a mess and is embarrassed, how do I support her?","(Disclaimer: English is not my native language)

Some background info about me/us:

I was (am actually) an awkward dude but 2 years ago I started lifting and that gave me quite the confidence boost, and I finally got the courage to ask someone out. Two months ago I officially started my first relationship with my girlfriend. She's my first everything (she didn't believe me at first), while she's pretty experienced already relationship wise. 

Now today she came over to my place. She had told me she was on her period when I saw her earlier this week. I didn't have a clue what to do with that information, so I just told her if she needed anything she should let me know. I know it's natural. I'm not grossed out, I think it's perfectly fine and I don't think it's weird let's get that straight. She wasn't feeling too hot today so I took care of her and tucked her in, she went to bed early. About an hour ago she woke up crying and I asked her what was up. She was pretty much inconsolable and it turns out she leaked (I really don't know what word to use here, I'm sorry) onto the sheets and it made a pretty big mess. I told her it was totally fine, I held her for some time until she calmed down and asked her if she wanted to shower or anything while I changed the sheets. She started crying and apologizing again and didn't really stop, so I just hugged her again and told her everything was cool. I changed the sheets and we went back to bed together, but she's still emotional. At first she even wanted to go home because she was so embarrassed but she ended up staying. 

How do I help her? Is there anything I can do that will cheer her up or be useful for her? She's embarrassed, but I really don't mind at all and I just want her to feel comfortable around me. This is my first time dealing with this so I don't know if I'm handling things the correct way.

Nitsuga_zitro,2019-05-01 22:09:09+00:00,Just found out my (F 28) fiancé (M 30) inseminated his friend without my knowledge.,"Long time fan of this sub, made a throwaway because me and my fiancé read this sub together.
So basically I met my fiancé through a mutual friend I work with let’s call her Meghan. Meghan was not usually my type of person but I was just starting at a job and she was in a higher position than me so I felt pressured to accept when she’d ask to go out to drinks. Through her I met her male best friend since childhood let’s call him Peter and I instantly connected with him in a way I never did before. 

We began dating and in the honeymoon phase all else seemed unimportant. Little did I know Meghan was getting very very upset with me this whole time as Peter was spending less time with her. It devolved into her being very rude to me at work and while she isn’t in a position that I report to she is still above me and was able to make my life harder wherever she could. 

Peter still hung out with her rarely but would tell me it was just to keep her happy because she was emotionally unstable. I was always skeptical of his reasons but never assumed he was cheating because Meghan was not his type at all. He insisted it was because he didn’t want to be “on her suicide note” as the reasons she killed herself. 
Fast forward to today at work I haven’t seen Meghan around for a while. She comes up to me and mentions that her pregnancy has reached three months. I congratulated her but was confused because it seems like she thought that I knew she was trying for a baby when I actually did not even know that she was in a relationship. I honestly don’t know anything about her because it is such a sour topic with Peter that we never talk about her. 
She goes on to mention how nice it was of peter to donate for her insemination. And I start sweating and fidgeting. I kept my cool as well as I could and continued to have the usual conversation with her. Once she left I ran to the bathroom and threw up then ran to my car and cried. I felt so embarrassed and shitty so fast. 
Now I’m sitting in the driveway typing this and I don’t know if he’s inside. 
I honestly don’t know what I’d say to him I really hope this is just a sick joke. If he did this I don’t know if I could still be with him.

throwmeaway4781,2019-05-01 15:41:45+00:00,"My ex (29m) decided to end things by trickle ghosting me (28f), I was starting to heal until I found out the reasons why he ghosted.","The past several months have been incredibly draining and hard for me. I’m not sure if I’m looking for advice or just a place to vent. 

My ex, ‘Tom’, and I had been together for about 4 years and we were extremely happy together, or so I thought. We had been discussing the possibility of getting married, and even looking for a house for us to move in to (but we were not living together). I was happy, and I thought he was too. We had a lot in common, never fought, we traveled together, my friends liked him, his friends like me, our families got along together, etc, I could go on. 

Everything was fine until our last trip together. We went to a destination where I had always wanted to go, but because of cost and distance it seemed like something I’d have to wait longer to do. It was his idea for us to go here, we saved a lot of money and were able to make this 2 week trip. Once we got back from this vacation, things started to get weird. 

After we landed (the last time I saw him) he told me he was feeling unwell and sick from the trip and wanted to go home to sleep. I didn’t think this was too unusual so we said our goodbyes. I tried texting and calling him the following day to see if he was feeling better and he didn’t respond. I started to worry, but he finally sent me a single text saying he was fine but tired about two and half days after our trip ended. From there our communication basically broke down. I can’t say he fully ghosted me, because he would occasionally send me a message, and didn’t remove me from any social media. From that point I’d try to contact him by calling, texting, sending a message on facebook and he didn’t respond. After about 4-6 days of no communication, he would end up sending me a couple of texts and then I wouldn’t hear from him for several more days. What hurt even more was this ghosting period overlapped with New Years, Valentine’s Day and my birthday - days on which nothing happened and he didn’t even wish me a happy whatever. 

I felt like I was going crazy. I had no idea what was going on and just wanted some sort of answer from him.  I was also extremely embarassed to talk to anyone about what was happening. I stopped going out as much, and didn’t really see my friends for the 2+ months he was trickle ghosting me. I found myself lying to my friends and family about his whereabouts - telling them he was busy with work, visiting his family, he was sick, or any excuse I could think of whenever I showed up somewhere without him. 

I eventually broke down, I contacted one of his good friends who I felt comfortable with and asked her to meet up with me. I told her that Tom had barely spoken to me in the 2+ months, he’s only sent me a few text messages and I have no idea what’s going on. I told her I didn’t know if he was mad at me, if we were broken up or still together, or if there was something else going on that I needed to know about. She looked kinda shocked and confused and told me that Tom had told told all of his friends that we had broken up and I that I was taking it really hard, and out of respect for me not to bring it up if anyone saw me. This was soul crushing to hear and I felt humiliated and worthless. I told her this wasn’t the case, and that he never verbally confirmed that we were broken up. She said she was extremely angry at him and would talk to him. 

Throughout March and April I felt like I was starting to heal some. I felt broken, but I started to pick up the pieces again and began to feel a bit more whole. I told my friends and family the truth about what happened and they were nothing but supportive and helpful. Then I found out some additional information about why he ghosted me and what happened on his end. 

He had apparently been cheating on me for awhile. Not sure how long, but a little less than a year. I’m also hurt because I know the person he cheated on me with. She’s an absolute garbage person. And I’m not saying that as a jaded ex girlfriend. She has always hung around our group but never really been a part of it. I’ve heard her say some extremely bigoted things about minorities, the LGBT community and non-Christians. She is the type of person who is proud to take advantage of government assistance programs, when she doesn’t need it. She somehow was able to claim disability, and has bragged about pulling the wool over the government’s eyes. I think she was able to somehow use her obesity problem as her disability, I’m really not sure. I can’t really confirm any of this, it could be a lot of talk and bullshit on her end. I’ve always thought you need to be drug tested in order to get some government benefits, and she does a lot of drugs. Not only does she take advantage of programs meant for people who can’t help themselves, but she is sent a couple of thousand dollars a month from her rich parents, which she also brags about. Her parents have paid for her car and I think they pay her rent too, so the money she gets is spent on pretty much whatever she wants. She spends her days getting drunk at the bars and restaurants my friends and I frequent and will interject herself into our outings. She has also tried to sell us hard drugs in the past and usually mentions that any of us are welcome to her place to get high. 

Tom apparently started to get high with her at her place, and was originally just trying to hide his drug use because he knew I wouldn’t approve. Then he started to get high and then have sex with her. He felt guilty and embarrassed about it, but this wasn’t enough for him to stop getting high with her. His intentions were to just get high and then leave to go back to his place, but what would usually happen is they would end up having sex once they were both properly high. This woman hated my guts, and kept pushing Tom to break up with me so they could be a couple. He didn’t want to end things with me, but felt so guilty and disgusted with himself he thought the best thing to do was to just try to ghost me. 

Tom kept their relationship secret for awhile, until she got tired of their secret relationship status. So she just started to blurt things out about them when his friends were all together at their usual bar. He came clean to his friends about it, but was so embarassed that he shortly ended things with her after his secret was found out. 

I only found out about this, because the same friend I had met up with a couple of months ago reached out to warn me that Tom is going to try to get back together with me and felt that I deserved to know the truth in case he isn’t forward with what happened. 

1. There is no way in hell that I’d get back together with Tom
2. I can’t help but feel like absolute dog shit that Tom would end things with me over that kind of garbage person and I'm having a hard time understanding why he would chose some waste of space, over someone who is actually trying to be a person and is successful. 

I don’t know what to do at this point. I’m dreading the possibility of seeing his face again. I don’t know if I could contain my urge to slap him, or if I would just break down and sob. I was doing well from moving on from him. I was starting to feel happy again. Now, I think I’m back at square 1. I'm depressed and stressed out. 

Is there anything I can do? I kind of want to stay hidden in my apartment not answering calls until this is all over.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bjikr9/my_ex_29m_decided_to_end_things_by_trickle/,relationship_advice,17391,1577,0.0

Her cousin passed away on Wednesday, the funeral was on Saturday. I never really met this cousin and they had a falling out before she and I were together but they used to be close like sisters and were neighbors growing up living on the same street. They saw each other when they couldn't avoid it but generally avoided each other.





On Sunday morning I get a text saying I love you so much, I'm sorry but we need to talk when you get home. I started calling like crazy because that's the worst thing possible you can do IMO sending a message like that. Unfortunately her phone stopped ringing so she must have switched it off. I was worried and panicking most of Sunday and yes my mind jumped to cheating.





So I get home yesterday and she's there and tries to hug me but I pretty much just tell her to say what she needs to say because I was angry she just messaged that to me then went dark. Her cousin died and she was devastated despite their falling out. At the wake on Friday she ends up meeting a family friend and drinking a bit. Then on Saturday after the funeral they end up spending more time together in a group then alone before she had sex with him several times on Saturday night. When she woke up on Sunday it hit her just what she'd done and she freaked out. 




According to her she was devastated, not thinking clearly and just needed something to take her mind off of what happened. She was apparently in a really bad way and wasn't thinking about me or us just then. She's been nothing but apologetic to the point of near groveling since yesterday.




But Idk, I'm devastated, I feel sad because I knew she was always kind of torn up about her falling out with her cousin but this doesn't excuse her hopping into bed to grief fuck away her emotional pain. I mean jesus christ we've been together 6 and a half years, our wedding is in October. And I couldn't even sleep yesterday or last night because I can't stop getting enraged thinking about her being with another man regardless of the reason.




I looked at her this morning and felt nothing except intense sadness and disgust. She tried hugging me and I just left and went for a drive. I took the day off today and I'm regretting that because I'm just at home now with this shit playing through my mind.

PrestigiousClue,2019-04-30 11:39:00+00:00,I (21M) helped out someone (F) 3 years ago and I had no idea how much it meant to them till now.,"This is meant to be a happy story that I would like to share :) 

**Backstory:** 

About 3 years ago, while I was into my second year of university, I had a particular situation where I was coming back home from my university campus via the train. It was already pretty late into the night (I think roughly 11pm or so at that point in time when I boarded the train). When I got onto the train, I was the only person in the carriage. I was pretty flat out exhausted at that point and started to ""sleep"" on the train. By sleep, I had this habit where I would doze off and back awake every 1-2 minutes, which helps me to make sure I get off at the correct station without missing it *most* of the times. 

After 2 or so stops into my train ride, I saw a young girl and an older man enter the same carriage as me on the train. I didn't exactly pay much mind to this as I assumed it was just a father and daughter on the train to get back home or something. Plus, I was half asleep on the train anyway. However, we were seated on the train in such a way where we could see each other's faces. This was a critically important part of this scenario as I started to notice that the girl was exhibiting a very fearful attitude towards the man. The man's face was also very terrifying and I had a feeling he was probably on some kind of drugs or just mentally fucked up in some ways. Quickly started to realise that this girls life was in danger from some kind of predator. At this point I had to think of a way to prevent this bastard from taking advantage of her. After maybe 2 or so minutes I figured out a scenario to play out and hope to God she catches on. 

So, first thing I do is try to play it cool. I wake up and ""yawn"" to make it look like I was really asleep. I stare at her and give off a surprised look. 

Me: ""OMG Jessica! Didn't realise you were on the train. Why didn't you wake me up and sit with me haha"" 

Girl: ""Wait what..."" 

I thought ""fuck"" she's not catching on. I had to carry the conversation till she does. Also I just gave her a random name Jessica to make it look like I knew her. That's not her real name. 

Me: ""Guess what Jessica? I just passed my exam and got a black belt in my Karate class examination."" &lt;-- Also utter bullshit on my side once again. I knew nothing about any martial arts. At this point she caught on. 

Girl: ""Wow congrats Bob!"" Bob isn't my real name btw. 

She then walks up from the seat, hugs me, and whispers ""Help me, please"". 

At this point, we up against the doors of the train and we're faking a friendly conversation with each other. The other man also walks up from out of his seat and is standing somewhat close to us. Now, from Sydney, our trains will usually have an announcement that's like ""doors closing, please stand clear"", and then the doors start to close. I was waiting for this announcement for the door to close, and whilst the doors were midways through closing, I grabbed her hand, and pulled her out of the train with me, whilst that other man was still on the train. Thankfully, the doors closed fully and the guy was unable to open it. When the train started to move again with both of us out of the train, the girl looked at me and started to burst out crying and saying how she thought she was going to die. 

I told her that it was fine. I walked her out of the station together and asked for her address to send her an Uber home. I found it strange that she was still so far away from home, as the Uber costed me roughly $120 from memory. I was kind of gutted by having to spend so much money, but realised that she was still in danger from that fuckwit coming back for her and that $120 was a small price to potentially save someone's life. At this point, she took the Uber home and I felt reasonably reassured that she was completely safe. At this point, I simply got back to the train again and got home. I thought this was the end of the story but it wasn't. 

**Fastforward to about a week ago:** 

At this point, I mostly forgot about this incident (happened 3 years ago). A lot has happened to me inbetween and long story short, I wanted to try get fit and start exercising again. I looked around and found a Karate club near my university campus. I decided to take a few lessons there to test it out and see if I liked it. 

Long and behold, the girl I saved 3 years back was one of the students in the dojo. She was the one who greeted me, not as a new student, but as the person who saved her in the past. At first, I didn't realise it was her, in fact she had to remind me of that incident from happening in the first place. She told me how she was so grateful for what i did back then and how for the past 3 years, she wanted to pay me back for what I did for her, but didn't manage to do because she forgot to ask for my contact details and other positive things about herself etc. 

Although, the interesting thing was, she recently got a black belt awarded to her from her sensei, I shit you not. The other students in the dojo talked about how she was an incredibly dedicated student of Karate the first day she came in. Some of the students told me about how she was always talking about ""The Karate master who saved her life 3 years back"". I guess she somehow got inspired to learn Karate from me, after bullshitting about it on the train years ago to scare off the fuckwit. I unknowingly became a talking point in this entire dojo for 3 years straight. 

And the funny thing was, she asked me if I was picking up another ""style"" of Karate. I didn't even realise there were versions of Karate lol. I just wanted to get off my fat fucking ass and stay fit and try something new at that point. I had to admit to her that I actually knew nothing about Karate and was interested in just learning. 

So now, I am learning Karate, from the girl I saved 3 years ago. The girl got inspired to learn Karate from me, a ""karate master"" and is now one of the best students in the dojo lmao. I can't believe the impact I've made to this girls life, and and how much she seems to have grown from her timid, defenceless self 3 years prior. 

PS. She was pretty upset at me for lying about being a black belt in Karate. But then thought it was funny when I told her the reason I did that on the day (to scare off that guy). 

tldr; Saved a girl's life 3 years ago. Just met her again a week ago and it's amazing to see how she's grown it makes me so happy :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bj29pj/i_21m_helped_out_someone_f_3_years_ago_and_i_had/,relationship_advice,1880,151,0.0

After reading tons of replies in the thread and all of the stories about girls who dated guys who also had thumb dicks, I was able to tell her about my peewee issue without feeling very embarrassed. I opted for a playful serious way to talk about it with her, so I told her that I had a micropenis and that I was serious. She asked me how big it was and I said that it was in the 2 inch region, give or take a bit. She said that she didn't expect it to be so small and that she wished I told her sooner, but she said that it's okay as long as I make it up to her in other ways. ;)

We decided that since I'm gonna have to make up for my lack of a fun-rod, we'll just buy toys that I can use on her and give each other the good ol mouth treatment. After she took it well, I jokingly told her that since my penis is around the size of one of her thumbs, we should have a thumb war and that instead of my thumb, I can use my penis in battle. She took it well and we both laughed about the joke and continued on with our day.

Anyways, I can successfully say that we did it Reddit! Thank you all for your stories and advice, it really helped me out a lot.

anorangehorse,2019-04-29 16:36:19+00:00,"UPDATE: My friend is about to ask his girlfriend to marry him, but I’m the only one who knows how unfaithful she is. Do I say anything?","Original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bicdpm/my_friend_is_about_to_ask_his_girlfriend_to_marry/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

So I got lots of feedback on what to do here. A good majority of the commenters told me to say something. To clarify, it may not have been clear in the op but I was never planning on doing nothing. Of course you gotta tell your bro if they’re being cheated on. I just was not sure how to approach the situation. 

Some of the commenters gave me some very helpful advice. Some of you told me to talk to the girlfriend first, some of you told me to wait, some told me to gather a bunch of evidence first which I ended up getting from Alison, the third party friend. Some of you guys got angry with me for not telling him sooner, told me I was a bad friend. Some were sure he wouldn’t believe me, some predicted the gf would deny it all. Well all of you were somewhat right. Here’s how it went down: 

I messaged Alison early on in the day, shortly after I made the post because typing it all out brought my guilt and apprehension from the situation to the surface. I said to Alison that I needed to tell Aaron, and asked whether or not she had proof. This was when she sent me the screenshots of the text messages. 

Aaron came over at around 8, and what was great was that Alison came over too. We all sat down and talked for a bit, and we all told him our suspicions about Mary. Alison showed him the text screenshots of Mary talking to her ex, and also told Aaron all the stories she shared about her sexual encounters. 

What was the most surprising was his reaction. He took it very well. He first got very quiet, and just nodded. Aaron ended up telling us that he had a sneaking suspicion that something was going on. He was not aware of the hookups, but he and Mary had gotten into fights before over the fact that she doesn’t allow him near any other girls, but she goes out and flirts with other guys all the time. He told us that she had been distant lately, and would leave rather often without telling him where she was going. There were a few other small things he mentioned that told us he was just generally unhappy with his relationship. He knew in his gut something was wrong, but wanted to believe it wasn’t true. 

We started unwinding with some alcohol after that and it all got way more emotional. He cried, talking about how he felt stupid for not seeing it sooner, how he really loved her and would’ve given her anything. Then he got angry. At her, and even more so at the guy. Some unpleasant and derogatory terms were used to describe her. 

Ultimately he told us that he’s going to be breaking it off at least for now. We told him a million times how much better he deserved. He’s definitely not going to marry her. 

Thanks again all for the supportive words and advice. We saved a good man from heartbreak!",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/birl13/update_my_friend_is_about_to_ask_his_girlfriend/,relationship_advice,35010,1449,0.0

0dadbab0,2019-04-28 19:33:35+00:00,UPDATE: I (48 M) don't know how to be a dad to a child (1 year M) I never wanted.,"While it's only been a few days since I posted I think I've been able to find myself in a better place, mentally speaking. I've done a vast amount of thinking and introspection. I had a lot to process. A lot to figure out. I believe I was in a bit of a panic when I posted. I feel calmer now since reading each and every comment.

I know now more than ever that I was never meant to be a dad. I certainly never wanted to be dad. Yet here I am, a dad. That will never change. My son is here and he needs me more than I need the life I'd originally planned for myself. He needs me.

Admittedly I've been a very hands off father. Not truly involved nor invested. If anything I was peeking through the window of fatherhood. Or better put, having one foot in the door and the other out. Neither here nor there. Mostly watching from afar.

I think my fear of him and what he represented in my mind drove me away from him. It made me avoid him so I could avoid the overwhelming feeling of ""what have I done"" and ""my life is over."" I think avoidance made things fester, made my fear and dread grow, and that painted a dark cloud over everything.

Still, I feel heavy weight loathing for the future and I mourn for the life I wanted, even if it is selfish. I realize these feelings they need to go. I need to move on. Grieve in a sense and push forward and forget how things could have been. They simply are not and will never be.

I sent my wife away yesterday so I could spend the day with my son. My first day alone with him. Maybe that's pathetic. Maybe I'm a terrible man. Maybe I'm a terrible husband. Definitely an awful dad.

I wanted to experience him in a way I hadn't before. Alone without being able to hand him over when he frustrated me or I was bored. 

Honestly the day went shit. We both had a tough time. He wanted mom and so did I. There was this moment though when I sang to him ""I like to eat, eat, eat, apples and bananas"" and he laughed so damn hard. I've never made him laugh like that before. It wasn't miraculous or revolutionary but I did feel this little spark inside me. This little ""I want to do that again"" sort of feeling.

I've done what a lot of you have told me and I've reached out to a few therapists. I have an appointment for next week and currently waiting to hear back from two others. I want to shop around and find a good fit since I know I need this. I feel ashamed admitting such a thing. I feel embarrassed. I for some reason even feel emasculated too. 

There are also a lot of unpleasant things I feel when I look at my son. What I've utterly failed to take into account is what I see, which is the epitome of innocence. From that I learned that I need to seperate my feelings from him. Whatever negativity I feel is not his doing, that is all me and my fears surrounding him. He is not the source of my feelings. He is a trigger and I need to fix that.

My son is innocent and he needs me. This is the truth.

I'm not leaving. I've resolutely decided that I'm not leaving. I'm never leaving. I need to pack up that fantasy and put it out of my mind. My wife needs me. My son needs me more. He needs me. He needs me. He needs me. I keep telling myself this. He needs me. He needs a dad. I have to be all in because in the long run being all out seems like such a worse fate for all involved.

I want to touch on a few things before I wrap this up...

Saying I love my wife is a profound understatement. She is all my hopes and dreams rolled into a package of femininity and determination. I married her for the long haul not just until things didn't go my way. Nowhere in my vows did it say if we accidentally create a child everything we've gone through is null and void, my love will disappear and I'm out. 

Some people said she betrayed me. I've never felt betrayed. The baby wasn't planned. We even took steps to terminate but her heart said no and I respect that. I respect her and I respect her choice. She made the decision she could live with.  Unless you or your spouse has been pregnant and you've considered all your options your opinion really isn't relevant. Watching my wife go through the rollercoaster of emotions and hormones while battling with not only her desires but mine... It wasn't an easy decision for her. She didn't just suddenly decide she wanted a baby. She agonized over the decision.

The child is mine. Some called that into question. He is mine. There are personal factors that I don't want to get into, but I know without a doubt he is mine. And, yes, I have since gotten a vasectomy. I'd attempted twice in the past and was denied. They were hesitant because I was young and childless, then it was because my wife was still young and we were childless. Maybe I could have better searched for doctors but in the end we chose to go with an IUD.

As to where to go from here? Well, I'm a dad now. I have been for a year. There's no changing that. I must learn how to be a good one. My son needs me. I've ordered some parenting books for fathers. I've been researching some groups to join for fathers as well. I've also been contemplating cutting my hours at work. I typically work 10-12 hour days. I don't think that's feasible anymore. I'm a dad now and my son needs me.

He needs me.

He needs me.

He needs me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bif0xb/update_i_48_m_dont_know_how_to_be_a_dad_to_a/,relationship_advice,7263,412,0.0
anorangehorse,2019-04-28 15:28:33+00:00,My friend is about to ask his girlfriend to marry her and I'm the only one who knows how unfaithful she is. Do I say anything?,"Not sure if this belongs in this sub because it isn't my relationship I'm asking for advice about. If not, apologies. 

Tldr: my friend is about to ask his girlfriend of 6 years to marry him, and I'm the only one who knows the truth about how unfaithful she's been to him. He's completely blinded by love and to him she can do no wrong. I know it might not be my place to say anything but I don't want him to make a huge mistake.

So my good friend ""Aaron"" and his girlfriend ""Mary"" have been together for almost 7 years. They meet in college and are in a very close relationship. Personally I would call them extremely codependent. Neither of them really have any friends aside from each other. She doesn't let him have guy friends. In fact she doesn't let him do a lot of things. He's not allowed to go out past 11, not allowed to drink or smoke, she has to approve of all of his friends, and he's not allowed to be alone with other girls. She's got this guy on a tight leash. 

The reason why they're still together is that Aaron is completely whipped, and to him she can do no wrong. He talks regularly about how amazed he still is that she finds him attractive. (He's a decent looking guy, but she's like super model level good looking) 
They post cutesy couple photos every day (im pretty sure she makes him post them) and to everyone who sees them they appear to be the perfect magical fairytale couple.

Anyway a few weeks ago he told my boyfriend and I that he was planning on proposing to Mary. Of course we congratulated him because he seemed super excited. 

A few weeks prior to this, I hung out with a friend of Mary- ""Alison"". Alison told me about a party they went to where Mary got drunk and slept with her ex. After the party they began hooking up regularly, and she had a threesome with him and a friend of his. Aaron has no knowledge of these hookups. 

I told my boyfriend about it because he shares my friendship with both of them, and he believes that we need to say something but I'm not so sure. It will destroy him, ruin their entire relationship and maybe a friendship as well. However I think in the long term he will be unhappy with a marriage where she's so controlling. Not even that, but if she's completely okay with cheating on her long term partner it will be the same once they're married. 

Is telling him the right thing to do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bicdpm/my_friend_is_about_to_ask_his_girlfriend_to_marry/,relationship_advice,2606,509,0.0

I must admit that I was really homophobic and racist growing up. That was how I was raised. But when I moved to America, I met my wife and she helped me a lot. She helped me adjust to this new country and changed my racist and homophobic opinions. I owe that to my wife.

Yesterday, my daughter told me that she wanted to talk to me. So we sat down to talk, and she told me that she wanted to bring her girlfriend over for her birthday. It took some time to sink in, but I understood. When I asked her if she was coming out to me, she told me that she was. She asked me if I was fine with it and I told her that I had no problem with her choice and she will always be the same daughter to me. I must admit that I felt proud because my daughter actually trusted me.

After that, I asked her if she wanted to go out for dinner. She told me that she wanted to eat lasagna. I'm a chef and my daughter loves my lasagna. So I started to get ready to prepare it. 

At this point, my wife returned from her sister's house. Idk what went down but after a while, my wife started screaming at my daughter. And when I came to look, she slapped my daughter twice. My daughter was crying and I was really shocked. I asked what happened and my wife told me that my daughter came out and she did not agree with her. She told her that she can't be gay and started crying and yelling at her. 

I asked my wife to leave, because I was really angry. After my wife left I told my daughter that what my wife did was incredibly wrong and I'll stand by her. My daughter did not talk much, she just went to her room.

Now, my wife refuses to talk to me. She told me that she will be back only if I agree to help my daughter become straight. Idk what to make out of this.

I need some advice.","I'm only posting this because I don't want to discuss this with my family or friends. Hell, I don't even want this to be on my reddit account. Please hear me out.

My wife and I have been married for 12 years now. I don't want to dive into too many details about my wife's infidelity, but I'll be brief. She cheated on me with one of her colleagues at a party. And he got her pregnant. 

I think my wife knew that she wasn't my daughter. So she confessed that she cheated on me and indicated that I might not be the father of my daughter. Well, we got a paternity test and I'm not the father. I'm starting to see the lack of resemblance once the results were out. Hell, I always thought she had my eyes. My wife informed this to her colleague and he contacted me. I was really pissed and asked him to fuck off, but my daughter resembles him. I know. 

Now my wife tells me that I'm her only father and no one can take that away from me. But I know that with this guy around there is no possibility of that. I will forever resent him and his relationship with my daughter. This guy will be at her wedding, graduation and all important events. Guess that makes me the step dad now? I don't even know. I don't think I can stay, because he's ready to step up and be responsible. As for my wife, I don't think I can work this out with her. I'm thinking of asking her to leave with the kid. I'll just slowly make an exit out of the kids life because she now has a wonderful bio dad. 

Well, I guess that's what I get for being honest and loving. I'm not my former self anymore and I'm really pissed. But I'm trying to be decent here. I don't even know why I'm here. I just needed to vent I guess. Can't talk to family or friends about this. So I'm here. I don't even know what I'm expecting here but I want to get some perspective.

Other than being annoyed and anxious that I couldn't leave on the first day, I was fortunately okay. However, my mother was an absolute mess during all of this.  I can't blame her for her reaction, but she cried a lot and said that I could've died despite the doctors saying I would be fine and just needed to be observed. My boyfriend was very sweet towards my mother while she was being a wreck, he offered to go to her home and cook dinners for her and the rest of my family, to help clean the house etc.

Anyways, today I found out that when my boyfriend was over at my mother's house helping her out while I was in the hospital, he told me they were having sex together. I would have never expected this from him or my mother. My boyfriend said he wanted to tell me because he was feeling immense guilt and that he was so sorry. He told me that they had sex twice, that it happened while he was comforting her when she was having crying sessions. I thought it was a sick joke at first, but I realized he was serious pretty quickly because he started to cry while telling me. I told him not to talk to me right now, and that I will talk to him when I feel like talking again.

After I had that conversation with him, I left his place to go confront my mom and she denied it. I asked her a couple of times if she had sex with him and she kept saying no, so I brought up the fact that he admitted to it. She said he was lying, but I kept pushing her and she eventually told me the truth. She told me that she wasn't thinking, that she was an emotional wreck and didn't know what to do. That he was there to comfort her and he said all the right things to make her feel better. After she said this, I screamed at her for a couple of minutes while she just cried and then just ran to my room. It's now been roughly 2 hours since I've talked to her.

I'm most likely going to break up with my boyfriend over this. I probably should have when he told me, but I decided I wasn't in the right place to decide that right now. I really thought I was going to marry him, but I don't think that's going to happen anymore. For my mother, I don't know what to do. I know she's my mother, but it feels like she's ruined my life. My mother and I were so close, but now I feel like I never want to see or talk to her again. I feel a massive hole in my heart at the thought of hating her for the rest of my life.

I own my family business ( fashion and jewellery ). We have 2 daughters.

First off, I'll be honest with you guys. I'm not an attractive person. I look average at best. I don't have a chiselled body, but I'm fit. My wife is really beautiful and I always wondered what she saw in me. I was bald at 19, so I hope you guys get the picture.

When I was in my twenties, I was very awkward and introverted. I didn't date many girls, because no one was interested in me. I met my wife in college. We had similar interests and I fell in love with her. I asked her out and she said yes. I was on cloud nine. And we never looked back. 

Yesterday was our anniversary. We had a small celebratiion. When we were about to sleep, my wife started crying. I was really worried because I did not understand why. She hugged me and told me that she wanted to confess something. She ended up telling me that she faked her love for me when we were dating. She also told me that she cheated on me when we were dating. But she fell in love with me a couple of years after we got married. She told me that she really matured at that time and realised that I was the mist important person in her life. She also claims that she never cheated on me once we got married. She told me because she really felt guilty. She told me that she would do everything to make it up. 

I was really devastated. I always kind of wondered what she saw in me. And I think I have my answer now. I'm broken. I also know that I only know this because she confessed.

I thought that perhaps somebody had moved the enclosure to get a better view of my tarantula, because it wasn't uncommon for guests to do so. However, upon closer inspection of it, I found out that the lid wasn't properly sealed on. I knew immediately that something was off about this situation, because in the history of owning my tarantula, nobody had ever opened the lid of the enclosure to look at her.

When I noticed the lid was unsealed, I took it off and searched all around the enclosure for my spider, but she was nowhere to be found. My heart sank to my stomach when I realized that she was no longer in her enclosure. I immediately ran to my girlfriend, who had been inside the apartment all day, and asked her if she had any guests over. She said no. I told her my spider was missing, and then her face went blank and she looked away from me. My heart sank, because I knew something happened.

I asked her repeatedly where my spider went, and she kept saying she didn't know, but eventually she told me the truth, she told me she killed my spider. I started crying, because I loved that spider. I know spiders are unconventional pets, but I had her for 10 years and went through a lot of tough times with her. I asked her why she did it, why she hurt me and my spider which I was so fond of, and she told me ""I couldn't stand having it inside because it creeped me out so much."" I asked her what she did to her, and she told me she scooped her out of her enclosure with a cup, put her on the ground, and then stepped on her and put her body in the trash. I told her not to talk to me and left to go to my parents house, where I'm currently staying for an unknown amount of time.

I knew that my tarantula creeped her out, but she's known about her since before we started dating. I told her if it was a problem, then let me know, but she didn't say much after I assured her that I'm extremely cautious and protective of the spider. She knew that in all of the time I owned the spider, it had never gotten out on accident. She's lived with the spider for roughly a year now, and despite the occasional ""eww it's so creepy"" comment, she never seemed bothered by it.

What should I do? Would this be a dealbreaker for you? I love this girl, but I think she went way too far, and I'm struggling at the thought of talking to her right now.

TL;DR: girlfriend intentionally took my spider out of the cage and proceeded to step on her while I was at work. I'm not talking to her right now and I'm staying at my parents house.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bhiyzz/my_22m_girlfriend_20f_of_2_years_killed_my_pet/,relationship_advice,10054,3600,0.0

I wrote:

Hi I was dating and having sex with your boyfriend for a few months now. We met in class and he told me he was single. I just found out he was with you, which he denied, but I think you have a right to know. I don’t know how many people he has been with, but I am getting checked for STDS and I think you should too. Sorry that this is happening this way, but I wanted to let you know. 

I then provided text messages that showed his phone number and dates talking about sex together and him asking me not to tell her. 

The girl blocked me right away and the guy told me she didn’t believe me and to leave her alone. He said he’s not mad at me. Her friend message me, I gave more answers, but she told me I must be a “fake account spending spam messages”. I don’t get this because I provided pictures and have been responding.

This is making me feel worse he got away with it, but I’ve done all I can do. What’s this girls issue? It still hurts I feel like he chose her over me.

But we have literally everything thing in common so I figured I’d give it a shot. So after talking for a few days we decided to meet up at this nerd bar last night.

I get there and pick a table. After waiting a few minutes this beautiful woman comes over and starts trying to flirt with me. That’s very strange so I assume she must be after something. Free drinks, drugs, my kidneys, I don’t know.

So I explain to her that I’m actually waiting for someone and I don’t want to give a bad first impression by chatting up some other woman when she walks in.

That’s when she springs it on me that she’s actually the one I’m waiting for. She told me how she’s lost about 130lbs over the past couple years and she wants to make sure guys are actually interested in her and not just her body.

And she was also testing me to see if I would ditch the fat girl if someone hotter showed up. So here’s the thing, I don’t know how I feel about being “tested”. I don’t want to live my life questioning every decision I make like she might jump out from around the corner at any minute.

Just a little update:

My (ex)friend reached out to me and told me that she thinks my boyfriend and I aren’t compatible, and that our relationship probably won’t last. This really pissed me off. I told her that I saw them that night. She was upset and kept apologizing, insisted that it was a mistake (stuff like that) I told her I didn’t want to talk and that was that. I then confronted my (ex)boyfriend and he confessed that they have hooked up before. 

I have since blocked them both. I feel so hurt and I’m not sure when I’m going to feel okay again

lilpinkie,2019-04-25 05:01:48+00:00,My (17F) stepdad (51M) has been sleeping with my sister (24F),"**TLDR; I went through my sister's texts and found out she was sleeping with my stepdad. My mom is at my aunts house now and I don't know where my stepdad and sister are. I don't know what to do or think about all of this.** 

Throwaway account because I don't want this awful part of my life on my main account. Don't really care if my sister ends up seeing it because there's obviously nothing here that she doesn't already know!!

The title is pretty self explanatory. I'm still processing everything so I apologize if this post is a mess. Some context: my sister and I have different dads (my mom has been married twice, had my sister out of wedlock). My dad died when I was 11 and my mom married my stepdad 2 years later.

I came home pretty high last night around 1am thinking everyone was asleep. I was about to walk into the kitchen but jumped half a foot because my stepdad was standing there in the dark leaning over the sink. He had to have heard me but didn't turn around, and being there kind of creeped me out so I went upstairs. I heard someone throwing up in the bathroom and when I looked out the window I didn't see my sisters car (she moved out but ran out of money half a year ago and moved back into the basement) so I knew it was my mom in the bathroom. I knocked on the door to make sure she was okay but she didn't answer and I could hear her crying. I assumed she wanted to be alone and I figured me being high off my ass wasn't going to help so I just went to bed.

When I came downstairs this morning I couldn't find anyone, and there's usually someone there to drive me to school (I'm in high school, don't drive, and live out of district). We never leave later than 7 but I still couldn't find anyone by 7:30 and no one was answering my calls/texts. I still felt weird about last night but thought maybe it just seemed weird because I was baked and tired but it was obvious at that point that something was going on. 

I got a text from my mom around 8 saying she was sorry but everyone is okay and she'll write me a note for school tomorrow. She wouldn't tell me what was going on but my sister ended up coming home looking like shit. Whenever I tried asking her what was going on she'd either ignore me or tell me to fuck off, and she was frantically going into the basement and bringing up her things and putting them in her car. 

I could tell she was disoriented and at one point she left her phone on the kitchen table and went to the bathroom. I grabbed her phone (yeah yeah I know reddit is judgmental about that shit and I get it but I had no idea what was going on with my family and I was so worried I felt sick) and saw she had been texting my mom apologizing over and over and saying she knows that she's a slut and said something about how Shaun (our stepdad) isn't even related to her and that it ""wasn't as many times as you think."" I don't remember exactly what else she said because I only pulled random words from it before my sister came out and saw me but I pieced two and two together. She ripped the phone out of my hand so hard her nail cut my thumb and when I asked if she fucked Shaun she didn't answer and got in her car and left. 

I was shaking like crazy and felt like I was going to be sick. I couldn't stand being in our house alone so I got my boyfriend to leave school during lunch and come get me. I've been at his house since and haven't heard from anyone all day except for my aunt (mom's sister) who texted me asking where I was. She said my mom was staying with her and wanted to make sure I was safe and told me to just stay at my bfs if I could.

I don't know what the fuck to do in this situation. I'm so grossed out and I can't help but think about all the signs and ways that we didn't notice. Like I said my sister moved into the basement and my stepdad's office is down there, none of us have a reason to go down there aside from doing laundry so it very well could have happened there. 

An hour or two ago I started freaking out because I remembered a few weeks ago I went to my sister's friend's house with her and they were asking me if I've started watching porn yet. My sister brought up all this stuff she had saved on her phone and most of it was shit like ""sexy stepdaughter caught masturbating"" or ""stepdaughter begging for cock"" or something like that idk. I asked her why she watches stuff like that and she told me to ignore the titles, if you turn the sound off the story doesn't matter... When I brought it up with my bf he said that there's a lot of that kind of stuff going around right now and some people do watch it for the visuals and ignore the title/context. But he agrees that it's probably too much of a coincidence. 

For a bunch of unrelated reasons my mom and I have both had kind of a bad relationship with my sister for a long time, but since she moved back in we've been working really hard to improve things with her and I finally started to feel like we were real sisters. I really want to believe that it was all my stepdad taking advantage of her (that sounds bad when I type it out but I just can't understand why she'd do this to my mom) but with the porn and stuff idk. Plus she was apologizing to my mom a lot and my mom didn't seem to be answering her. My sister was already in college when my mom met Shaun so maybe he never thought of her as a kid? 

I really don't know if he's the kind of person who does this (I mean I know he did, but yeah I don't know the full story yet) because to be honest I just don't know him that well. He married my mom pretty soon after my dad died and I don't think any of us were ready but my mom was lonely. I don't know what she sees in him, he's pretty boring and works a lot and just watches sports and stuff but he never struck me as being a bad person. 

This is getting rambly and I don't know what details are important so I'm sorry if parts don't make sense. I just needed to get it out and see if anyone else has gone through this or has any suggestions about what to do? Is this a common thing that happens?? 

My boyfriend thinks I should give my mom space even though I want to comfort her because we're both still processing it. I don't know where my stepdad and sister are and I kind of want to know but also really don't.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bh4qad/my_17f_stepdad_51m_has_been_sleeping_with_my/,relationship_advice,5353,739,0.0
kjsother,2019-04-25 00:18:03+00:00,I (22F) woke up in the middle of the night to find my best friend (22F) sleeping with my boyfriend (24M) in the living room,"Throw away account for obvious reasons, and sorry for any formatting, I'm on a mobile.  

I don't even know where to begin, my head is such a mess right now.. So my boyfriend ""john"" and I have been dating for three years and at the beggining, it was the most romantic love story. I met him when I was 18 and starting dating him when I was 19 and the more I dated him, the more I saw a future with him. 

He would always put time and effort into me, take care of me and go an extra mile to put a smile on my face. But things have changed since then to say the least, after about 1.5 years of dating. It started with little things, like him not wanting to kiss me as much or finding excuses to not hang out. We went from seeing each other every day to only hanging out maybe once or twice a week for two hours. I know he's got his own life and I'm not trying to control him, but I wish he would make me feel a little more special and maybe make an extra effort to see me. 

I should probably also mention that I suffer from depression and a low self esteem, and it's probably really hard on John when I'm in a bad state. I try not to but sometimes I just can't help feeling so alone and in the dark. 

So anyways, we were celebrating my bestfriend's  (ex-bestfriend now?) birthday at my house last night with a bunch of friends (maybe about 20) and there was a fair bit of drinking. The reason she couldn't have the party at her house was because she shares her place with room mates, which was fine because I had no problem throwing her party at mine, as long as she helped clean the house up in the morning. 

The night went alright, but I did I notice John and ""Sarah"" (the best friend) we're getting a little too close like him grabbing her from behind and spinning her around. But I just brushed it off because I never noticed anything before and we are all bestfriends. 

So after around midnight, everyone has left and John, Sarah and I are just chilling in the longueroom laughing about our night together. And when it was ready for bed, I set up a mattress in the longueroom for Sarah and John told me he'd be in our bed soon. So I went to bed and crashed alone. And maybe after a few hours I woke up in the middle of the night desperately needing to pee. Now I don't have a bathroom connected to my room, it's down the hall. So I slowly get up and realise John isn't in our bed?? So I went to walk down the hall when I start to hear like moaning noises and I'm like wtf and I peek my head down the hall to see John and Sarah having sex. I know I should of confronted them right there and then but I couldn't, I just sneaked back into bed and cried silently. I didn't even have a chance to pee. 

So now it's morning, Johns snuck back into our bed and is acting like nothing's happened. I've lost a long life bestfriend and a boyfriend I put three YEARS into you. I don't even know how to confront them, I'm not even sure if I can confirm what I had seen because we were all drinking, it's driving my insanity crazy. But the real kicker is that John and I haven't slept together in months, but he can sleep with her. I just feel so low. 

How can I comfort them and even begin to process this? I don't want to lose John, we have our ups and downs but he's everything to me :((( if everyone has ever been in this situation and has any advice, feel free to let me know, just don't be too brutal.

0dadbab0,2019-04-24 20:28:55+00:00,I [48 M] don't know how to be a good dad to a child [1 M] I never wanted.,"So my wife (she's 40 and we've been married for 18 years) and I were vehemently childfree, or so I thought. We've always planned that if an accident did happen and she were to get pregnant she'd have an abortion.

We've talked in the past about a vasectomy, clearly it never happened. We both have a low libido. Sex maybe once a month. She had an IUD. Often we'd still use condoms since it was more cleanly. 

Well against all odds my son was created. I pushed for an abortion which she wanted originally. That never came to fruition since she began to have doubts it was the right thing to do. Eventually she said she just couldn't go through with it. I don't blame her nor do I feel negatively towards her suddenly wanting to be a mother. Afterall is the most natural thing there is, especially once pregnant. I could not fault her. I love her dearly. She knows what she is and isn't capable of and she wasn't capable of abortion.

She has acclimated wonderfully to motherhood, whereas I to fatherhood? Not so much. I was planning on retiring in a few years. We were going to travel since we haven't ever done much of it. I've always been fairly busy. I was ready to be done. I've worked hard to put us in a position where this was possible.

Now with a child it's really not feasible. That's not the point really. The point is this niggling sense of resentment. The fact that I'll have a teenager in my 60s fills me with dread. The fact that when I look at my son I don't feel love, just an overwhelming sense of responsibility.

I feel horrid saying that, but this isn't the life I wanted nor dreamt of or worked hard for. I don't hate him for it. It is what it is. I'm struggling, however. Mentally mostly, I'd say. Emotionally I'm a wreck. I think I hide it well.

It's just never ending. He goes goes goes. And screams. He's never satisfied. He's cute when he laughs. He's a spitting image of me. I feel a pull towards him. I wouldn't miss him if he disappeared. I want him to be happy. I'm not happy. How will this ever work?

I'm afraid of failing him and creating some sort of monster. I'm afraid I'll never be enough. I'm afraid I'll never feel content in my own home ever again.  I'd run if I were a lesser man. I'd never leave them without means to care for themselves... but I'd run.

I will never run. He needs more than just money. I don't know how to be more than just a wallet. How do I love him? How do I be everything he needs? How do I not lose myself in the process?

Gonzo_Fish,2019-04-24 17:36:49+00:00,My (31M) wife (37F) will no longer let me pursue my hobbies.,"Exactly as the title implies, she says I am not allowed to pursue my own hobbies anymore, as they are ""unhealthy"".

Before our marriage 7 months ago, I was interested in all sorts of things - playing video games for at least a few hours per week, collecting Star Wars figures (some may say that was a bit childish anyways, but I enjoyed it none-the-less), painting Warhammer 40k, etc. These are things that I had done since my early teens.

My wife wanted us to make healthy life-style changes after our marriage, which at first I took as just eating healthier, exercising, etc. I was totally on board for it. Everything was fine until I went down to the basement one day and noticed all of my Star Wars figures gone from the display shelf. All that remained were some limbs from a few of the figures.

My wife was at work, so I sent her a text asking what happened to them. In the meantime, I rummaged through all of the garbages and finally found the figures in the bigger garbage next to the garage. Most of the cards were torn up &amp; the figures dismembered, while others were completely burned or melted. I took a picture and sent it to her, asking if she did it.

That night, after not replying to any of my texts, I confronted her. It turned in to a huge argument about how my hobbies are immature and that she was repulsed by them, even threatening to not have sex with me until I gave them up. In the heat of the moment, I agreed with her, if only to get her to stop yelling at me.

We haven't talked about it since, and I've unfortunately been abiding by her ""rules"" for the past 7 months. Though I've been secretly playing video games, buying figures, etc (she only found out about it one time, and she destroyed it immediately). I can't keep this up any longer, I want to have my own hobbies without her getting upset.

What is the best way to bring the subject up again &amp; how can I let her know how much my hobbies mean to me?

So I finally talked to my wife about what was going on, told her I was worried about what she was doing and I wanted to know what her weight loss goals were just to make me feel better about things.  

She didn’t really seem to want to talk about it and just pointed to her original plan which did not make sense to me at all because she has lost much more than her original goal.  I kept pressing on it and she eventually started to cry and then started talking about how she tried reconnecting with her dad and didn’t understand why she wasn’t good enough for him.

Before I go into it more I’m going to say that her dad is a piece of shit.  He was abusive to her, broke her arm once while we were dating and gave her black eyes regularly which is why she started to wear makeup in the fourth grade.  

So when she tried talking to him he told her that she had gotten fat and a lot of other very harsh things to her that she has been dealing with on her own up to this point.

She wanted me to drive to the store to get a certain kind of ice cream for all the kids there (including our own). I'd already had a few drinks and was feeling a bit tipsy. I didn't think I should drive. My sister was also urging me to go. She was standing right there when my wife hit me. It was square across the face. I'd just told her there was no way I was driving since I'd been drinking and that if she wanted the kids to have icecream to go get it herself. My wife called me an asshole... Then wham...

My sister looked a little shocked at first and then just laughed. Everyone around us laughed. Maybe some of it was awkward laughter, but I can't say for certain. Nevertheless I felt humiliated.

The thing is that was far from the first time my wife has hit me. It started a year or two after we were married (we married at 25). It was infrequent at first. She was always super apologetic. Over time it escalated. She started throwing and smashing things. Screaming. Berating me. Hitting, kicking, and punching me. I don't even know how it got so bad. It just is and I feel trapped. Who in their right minds would believe me? Who would ever think she was capable of this? Sometimes I feel like I'm hallucinating it all and I'm just losing my mind. She was once such a wonderful woman and mother, and now? I don't even know.

Now people do know and it doesn't even matter. It's funny. I'm funny. It's so fucking funny. Look at him getting hit by his wife. So damn funny.

I want to disappear. I would if it weren't for my kids.

I don't even know what my question is. I don't really have one.

Is even possible to come back from this? I wish I could reverse time and pause it when we were happy.

I want to put the whole thing behind me and focus on moving forward now, but my last post got a lot of responses to I felt as though I needed to say at least something on the matter. 

A lot of you have been greatly helpful to me in this time and I appreciate that more than I can say. To those of you calling me an idiot or saying I was making excuses for him - I wasn't. Evidently I knew his actions were wrong, otherwise I wouldn't have made the post to begin with. I clarified that he was usually very nice to me because he was. He's helped me through panic attacks, paid for a lot of my food when I've had no money, defended me against a previous abuser, and always been very attentive prior to recent incidents. Of course I knew that his actions in my post were wrong, I was trying to stress that he is not normally like this &amp; that he was not aggressive with me. This is a man that I felt safe with because he had given me all the reason in the world to feel safe with him. He protected me from a lot, and literally came to my aid at 3am once when I was alone and distraught on some random beach! Of course he had my complete trust.

Anyway.

Following my last post, I basically avoided him and confided in some of my rl friends about it. In doing so, one of them (lets call her Daisy) brought me to the realisation that I was never THAT insecure about my body, and that my boyfriend had simply been making me feel that way. It sort of feels like a weight has been lifted in that regard but the realisation made me so so so angry. I rarely get angry but talking to everyone and reading everything and learning more about gaslighting made me SO pissed. Then there was the icing on the cake - TWO of my friends confirmed that he did indeed go to Lucy's party (no shit) but Lucy hadn't actually wanted him there?? She's apparently very aware of his obsession with her and isn't entirely comfortable with it. Great! I guess I'm fucking blind.

That really was the final straw for me. So last night when I saw him, I asked him about the party again and whether he went to mine or Lucy's. Again, he said mine. I told him that I'm not an idiot and that our friends could all confirm his whereabouts. He seemed bothered that I had been talking to people about the situation and he started with the whole ""your jealousy is really getting bad"" shit and at that point I lost my temper. I told him that I wasn't jealous, I was just trying to understand why he was lying to me about something so dumb. It wasn't even a good lie. 

We had a pretty rough argument and I brought up his constant comments about surgery and as we argued, little things started dawning on me about other stuff he had previously done. I cried a lot. He kept trying to be calm but it didnt always work.

But yeah. I'll spare the gory details. I did try to break up with him but I don't think it sunk in. As far as I'm concerned we're over, but he doesn't seem to really get it yet. I'm sure he will soon. I've blocked him on everything and I'm going to keep my distance, but we have a lot of the same friends so fully cutting him out isn't going to be as easy as I would like. I'm done with this though. He dominated so much of my life and I'm still doubting myself so much about everything but i have a lot of good friends helping me. Apparently he was weird about Lucy even when he was with his ex, so I think I might talk to her about the situation. 

I wanna keep moving forward. I need to get past this fucking fog in my brain that he put there. When we met he told me he'd lost a sibling in a car crash, yet no one ever spoke about it and I thought that was strange. At the time I thought it was due to grief but now i think no one spoke about it because it didn't fucking happen. I had so much faith in this man and for a long long time he really was my best friend. I already miss him and it fucking sucks but frankly I've overcome worse.

I'll be fine.

turbomaxshootem,2019-04-22 20:35:16+00:00,UPDATE: My [34M] wife [28F] wants to name our baby after her dead ex-boyfriend,"Hi all!

Wow - so, this post got a lot more traction than I expected. First of all, I want to thank all of you for your advices and showing your concerns not just for myself, but, for my wife. It means a lot.

Now, onto the update.

For Easter, we already had plans with her family to go to church and then have a BBQ at her sister’s. Not wanting her family to see any tension, I saw this as a chance for her to HAVE to speak to me. As we’re getting ready for church, I tell her that we need to talk about everything now. She agreed and sat down with me.

I did tell her that there is absolutely no way we’re naming our baby after her ex (or, any of our kids, if we have even more). She agreed and apologized for acting irrational.

Also, I know a lot of you suggested that I get a paternity test. I know that I’m 100% the father. I didn’t want anyone to get my anxiety up since, while it may seem rational, jumping into an extreme conclusion and making things worse. I thought it out, but, I still did ask if she was still in love with her ex and is she did cheat. She adamantly said no. She had already stopped loving him, even before they broke up. She tried to make the relationship work, but, she just wasn’t in love with him anymore. She described him as not being a good person at all.

She apologized for making me feel that way.

I told her that I understand she’s going through a lot of emotions right now and being pregnant doesn’t help at all. But, I had to ask on why she would want to name our baby after him, even after all she has told me. 

She started to get choked up and was shaking. I told her that she could tell me. 

She confessed that when her and her ex broke up, the last thing she told him was that she wished he would fall off his bike and die. Also, the bike that he died riding on was a bike that she strongly suggested that he buy, even though it wasn’t his first choice.

She also talked about how accidentally getting pregnant and her ex suddenly dying is a lot for her to handle. She wasn’t expecting to be a mom so soon and her life is about to change when she really didn’t want it too. She talked about how she thought we’d travel and that she’d continue racing her motorcycle. Now, she’s not even sure if she’d be able to ride again. She actually thought she might be able to ride again once she had the baby, but, her ex’s death reminded her how much of a risk it is. She doesn’t want to risk her life when she has a family. She feels gutted. 

Regardless, she kept stressing out to me on how she wouldn’t change a thing about her life now and that she’s happy to be married to me and is going to be a mom. We’re the best things that has ever happened to her.

Anxiety also runs in my wife’s family. My wife gets intrusive thoughts about how her ex died too. It’s so bad that she has a hard time sleeping sometimes. 

After discussing things, she decided that she’ll be going into therapy.  She has her first appointment this week.

TLDR: Wife feels guilty about ex’s death after persuading him to buy the motorcycle that he died on and telling him she wished that he’d fall off his bike and die. She keeps thinking about how he died. Wife also said that she’s happy to be married and is going to be a mom, but, there’s a lot going on and it’s a lot. She’s sad that she probably can’t ride motorcycles anymore. Wife will go into therapy this week.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bg71a7/update_my_34m_wife_28f_wants_to_name_our_baby/,relationship_advice,10019,433,0.0
kupo_kupo_wark,2019-04-22 12:08:10+00:00,How do I tell my sister I don't want my unvaccinated nieces to visit my newborn?,"So a little bit of pretext, I live several states away from my family so seeing them is far and few between. In January I found out I was pregnant after losing twins last year, so my family is ecstatic to say the least. My sister and her husband are going through some financial struggles so I understand it's difficult to make a trip to visit, so it came as a shock when she suggested the other day, they wanted to plan a trip up here when the baby is born. The problem is she's an anti vaxxer. 

I have two nieces, 7 and 4, who haven't gotten a single vaccine in their life. I love my sister dearly, but she firmly believes in the hype surrounding their dangers, along with many beliefs with western medicine. They have no health insurance and when the kids are sick, she takes them to a chiropractor. Every food must be gluten free, organic, natural, because, without testing, she just ""knows"" her children have egg, dye, and gluten allergies. Ironically she's also a massive germaphobe, keeping her kids homeschooled. My point is not to knock her, my point is to stress how much of a lifestyle this whole thing is and therefore not as easy as just saying she does one thing but not the other. She is a full 100% on board with the term ""vegan crunchy granola mom"". 

Last year she talked about coming up alone to visit my twins which wasn't a problem (we were vaccinated as children) but now her mentioning bringing up the kids when my baby is about 2-3 months old and therefore not up to date with shots, is sadly not an option. I was scared before but now with the measles making a comeback I'm even more freaked out and don't know how to word this. 

I know she's going to be offended and I know she's going to be upset but this is not an option nor is it up for debate. She chooses to believe in not vaccinating but my husband and I firmly believe in science and medicine and after losing two children I'll be damned if I put another child in harm's way. Any advice on how I can word this to soften the blow would be very much appreciated. Like I said, this is not a negotiation and it's a firm no they can't come up but I'm sure there's a better way to word this than, ""I'm terrified your children are going to kill mine.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bg1bte/how_do_i_tell_my_sister_i_dont_want_my/,relationship_advice,3400,568,0.0

I have smallish breasts which I am ok with but my husband is often suggesting I have a boob enlargement. I don't want to go through all that pain, I have always been this size and was like this when we met and it never seemed to bother him then. Am I right to be upset? I have tried saying I am happy the way I am and that he was happy enough when we met. Why is it now an issue? I don't want to feel insecure but I am starting too. He also often talks about his hair as he's becoming bald, it's absolutely not a problem for me and I made some small jokes about it in the past but he's convinced it is a problem. He wants to get an hair transplant and he usually brings that up when he talks about my boob job, almost like he would undergo that procedure ""in exchange"" for my boobjob. He'd probably look better with more hair but I love the way he is now and I don't need him to change.

We don’t know this but we are subconsciously expecting this person to be exactly who we imagine them to be in our day dreams, in between steamy/funny texts and calls. We unknowingly place absurd expectations onto these people. We expect them to be someone we believe them to be. Nine out of ten times, we don’t even have a clue as to who they *really* are. This is just one reason relationships fail. There are so many others. For a relationship to work, it needs to stand up to so many challenges.

When you do finally get to know the person for who they really are, keep in mind that you too have your flaws. No one is perfect and nothing in this world is perfect, so how could your SO be perfect? Remember that only you can provide yourself with a love that is truly fulfilling. No other person can give this to you. Remember to stop focusing on the negatives of your SO and start focusing on the negatives you yourself are guilty of possessing. Remember to stop yourself from over analyzing small details that you know mean nothing in comparison to the big picture. Remind yourself to stop placing blame on others, ask yourself “what part do I play?” Every time  you think of a bad experience with a significant other, ask yourself, what did I do to fix things?

I got a call back from John and decided to take a drive while we spoke.

Yes, John is Rachel's husband.  He told me that Rachel admitted to sleeping with Sean.  In his office.  More than once.  He saw a text she sent to a friend talking about the remorse she felt for what she did.  He questioned her about it and at first she lied but she finally came clean about everything.  How it started when she was a STUDENT.  And he stopped it and then he started again.  About how she asked him not to leave the state because feelings back when I was looking for jobs bc I hated mine.... he agreed and i REMEMBER him telling me we should stay for a little longer to try to make it work there...

I asked if he had any proof and he did not.  Apparently when she told him his immediate reaction was A) I'm leaving you and B) we are telling his wife.  Rachel refused to participate in telling me.  He said he felt like I should know.  I'm glad he did.

I confronted my husband knowing full well that Rachel had time to warn him.  As expected, he said that Rachel had called him to warn him that her husband was crazy.  According to her, as soon as he had heard from her friends how hot the new prof was, he became obsessed.  He constantly accused Rachel of sleeping with Sean even though she wasn't.  Sean insisted that John is crazy and delusional.  He asked if John provided any hard facts and I said no, but I quoted some of the emails between Sean and Rachel.  He said that they may have a bit of a flirtatious banter but they NEVER had sex or anything else physical.  He also swore he is not in love with her.  He vowed to never speak to her again.

So here I am.  I believe John.  There is no real physical evidence but he didn't sound crazy to me.  But my husband is holding his ground.  I'm right, right?  John is telling truth?

twistgrebe,2019-04-20 15:27:13+00:00,Update: Got kicked out of boyfriends apartment for not wanting to have intercourse.,"Hey guys, thank you for all of the advice. But I guess I should clear some things up. 

In the three years that we have been together he’s been nothing by loyal, kind and loving. Since we started dating when we were 16 and 17 he has never pressured me into doing anything. He allowed me as much time as I need for me to get comfortable before even losing my virginity to him. He cares for how I feel and never wants me to be uncomfortable.

I do have my own transportation and do not depend on him to do anything for me. He’s likes to pick me up after work, he knocks on my door and at the end of the night will walk me to my door. This is how he has been since we started dating. I have offered to drive myself but he always refuses. In our relationship I’ve made it clear that it is 50/50. Growing up in a house where my Dad paid for everything while my mom wasted her money, I did not want us to be like that. We trade off dates, he’ll pay one then I’ll pay for the next. We each value being with each other  but we know that we need to be independent. 

To all those who commented that he’s just using me for sex and that he never loved me. You are wrong. We went a long time before even having sex, so if he was just using me then he waited a longgg time before even getting any. 

He called me the next morning before class crying, he wanted to take me breakfast so he could explain himself. He’s been having some family issues on top of finals. He was excited that he was finally able to spend time with and hyped himself up and got rejected. In the 5 minutes of silence the stress of his issues and the thoughts of why I “really” didn’t want to have sex made him snap. 

He said 10 minutes after he kicked me out he realized he truly fucked up and ran outside but by that time my roommate already picked me up. 

After posting on reddit I turned off my phone and went to sleep. When I turned it on in the morning I had multiple text messages and missed calls.

I talk to him and told him how his actions affected me and that they were not allowed. He apologize and swore that he’ll never do it again. I’m going to move on but not forget. We all have bad days and next time I’ll reconsider our relationship.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bfdcsp/update_got_kicked_out_of_boyfriends_apartment_for/,relationship_advice,8113,827,0.0

About a month ago I posted about my preggers roommate who knows I'm not a kid person. I came here to see if I was the jerk for not wanting to deal with it. This post garnered more attention than I expected but I wanted to thank you all for sharing your thoughts. It was truly divided between people who thought I was the jerk and people who thought I was in the right. I gave me a lot to think about.

After sitting on it for a few days, I contacted a local lawyer in my area and got a free hour of advice. She told me to go over my lease contract again and check all the fine print. It was good that she did because I found a clause that states I have to have all tenants on my lease even if they are temporary. I broke that rule by not putting my roommate on the lease. I had a meeting with my landlord and admitted my mistake. He said I didn't really break any laws by not having my roommate on the lease but Betty needed to come in and prove her income can sustain her and another person (her unborn baby) before they can add her. No big, right?

The result? Betty now knows she can't afford a baby. She has to apply for welfare if she wants to keep it so she moved back home (to another state) with her parents.

TL;DR - Betty moved out and back home with her mom. I AM the asshole for pushing it as far as I did. But I found a new roommate (19F) who is on the lease and who has no desire for kids for another five years at least. Betty is clearly better off with a support system at home and even emailed me a tiny picture of some white blurry thing with a big head that she called her son.

I figured there was an interest in an update so here it goes. This all happened a few days ago. 

The day I made the post she actually came up to me and said that we should do something romantic for our anniversary soon. Well, that didn’t turn out well. 

Before I told her about my background, I asked her why she holds these beliefs/attitudes towards Jews. She pretty much sounded like Hans Landa the whole time. At one point she even admitted that she got suspended from school as a kid for “teaming up” with a white supremacist and pulling a horrible “prank” on a Jewish student. 

Afterwards I bluntly told her that I’m Jewish. She didn’t believe me at all and thought I was joking. I told her that I was dead serious and she just laughed and told me to shut up. This went on for a while and she even asked for proof. 

When it finally hit her she looked like she died inside. Things went 0-100 very fast. She got physically aggressive and screamed at me, calling me a liar and a psychopath. She said that our relationship was never real because it was based on a lie and that she feels disgusted with herself. When she insulted me I reminded her that she really liked me despite my “dirtiness” which just pushed her over the edge. She cried hysterically and I left. 

The next morning she knocked on my door and insisted that SHE dumped me and not the other way around.  She warned me not tell people that I dumped her since that would make her look bad. I didn’t say anything and closed the door. I heard her screaming and knocking violently, basically asking me how dare I close the door in her face and that “you people are all the same”. After a while she left and started writing me on Snapchat. I blocked her, then she called me from a friends phone and verbally attacked me. I’ve never seen her act so crazy. 

Long story short, I blocked/deleted her on everywhere and she eventually stopped. I knew things wouldn’t go smooth, especially after our initial conversation, but I didn’t know it would be this bad. Some of her stuff is still at my place. Oh well

DoIt4TheMetricSystem,2019-04-17 18:50:59+00:00,My (22m) girlfriend (20f) tried to catfish me on twitter in an attempt to prove I'm disloyal,"This happened a short while ago but i only found out recently and haven't done anything about it. We've been dating just over a year.

Firstly, I'm a student but on Twitter I'm trying to get a small following for indie games development, as I am interested in game dev and like to make a few small things. Not long before all this happened, i had some tweets showing off some of my stuff that got moderately popular. I gained some followers, got some attention, and it encouraged me to post more and more. One night, just before sleeping, I text my girlfriend goodnight, and then my twitter buzzes with someone tweeting at me to message them. Their account is clearly about indie dev stuff too, but mostly bare, only saying they'll post their own stuff soon. I figure it's someone who saw my stuff and wanted to ask for help, so I messaged them. It didnt take long for their messages to get weird and flirty, and with the girl asking if i found her pretty, among other things. I told her she's asking the wrong person, i said i had a gf - they didnt stop. They sent a picture of her legs (which i deleted) and then they said to me they'd tell my gf that I'd flirted with them (i hadn't). My gf messaged me after all this, saying she couldn't sleep. I told her what happened and then she told me to block the account, so I did.

I dismissed it as a bot, but then thought about how oddly targeted it was. The fact they knew to target not only indie game dev, but a specific subcategory of indie game dev that I was interested in. I watched the account, thinking they would repurpose themselves for another attack if it really was a bot - but ever since it lay dormant. I found this odd and concluded it must've been someone who knew of my account to try and personally attack me. I figured I would never know who, so I let that be the end of it.

2-3 weeks ago my gf did something that led me to believe catfishing people wasn't beyond her. I analysed the messages from the twitter account and noticed they were similar to my girlfriend, but almost as if it was specifically her trying to type as if it's not her. Furthermore, i recalled that on the night, my girlfriend conveniently disappeared just before this girl contacts me, and reappeared once the conversation had ended, where my gf asked specifically what i was doing and why i couldn't sleep. Lastly, i remember my girlfriend expressing some insecurity about wishing she was a game dev so that i would love her more, which would be a believable motive. It was all too convenient.

I happen to have her password, and I know she uses it for everything, so I try it on the account, thinking i have nothing to lose. And boom, I'm into the account. So i know it was her. She tried to catfish me with a fake account to prove I'm disloyal, and yet i didn't do anything wrong. I told the fake girl immediately i have a girlfriend, nor did i flirt back. She brings this up occasionally as if it's something i did wrong, even though i know it was her. What should i do?

JohnThaRipper,2019-04-17 17:14:09+00:00,My girlfriend of 3.5 years kisses ex at sisters wedding right before I’m about to propose,"My girlfriend (24f) of the past 3.5 years told me that when she went to her sister’s wedding without me over the weekend that she kissed her ex. 
We had a trip planned for this upcoming week to go to Spain and I was going to ask her to marry me - she was well aware this was going to happen. She always told me there was nothing she wanted more. 
She tells me she was drunk and it “just happened”. 
I’m so hurt right now. She’s said how sorry she is many times, and I believe her, but I feel so betrayed. 
We’ve had a great relationship up to this point, I’ve loved every minute of it. To add to it she tells me before that how she confided in him that she was scared of spending the rest of her life with someone and how she was unsure about our relationship. 
This hurts me to my core to think that someone I wanted to spend forever with could do this to me. Out of all the women I’ve ever dated she was the one I was least worried about this happening with. 
She tells me that it was the biggest mistake she’s ever made and how she regrets it, I just don’t know if I can move on. 
We live together, have a dog, have built a life together which makes a breakup even more difficult. 
I just don’t know what to do. I still love her to pieces  but idk if I can get past this. 
Do I still go on the trip with her? Do I try and make this work? I’m certainly holding off on the proposal for now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/beadoo/my_girlfriend_of_35_years_kisses_ex_at_sisters/,relationship_advice,17036,3225,0.0

We’ve only been together two months but he was my first everything, first kiss, first boyfriend, first sex, first everything. My age limit when it comes to dating is 25, so falling into a trap and dating someone 14 years older than me was never the plan. I suspected he was older when his nephew who is 27 and married told me his own age, which didn’t add up cause my boyfriend told me his nephew is 22 and unmarried and I asked his roommate for his age the next day and he told me he was 29, i didn’t know the next step to take so I was just angry and I didn’t tell my boyfriend, I just stopped talking to him and then the next two days I picked his call to call him a liar and how he lied about his age. We met up and he just blamed me for not trusting him, and for not asking for his ID and believing rumors. So I searched him online and some name came out and it listed him as 33. But I still snopped some more, so now I just met his friends wife in my school and I talked to her and asked for his age and she told me he was 30’s.

RedHeadRebel,2019-04-16 16:51:55+00:00,My girlfriend just broke up with me over something that happened almost 10 years ago.,"Last night, me and my girlfriend were just hanging out in my apartment when we randomly started talking about middle school memories. I eventually reached a memory back in 2010 near the end of my 8th grade year. It was at our Spring dance and it was our last dance of the school year. It was actually pretty boring and me and a couple of friends were looking to sneak away. The three of us ended up sneaking into the bathroom to do some prank calls on random numbers and while we were in there, we saw that one of the toilets in the stalls was FILLED with toilet paper and unflushed diarrhea. We thought it was disgusting, but we also got a good laugh out of it.

One of my friends tries to flush it, but it just ends up overflowing and a bunch of shitty water starts flowing onto the floor. The three of us just ran off and blended back into the dance crowd. A few minutes later, our language arts teacher stood on the stage with a microphone and started yelling about the overflowing mess in the bathroom and how the dance is being cut short because of it. She then starts screaming ""I'M DONE!"" into the mic and later in the week, we find out that she actually quit her job as a teacher and just settled on being a waitress at Denny's.

Me and my three friends were never caught, but the bathroom was closed off for the rest of the year and there were multiple rumors about who caused the overflow. I told this story to my girlfriend and I thought that she would get a good laugh out if it, but she wasn't amused. She just shook her head, called me immature, and left my apartment. Then she calls me and tells me that she's breaking up with me. She said that she's done some thinking and she doesn't want to risk being with me if I'm still in that immature stage. I tried to explain that it was back in 2010 and I've obviously changed since then, but she didn't want to hear it. Now I'm both pissed and confused about the logic behind my girlfriend's decision. I don't know how to process this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bdw8ic/my_girlfriend_just_broke_up_with_me_over/,relationship_advice,9762,1426,0.0
hoabreakin101010101,2019-04-16 12:39:05+00:00,My(24m) parents told me that they want me to take legal guardianship of my sister with downs syndrome (20f). The argument ended with my entire family angry with me.,"So, let me preface this with some background context. Fair warning to you if you read this, I am fully aware that many of my actions and possibly even this most recent disagreement will show me in an extremely bad light. I'm just looking for advice for what to do next. This will probably be a long read and a partial rant so I apologize for the length and probably unnecessary background details.

My younger sister Melissa was diagnosed with both autism and Downs Syndrome and is completely incapable of caring for herself. My entire childhood was spend with me acting as her personal caretaker since I was ten. As a teenager I was effectively forbidden from having a social life because my parents worked long hours and when they got home I was expected to be in the room with her at all times and make sure she didnt hurt herself or do things she wasnt supposed to. This led me to being a social outcast during school because teenagers are rude assholes who would take any chance to knock someone down a peg or two, and the guy who couldnt go to parties or even play video games at home because his sister was a ""Downie Girl"", as they liked to call her, was an easy target.

During my childhood, I was expected to yield to Melissa's needs in all things. During my birthday I was unable to get large or expensive presents because Melissa would throw a tantrum that lasted for days if she also didnt get a present. I wasnt allowed to have any kind of video games or watch TV with Melissa in the room because she started screaming at the screen until it was turned off. My parents got rid of the bike I had gotten for Christmas because Melissa kept trying to ride it and broke her wrist when she fell in the driveway. Even going to the bathroom with the door closed was not allowed because Melissa started banging on the door and screaming if any doors were closed.

This led to me having a lot of resentment toward my parents. Any time I wanted to go do something that didn't involve my sister, like seeing a movie or going to one of my few friends houses, I was always told that if I couldnt do it with Melissa, I couldnt do it at all. From middle school through high school I was mostly either at school or at home looking after my sister. There was more than one argument with my parents over this, and as a teenager I resolved to free myself of what I saw as the burden of my sister as soon as I was old enough to be on my own. My parents were already talking about me staying at home in the coming years to help them take care of her, a situation they seemed to have just decided was going to be reality without ever discussing it with me. Any time I tried to talk about going to college or moving out on my own, it always started a huge argument. 

During my junior year of high school my family was going through some financial hardships, which required me to get a part-time job after school to help support the family. Though I know it was a dick move, I used this opportunity to hide away about a 1/3rd of my wages in my room where my parents couldnt find them rather than putting them towards things my parents said we needed. I planned on using this money to move out and get my own place and go to college and live my own life. Originally I planned on sticking it out for another year or two until I had enough money to get my feet under me and then peace out when I felt that my parents were financially stable enough to hire someone to look after Melissa when I was gone.

During my senior year of high school I somehow got myself a girlfriend despite being a shut-in and asked her if she would go to my senior prom with me, which she said yes. I begged my parents to let me go and told them that this was the only time that I would ever be able to go do something without Melissa and just have some time to myself that I could enjoy without Melissa trailing along behind me. After months of trying to convince them, my parents finally agreed and everything was set to go. This was incredibly important to me because social events of any kind had been entirely beyond my reach for my entire life until this point.

A week or two before the prom, my dad came home from work all excited because he had won two tickets to Vegas from an office raffle. My parents spent a day or two discussing when the best time to go would be, or if it would be better just to sell the tickets for some extra money. They eventually figured out some times they would be able to go on the trip, but because of scheduling conflicts the only time they could go would be the day before the senior prom, which meant I would be needed at home to look after Melissa. My parents sat me down and told me that they knew it was upsetting for me to miss the prom, but this was an expensive trip and they had really needed some vacation time for years and they hoped I would forgive them for it.

I had never been so angry in all my life. I had spent months trying to convince them to let me go to the prom with my girlfriend only for them to yank the rug out from under me at the last second. That particular screaming match lasted for nearly two hours, in which I threatened to go to the prom anyway whether they were home to look after Melissa or not, and telling my parents how much I hated being Melissa's caretaker. I told them I wasnt going to spend years of my life looking after her, that she wasnt my problem, and I was going to leave as soon as possible.

They didnt take any of those things well. After days of arguing, I found my dress clothes torn up and stuffed in the garbage, and with a strict dress code to be able to enter the prom and being unable to buy new clothes without tipping my parents off to my money stash, I was effectively unable to go to prom. In that moment I decided that my 18th birthday was the last day I would spend in this house.

Prom came and went without me, and I kept working at my job and putting money away while seething in anger over what I saw as the injustices being done to me and my freedom. At 3AM on my 18th birthday, I packed up my clothes, grabbed my money from under the mattress, left a goodbye letter on my bed, stowed my stuff in my girlfriend's car in the driveway, and left. I left my phone behind and blocked my parents on all social media. At that time, I was so angry that I fully intended to never see them again. 

Family members tried to contact me over the next few weeks, but I ignored them all. I moved in with my girlfriend near the closest college and started attending classes and having the kind of freedoms that I had never been allowed to have before. For the first time in my life, I wasnt miserable. I decided I wanted to get a law degree and for nearly two years I had zero contact with my parents and only the occasional message from a distant relative.

Eventually the guilt got to me. I realized that outright abandoning my parents with no warning when they had a special needs kid who needed looking after was too harsh of a way to break things off. The day after my 20th birthday, I called my parents and asked if we could meet up. The meeting was tense but in the end I thought I had gotten my parents to see my side of it. I was still with my girlfriend, I was making good grades in college, and in the end my parents and I made up. I was in contact with them and Melissa again and had been from that day until today.

A couple months ago my dad found out that he had cancer in his liver, and his doctor told him he had maybe three years to live. After a lot of exploring different options, my dad decided that the best thing to do was put his affairs in order and accept the inevitable. He and my mom have been traveling the world for the past few months while I was looking after Melissa for them with my now-fiance for the first time since high school.

When my parents got back a few days ago, I had expected them to return to taking care of Melissa. I'm still working on my law degree and have a side job, and my fiance has been making hints that she was looking forward to my parents getting back so we could have the house to ourselves again. Our budgets were strained, but with the assumption that this was only a temporary thing I was willing to accept it.

My parents saw it differently. When I drove to their place with Melissa to drop her off, they asked if it would be alright if Melissa stayed with me for another couple months. I told them I couldnt do that and explained that it was simply too expensive for me to take her for so long with so little notice. I suggested contacting my dad's sister Alice and asking if she would be able to help.

This started another argument. Apparently from what I was able to put together from the two of them screaming over each other, they had planned on leaving Melissa with me for a few months while they went traveling, then having me take her for a few more months when they got back and then giving me paperwork to sign over permanent guardianship of her to me. In their eyes since I was working on becoming a lawyer I would have plenty of money to hire someone to take care of her for me and my dad would be able to live out the rest of his life without the stress of looking after her.

I angrily told them that we had been through this before and I had no intention of becoming Melissa's guardian, now or ever. I was more than willing to help them financially when I was able, but I would not take responsibility for her. I left Melissa with them and went home, and told my fiance what happened. Soon afterward my phone started blowing up with Facebook notifications. My parents told my extended family what happened, but framed events in such a way to make it look like I had agreed to take care of Melissa and then dumped her back in their laps as soon as they got home. My aunt Alice has been repeatedly tagging me in posts for the past several days calling me an ungrateful slob who doesnt love Melissa or my parents and only cares about myself. When I responded to a post and asked Alice why she couldnt take care of Melissa if she cares so much, about a dozen members of my family dogpiled me calling me a trash human being and how terrible I'm being to my sister.

So that's essentially where I'm at right now. My dad is dying of cancer, my sister is soon going to have only one guardian, and my parents expect me to take care of her for the rest of my life when I made it very clear that I dont want to. What can I do to resolve this? Is there any way to deal with this without being seen as the bad guy here? *Am* I the bad guy here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bdtg6v/my24m_parents_told_me_that_they_want_me_to_take/,relationship_advice,27253,4310,0.0

I need some advice on this.,"My wife and I have been married for 7 years, dated for 6 before that. I always thought we had an amazing relationship. We have twin daughters (6f &amp; 6f). 

Recently, I found out that my wife has been cheating on me for years with one of her colleagues. This completely upended my life. I shared that with my sister, who asked me to get a paternity test done on my daughters. I was really hoping for the best, but the results came and they're not mine. I had a panic attack when the results were out. I'm completely broken and I don't think I have anything left anymore. 

I loved my wife. But she chose to cheat on me for a long time. Now, she wants us to reconcile for the sake of her daughters. I don't think I can get back with her ever again and I detest her now. I asked her to leave with the children for now until the legal proceedings are over. And I don't think I'll be able to have my old life back again. Idk what to do now. I always dreamed of a perfect family life. About how I would grow old with my wife. About our daughters graduating, getting married, about them inheriting my company, about them being successful in their lives and about grandchildren.

&amp;#x200B;

So, originally, I (17F) planned to do this on Christmas, but, I cannot wait that long considering 'm horrible at hiding things and keeping secrets. Not to mention that the suspense is killing me!!

&amp;#x200B;

So, I've had a lot of great ideas on how to present this question to her (43F) and all were really amazing! However, everyone kept suggesting one thing, which that was a scrap book.

&amp;#x200B;

It took me a long hard couple of hours on how I would do that, then the idea finally came to me.

&amp;#x200B;

So, on the 13th of this month, I had went to the tore and tried looking for a scrap book. I found one, but it looked bland so, I decided to get a bunch of stickers that all match the theme of the scrap book (black and gold).

&amp;#x200B;

On the front of the scrap book, it says.""Family, Hug harder, laugh louder, smile bigger, love longer"" written in golden letters. I decorated it with golden designs with little circles that are pearl colored. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, on the side of the book, I wrote in gold letters, ""Mom"" with flowers on the top and bottom. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the inside, I plan to draw, and talk about memories that her and I share. (There's 60 pages - yet that might not be enough tbh). Then, on the last page, I wrote in golden letters ""Will you be my mom forever?"" Then once she flips that page, there's a bracelet that says ""If moms were flowers, I'd pick you."" which is tucked in a pocket.

&amp;#x200B;

I also plan to add pictures of her and I together throughout the book. It might take a while for me to complete this, but it's sooo worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

When buying all of this stuff, I was worried she would see my bank account because she likes to watch over my spending habits and yells at me for spending a lot. So, I had a lecture waiting for me when I got home. Yet, this was still soooo worth it. I cannot wait for her to see this.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you guys for your amazing ideas and for giving me advice on how to ask her! I still plan on having this recorded  for memories and for you guys. 💖",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bdg9p7/update_1_for_mothers_day_i_17f_am_going_to_ask_my/,relationship_advice,9925,310,0.0

Sora26,2019-04-13 21:58:46+00:00,UNPOPULAR OPINION: Some of the Top Posts on here are transparently bullshit and I think there needs to be a better filter so that this doesn’t become the sub of fiction story-telling,"I mean seriously.. That girl who found out her BF was having hardcore bondage sex with her 64 year old dad? 

That dude who walked in on his brothers having sex with a picture of himself on the bed as well? 

The stories just keep getting crazier and crazier and I’m truly wondering what kind of filtering takes place with these stories? 

Now we have a new story that’s getting upvoted to the moon, where supposedly this 26 year old Male had zero idea he was Gay until he met this 40 year old divorced father at the gym. Supposedly, within 4 days, he’s had 2 updates. The post started asking for advice because he didn’t know how he was feeling and low and behold, within 4 days of the popular reaction from the post, his newest update is them in bed together and spending the weekend at his house. 

Just 4 days ago the dude didn’t know what he was feeling, didn’t know if the guy liked him etc, and supposedly just 4 days later they’re having a romantic night escape together. 

One comment in the thread stated that “this feels like a good book I can’t put down”,  and I couldn’t agree more. It feels like a damn book because it is one. 

I’m sorry, but It’s just not realistic. What are the chances that 1.) someone at 26 didn’t know they were gay/bi 2.) the chances that the 40 year old divorced husband didn’t know he was gay/bi either 3.) despite all of that, they go from unknowing how they felt to in each other’s bed about to have sex and indulge in a relationship together in JUST 4 days. That is NOT how real relationships work people. Even straight ones takes weeks typically before things get to staying over at each other’s houses and making breakfast in bed.. 

Use your brains people, this has all the making of some twat trying to push a weird “wonder how many people I can fool” narrative and he’s using your liberal leaning tendencies to get the better of you. It’s bright as day half the posts on here are using liberal tendencies to dupe everyone with crazy stories that quite clearly, are bullshit 

I’d rate the chances of this actually happening damn near zero. But holy hell, at the very least the mods should have asked for proof long ago. Take a damn picture with you two at dinner with your username in the pic so at least the Mods have something to go off of. 

Otherwise, keep expecting these stories people.. next up: My (19F) “Uncle” (47M) is really my Dads (44M) Husband/BF. My Mom (39F) has no idea. I’m devastated”.

I wasn't expecting nor did I intended to have such a response. I got so many messages that I was unable to answer them all.  Thank for all of your support and encouragement. Also, my post is on Twitter and Facebook. I a fellow user to link them to me so I could see the response.  I felt as though I had thousands cheering me on.. it was surreal and much appreciated. I really was a nervous wreck, so seeing all the positive vibes really helped! Thank you!  

The date went very well. He wanted to go somewhere more high-end but I was against it. I wanted to maintain normalcy. There was no need to go all out on the first date (I was already nervous as hell, didn't want to make it worse) and we could always work our way up to something more elaborate down the line. We kept it causal and went to BP's (Boston Pizza) and we talked the entire time. There wasn't a single moment of silence. I've realized that we have a lot in common than I originally thought (hiking, camping, skiing/snowboarding, kayaking). He's also into archery which I thought was unique; he's agreed to teach me.

Had no idea 3 hours had passed. I kid you guys not, we just kept talking.. and talking.. and talking. The bill was split(he offered to pay but I like splitting it. I'm my own person and I'm capable of taking care of myself. Plus I wanted to make a good impression). I had a great time opening up and him and getting to know more about him on a deeper level.  There came a point were I realized I was talking too much and tried to shift it the conversation to him but he told me to keep talking because he likes the sound of my voice. That happened BTW

He spent the night at my place and no there was no sex. This is our first time being with other men and we've agreed to take this slow.  It was 3:45 am and I didn't want him to drive back so early (Plus I wanted him want to stay). We did sleep in my bed- I pushed for that(please don't judge. I really like him ). There was a bit kissing and spooning involved. 

I woke up before him and made breakfast. We spent the whole morning together. He's left half an hour ago. He kiss me goodbye which was nice.  I'm having lunch with him on Monday- looking forward to that. 

There is great chemistry between us. TBH, I think this could possibly lead to something long-term.  I'm on cloud nine atm",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bcu4gl/i26m_was_questioning_my_sexuality_after_meeting/,relationship_advice,5964,436,0.0

We met through work, and at first, it was true love, like most new couples. We couldn't stay apart from eachother. Of course, the honey moon phase has now passed, but I still love him very much.

We had a baby very early in the relationship, but we were both happy about it. He has helped me through pregnancy and labor, and now our daughter is a little bundle of joy in the house.

A week ago, we were both sitting down cuddling on the couch, the baby on my lap. She was really talkative that day, but none of us would've expected for her to say her first word. She turned at me and just said ""mom!"" with a big smile. I swear I was on cloud 9. My boyfriend seemed surprised at first, and then totally upset. He got up and said he was ""going to bed"". To be honest, I didn't think much of it and maybe I should've asked him what was wrong, but back then I was just so excited all my attention was on my daughter.

Later I went to bed, and he was already sleeping, or maybe he was pretending to. I decided not to wake him up and just went to sleep.

My BF and I had an agreement that he has to change it every morning before leaving for work. He did it everyday until that day, but I brushed it off thinking maybe he forgot. I'm on  maternity leave, so I stay home all day, mostly taking care of the baby or cleaning the house. When my BF came back at around 6, he didn't speak a word to me, just heading straight to the shower and then ""going to bed"" because he was tired. And then, same thing all over again.

This behaviour has been persisting for over a week now. He won't talk to me, except for basic necessities, and won't interact with our baby in any way. I'm the ones changing her diaper every morning now and have to take care of her 24/24h. She has been crying non stop for two days and I'm starting to think it's because she misses her dad.  
I'm so lost. I get that he could've been a tiny bit upset at first, but then would get over it and just be happy our beautiful daughter said her first word. This just seems excessive to me. I love him very much and I don't want our relationship to end, but I feel like I'm just now seeing his true colors. 

As I'm typing this, I'm hanging out with my daughter. I just wish her dad was here, not ignoring us, so we could be a happy family again.

The_Real_Scrotus,2019-04-12 18:44:13+00:00,[Update] I [34/m] found condom wrappers in our trash can. My wife [34/f] and I don't use them and I'm wondering how to approach this.,"Link to previous thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ba2nt4/i_34m_found_condom_wrappers_in_our_trash_can_my/).

Opinion on whether I should talk to my wife or not was pretty even and quite divisive at times.  Ultimately I decided to talk to her for a few reasons.  She wasn't exhibiting any other suspicious behavior that I could tell.  I know her pretty well and I think I can read her reactions to things well too.  And she's my wife, she's been honest and faithful, as far as I can tell, for the 15 years we've been together.  I owe her the benefit of the doubt.  And finally if she was cheating, she was getting away with it, so maybe bringing this up would shake something loose and I'd figure out what was going on.

I brought it up pretty casually.  Just ""Hey, I found condom wrappers in the trash can outside, any idea where they came from?""  We discussed it pretty calmly.  She didn't have any idea where they came from and suggested some of the same theories that you guys did and that I had thought of myself.  There was no indication she was lying or hiding anything.  She understood why I was concerned and didn't freak out and accuse me of not trusting her.  

So that's pretty much the end of it I guess.  I don't see any further evidence that she's cheating and I'll chalk it up to one of those weird things that happens sometimes.  I'll probably be on higher alert for odd behavior for awhile, but that's really all I can do.

**Note - Please don't make a comment that is hateful and derogatory towards my wife. My post last time was locked because of this and I wasn't able to respond. I'm posting this at work, and I only have a few pockets of time throughout the day where I can respond.**

By the time I was able to respond to my first post, it became locked. I read everyone's replies and thank you to those who responded with good advice. I got a lot of DM's and I wasn't able to respond to everyone, but I did read your messages. However, I did not appreciate the many comments that simply insulted my wife, I know she fucked up and I'm still very angry at her, but I want to believe she can heal and become a better a person. 

Also, some of the DM's I got were extremely weird &amp; hateful towards women in general, like stuff you see on the incel tears sub - y'all need more help than me and my wife. 

There were some common questions I wanted to address to provide additional clarification. 

* How did she avoid jail? 

I only mentioned the civil case since I felt it was the most appropriate to write about because I was originally angry about our financial situation. There was also a criminal case. Our lawyer thought she would originally have to go to jail for 3 months. However, we were able to get her punishment to be community service instead. She has A LOT of community service hours to fill within a year, she will also be getting visits from a PO. Laura and her husband did file restraining orders against her, I honestly can't blame them for that. It helped my wife that she had a clean record and has family that works in law enforcement. I want her to finish those community service hours first before we talk about her working more hours to help pay me back. 

* Why did she do this to Laura?

That is a good question. I asked her this multiple times over the past several months to try to understand what this woman did to my wife. She would tell me that Laura deserved everything horrible thing that my wife did to her, that Laura was a shitty person, a narcissist, a liar, and just overall a scumbag. But she never really gave specific examples. I've been pressing her for more info, and when she told me some specifics it made me feel sick to my stomach, not because of what Laura did but because how far my wife decided to go due to some petty things that happened in their friendship. Their friendship ended about 8-9 (they had been friends since early in high school) years ago and it was over a man they had both briefly dated. My wife dated ""Matt"" for a few months, she broke up with him because she thought that Matt had feelings for Laura. Laura said she didn't want to date Matt because he had dated my wife. My wife decided to ""test"" her friend Laura's loyalty, and told Laura she had her blessing to date Matt. Laura and Matt ended up dating for a few months, my wife stuck around while they were dating and once they broke up my wife told Laura that she had failed a loyalty test. They fought, and ultimately it was Laura who decided to end the friendship. (Note: In case it's not clear, Laura's current husband is NOT Matt.) 

Secondly, I was able to get some information from her about what inspired her to do this since their friendship had ended so long ago. My wife said she happened to see (by chance, not by stalking) Laura at a restaurant about ~1.5-2 years ago, and it looked like Laura had lost a lot of weight and was fit. My wife and I are both fairly overweight, and apparently Laura use to be overweight too. My wife admitted that she felt angry that Laura had lost a lot of weight while she had never been able to. My wife was also insulting Laura and said that she doesn't make a pretty thin person and that her new muscular body was too masculine. She also insulted Laura's husband's looks and physique as well. I saw both Laura and her husband in person on multiple occasions - they both look like normal, attractive people who obviously work out. (I could also tell my wife was irritated when she saw Laura at the courthouse the first time, and you could barely tell that Laura had even had baby.) My wife admitted that she just wanted to do some snooping to try to find that Laura wasn't doing well in life, she found the opposite and was jealous of Laura's success. She first found out both of their job titles (they both work at tech companies with some sort of engineering title) and their estimated salaries by using something called Glassdoor, and if that's accurate, then both Laura and her husband make really good money. She also saw a photo on facebook of Laura and her husband standing in front of what appeared to be their very beautiful and large home. She said she was angry because she knew that Laura wasn't deserving of any of this. She proceeded to insult Laura about how she's not that smart, not pretty, not responsible, she claimed that all Laura did through college was do drugs, drink, have sex with anything that had a penis, skip class and failed a lot, my wife said that she's the type who would cheat on her husband, that she's manipulative and is always up to something, etc. 

Both Laura and her husband seemed very sad and exhausted throughout the whole ordeal. I never picked up on anything sinister from Laura at all, I felt absolutely awful for her. I felt extreme shame and embarrassment whenever I was in the same room with Laura and her husband. I don't think I was ever able to make direct eye contact with either of them.  

So..yeah. I was expecting Laura to have done something truly evil or sinister in the past and that just wasn't the case. 

* Does she feel remorseful?

I want to say yes, she does. She has been really depressed since this all finalized. However, I can't help but think she's sad only because she got caught. She hasn't directly said anything that would lead me to believe she is truly remorseful. 

She's still angry at Laura for escalating to the point of a criminal and civil case, she feels that Laura overreacted. My wife believes every horrible thing she said about Laura. She's convinced that Laura is some kind of alcoholic/drug addict who cheats on her husband, and is the type to lie and cheat her way to the top of her career. And somehow Laura is able to hide this from everyone in her life. My wife felt like she was trying to ""expose"" Laura for the monster that she is. She feels that Laura pressing charges and suing her is additional proof that Laura is vindictive. 

My hope is that she has time to think while she is doing her community service hours over the next year. I think she feels bad that I had to empty out our accounts and sell some things to come up with the money. I talked to her about working more hours once she has finished community service, and she agreed. 

* Are you going to get divorced?

The thought has crossed my mind, but we've been together for so long and I still love her despite this disgusting thing she has done. I can't see my life without her. But, I know (and I'm having a hard time admitting this to myself) that if she doesn't improve or learn a lesson from this mess then I can't be with her anymore. A lot of people mentioned that if she can do this type of thing to an ex-friend, then she can do the same to an ex-husband. This has me worried some, I'd like to believe she wouldn't go nuclear on me if we did file for divorce. I'll be taking precautions in case I have to defend myself in the future. 


* Why is she only working part-time? 

She is a licensed masseuse and works at a really nice salon/spa. Her hourly wage is pretty high, but she hasn't been able to get the hours she wants at the spa she works at. She could probably get a more full time position at a different spa but with a slightly lower hourly wage, which would still bring in more income than what she is doing now. She really likes the place she is at and doesn't want to leave, but I may pressure her to full time work elsewhere to help pay me back and refill our emergency fund once she is done with community service. At the moment she is onboard with helping me put money back into our savings accounts. 

* What about therapy? 

I know we need this, both as a couple and as individuals to deal with this mess. I talked to her about this and she doesn't seem totally sold on the idea of therapy. I've expressed that I think it would help both us, and she seems indifferent at this point. I've talked to her parents, who are really angry/disappointed in her, they basically begged me not to leave her over this. I told her parents that I think therapy would help both of us, but I can't afford it now. They offered to pay for couples therapy, but that is as much as they would be able to afford, so it's a start. I know my wife will need individual therapy, and if that means I stop going to couples therapy so she can get the 1 on 1 help she needs, so be it. 


I'm not ready to call my wife a psychopath as many of the commenters did the last post. I think she got carried away, and thought she was trying to expose someone she truly believed was a bad person. I'm heavily leaning towards that she has had some sort of mental breakdown and focused all of her energy on this one woman and her life. I'm not going to give up on my wife yet. It's very possible that she has some underlying mental illness that could very well be treated with therapy or meds. 

* How much money was she sued for?

I don't want to give specific numbers, but it will take about 4-5 years to get back to where we were prior to this happening. If my wife takes on a full time after she is done with community service and hands over the majority of her paycheck, it may take less than 4 years.  

* Are kids involved?

No, we don't have kids and are not planning on having any. 


* What next? 

That's what I need help with. I've sat down with my wife a few times since the post and I can feel some resistance coming from her about starting couple therapy. I think she's irritated at her parents for offering to pay for therapy for us. She has stated that she would rather us solve our problems together without interference from someone she doesn't know. She's afraid she isn't going to like any therapist we find, and that the therapist will attack her throughout our sessions. I've tried explaining to her that the therapist isn't there to blame anyone, that they would try to help us and that it would be a safe space for her to talk and vent about whatever she needs. I've brought up the idea of therapy every night since the post, and each time she has had an excuse along the lines of - it won't help, the therapist will gang up on her, she isn't going to like the therapist/the therapist won't like her, or that we can solve our own problems at home. 

tl;dr : I answered a bunch of questions I wasn't able to get to before my first post was locked. But, I really need help pushing my wife to get therapy, she is resistant and isn't convinced it will help us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bcfee8/update_my_36m_wife_33f_was_sued_im_feeling/,relationship_advice,6378,2205,0.0
under_thewire,2019-04-12 09:05:33+00:00,"A random girl kissed me (F-21) at the bar in front of my husband (M-23), and then told him FUCK YOU","While at the bar this random girl came up to my husband and asked him his name. He’s a pretty big introvert so he asked “why?” Bar girl said “because you’re super fucking cute and I want to get to know you.” My husband got really awkward and said “well I’m not gunna tell you my name because I’m married, this is my wife,” and pointed to me.

Little background on my husband.... he’s fucking awesome. He’s my best friend and one of the nicest guys you would ever meet. I’m honestly surprised he even said that to her. But he is a huge introvert so I’m not surprised he got awkward and nervous really fast.

Anyways, I introduced myself because what she did seemed harmless and honestly I felt kinda bad for her because she seemed embarrassed. Whenever someone hits on me I usually just take it as a compliment and then go on about my day. But me and my husband have never come across this situation where HE gets hit on openly at a bar.  

She told me she likes my lipstick, I told her I like her dress and some other girl shit compliments but she seemed sort of cool. My husband introduced himself after he felt more comfortable. She then mentioned that she was Bi and made a joke that if anything she wants to get with me rather than my husband. We kinda just laughed it off and she then invited us outside to smoke and hangout with her group of friends. 

After a while of hanging out, my husband and I we’re getting ready to leave and we we’re saying goodbye to the group of friends bar girl introduced us to.

When we were leaving my husband was paying our tab and I was saying bye to bar girl. As I gave her a hug she grabbed my face and proceeded to literally tongue fuck my mouth for a good 10 seconds. I tried to push her away, HARD, and when I finally got her off of me, she looked at my husband and screamed across the bar “ FUCK YOU (husbands name)!!!!!!” And gave him the middle finger. I was so fucking embarrassed and shocked that I didn’t say anything and kind of laughed it off. I’m guessing she did this because he turned her down at the beginning of the night.  

I heard people sitting at the bar saying “ew” and “thats nasty” and other shit like that. So needless to say, I was mortified. 

I’m a huge extrovert and I love talking to new people, and I’ve been thinking that I kind of gave her vibes that it would be cool to try to grab me and make out with me. But I feel fucking terrible for my husband and mad that I didn’t straight cuss her out, but I also feel super used and violated. I’ve been sexually abused in the past so I’m pretty sensitive about this stuff. Maybe some people would think it’s different because it’s “girl on girl” but I really don’t want some random persons tongue in my mouth and to disrespect my husband. 

Sorry for the long post, I guess I’m just looking for advice on how to get past it and overcome these feelings. Maybe I’m over reacting, maybe I’m not cut out for the “bar life” or maybe I just need to cut back on the talking to strangers/new people. But I feel like a super shit wife and feel like I just got publicly violated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bcbdw6/a_random_girl_kissed_me_f21_at_the_bar_in_front/,relationship_advice,1180,195,0.0

So today at school I decided to talk to her and see what made her do what she did. And I must say i was sure surprised when she said it was just something that other people have told her and she was curious if it was true. So naturally I asked her why and she literally told me ""just because"". So then I asked her if she was aware of how uncomfortable that made me feel and how it hurt my feelings to which she just said ""sorry"". After that I really just lost it and went home to sleep. It really didn't go as i planned or wanted it to go, but i did learn some things if nothing else. My until recently ""best friend"" isn't really the best nor even a good friend. How blinded could i have been? Anyway, her behavior answered some of my questions without even having to ask them and i'm pretty sure I just wanna stay away if I can and distance myself now. And yeah that makes me mostly angry than anything else but I can only hope these emotions will go away slowly.

amanhasnoname909,2019-04-11 17:39:57+00:00,I (29m) left my fiance (28f) after she admitted to being a sugar baby for a weekend.,"We met on OkCupid two years ago. I proposed on new years day and we had been saving up for a wedding. 

For background she lives with her mom. A week ago I was trying to get a hold of her to make plans because Sunday is our date day. I felt like she was trying to avoid it and she kept telling me to spend time with my guy friends. Friday I couldn't reach her, so I figured she wanted some alone time. I have her on find my friends and could see she was out doing something a couple hours away. 

I called but she didn't pickup so I checked again a couple hours later and she turned off the location. I eventually heard back from her Monday morning while I was at work.

I asked her about where she went and that's when she fessed up that before we started dating there was a mid 40s guy she talked to on OkCupid and they chatted online quite a bit but he was too old and lived far so they stopped talking. She said he was a kind person and once in a while he would send her email every few months asking about life and my fiance would politely decline to converse much cuz our relationship. 

This time however he offered to give her $2000 to ""hang out"" for a weekend. They supposedly went to see Shazam and had dinner, then the next day they went to see the poppy fields after the California rain. He did approach her for sex but only if she wanted. She said she declined and slept in the guest room instead.

We met later that day and she felt guilty and apologized. She said she wanted to contribute more and thought I would understand. She showed me the cash and I felt so heartbroken. She swore 100% nothing happened. I have never felt that intense in my life, it was like something was in my throat and I couldn't even talk so I got in my car and drove away from her house and sat in the Starbucks parking lot for two hours. 

She was texting me nonstop and her mom and sister started texting me too cuz she was crying. After a couple hours I decided to drive back to her house and end our relationship. I told her that was too much for me and that's not something that we can ever recover from. She was devastated and fell into her bed face first to cry into the pillow. I don't know why I did but I remember sitting next to her to comfort and tell her that I understand and that I will always love her before I left. 

It's been a few days now and neither of us have texted each other. I feel like the last things I said to her will really mess her up and not give enough closure. My best friend is telling me to just delete her from social media and move on. I think he's right but I also feel like I should tell her that I didn't mean to say goodbye that way but I don't want to make things worse for either of us with an awkward phone conversation.

After talking some more with my fiancé, we actually decided to postpone our wedding. 
We talked a lot about boundaries and I told him that some things are not ok. He has been single and free his whole life until we met and I imagine it’s hard for him to readjust his thoughts about some things. 
We also agreed that we both had issues we should work on before getting married. My issues mainly being my insecurities. 

At first I was really sad, but I actually think this is a very good thing. I had so many negative feelings about the wedding, and now we have the opportunity to fix whats wrong. Maby the next time we try will feel so much more right, and we’ll have mostly happy feelings. :)

This is completely out of character and I’m still not sure if she was trolling or not. 

Yesterday evening we were sitting in the car and she was talking to some guy from her internship. She sounded heated and they were clearly arguing over something. When she hung up she said that he was an asshole, a douchebag etc...then she started calling him a “dirty ass Jew”. I was shocked to say the least and didn’t even know what to say, it came out of nowhere. She said that all Jews are “extremely arrogant” and that they disgust her. 

For the record, we never discussed our religious backgrounds. Neither of us are religious (she’s Middle Eastern) so that’s just not something we ever brought up. 


She continued saying that you can’t trust Jews, that they’re all “rats” and that she’d rather die than associate with someone “so corrupt”. I asked her if that’s how she really feels and she said yes of course.


I still haven’t told her that I’m Jewish, I’m not even sure how she will react when I do tell her. Should I even bother? It sucks because she’s an amazing girl and I’m ridiculously attracted to her but had no clue she was like this. Any advice?

He asked if I wanted to go to dinner. Naturally was stoked but I didn't want him to see that. I played with him for a bit and asked if he was asking me out on date. He responds with saying ""if it was, would that bother you?"". Obviously I was stoked and said ""no that wouldn't bother me at all"" trying to hide my excitement.

**Update from 2 weeks ago [Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b53wfq/update_fiance_30f_deleted_old_conversations_after/)**

So it's been 3 weeks since the shit hit the fan.  I moved out all of my clothes and necessary items to my parent's house a few towns over.  As far as I know, she's still there.  I haven't spoken to her in almost 2 weeks.  I have to go back to get a few more things before the end of my broken lease (about 30 days left). Sounds cliche but I'm going to leave everything else there because a lot of it would probably remind me of her.  

I found a place near work that I'm moving into May 1st.  It's a bit smaller, but it's closer to work.  My friends have been great, allowing me to spend time at their houses just to hang out.  My parents have always been lovely and supportive and I thank god that I have the family and friends that I do.

When life slows down, and it gets quiet - my emotions creep up.  This is a woman who I loved so dearly and truly.  I wanted to build a beautiful life with her.  Wanted to have children, buy a house and do all the fantastical things that partners do.  I am, however able to reflect on the lies and the deception and her true character and that can snap me out of feeling remorseful for breaking it off with her.

One thing that has helped - I started to see another woman very casually.  She's not really my type, but she is very very attractive.  I told her that I was very far from looking for anything committed or serious, and she is in the same boat.  She basically just wants to sleep with me.   

Before I met my ex-fiance, I was somewhat of a ""hit"" with women.  My ex was the woman who made me immediately disinterested in talking to, being physical with or spending time with any other woman.  I have confidence that I will find another woman like this.  Until then, I will continue to be an adult and have casual relationships like I used to.  

To sum things up:  I am heartbroken.  Some days are better than others, but I keep pressing forward and focusing on my day to day for now.  My goals will change and my focus is shifting back to myself instead of a partner.  To anyone else who is going through similar:  Carry on.  Pick your head up, look yourself in the mirror and realize that as long as you work very hard at being the best version of yourself- you will attract the right people into your life.  And sometimes, someone might seem like the right person even though they're not.  But do not compromise your own self-worth and self-respect for someone else.  Hold your ground and be the best you possible.

Thank you all very much for your words and support.  Goodbye.

purple_touch,2019-04-10 13:48:51+00:00,Today I (18M) found out my best friend (18F) knows i'm in love with her,"So today me and a couple of my friends including my best friend were having a casual chat. Some time passed and we decided to play some ""game"" where we tell one of the person's secrets that they think we don't know. So it starts with some small things but gradually we all start telling more and more deeper secrets. And just like that, out of nowhere, she says how she knows i've never had a gf because i'm in love with her and don't want other girls (which is very true). I tried laughing it off, and saying how she's crazy, but she insisted that she knows and that I can't lie to her. At that point i think my face turned white and I legit had no idea what to even do or say.

I was sure my behaviour towards her was not in any way indicative of the fact that im in love with her, but somehow she   
 knows. I also never told anyone about it before telling you right now, so I can't say someone ratted me out. She said that it was the way I looked at her. I never planned on telling her because she's in a relationship for over 2 years now and I know there's not even a chance.

She is pregnant now - 5 months actually - but she has a major problem. She is drinking.

When I say drinking. I mean drinking.

Usually three or four drinks a night. 

On the weekends up to ten.

I’ve tried to get her to stop but she won’t.

Even tried asking the police what my options are and they said that it’s her choice and they can’t stop her.

I’m so angry I want to leave. But I want this child in my life.

I want my child to be okay. Not messed up from FAS. Not born addicted to Booz.

My wife won’t listen. Over and over she tells me. “It’s my body stfu” or “my body my rules”.

It breaks my heart to see this happening over and over again.

Also please don’t suggest abortion because that choice is hers to make legally and she doesn’t want to. 

I would also be against it but I get that I have no say in it as a man so my opinion is nut.

For the past couple of years I’ve tried to install an “ask me first” policy, but since I don’t have a FB account of my own, this is hard to monitor. I can only really tell when I manage to get into her phone. The last time I did this I saw some.. grade related stuff. 

I feel like I have absolutely no privacy. I can’t talk to my own mother for fear she’ll post it on social media. I’m her child, not her dog, and I’d like to be treated as a human being. However, I love her and honestly think she is an awesome mom. This is pretty much the only thing she does that annoys me.

My friend ""Sarah"" is on her 3rd marriage at 29. She's got an alcohol problem and gets herself into stupid situations and has cheated on all her partners since I've known her. Her current husband is a great guy, but kind of naive. He really has no clue - he just loves her so much. A couple weeks ago he stopped by my work, and after some small talk he straight up asked me if I had seen or heard of Sarah seeing other men. I told him I honestly didn't know, because I don't \*know\* 100%. He seemed really beat. It was awful. Fast forward to this past weekend, few of our friends got together, and she started to tell us about some dude she met. I was a little buzzed, so I decided to try to sneak her on video. I clicked on my contacts and sent him a video call and he actually picked up. I pretended to be into my phone and just let it roll. He ended the call abut 2 mins in but it was enough to hear what she was talking about.

ThrowAwayFoDais,2019-04-09 16:29:51+00:00,My ex was recently in a car accident and now has amnesia and thinks we are still together.,"A throwaway for obvious reasons but I am mentally breaking down and this feels so unreal and so incredibly confusing I need help desperately. 

Backstory: My ex of 3 years broke up with me about a year ago. We were at different points in our lives and things were becoming strained. She said she had wanted to break up because she was young and wasn't even sure if marriage was something she ever wanted. (I had made it clear I wanted to marry someone at least some day hoping it would be her) I told her I loved her and let her go knowing that I didn't want to restrict her from finding herself or getting to a point where we would end up hating one another from the pressures of the time. Everything was fine until about a month later she began dating someone half way across the U.S. (us in OK he I NJ) I was devasted. I thought she wanted to explore and find herself and I hope by letting her do this that maybe one day we could try to reconvene as more mature people. But no, she met some guy from Jersey in Louisiana during Mardi gras and they started dating. They maybe see eachother 7 weekends out of the year. All the reasons we had broken up for seemingly meant nothing because then she just started doing it with someone else. 

It's been a little over a year now and we haven't talked in months. I'm finally starting to get past the depression and make forward progress in my life. Until the other night... Her father called me in a panicked voice and began to apologize for a reason I didn't know. When I called him down he said my ex had been in an accident with her mother. Apparently she took a good hit to the head and went unconscious. When she came to she asked about me and to her disturbance, they told her she had left me and was now dating Mr. jersey. She refused to believe it because apparently her memory went back to what was probably the best part of our relationship. She refused to talk to her current bf and was adamant about calling me. I guess her father gave in eventually and asked if I would be ok with talking with her. Of course I wanted to talk to her. Someone I loved was injured and I was concerned. The phone call was so hard... She cried and asked what was happening and what had happened to us and just keep repeating how much she loved me... I hadn't heard her say that to me in over a year. After the call I told her father I was sorry, but to please not contact me anymore. I know their situation is difficult but this isn't easy for me either. He respected my wishes and let me off the hook. Unfortunately though she unblocked me from her phone and began to txt and call me about what was happening and why wouldn't I talk to her and who's Mr. Jersey? I had to block her for my own mental health... I can't go back there again only to have her regain her memory and leave me again... I can't do that twice. But I feel like I need to be there for her as well! Shes hurting and confused and I hate seeing someone I still love like that... I feel like I'm being selfish but I can't go back to that depression when she leaves me again for him...

suedwifeacct,2019-04-09 11:34:25+00:00,"My (36m) wife (33f) was sued, I'm feeling resentment towards her and I don't know how to move past it.","FWIW This is not a post asking for any legal or financial advice, we already have a lawyer and have help financially. No offense to reddit, but I’d rather not get any legal advice from a forum, but I’m okay getting relationship advice it seems. 

As the title states my wife was recently sued, she lost and we had to pay. The money is a significant amount for us, we didn’t have much in savings or our emergency fund to begin with, and both of those accounts are now empty. 

My currently problem is trying to move past the resentment and anger I’m feeling towards my wife. Until now I’ve always felt like we were a partnership in our marriage. But, since I’m the breadwinner I can’t help but to feel like I’m spending ""my"" money on something that isn’t my fault. I’ve had no problem paying the mortgage, and taking care of various financial burdens that come with being a married homeowner. However, I have been the only one to put money aside in our savings and other accounts to prepare for an emergency - like a totaled car, someone loses their job, medical bills, or an act of god… not a stupid lawsuit where I know my wife is guilty. She has a part time job and doesn’t make much money, but pays for smaller things when she can (like groceries and some random bills), but she does take care of a lot of cooking, cleaning and caring for our pets. 

What did my wife do? (Note: I had no idea this was going on while it was happening). 

She used linkedin to find her former ex best friend, she ended up creating a realistic looking fake linkedin profile with a vague occupation of ‘recruiter’. My wife ended up sending this ex-best friend, ""Laura"" a few messages pretending to be a recruiter in her line of work. Laura finally responded thinking that this recruiter was real, my wife wanted her phone number but Laura gave her a personal email address instead. My wife created a second fake linkedin profile and started to send messages to people with similar titles as Laura at her company. These messages said derogatory things about Laura, a mixture of truthful things but embarrassing and just fabricated bullshit to make Laura look bad. Her manager got one of these messages that claimed that Laura was a heavy drug user. Laura's manager talked to her about these messages and he felt like the messages were bizarre and seemed like someone was trying to troll or harass Laura. Well, Laura team had her back and helped her saved these messages. Not only that, but Laura requested that she be drug tested anyway, to provide further evidence that she was clean. My wife didn’t know this at this point, but Laura was pregnant. Several of her coworkers, including her manager testified on Laura behalf. 


Using the personal email address she got from the fake recruiter profile, she was able to find a few social media platforms Laura was on and was able to figure out her husbands name. She did some more internet sleuthing and found Laura's husband on facebook. Laura's husband didn’t have much on his facebook profile, but you could see his business email address on it. My wife sent him an email claiming that Laura was cheating on him. The husband confronted Laura about this email and Laura encouraged him to keep responding to this person, and save the messages, as well as to start asking specific questions about this supposed affair.  My wife thought she was being clever and ended up telling the husband that Laura was cheating on him during the work week, she even gave him specific dates. What she didn’t realize was Laura had something turned on in google maps where it keeps years worth of historical gps data. Some of the dates my wife gave him also happened to be days where they both worked from home together. She also ended up giving him dates during a time they were on vacation together. Laura had her husband keep responding as much as possible to my wife and to backup all correspondence. 


My wife was able to  find out when and where the baby shower was going to be. One of Laura friends had created a public registry for her and had the invitation online. My wife decided to show up unannounced (the baby shower took place in a semi-public place, they had rented out an area connected to the public business.) She did not make herself known immediately. Instead she looked for patrons that were entering and exiting the rented out room. She was able to get the attention of a few guests that had never met her and tried to gossip about Laura - my wife was telling people that Laura didn’t actually know who the father was, among other things. This was at an event where her husband was at as well. The word got back around to Laura and she spotted my wife and apparently immediately put together all the pieces of what happened. 


I’m leaving a fair amount of information out - My wife was able to find phone numbers, social media accounts and email for other people in Laura circle and sent them messages about Laura on multiple occasions. All the messages were trying to paint Laura in an extremely derogatory light. All the events I’ve mentioned so far took place over a year or so.  My wife didn’t think to mask her IP address, so it was pretty easy to find out that all of these made up messages came from the same IP address, ours. Many of Laura's friends and family testified on her behalf, Laura had everyone saved as much digital evidence as possible - and it was a lot. 


Laura and her husband hired a lawyer and decided to sue to my wife. They had ample evidence against her. All the saved messages, close friends and even her manager spoke on her behalf, she showed that she went to see a therapist once all the harassment started because she was depressed and anxious, she showed that she and her husband went to counseling after the accusations of her cheating. She even went above and beyond and had more drug tests done to show she was clean and my wife’s accusations were 100% false, and even had a paternity test done to show that my wife was again wrong and chose to lie. 


I honestly felt awful for Laura, there were lots of tears on her end. You could tell how much emotional stress she had gone through. She said that being pregnant during the majority of this was absolutely horrific and was worried the stress and anxiety would somehow hurt her baby. She was pained that her one and only baby shower was ruined by my wife and that was something that could never be truly repaid or made up for. And that my wife’s harassment continued even after Laura gave birth and was trying to manage a newborn child. 


My wife has never done anything this crazy before. I knew she could be a little petty and jealous of others, especially people she use to be friends with in the past, but it was only talk - no action. We’ve had a very happy marriage otherwise, we rarely fight, have a lot in common, we have a lot of fun together. But, she really fucked up this time. I don’t know how to move forward. I know someone is going to suggest therapy, but I really want to start building up an emergency fund again. We’re pretty screwed financially for awhile. 


**tl;dr** Wife was sued by her former best friend, I emptied out all of our savings and sold a few things to pay for everything. I need help managing my resentment towards my wife and to move past this. Funds are low and we can't afford therapy right now.

mayza88,2019-04-09 09:26:46+00:00,My (F30) fiancé (M40) is going on a trip with his friend (F27) for his bachelor party. My jealousy ruins every happy feeling towards the wedding.,"Ok, so my fiancé has just one good friend and that is a girl he met through work about 7 years ago. (We have been together 3 years) There has never been any romantic feelings between them and I believe him because when I see them together they display a very sibling-like relationship. 

He proposed to me in september and we are getting married in may. And because he only has this one good friend, she became his best man. And she has planned an overnight trip to a city with a stay at a hotel. They are going to sleep in the same room, probably even in the same bed and I’m finding myself becoming very jealous, so much so that I want to cancel the whole wedding.. And I hate that I feel this way, because I KNOW they would never do anything wrong. 

I think the problem is a few different things:
1. My fiancé is not very fond of traveling or doing something new. So it’s rare for us to go on such trips and I become selfish and would have liked for us to go together instead. 

2. She is much more pretty, funny and have a lot more self confidence than me. So I’m afraid that a trip with her would remind him of the ugly, depressed and boring girl he has waiting at home. 

3. And even though I’n not afraid that he will have an affair with her, it’s still painfull knowing he will be that close to another girl. 

I work really hard with myself and my negative thoughts every day, but this is just too much. 

Could someone give me a virtual slap in the face?

throwawaytruth09,2019-04-09 00:38:02+00:00,I (16M) found a hidden camera in my room at my stepmom's (37F) house. Wondering how to bring it up to my Dad (43M),"I really need some advice on what to do here.. I am really just lost in all this.

So some back story my parents have been split since I was 9 and I used to live with my mom up until when I was 13 I had to move (nearly 90 miles away) to live with my dad and stepmom when my mom became too ill to look after me. She lives in a care facility right now so moving back in with her is not an option.

The house I live in now is my stepmoms, she has owned it for like 15 years or so and my dad moved first in with her when I was 12. They have been together for like 5 years now but are not married as my parents are only seperated not divorced.

Onto the situation.. this afternoon I found a hidden camera that was fitted inside what I thought was a smoke detector inside on the ceiling of my bedroom. I only ""found"" it because the screw holding it onto the ceiling was loose and it fell down and when I looked at it there is no like electronics inside only a camera like body thing with a wire connecting a tiny lense pointing out at like maybe a 45 degree angle dowm towards the main part of my room.

I've checked and there is no other smoke detectors like this in any other room and I remember my stepmom had put this up one day when I was at school I think when I was 14. The house I think only has one other security camera which is in the doorbell and points outside.

I really am struggling to think why she has this here and I really cannot think of any other reason other then to spy on me.. Any suggestions on how I should bring this up to my dad or maybe both of them? I was thinking the casual approach could be best like ""this fell off my ceiling earlier it looks like there's a camera inside"" or something like that. I've kinda got to do it tomorrow morning anyway because I think she will notice its gone off the ceiling if she comes in my room.

I'm in the UK if that changes anything thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bb1gl4/i_16m_found_a_hidden_camera_in_my_room_at_my/,relationship_advice,1064,228,0.0

I’m half Japanese/Korean and half white. For reference, I’ve been told by multiple people, including him, that I look like kiko mizuhara. (Love the compliment btw”

So I’ve known since the beginning that he loves Japanese culture. No biggie, whatever. I’ve dated weeaboos before, and it never turned into a problem. 
Somehow my mom got brought up and how I’m more Japanese than Korean. He got weirdly excited. It kind of weirded me out, but I let it go.

Then he said that I “shouldn’t call myself white” because I’m hapa. That pissed me off, but I didn’t make a big deal out of it. Then he said something along the lines of “you’re so lucky you got the best features from both races” and I was so grossed out.
It escalated, and it basically ended with me saying that I felt fetishized and then he sounded like he was into eugenics. He got angry because he said I called him a nazi. (I did not. I said what he said sounded like eugenics) he then proceeded to cry and say “it’s not my fault I have yellow fever” and “Japanese girls are tighter and are more submissive”

I’m honestly afraid to tell our friends about it, but I’m pretty sure I’m done with him. I’ve had white guys do kinda racist stuff before, but never to this extent. All of our friends are white, and I’m afraid they’ll think I’m overreacting or something. Idk. I guess I’m just looking for some type of reassurance that what he said isn’t okay.

paury,2019-04-08 20:16:35+00:00,I (22M) was sexually assaulted by a girl at a party and my girlfriend (23F) walked in on it happening - she broke up with me after slapping me in the face and now I am devastated,"Hi. I am a 22M senior year in college. My girlfriend is a 23F in grad school at the same university.

We have been dating for six months and everything was going well or so I thought.

Over the weekend, we both attended a party and got quite a bit drunk.

At one point I got up to go to the bathroom, and another woman followed me into the bathroom and started forcing herself on me.

I tried to make her stop but she whispered in my ear “if you scream, I will tell them that you raped me now shut the fuck up”.

I began crying but she proceeded to do things to me which I never wanted to do with anyone, ever. And I never wanted to be forced.

After a few minutes (or eternity whichever is longer), my girlfriend went to find me and three open the the bathroom door to find me being assaulted.

Her first instinct was to scream, which attracted a crowd. My rapist/assailant, backed away and like a deer in headlines, gasped and pointed to me and said “he started it!”.

At that point my girlfriend tried to kick my testicles but thankfully I protected them but then she immediately smacked my face while I was busy protecting my crotch.

Then she ran out of the party and texted me “never fucking talk to me again ever scumbag and if you do I will get the police involved”

I tried responding back that I did not chose what happened and that I was a victim not the instigator but she doesn’t believe me at all.

I went to the campus public safety office and they tried to ask me questions as if I was the person doing the sexual assaulting. I ended up leaving before I got in trouble myself. 

I’m fucking devasted and don’t know where to turn. She fucking hates my guts and thinks that I tried to seduce or assault another woman when really it is the opposite of what actually happened.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/baykhs/i_22m_was_sexually_assaulted_by_a_girl_at_a_party/,relationship_advice,1721,362,0.0

We have two daughters (4f&amp;1f) Let's call her friend Mike. They've been best friends for ages.

Mike and I got along well and he was a cool guy to be around. Unfortunately, a copule of years ago, he announced that he had cancer and he decided not to undergo chemotherapy. My wife took it real bad. 

Mike was a great guy and we all felt bad. It was a really emotional time for my wife and she helped him clear his bucket list. Mike passed away later that year.

Yesterday, my wife told me that she wanted to talk to me. So, after the kids went to sleep, she came to me and started crying. I was really worried and asked her what happened. She told me that she did something really bad and started apologizing. Finally, after an eternity, she told me that she had sex with Mike before he died.

She told me that it was a very emotional time for her and it was not out of love. She also told me that I'm the only guy she loves. I was really devastated. Sure, Mike was  a great guy, but I never expected that this would've happened between them.

She wants to make it up to me. But I'm really depressed. This has upended my life. I can't even imagine it. I hate to admit it, but I really love her. I really don't understand how I should cope up now. Any advice is welcome guys. Thanks for listening.

A few months ago we took on a new roommate, let’s call her Jessica. Jessica is a transwoman which is fine with everyone there. We all get along and occasionally hang out. 

Jessica did seem a bit weird sometimes, but we figured she was nice enough and wasn’t hurting anyone so it was all okay. 

Long story short, I recently let her borrow my hairdryer and she forgot to give it back to me after she left for class. I usually wouldn’t do this, but I was in a hurry and my hair was wet so I decided to go into her room to get my dryer. 

What I saw was so disturbing. The smell in the room was terrible, like a public bathroom. There were bottles of urine everywhere. But worst of all... there was a ziplock bag with used tampons under her desk. On top of her desk was a plastic cup with one of the used tampons, and water. 

I ran out and threw up. I didn’t know what to think. I woke up one of my other housemates and told her what was going on. She looked with me and was shocked. We took pictures to show our other roommates. 

Once everyone knew and Jessica came back we had a house meeting. The 5 of us told her we knew what she was doing and asked her why. She screamed that we shouldn’t have went into her room and that we’re being transphobic. We told her we want her out by the end of the month and that we will refund her entire rent from this month to make up for the short notice. She cried and told us that she can’t afford estrogen and doesn’t have insurance, so people online told her that drinking period blood was a way to “become a woman”. 

I feel really bad for her, but I can’t do this... none of us can. Are we wrong for telling her she has to go?

TL;DR: My housemates and I [19-22/F] just discovered that our trans housemate [22/M] has been making “tea” out of our used tampons because he can’t afford hormonal pills. We don’t feel safe and want this person gone. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/baomys/my_housemates_and_i_1922f_just_discovered_that/,relationship_advice,2757,2363,0.0
throwisiwiw,2019-04-07 21:04:25+00:00,My (22M) gf(26f) of 5 years killed my pet snake (14 yo) as soon we moved in together,"So I'm pretty much convinced my gf killed my snake that I had since I was kid. 

She always had a problem with the snake, she would believe its satanic and bad omen to have a snake in the house. 

But to me the snake was like family, and is very docile. He has no problems with her dogs, he just be chilling. Even her dog would just chill, not attack my snake.

When we were moving she kept telling me to get rid of the snake but I couldnt cuz I really love my snake.

Well now I came home and the snake was just gone, no traces of anything just gone and not tp be seen in the house. 

When I confronted my gf about it she claims she doesnt know anything and claims that it probablt escaped.

I find this hard to believe because first off he actually cant escape his enclosure, and I doubt the snake went down a flight of stairs and left through the door.

I dont wanna make a big deal out of it but i think its mad fucked up she did this.

I wanna confront her about it but I dont wanna seem like Im being petty",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bal41x/my_22m_gf26f_of_5_years_killed_my_pet_snake_14_yo/,relationship_advice,13987,2863,0.0
BritishGranddadGuy,2019-04-07 08:39:40+00:00,I [59M] cut two of my kids [24F][28M] out of my will for his irresponsible spending of their previous inheritance. How should I fix this situation?,"My (now deceased) ex-wife and I have 5 kids together: 21F, 24F, 28M, 30M, 35M.

A few years ago their mother passed away and left each of them a very large inheritance. Over 300K GBP each, evenly distributed among them.

Prior to her passing she made it clear to them that this money was not to be wasted. It was to: 1. Used to pay off debt, 2. Used to further education, 3. Put towards buying a house in future.

Two of my kids, 24F and 28M, have completely squandered this money in just a couple of years. My daughter spent it **all** travelling across the world care-free staying in nice hotels and eating fancy dinners. I completely understanding going on a vacation, **but to blow all of it on travel against her mother's wishes?** Bloody shameful.

My son is even worse. He has literally spent it all on drugs, alcohol, and escorts over this time. None of it, **none**, going towards self-improvement as their mother wanted.

So I continued to hound them over this time and time again until, as expected, it's all bloody wasted. Once this happened, I decided to cut them both out of my will, as I don't want my hard-earned money being squandered so my children can live a hedonistic lifestyle for a couple of years.

I told this to their siblings in confidence, so that they would be prepared to deal with the fall-out when I eventually pass. One of them (not sure who) let it slip to them, and now they've gone off the deep-end and proclaimed I'm ""dead to them"" and they ""don't have a dad"" etc.

I don't want to go into a long bitter fued with my kids, but damned if I'm going to have my life savings wasted by them also.

Any advice on how to fix this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/baec65/i_59m_cut_two_of_my_kids_24f28m_out_of_my_will/,relationship_advice,6300,929,0.0
ohmygodhelp01810,2019-04-07 03:35:26+00:00,I [F24] accidentally found out that my father [M50] has been having an affair with my boyfriend [M27].,"I don’t even know where to begin.

I have been with my boyfriend for 4 years now. Just yesterday we were discussing our future, marriage, children, and the like. Today my friend showed me a photo of a man that he said “looked like” my boyfriend on a gay “kink” Twitter page where men are dressed in leather suits/puppy masks/etc. I thought it was a bizarre thing to send to someone until I found out that that had to be my friend’s way of saying that is *definitely* my boyfriend in the absolute gentlest way possible. I scrolled through the photos and while his face was covered in a puppy mask, I could clearly make out his eyes. Scrolling through more, I saw enough of his face to know that it’s him, even though he had a thick amount of tape covering his mouth and all of his jaw. 

If this wasn’t shocking enough, he kept referring to another twitter user as “daddy/bear.” I don’t want to go into too much detail, but in the photos/videos he had posted, he was being used by another man. I clicked on the account he @/linked, and the bio read “proud owner of pup “boyfriend’s name.” Curious to see who my boyfriend was having an affair with, I scrolled through the page. In a few shots I could make out that the man was significantly older, but I didn’t see a clear photo of my own father until a few hundred tweets later. The photo was a selfie of them posed together, my boyfriend in a mask and my father holding him on a chain like a dog. He made no attempt to conceal his identity in this photo. I didn’t look for anymore. I nearly threw up. 

I live with my boyfriend, but am currently staying at a friend’s house. This literally happened just 2 hours ago. I’m still shaking, and for all I fucking know my boyfriend is with my fucking father right now. I have no idea what to do, and don’t even know how the hell I should bring this up. My father is divorced, so luckily nobody else is getting hurt except me. I don’t even know how to feel.

princessnokia_,2019-04-06 17:00:00+00:00,I [21] went off on a man who groped me at a bar. My friends [20sF/M] think I overreacted. Am I justified in cutting them all off?,"To cut it short, I was at a nightclub minding my business, having fun, tearing up the dance floor when I felt a man reach over and grab my breast. Now I can always tell when someone accidentally grazes up against me when trying to get past me in a packed club, but this was a clear and definite grab. Now, even though all of my friends fear confrontation, I have an attitude and like telling people if they’ve pissed me off. So I followed that dude over and made sure everyone around him knew what he did. Another man close by grabbed him by his shoulders and dragged him out towards the entrance. Right after this, I was able to bounce back and went right back to dancing. 

On the way home, though, my friends told me that I took the confrontation too far and embarrassed them. One friend kept going about how the man was clearly drunk and didn’t know what he was doing, and then said, “what if he thought you were his girlfriend and now he feels like some kind of pervert”. This man was an older white man, probably in his fifties, and I’m a young black girl with braids - I HIGHLY doubt I looked like his wife from behind, let along the front. After I threw out that theory my friends, even my female friends, reminded me that I’m wearing a revealing top in a crowded place, and what should I expect. 

I felt really sick and I just want them out of my life. This isn’t the first time I’ve had to stand up for myself for them to tell me I’m embarrassing or “ghetto”. Of course they don’t say the same thing when I stand up to defend them, though. 

Was my reaction an overreaction? Am I right to just ghost on all of these friends? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ba6ebm/i_21_went_off_on_a_man_who_groped_me_at_a_bar_my/,relationship_advice,19473,2388,0.0
throwaway98234i,2019-04-05 20:47:57+00:00,I (23) just found out my parents paid for my sister's (21) college but made me take out $40k in student loans and now we're not speaking,"To start off, I know my parents love me and are proud of me. Growing up, though, they always gave more to my sister because she is not as capable or as smart as I am (I know that sounds mean, but it's objectively true). Whether that was money, replacing toys or electronics she lost/ broke, my parents would provide more to her because she wasn't responsible. Even when I was in high school they would make me pay for my own school trips because they said they ""couldn't afford it"", but would pay for anything my sister wanted to do.

Last week I found out they replaced her MacBook for the 4th time (she got drunk and spilled beer on it). This lead me to a line of questioning to my parents since they made me buy my own computer in college and didn't contribute. It finally came to a head when I asked if they paid more for her college than they did mine and it became clear that they did. 

I went to a top college in the US with a &lt;10% acceptance rate. My entire life I have been passionate about working in politics, so I went to the best school in the US for it. I had no legacy, have struggled with mental health my whole life, and cried tears of joy when I finally got it since I truly earned my spot there. But because of how expensive the college was, I had to take out a significant amount of loans, work many jobs in college to support myself, and ultimately got a job in an unrelated field to pay off my debt. My parents said they would only contribute $x for my college because that was all they could afford and that my sister and I would get the same amount for school (we qualified for some financial aid, but it wasn't enough for me to avoid taking out loans). My sister went to a bottom-tier school (to put it in perspective it has an 85% acceptance rate), has repeated said she doesn't care about college, only wants an ""easy life"", and her dream is to find someone rich to marry.

I'm realizing that I essentially subsidized her education and have had to sacrifice my passion in life in order for that to happen. My parents have stopped responding to me when I ask about it. Even though my college was more expensive than hers, they paid more for hers (not to mention financially supporting her every summer whereas I got jobs in finance where I worked 80 hrs/ week to put that money towards my education) despite how little she cares about school.

I understand that because she doesn't care much about her life and isn't as capable as I am, my parents have had to financially support her more. What I cannot come to terms with is how much they lied to me about it and how they have stopped communicating with me.

What can I do to move forward? I feel a lot of resentment for them because they know how hard I've worked and what I have had to sacrifice to be where I am in life, but were unwilling to help me whereas they helped my sister. I feel like I gave up on my dreams to pursue a more financially-realistic career and my heart is broken.

TLDR: My parents paid for my sister's college and not mine and lied to me about it for years. I don't know how to move on from this and continue having a relationship with them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9wghk/i_23_just_found_out_my_parents_paid_for_my/,relationship_advice,1397,469,0.0
wllmwallace,2019-04-05 19:04:43+00:00,"*UPDATE - Don't want to have a ""Click-Bait"" Title - Wife's Wedding Band(s)","So, I have just returned from LUNCH, where my wife received her new bands.  We kept it low key, no pictures/video, and semi-private.  What we did was planned to take her cut band to a local jeweler after lunch, and invited our two sons to lunch before the ""appointment"".  While ordering, Oldest son asks to see the damaged/cut wedding band, saying he might be able to fix it, he takes it below the table and starts acting like he is squeezing and straining, and then places a complete ""fixed"" band on the table, and asks his mom if that works, she is ASTOUNDED, and places the band on her finger, but....it is too big.  Youngest son says he can fix THAT and asks for the band, wife reluctantly and with a look of ""WTF is going on"" on her face, hands the band to our youngest, he takes it below the table, and squeezes and strains, and makes it ""smaller, but not quite perfect"" when she puts it on.  She is now trying to figure it out, and as she takes it off and starts to inspect it, I take it away from her and do the same ""act"" as our boys, but this time, the band fits PERFECTLY on her finger, and she has quite LITERALLY had enough!  She finally takes it off, and is inspecting it pretty hard, and cannot figure it out.....until My oldest places her cut and older band on the table, our youngest places the too large band on the table, and I place the next size on the table.  At this point she's just staring at all of us, and I explain what had happened, and how I was able to find the jeweler, etc.  I even showed her the Reddit post.  She didn't start crying until reading about the comments and all the caring and support you guys posted.  Lunch was ordered, we all talked about everything, ate lunch as a family, parted ways back to respective work, home, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

She (wife) did mention that after reading all the replies, she would have KILLED me if I had gone full public display, and all that, so very thankful to those that suggested to keep it low key and semi-private.  


So, about the jeweler.  They responded to my email regarding posting the name/info, and would like to maintain their privacy.  The oldest son IS making jewelry and doing repairs ONLY to catch up previous orders and work requests prior to their fathers passing.  Once it is all caught up, they are closing it for good.  They sent copies of the drawings and mold for our bands and we placed them in our safe at home in case this happens again, we can get something made/designed.  I followed up asking if there was ANY way to repay their kindness, and haven't had a response.  Regardless, my wife is planning on hitting up some local spots and making them a ""Texan"" Gift Package and sending it to them.  


And that's it.  She is extremely happy and overjoyed.  I am really glad it's ""over"" as I had NO idea this would garner this much attention, and can now go back to our normal lives.  Thanks to everyone for their suggestions, and we are grateful to all the outpouring of genuine caring, thank you to everyone that sent Silver, Gold, and Platinum, it wasn't necessary but greatly appreciated.  


TL;DR - Took wife and sons to lunch, pretended to try and fix her band, sons helped in the scenario, wife was finally presented all three bands that were sent, and told about what had occurred.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9v8sv/update_dont_want_to_have_a_clickbait_title_wifes/,relationship_advice,7614,155,0.0
teenyleemy,2019-04-05 17:07:45+00:00,*UPDATE* I (32F) am seriously considering divorcing my husband (31M) after less than one year of marriage.,"Again, I want to thank everyone for their responses. It opened my eyes to how truly awful the situation had become. Here is my update:

Wednesday we went to couples counseling. I love this new counselor, she is amazing. He even remarked at how much he liked her. She did tell him during the session that some of his actions are abuse and she reiterated this to him multiple times. We didn’t get into the financial stuff because since it was a first session we spent 1 hour doing background stuff then 30 min delving into why we were there. Mainly we discussed his avoidance of resolving issues and the way he treats me as a subordinate. She made it very clear to him those are forms of verbal abuse ( silent treatment, avoiding, ignoring, punishing etc). Things seemed fine. We left the session and went on about our days. I came home from work and went into my normal routine of laundry, cleaning, watering the garden etc. I decided to take the sheets off the bed even to wash them so we had a nice comfy bed to sleep in that night. We hadn’t shared our bed in days and I was hopeful that things would be better from here.

He came home around 9:30 PM as I was putting the pillow cases back on. He sat out in the kitchen and I could tell something was wrong. I’ve gotten good at reading his moods just by his face. I walked up to him and gave him a kiss and asked about his day. I got short answers. I asked if he was ok. He said yes. I asked if he was hungry. He said yes. I asked if I could whip him up something. He said no. Then he said I should have already had dinner ready for him. I got a chill all over my body. I just walked away and went to my bedroom. Nothing has changed. I know I’m silly for thinking one session could do anything but I thought the counselor telling him that him demanding I complete tasks and then punishing me for not completing them was abuse had hit home. I was wrong. He came to the bedroom and I asked again why he was mad at me and he reiterated he hasn’t eaten all day and I should have made dinner. I said I’m sorry and I can make him something now but he refused. He again slept in the guest room that night and I didn’t even have the energy to cry this time.

The next morning (aka yesterday) he didn’t even say goodbye when he left for work. I didn’t hear from him til about 12:30 PM when I was already at my office. He asked me what last night was all about. I said he was mad at me for not making dinner and that I don’t deserve to be punished simply because I didn’t make dinner and have it waiting for him at 9:30 PM. So at this point he just tells me to stop talking and he drops the bomb. Basically he said the following: 

“I want to separate for a month so that I can figure out what I want and after the month I can decide if I want to work on this marriage or get a divorce. I no longer want to continue counseling because I don’t see any value in it. You have two choices, you can either leave the house or you can pay me $1300 ( the mortgage amount) and then I will leave the house and you can stay there til the end of April.”

I didn’t know what to say. I know he’s told me it’s his house a number of times but I never thought he would kick me out or try to get me to pay him to stay in my own home. He knows I don’t have $1300 laying around to give him. He knows I would have to ask my parents for the money. He knows I would have no choice but to leave my home. That is... if I wasn’t smart enough to realize he cannot do this to me.

I told him I would not be leaving my home but I also would not be staying under his terms ($1300 payment). He said that’s too bad and those are my only choices. I reiterated again that I love him, I do not want to separate, I want to continue couples counseling, I want to make this marriage work BUT if he wants to separate I will not stand in his way. That being said, I want to stay in my home and I will not be paying you. At this point he flew into a rage. He said something to the effect that things were going to get ugly and he would talk to me when he got home.

At this point I’m scared. I work for an attorney and up to this point he had no idea about any of these going ons. I do not like to bring my personal life into work. But I felt like enough was enough and I trust him enough to follow his recommendations. I sat down with him and he firmly recommended I talk to a family law attorney and then set me up with an appointment to meet with them that very afternoon.

My mom left work and took me to the family attorney as I was a crying mess and couldn’t drive myself. Can I just say, all the advice and perspective you all shared with me was echoed by the attorney and I even told her how hundreds of strangers on the internet had really helped me get to this point where I grew a spine and stuck up for myself. We chuckled at that.

We went over everything and turns out I will get 1/2 the home, 1/2 the business and he gets to lose all that &amp; me.  I made it clear to the attorneys my primary goal is reconciliation. I know, I’m a moron, but I do love this man and he was not this person 1 year ago. Even my mom remarked that she’s seen a steady decline in his mental health ever since he started having issues at work shortly after our marriage. Either way, I’m not a punching bag. If you are struggling you don’t drag me down with you when all I want to do is lift you up. 

Anyway, the attorneys called him to notify him he has no right to kick me out and no right to demand payment for me to stay in my home. He had some choice words for the attorney and hung up the phone. They called back to reiterate everything but of course he didn’t answer so they left a VM. The attorneys were wonderful and even gave me big bear hugs on my way out. It felt so wonderful to have people supporting me I forgot what it felt like to be honest. 

My mom and I went home and hid his firearms under my bed. We moved all of his clothes to the guest closet and moved his toiletries to the guest bath. I put some clean towels on the bed for him and wrote him a note that basically said while I don’t want to separate or divorce and I want to make this work I have to protect myself and my rights as his wife. Me “ lawyering up” isn’t a reflection of my refusal to repair the marriage I simply want to make sure I am being treated the way I should while we figure everything out.

I go to bed in my room with all the doors locked last night and am awoken by a knock on my bedroom door at 12 AM. “ Sheriff’s department, OP please open the door”. I spring up out of bed, my dogs are barking at the door. I open the door and there are two female officers ( instantly felt at ease and safe) and him standing behind them. They asked where the firearms were. I said they were under the bed in their cases, unloaded. I said I hid them under the bed because I was scared of him having access to them. They took the firearms from me and made him put the glock in his truck. They said have a good night, I said thank you , locked the door and tried to go back to sleep. HA! All I could think was... he noticed the guns were not where they usually are. Why did he go for the guns. Why did they give him back the guns? What could he have said to the cops to get them to knock on my bedroom door in the middle of the night in the first place. 

I heard him gathering some items and then he left when the sheriffs left. When I woke up around 7am I found the letter I had written him crumpled up in the trash but above the lid so he would be sure I saw that he tossed it. He also took my vacuum cleaner but left the wall charger. I still cannot fathom why he would take the vacuum especially without the charger. Seems irrational. He came back home around 10 AM, sounded like he gathered a few more things and left again. The majority of his clothes and personal items are still in the house so I think he intends to keep coming back although I don’t know if he intends to sleep in the house anymore. 

We are currently no contact since the phone call he made to me at work to tell me to get out yesterday. I’m in this weird space where I want to make this work and I want to fix this more than anything but every second that goes by I see that possibility slipping farther and farther away. It’s heart crushing. I keep second guessing my actions. Did I escalate things by seeking legal representation? Should I not have made a fuss about him being mad about me not making dinner? Should I have just left when he said he wanted to separate. I keep trying to find where I am at fault. I keep analyzing my every word and action to see what I could have said or done differently. I want to blame myself for all this even though that’s not right. But I feel like I’ve been conditioned to always think all of our issues are my fault. It’s hard to undo that line of thinking.

I called the counselor and told her what happened and that he no longer wanted to seek couples counseling but I would like to keep Tuesday’s appointment as a solo session for myself. I’m devastated and broken and I need to do everything I can to heal. 

That’s all I have for now. Thank you all again and again for your support. I never thought strangers on the internet would give me the push I needed to finally say enough is enough but here I am and thank you all!

needsadvice_1,2019-04-05 04:44:31+00:00,"My [27/F] ex boyfriend [30/M] and I share custody of our 5 year old daughter. He just told me that he doesn’t want to see her anymore because she is too dark skinned (we are all black). His current wife is white and their child is biracial, he says he’s ashamed of our daughter.","Long story short, my ex and I met in college. We’re both black Americans from a major metropolitan area. 

Things in our relationship were always mostly fine to begin with. He was never abusive, we were supportive of each other, liked each other’s friends and families, etc. 

I wanted marriage, but after a couple of years he told me that marriage wasn’t in the cards for him because of divorce laws, and that if I loved him then a ring and living together would be enough. 

His divorce argument never made much sense to me as I make slightly more than him anyway (not by much, we’re both professionals), but I loved and trusted him so went with it. 

After I gave birth to our daughter things changed. He said he was really hoping for a son and that having a daughter was kind of a let down, but he still loved her. Over time he started becoming verbally abusive towards me and cold towards my daughter. He cheated and left me. He ghosted me and his daughter for 3 months, then came back and told me that he was never attracted to me because I’m black and that all he wants is a non-black woman. He said this is what every black man wants and that I might as well learn to live with it. I asked him what about his daughter and he said he would pay child support and see her on the weekends. 

This arrangement has been going on for a year and a half now. In the meantime he got married to a white girl (so much for not wanting to be married... ) and had a biracial daughter with her. He flaunts them on social media, but he never did the same with us. 

A few days ago he dropped off our daughter to my apartment as usual. He told me that this would be the last time he would see her, and that he’s sorry but he can’t anymore. 

I asked him what he means and he says that he just doesn’t want her and that he doesn’t like being around females who are black. 

I broke down into tears. He told me that he’s sorry, but it’s just the way it is and if I don’t like it he wouldn’t blame me for ENDING MY LIFE BECAUSE THAT’S WHAT HE WOULD DO IF HE WERE A BLACK WOMAN. He left me crying on the floor, then said he would would continue to pay child support and walked away. 

What am I supposed to tell my daughter? In a way I’m glad she won’t be seeing him anymore. I’m not saying he said anything to her, but I can tell she has low self esteem. She’s happy when she’s with me, but she would always be sad when it was time to see him and his family. It seemed like he made her feel ugly and lesser than. 

But still, what am I going to do? It’s one thing to hurt me... But my daughter didn’t choose him. I never abused him, I always respected him, I took care of him when he was sick, I took care of all of our bills when we were struggling and he couldn’t find work, and this is how he repays me... By treating our daughter like dirt because of the color of her skin. 

I’m sorry, I just need to vent. I don’t know what to do. What will I tell our families when they ask why he doesn’t see her anymore?

I’m worried about my baby girl. I would give my life for her.

meagertodd,2019-04-05 01:56:32+00:00,My wife’s mother tickles our son inappropriately and my wife defends her - help?,"Hi everyone. I am a 35M married to a 27F. 

We have a 2 year old son. Ever since I can remember, my wife’s mother has tickled him. Usually in normal places but also in places where it should be okay to tickle someone.

I recently read something that women can actually be child molesters too but it’s often overlooked because people give them more leeway.

And I realized that exactly described this scenario. If this were her father or my own father then this would definitely not be tolerated ever!

But the fact that it’s my mother in law... who is mother to... my wife... makes it complicated.

I recently called me wife out on it for the Nth time and she came back with “you have a sick mind to think that my mom would ever molest a child - in fact YOURE the deranged one because you’re sexualizing it!”

I actually felt guilty because I felt like maybe I was the one viewing it that way and maybe it is my fault for seeing something that’s not there and overreacting.

While my son doesn’t seem to have a problem with it, I wonder what example that it’s setting for him about boundaries and touching. What if he starts tickling other boys or even girls down there because he learned it from her?

What happens if it progresses into more?

Idk what to do and I’m honestly hurt that my wife is trying to gaslight me about my concerns.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9lem1/my_wifes_mother_tickles_our_son_inappropriately/,relationship_advice,5413,1048,0.0

kxkiro,2019-04-04 17:55:08+00:00,I [34M] just discovered the real side of my girlfriend [33F],"We had no issues before, and she was my role-model. I'm honestly shocked by this.

Yesterday I got invited to her place, things were going great... she turned on the TV and we were watching some movie about poverty-stricken family, in the plot it was around Christmas time.

After a few minutes there was a part where the family was eating Christmas dinner. My girlfriend made a nasty comment which was something like: ""Look at that crap dinner."" I didn't really react to her comment.

The mother in the movie brought the turkey and my girlfriend said ""That looks like cow's placenta."" that's when I sat up and said ""Are you serious?""

I told her that not everyone has the luxury of a ""fancy"" Christmas dinner, I told her to look at the real image, they have at least they have their significant others, it's not about the presents and all after all...

Then she said something along the lines of: ""Yeah, that money you spent on food to donate to charities on Christmas day could have been used to fund me a better gift.""

That was when I lost my shit and just went home. I haven't talked to her since. I'm contemplating whether to stay with her anymore.

Any advice appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9g0n3/i_34m_just_discovered_the_real_side_of_my/,relationship_advice,6479,725,0.0
throwingitawayhelp56,2019-04-04 15:22:54+00:00,My (35) husband (37) is obsessed with our neighbours au pair.,"Throwaway account because my husband knows my reddit name. But post will probably be obviously regardless. Confused and shaken so don’t know where to begin &amp; will probably ramble. 

We have been married for 11 years and have 3 young children. No huge issues up until this point. I consider him a great partner, works hard (as do I) and we are happy together. 
    In January our neighbours got an au pair from Ireland. She was a hot topic when she came because she’s stunningly beautiful. Their house directly faces ours so we seen her often and joked together that the wife must be sleeping with her eyes open. These neighbours both work, like ourselves, but my parents are retired and care for our children. This couples au pair basically tends to the children’s needs during the working day, driving them to school &amp; extra curricular activities. Our kids attend the same school. 
    Like EVERYBODY else, my husband ogled her at beginning which was not cause for concern- I’m telling you if I could insert a picture of this girl without exposing him and myself I would. Our other neighbours even made comments to us about her, complementary of course. However as the months have passed I have noticed my husband becoming obsessed with her. It started with the staring out the window waiting to catch and glimpse of her. His “chair” he sits on whilst watching tv was positioned in our living area towards the back of the house nearer our back yard area...he MOVED the chair to the front of the house to have a clear view of neighbours house. I confronted him because it was that damn obvious, but he claimed that it’s “coming into spring and he sun comes in that side better.” Huh, really? 11 years later and you decide this? But whatever, he wants to check out Irish au pair model, I suppose if the shoe was on the other foot I would do the same. 
    The next cause for concern was when he decided he wants to take my daughter to her swimming lessons on Saturday morning that he never once was interested in before. And yeah, you guessed it, au pair takes the neighbours twin girls to the same class. I again confront him on his true intention, and he scoffs at me. I drop it but I’m on high alert. 
    He returns home from swimming and is gushing about au pair, I mean gushing. Like a fucking teenager. He finds out her name and is telling me and my sister about her life back in Ireland and how great of a girl she is. My sister couldn’t even hide her dismay. I again confronted him but he brushed it off and said he “never took me for the insecure type” and she’s “10 years his junior, she’s just a nice girl.” 
   Fast forward to this morning. I am on our computer working from home. I don’t have a Facebook profile but I check his messages in a moment of weakness- nothing. Relief, momentarily. I go into the history to retrieve the page I was on before the Facebook snoop and my heart sinks. He has been searching this girl on Facebook daily for weeks, probably over a month. Every single evening and sometimes multiple times a day. 

I’m concerned about this and find it quite frankly disturbing. I can’t help but feeling he is masturbating to her profile judging by the times in which he is searching her and that is only from our desktop -I dread to think how often he searches her on his phone.

I wouldn’t consider myself insecure, however for the first time in my marriage I feel like, if given the chance, he would cheat. 

How do I go forward from here? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9e2ys/my_35_husband_37_is_obsessed_with_our_neighbours/,relationship_advice,1256,362,0.0

[Link to update](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b78m0s/update_my_22f_boyfriends_24m_new_tattoo_makes_me/)

&amp;#x200B;

Super long post incoming so apologies in advance.

I wasn't going to bother with this update but after all the support and love I received from people in this sub I feel like the least I can do in return is give some closure for anyone wanting it. Before I begin I just want to thank everyone who gave advice, I didn't respond to everyone but I read almost every response. I stopped reading my Pm's because a lot of the messages I was getting were graphic and negative but I appreciate the few of you who were positive and helpful in your messages and I'm sorry if I didn't respond to you. Now on to the update: 

It's been a crazy week and a lot has happened since our argument. My bf spent two nights at his sisters and during this time I decided to just send him a link to my reddit posts instead of writing him a letter. I felt like everything I needed to say was in those two threads and it would be good for him to read people's opinions. His sister read through them too and that started a massive argument between them that revealed some shocking information that led to my bf coming back home and completely breaking down. 

We spent the whole night talking where he revealed he's been using a lot of drugs recently and drinking a lot more to deal with his grief. He told me he feels responsible for his brothers death because while I was pushing for us to file for custody he was on the fence about the idea and now he feels his brother would still be alive if we had filed for custody over him when I first suggested it. He said because of this he's been developing a lot of feelings of resentment towards me (I don't really understand why and neither does he) which he recognises as being unjustified so he's been bottling them up along with everything else which essentially led to him flipping out when I brought up his tattoo. Obviously I knew he was having a hard time dealing with his brother's death but I must have been viewing the world through rose coloured glasses because I never would have realised how bad it was if he hadn't told me. 

I was really hoping it wouldn't be the case but unfortunately a few of you redditors were right on the mark. He regrets the tattoo and discovering I wasn't happy with it either sent him over the edge into panic mode and he tried to use it as an excuse because the very idea of regretting the tattoo or wanting to get rid of it makes him feel even guiltier. Truth is he hates the tattoo and he tries not to look at it at all. He apologised about a hundred times for reacting the way he did and for not considering he was making me look at the tattoo in general, as well as during sex. He completely understood where I was coming from when I brought it up, he just reacted the way he did because he essentially had a ""mental breakdown"" in his opinion. 

I apologised for my ""jack off"" comment. Initially he was quite shocked and did take the comment as an insult but after reading the reddit post he understood what I meant and was very forgiving. He apologised for accusing me of never caring for his brother. 

We then talked about the argument he had with his sister... 

Up until now I was under the impression that my bf went on his own to get the tattoo done, but it turns out his sister went with him to his first session and it was her who convinced him to get a portrait on his chest whereas my bf originally wanted to get a drawing of his brothers favorite stuffed animal. Not only this but during their argument it came out that his sister wanted him to get such a drastic tattoo because she was hoping it would cause a rift between us. Apparently she felt like I was tearing their family apart by trying to file for custody and she doesn't want me dating her brother anymore. 

If that sounds totally ridiculous to you, it's because it is. Not defending her actions, what she's done is absolutely deplorable, but a history of mental illness bipolar/schizophrenia does run in their family. We're certain his sister suffers from bipolar disorder as well, or possibly something else, but she refuses to be diagnosed. 

My bf didn't go around to all our friends, that was his sister lying. She was the only one he told and he's promised to set the story straight for any family members she mentions it to. We've both apologised for what we said and we're going to stay together and work through things together. 

In the short term we're going to be getting in contact with a grief counsellor and try out some of the suggestions for how to make things less awkward in the bedroom. In the long term we're going to consult a tattoo artist to see what can be done in terms of lasering it off/turning it in to something else. Bf doesn't feel comfortable lasering it off and currently his favorite idea is to get a heap more tattoos to try and make it less noticeable. I'm a fan of this idea as well. 

As for his sister, bf is currently debating whether to cut her out of his life or not. I don't think he should, I feel like he's lost enough family but I'll respect whatever decision he comes to. 

I think that just about wraps everything up. A huge thank you again to everyone for all your advice and help, it really helped me get through this horrible and awkward situation. 

I mean this in the nicest way possible when I say I hope I never have to post on this subreddit again. 

tl;dr - We both apologised for what we said in the heat of the moment. Boyfriend revealed he regrets getting the tattoo and it was his sister who convinced him to get it in the hopes it would break us up. We're seeking grief counselling and considering getting more tattoos to make the current one less noticeable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9arq5/final_update_my_22f_boyfriends_24m_new_tattoo/,relationship_advice,30242,1211,0.0
Snowflakehoney,2019-04-03 15:45:54+00:00,My sister's boyfriend[24] of 7 years sexually assaulted me[18],"Hi, I am really new to Reddit but I needed somewhere to vent because I literally can't turn to anyone. 

My sister has been dating this guy for a long time and everyone (including myself at one point) thought they were perfect for each other. He is super caring of her and I can definitely tell he loves her and she loves him. I am also dating a guy and it's been a year and a half and I love him to bits and he loves me the same too. 

I am close to him but he always felt like an older brother to me. He is funny, smart and everyone loves talking to him. My family, my boyfriend all love him as well, we all have a close relationship with him. My sister and him live together in an apartment but a few months ago she started visiting our house again and they would stay over and she would go to Uni or work and come back later that day.

Him and I would just chill on the lounge watching movies or talk or play games. We have done it many times before in the past and it was enjoyable and fun because my parents are usually never home and I get lonely sometimes (my boyfriend can't come over often since he lives quite far). 

One day we were on the couch, (we usually keep our distance, we sit on opposite sides) and he was sitting right next to me. I kept to the corner of the couch and we were just having banter and telling jokes like we usually would. But everytime I made a joke, he would tickle me and touch me in a very different way which I could tell. At first I tried not to think much of it and told myself I was overthinking. But then he had his hand on my thigh and I just froze. I didn't know what to think because I never thought I would be ever stuck in this situation. He kept rubbing his hand up and down my thighs and I felt sick to my stomach but I didn't know what to say. All of a sudden my sister called to tell us she was coming home and he immediately stopped and I got up to go the bathroom. I was frozen for a good 5 minutes and I had to process everything that just had happened. Another few instances was I could obviously tell he was checking out my body. I am relatively short and small but my chest somehow is relatively large for my body size and I try to hide it most times because it makes me feel uncomfortable as I know many random guys in public make comments about it or obviously check me out. I rarely ever wear low cut tops because of this yet my sister's boyfriend has quite obviously checked them out if we are ever close to each other. 

Anyway, this happened again, however this time my sister was here too. She had a day off and we all chilled on the couch. He sat in the middle while my sister and I were on each side. I somehow fell asleep during the movie and as I woke, I could feel he was touching my butt under the blanket. More like caressing. My sister was there and he was still doing this. I pretended to be asleep because I had no idea what was going on or what I should've done. This went on for about 10 minutes before my boyfriend called and I pretended to wake up.

Then the dreaded day happened. We were chilling again as per usual. I made sure to keep my distance and try my best to keep normal because I wasn't sure of what was happening. I have major anxiety so my mind was always racing. He somehow edged so close to me and was touching my thighs. I felt so so so so so uncomfortable but nothing would come out of voice because I was so so afraid. He ended up caressing my entire body and pushed open my legs as I tried my best to focus on the movie. He kept trying to get me to look at him and kiss him but I kept my face towards the tv. He also ended up touching me down there and almost fingering before my sister ended up calling. I kept my face normal (I have major depression as well, so faking is really easy for me) and waited until the left to go home. I broke down crying and crying and crying because I couldn't believe what just happened. I had never felt so unbelievably disgusted and dirty and ashamed. I hated it so much that I didn't even say anything. But I literally had no idea what to say. I feel so extremely guilty because I love love love love my boyfriend. But if I tell family, I feel like this would ruin everything and I feel like my whole family will just break. Especially my sister and my boyfriend. It's hurts me the most that I can't tell my boyfriend but it literally eats me alive. We are going so perfectly well but I feel as if I'm slowly detoriating and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so so so lost but I absolutely can't say anything to anyone.

I messaged him a few days later telling him how disgusted I was with him and that I honestly never wanted to have anything to do with him again, but that I would have to for the sake of my family and my sister(my sister also has issues and I think she would literally break if she found out) he apologized and said how sorry he was and ever since then, if we ever see each other we avoid each other,  but not enough that people notice. 

Please please please give me advice on how to get over this and become stronger because I literally am so lost and hurt and sad. I've been crying for a good few months now. I even considered breaking up with my boyfriend because he doesn't deserve such a broken girl like me. I wish I told someone but also am too afraid for the aftermath and how it would affect everyone. So please tell me how to get over this... It kills me everyday. I love my boyfriend so much, I wish this never happened. Please help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b8zmkd/my_sisters_boyfriend24_of_7_years_sexually/,relationship_advice,1974,462,0.0

wllmwallace,2019-04-02 15:15:03+00:00,Can't wait until Thursday....My(48M) wife(44F) is going to be SHOCKED,"So, wife and I have been together 17 years.  We are still stupid for each other, and she is the absolute love of my life.  About two years ago she started having joint aches and pains, and some minor swelling in her hands, wrists, ankles, etc.  So off we got to the GP, who gives us a consult to a Rheumatologist.  Come to find out, she has rheumatoid  arthritis, no worries, she starts treatment.  Fast forward to a month ago, when our North Texas weather decided to go full mental, and start changing temps and rain/weather by the hour it seemed.  She woke up after overnight temp changes and thunderstorms, and her hands were HUGE, worse, her small petite fingers looked like sausages.  And even though she had been previously warned about this, had slept in her wedding ring.  So, off to the doctors office....where they had to cut off her ring.  So, now for the bad, our rings were special order from Ireland, and have words in Gaelic around the exterior of the ring, negating any type of ""repair"", and they were designed and made......17 years ago.  She was absolutely GUTTED.  I assured her we would figure it out, and it wasn't a big deal, but I could tell, to her, it was.

Begin Sherlock Holmes Mode.  I googled until I couldn't google anymore.  I was able to find that the original jeweler had closed up shop 10+ years ago just due to age.  I searched some more.  I finally found his personal Facebook page, and I message him, and wait......and wait......

I finally get a response from his daughter, that she had noticed a pending message on her Da's page, and that he passed away just six months ago.  I express my condolences, and she asks what was the purpose of my inquiry.  I go into this long diatribe about what had happened, etc.  She tells me she understands, and is so sorry about what had happened.

Fast forward a couple of weeks.  I get a message on Facebook from an unknown person, until she explains this was the daughter of the jeweler.  She explains that she went through all her dads designs and looked up the approximate dates, and thinks she found the drawings, details, and MOLDS in her dads things, and wanted me to confirm.  She sent pictures, and I confirmed that YES - THOSE ARE OUR RINGS!  She said she would get all of this to us as soon as possible, and asked for our address.

I open my email this morning to find tracking information, and pictures.  OF OUR RINGS.  She went ahead and had her BROTHER, who had taken over her fathers business make our wedding bands again, in her original size, and two extra in two larger sizes in case her condition causes her fingers to swell/change, and mailed them out to us, at no charge.  I asked why they did both as mine was fine, and she said it would not be fair that my wife had to have a new ring, and I was allowed to keep my old one.  She told me we needed to put our original set away, and to enjoy our new wedding bands.  I asked about compensation, and she said she was honored to keep her dads work and spirit alive.

Our ""New"" Wedding Bands will be here Thursday.

Trying to think of romantic way to present her with them as she has NO IDEA any of this took place.

PepGodiola,2019-04-02 10:55:36+00:00,My (M25) new girlfriend (22F) just told me she sleeps with her best friend. Now I am conflicted.,"I’ve been seeing this girl for just about a month, and we came together in a random but beautiful way. I’ve grown quite fond of her, and her dog as well. Just last week, after meeting her friends, we had “the talk” and decided we would pursue a relationship with one another.

Due to her work schedule,  she has 2 weeks off upcoming. I asked her how she planned to spend these weeks, and she revealed she will travel to her old college town about 3 hours away to meet her school friend. When I asked if I had met this friend before in the bar, she replied that this male friend is her best friend. He “saved her life” when she was depressed in college, and is an important person for her. Sure, no problem I thought. Then she revealed she always has sex with him when she visits. 

I was shocked and played it off, and only waited until one day later to talk to her about it again. She doesn’t see this guy but once a year, and is adamant that there are no romantic feelings there. I get a seriously weird vibe from this: Guy helped you when you tried to kill yourself, so now you owe (or give) him sex? Wtf. 

She says this is something I have to accept, but I wanted to have a good think before I make any decision. I really care for her and her little doggo, but this situation makes my stomach uneasy.

I (33 F) have just given birth to a white baby while both my husband (36 M) and I are indian. He thinks I've cheated, meanwhile I'm worried i was raped. i haven't talked to my husband since he left the hospital and i don't know what to do

throwaway because who wants this disaster on their mane account?

A little backstory, although not much is necessary, we're a typical couple (or we where)

We've been married for 5 years, both of indian descent, with dark skin to match.

we met in our workplace where we both still work together and have been (for the most part) happy ever since.

Things have been a little harder the last few years, we'd been trying for a baby for so long and started losing our hope. So when we finally got pregnant with a healthy baby boy, we where over the moon, my husband could not have been more excited to be a dad.

I'm avoiding it but, might as well cut to the chase, my baby is white. At first i didn't even really notice it, he was more red than anything, but once i saw it was like my brain split open right there in the hospital.

I can't entirly recall what happened, but my husband started screaming at me and i didnt even know what to say. of course i never cheated on him, but clear as day the baby is white! He stormed out pretty soon after, and has been at his brothers place ever since. i only know this because his brother texted me.

its been two days, he hasn't talked to me and I'm afraid to reach out, because i have nothing to even say. i understand why hes so angry, but it hurts that he would think I'd cheat, i cant help to be angry too.

I haven't been able to barley touch my baby, just looking at him makes me cry, its not his poor little fault but who's is? I'm not really a drinker, but i went to a couple events around the time i got pregnant, still i can't remember any moment i could have been drugged. did somone break into my house?

what if i never find out and my marriage is destroyed, if i can't fix this i don't know how i can take care of my son, i can't even look at him.

what do i do once i have to go back to work with him? Will i have to quit?

i dont even know what any of you can do but i feel like I'm drowning.

teenyleemy,2019-04-02 03:22:16+00:00,I (32F) am seriously considering divorcing my husband (31M) after less than one year of marriage.,"I’m at my breaking point. I don’t have a sad story about a cheating spouse or some perverted secret being discovered. I think my issues are more common so I’m hoping people out in the world can relate and offer me their advice based on their own experiences. I’m going to write this as a list of reasons why I’m considering ending my marriage. Any insight you all can provide is appreciated.

1. Puts me down for not making as much money as he does even though I work a full time job.

2. Due to our income differences, all of the household chores including but not limited to cleaning, laundry, groceries, cooking etc are my sole responsibility. We split the household bills evenly so I still am as financially responsible as he is but I also have to do all house work. 

3. Although we have discussed our love languages and I have made every attempt to accommodate his needs he has never made an attempt to accommodate mine. 

4. We own our own business and I am not allowed to know any of the finances or have access to anything regarding the business finances. He often has me do work for the business but does not pay me for my time. He says the roof over my head is payment.

5. Constantly tells me I live in HIS house &amp; that it is not our home even though we bought the home together and my name is on the deed. 

6. We do not have any joint bank accounts and my husband does not give me money for any reason whatsoever &amp; I have no idea what he spends his money on. However, he constantly is asking how I spend my money &amp; if he disagrees with my spending an argument usually follows. For this reason I don’t spend any money on myself to avoid arguments. 

7. I have a masters degree and he has a bachelors degree but he is always discouraging me from going for my doctorate because he thinks it’s a waste of money. I feel like it’s a necessary expense so that I can make more money in my career field. Plus, I love learning and it makes me happy. 

8. He’s selfish. Now this one is hard to measure and is a matter of opinion but I feel like he’s a selfish person. We only do things that are his interests. Our life is prioritiZed around his needs, wants etc. I’m always supporting his hobbies and interests but he never makes any attempt to even get to know what I’m interested in. 

 9. I do not feel loved. This is the main thing right now. I’m a simple woman. All I want is to feel loved, appreciated and respected. I want to be treated with kindness and affection. I have made these needs known and he will even admit that he has failed to meet these needs. His excuse is that because I’m not living up to his expectations of who, what and where I should be at the age of 32 it makes it difficult for him to show me love and affection. I could understand this if I was behaving in a way that was contradictory to the way a wife or spouse should behave but I’m not. I’m loyal, I don’t cheat on him, I don’t lie to him, I try my hardest to make him happy every single day. I don’t ever go out with my friends anymore because I know I can’t spend the money, I do everything that he asks of me in the bedroom because if I don’t he throws a temper tantrum and says it’s what he needs. I feel like I’ve completely lost myself. I’ve let him slowly gain control over every aspect of my life and now I’m just stuck. He lives his life however he wants and I’m along for the ride. 

I know marriage is hard and I know it takes work. I know my issues are perhaps trivial &amp; I know other people have it worse but this is my life and my reality. I feel like I’m fading away slowly. Like I’m a shell of my former self. There are more things but this is all I could think about right now. I have a counseling session scheduled for Wednesday morning with a new doctor. I feel like this is my last attempt to try in this relationship. I’m hoping something will change but I’m cautiously optimistic.

zflv,2019-04-02 01:56:16+00:00,I realized how much my boyfriend loves me after I passed out at work yesterday,"Not looking for advice, just wanted to share! Yesterday at work (I work part time in the kitchen at a restaurant), I passed out from dehydration, not eating enough lately, stress, low blood sugar, standing up for too long without rest, and being in a hot and crowded environment. It was my first time ever fainting (I’m 18) and I was unconscious until I got to the hospital. My family of course were called in, and my sister contacted my boyfriend to tell him what happened. It scared my boyfriend to death. He told her to have me call him when I was able to and he kept checking in with her to see if I was ok. When I finally was able to call him, he asked me how I was doing while his voice was shaking. It then became full on crying and he kept blaming himself. He said he was sorry for giving me too much stress lately (we’ve had a few arguments lately but it’s mainly been my fault) and he said he was sorry he didn’t treat me better in order to prevent this from happening (but actually, he is really really good to me. Like idk how much better he could treat me). Anyways he was really scared and cried for such a long time. He really wanted to see me, but I said he couldn’t because my dad was there and my dad doesn’t know I’m dating. Later his friends contacted me and asked how I was doing and said my boyfriend told them what happened. They said it was the first time they heard my boyfriend cry and joked that he doesn’t even worry about them that much. Then this morning, he stopped by my house (I didn’t go to school today and my dad was at work) and brought me breakfast. He then cried more before telling me I scared him to death and that I need to know that he really really loves me. After I reassured him that I would take better care of myself and that it was in no way his fault, he stopped crying and brought me to DimSum for lunch. On the way to DimSum though I closed my eyes for maybe a few seconds because I felt a little tired and he instantly screamed what’s wrong. That was kind of funny and I laughed at him for overreacting so much, but I was honestly touched that he was so worried. I knew that my boyfriend loves me, but now I know how much he does.

mln27,2019-04-01 20:05:51+00:00,UPDATE: My [27f] friend [32] is cheating on his long time girlfriend of 4 years with TONS of girls. Should I tell her?,"[previous thread, although the description was deleted](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a3feh2/my_27f_friend_32_is_cheating_on_his_long_time/)

Original thread tl;dr
My pro-athlete friend was constantly cheating on his girlfriend of four years (now 5 years) with multiple different women and I was conflicted on whether or not to say something to her. The majority of our friends knew about the cheating going on but no one had said anything.



After I posted that question and read all the replies, I decided to tell the girlfriend. I didn't really know how to go about it, because I don't really know her that well. So, I did the cowardly thing and made a fake Instagram account to send her a message on. At first I wanted to keep it anonymous, give her some proof I had which were screenshots of my friend bragging to me on Snapchat and various other platforms about how many girls he had slept with that week/night. His fake Tinder profile too. He would catfish girls on there and add them on Snapchat to talk to them, sending them his Instagram account so they can see that he's 'famous' and make the girls ""feel privileged"" that he's talking to them. ((his words not mine)). I figured I could start by not saying my name, and I would gauge her reaction then I would let her log onto my social media accounts and see for herself what her boyfriend had said to me just to verify what I had been saying was true. The conversations with my friend over Snapchat were always saved, so that wasn't an issue about having lost messages.


[So, this is the message I opened up with](https://imgur.com/je9v7lE)
When I told her that other people knew, I specifically meant her boyfriends pro-biker friends who travel with him all over the world. They all know he cheats on her because they're there when it all happens. I didn't say that at first to her, but then she sent [this](https://imgur.com/afWJ64L)

After she asked me for someone else's name, I felt really bad just giving her it, so I messaged my friend quickly and asked him if it was alright to pass his name along and he said yeah. After a little bit of back and forth between the girlfriend and myself, I offered her my log in details to some of my accounts so she can see what her boyfriend has been saying to me. I apologized to her for bringing this all up. 
[She replied with this](https://imgur.com/ioEXZxg). I gave her my details, and then she knew exactly who I was. 

A lot more messages were sent to each other, and surprisingly she seemed to be taking it well. Now by this time though, she had messaged my friend saying that ""some girl"" had messaged her telling he had cheated and that he needs to admit it. She was telling me that she hasn't mentioned my name at all to him, and she sent me screenshots of their conversation. He messaged her saying ""it was Becky who messaged you wasn't it?"". My name is not Becky. The girlfriend said no it is not Becky, and asked who Becky was. He said he slept with Becky ONCE. I told her this is a lie as it happened more than once, and that he will have millions of other names to give her, so don't just settle for the one name. 

After some more messaging, and giving her more details about things he's said and done in the past [she sent me this](https://imgur.com/KHuBXFf)

And this is what I said back to her, with her reply saying that he finally admitted it. [Here](https://imgur.com/iVmBDdk)


I felt extremely guilty for causing this drama and telling her about her boyfriend, I couldn't sleep because I kept thinking about how I broke two people up. I can only imagine how bad she feels! My friend hasn't messaged me at all, and the girlfriend hasn't messaged me since either. I don't know if they broke up for sure 100%, but at least now she knows the truth about who she's dating. And if she wants to either end things with him completely or try work things out between them then I hope whatever she chooses it brings her peace. 

I think I have lost a friendship out of this, but I've come to realise that if someone is willing to cheat and lie to the one you love then you're probably a piece of shit anyway. 

TL;DR 
Messaged the girlfriend about her boyfriend cheating, gave her all my log in details to my accounts so she can read what her boyfriend has bragged about to me. He finally admitted it all. She broke up with him. Not friends with the guy anymore.

imfromsaltlake,2019-04-01 18:53:16+00:00,Update: I think my husband cause our neighbor to commit suicide,"Hello, everyone. Considering the flood of messages and responses I have received, I decided that I would put out a response as soon as I had gotten myself together. I hope to answer a few questions and give you a bit more information on what has happened. 

Why did I let my husband take the money? 
I did not know how much she gave my husband until he came back to the backyard. I would have told him to give it back if she’d still been in the neighborhood but she’d driven off. 

Why/what did your husband tell the father? 
My husband is a military man with very strong morals. He believed that helping her lie to her father was morally wrong. He tried to return the money to her father and told him that his daughter hit our fence, paid for it and asked us not to tell him but because we had the supplies, he was looking to return the money and get him updated on the situation. The father did not accept the money and “slammed” the door shut. 

Why didn’t you notice anything was wrong?
My husband and I are Catholics in a predominantly Mormon neighborhood. We are mostly ignored. Up until a few days ago, we hadn’t spoken to more than a few neighbors besides in passing and knew nothing about their home or family lives. We have never been around children and took her crying for normal teenage hysterics. 

Did you tell the police?
Yes. I called the non-emergency line this morning and told the operator about what I knew since my husband was afraid they might arrest him for not reporting what he saw. They did not ask to take my statement down at the station but said they would “look into it”. The funeral is in a few days and we are not invited. I donated a few hundred dollars to a charity chosen by the mother that her daughter supported and will be picking up their younger sons from school in a few hours. 

My husband and I are looking to book separate appointments with a counselor nearby. I do not know if I blame him for her death but it has brought some things to light that make me very nervous. He called our lawyer to see if he could be held liable before telling me what happened, tried to hide that he knew the girl was dead, and generally acted in bad faith. It is a culmination of everything I dislike about him and I do not know how to move forward.

No, I do not know how she died and I am not going to ask.

recacer,2019-04-01 09:36:52+00:00,I [M28] Just broke up with my girlfriend over something she [F27] posted on Facebook. Justified? Did I overreact?,"So we've been together about 7 months. We've had plenty of issues, but always managed to work through them and come out the other side a bit stronger. But something I found tonight just churned my stomach and it affected me so much I ended our relationship.

Some backstory for context: About 2 weeks ago we had a minor argument. It started in the morning, we paused the conversation for the day while we went to work, then talked about it that night. We both got kinda heated but eventually agreed that we were arguing about something ridiculous, and reached a compromise, and everything seemed fine.

Fast forward to tonight. We're laying in bed and I realize I never accepted her Facebook friend request. I literally never use Facebook, so this wasn't a point of contention or anything. But we weren't doing anything else so I decided to accept the request and check out her Facebook (She was right next to me the whole time).

What I found really upset me. Multiple shared posts that were obviously in reference to our relationship. They were just pictures of text that she had shared, not actually written herself.

The first one I found was this: ""Hey, here's a cool concept: treat the people that are important to you... Like they are important to you..."" I think ""Hmm, is this about me?"" I feel like I make her feel important all the time. I drive 30 minutes to her house every single day. She had a birthday and I did all the things that you would expect: Multiple presents, dinner, I offered a movie and drinks but she felt sick and we didn't go. I often buy her things just because. I offer her lunch nearly every day to show I'm thinking about her...

Ok, maybe I'm overreacting on that one I think. That post could be about anything or anyone, so I keep scrolling. I see another one: ""If you push me away, I promise you, you won't find me where you left me""... Hmm, this one obviously sounds like she's talking about our relationship. And I was a bit upset at seeing it. Especially considering I never felt like I was pushing her away. I spend literally every free moment I have with her. She got upset that I wanted some alone time. She says she doesn't desire it, doesn't understand why I need it, so I pretty much did away with my private time to spend more time with her. We are constantly doing things together, and make plans to do things and go places. I never felt like I was pushing her away. If anything, I felt like I spent most of my free time trying to think of things we could do together.

I keep scrolling, and I found the one that hurt me the most: ""Don't be mad when someone else starts to appreciate the person you took for granted. What you won't do, someone else will.""

That one absolutely killed me. I never thought I was taking her for granted. And the thought of her not feeling appreciated kinda floored me. On top of that, the implication is that she wants to find someone else who apparently appreciates her more than I do...

I confronted her about these posts. She said they don't mean anything. That she didn't even think about it, and that it took less than a second to hit the share button, so it's not a big deal.

I took a bit to collect my thoughts, and then I went back through our text messages to each other. Turns out that every single one of these posts was made when we were in the midst of an argument/spat. That last one, the one that hurt me so much, was shared by her during the day after we had the minor argument and before we had talked it out that night.

It just felt so terrible. Like, we have a very minor disagreement about something and you're thinking about finding someone else? That's what it seems like to me. Am I out of my mind for thinking that? She made me feel like I was. She said I was overreacting. That she felt that way in the moment, but not now. But I can't stop myself from thinking ""If you feel this way after a minor argument, how must you feel after a serious one?"".

Then there is the whole issue of airing out our dirty laundry to anyone that happens to be friends with her on Facebook. Anyone with a brain knows what those posts are about. By sharing them, you are essentially announcing to the world ""I'm having relationship problems!!!"". I can't help but think about the things her family and mutual friends must think about our relationship considering how often she is sharing things like that (They were all posted within this past month). To an outsider, I must seem like a fucking asshole. Not treating her right. Not respecting her. Not making her feel important.

I just felt disgusted. I felt like I was going to vomit. I just kept seeing the words ""What you won't do, someone else will"". I know she didn't write them. But she thought them. She agreed with them. She broadcast them to the world.

I told her I knew myself well enough to know I wouldn't forget it. That anytime we had any minor argument, I would be thinking ""Guess she's gonna go find someone who respects her more than I do"". I don't think I could deal with it. Knowing that anytime we fight, she is having these feelings. Instead of wanting to work it out, she is thinking about finding a new partner...

I broke up with her within an hour of seeing the posts. It was ugly. I feel bad. I feel tired. I've had no sleep and I have to work in like 3 hours. I don't even know why I'm posting this. The relationship is over. Maybe I overreacted, maybe I was justified. I just know it felt right.

confusedangryannoyed,2019-03-31 20:17:44+00:00,My (24F) boyfriend (25M) had a bizarre reaction upon meeting my sister (23F). Neither of them will tell me what’s going on and it’s driving me crazy. (UPDATE),"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b6nhjf/my_24f_boyfriend_25m_had_a_bizarre_reaction_upon/


I had NO idea that my post blew up the way it did. Had it not been for the hundreds of “where’s the update/what happened???” comments and DMs I probably would’ve deleted the account and moved on. I don’t have a main 

Anyway, on the day I made the post I calmly just asked him to tell me what happened. I told him that it can’t be THAT bad and that we can work through whatever it is. He said that he can’t because I’d think less of him and all that stuff. Idk, I was very hurt by that comment and didn’t push it any further. 

The next day I had a massive argument with my sister who said that he never actually paid her off. I had a feeling she was lying anyway. She decided to tell me what happened because she got bored (yes, really) and wanted me to leave her alone again. In a nutshell, this is what she told me: 


- Around 2 years ago she went to these weird, fucked up parties (/clubs?) that were filled with people from wealthy/professional backgrounds and everyone was constantly coked up. Basically lots of debauchery &amp; excess. 

- She saw my BF on several occasions and said that he was always doing heavy ‘substances’ and acting very, very wild. Apparently he and his buddies were major assholes too. (Btw, I’m not sure how she ended up there but he comes from a wealthy family so the connection makes sense)

- One day he invited her to one of the rooms where he was smoking weed. She said that they got high together but never hooked up

- Afterwards she left the party with him and a few others and they went to someone’s place 

- She walked in on my BF having a threesome with a couple of girls who tied him to the bed and pegged/used toys on him amongst other things. She spent 5 minutes explaining how “loud” he was and that he asked her to hold his hand. 

- Someone called the cops to the location and everyone, including my sister, took off without untying him so he was stuck there 

- She says she never saw him again after that night 

Long story short, I brought it up with my BF. He eventually admitted that she told the truth. I was more concerned about his substance abuse and said I’d be willing to discuss that if he’s comfortable with it. It was a sensitive topic but I think we dealt with it well. He’s clean now and said that he managed to put a stop to it before it spiralled out of control. I assured him that his mental/physical health is far more important, the rest  is just whatever. He was pretty relieved.

He said that he’s actually open about his past issues but didn’t feel like he could tell me. I think many people did something in the past they’re not proud of and it’s not always easy to share that with someone you care about. However it’s definitely not something I expected because he’s a clean-cut guy and just very calm/quiet overall. 

Afterwards I asked him about *that* incident and he was mortified. He said that my sister just laughed in his face and didn’t even try to help so the cops had to untie him and he had to go ER that night as well. He was incredibly embarrassed about the butt play stuff.... and the handholding. It’s the first time I’ve seen him so red faced. 

I definitely could’ve handled the situation better from the start and regret that I was so pushy. Maybe if i didn’t freak out he’d feel more comfortable telling me. 

Just to finish off this post I’m gonna say this: if you’re facing a serious problem or addiction of any kind, please make sure you get help! The people that matter won’t judge you &amp; you’ll feel less alone.

imfromsaltlake,2019-03-31 19:18:36+00:00,I think my husband might have caused our neighbor to commit suicide,"My husband and I live in a neighborhood where the houses in the street behind us have their garages facing ours. We share a connecting back alleyway. One morning, our neighbor’s daughter was pulling out from her driveway when the back of her car hit our fence. It shook the fence but besides a smear of paint from her car and a decent sized crack in one board, there was absolutely no damage. We were both in the backyard when it happened so we knew what she had done. 

My husband went out to confront her. She started screaming and sobbing uncontrollably, begging him not to tell her father and repeatedly saying that he would “kill her” if she found out. She offered us money from her own savings to fix the fence. My husband accepted the money, which she brought us immediately. She kept asking if he would tell her father and he assured her that he wouldn’t. After paying us, she left for the day. It was about 100 dollars in cash, although we had the boards and tools to fix the fence without any cost to ourselves. I wasn’t happy but he insisted that it was good for her to learn a lesson in responsibility and safe driving. 

Later that week, we learned from our next door neighbor that the daughter had committed suicide. I believe that’s what happened because another neighbor next door to the daughter’s house confirmed hearing shouting and seeing an ambulance outside the house while my husband and I were at work. My husband was pale and shaken for a day or two after. When I finally asked him why he was taking it so badly, he told me that after the daughter left and I’d gone inside, he waited until the father came home from work and told him that his daughter had not only hit his fence but paid for us to keep it a secret. He said the father seemed angry and slammed the door but didn’t say anything else.

I doubt the father murdered her; i have the mother on facebook and she is posting openly about her daughter’s suicide which I don’t think she could do if there was a murder investigation. I do think my husband took advantage of a frightened girl and reported her to an abusive father. He wants my support and to attend trauma counseling but every time I look at him, I’m just disgusted. I think about how he took her money and lied to her face. I don’t want to throw away a decade worth of marriage but when he asks me to tell him it isn’t his fault, I just stay quiet. We have no children together but he’s the only family I have. I need advice, I don’t know what to do.

KyleKKatarn,2019-03-30 17:11:09+00:00,UPDATE: Wife going behind my back to hang out with ex,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_guidance/comments/b74unj/my_wife_went_behind_my_back_to_hang_out_with_her/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app

I read over everyone’s suggestions.  You were all right.

I confronted her and demanded the truth.  After a bit of interrogation (mainly repeatedly saying I need to know the truth, I know what’s going on, I need to hear it from her), which I recorded, she finally confessed that they hooked up the first time, a month before we got married, as well as several times afterwards.  I informed her that it was over, and then she broke down crying, saying that she doesn’t want to lose me, has nothing without me, doesn’t want to be with anyone else, etc.  I told her no, it’s over, she made her decision last year, and she obviously does not respect me or our marriage.  She said ‘just come lay down with me’ l told her ‘no, you need to go to your parents’ house.  (They live five minutes away.)  You’re not staying here.  I called her sister who headed over to pick her up.  She said she was going to kill herself if I leave her, then went for the closet where our gun is.  I grabbed her and held her back and got to the gun, where I removed the clip, made sure there was no bullet in the chamber, and zipped the clip into a pocket in my pants.  I called the police, about five officers came, and they talked to us separately.  That’s the last time I spoke to her.  The psychological evaluation officer spoke to her, and apparently she agreed to go with them.  I hung out with my friend and my dad the rest of the night, had a few drinks, then passed out.

This morning, I went to Lowe’s to get cardboard boxes.  I called her parents to see if they have any update (not because I want to talk to her or anything, I just don’t want her hurting herself), &amp; they said they’re trying to get her out of the mental hospital, but they can’t do that until the doctor sees them.

I called up the hospital myself, told the lady who I was, who then told me that she’s spoken to a doctor but he hasn’t made an evaluation.  The lady asked if I wanted to speak with her.  I could hear my wife crying in the background.  After about ten seconds I told her about the adultery, and that now is not a good time for me to talk to her.  She asked if I was sure.  I said yes.  She asked if I wanted to relay message for her.  After a moment, I said to tell her that I love her, and I want her to get help.

I’m really just afraid of her hurting herself.  If her parents take her home, I’m confident she’ll try and hurt herself.  I love her, but I 100% can’t be with her after this.  There’s the slimmest chance that, if the doctors diagnose her with bipolar, bpd, etc, and she got help, and maybe decided to give herself to the Lord... but I’m not putting any eggs into that basket, especially at this stage.  I don’t want to talk to her.  I just want to move on.

wittythrowawayhandle,2019-03-29 14:07:31+00:00,She (36/F) broke something I (37/M) built in my free time. I am still sad about this and having trouble moving past it.,"TL;DR at top: got into a huge argument with the wife, went out to do a chore she asked me to do, came back to a project destroyed. Feeling really sad and want to move past it. 

Most nights when my wife comes home, she doesn't even talk to me. She immediately gets on her phone and binge watches yet another series. She's able to live on far less sleep than me, so she can stay up for hours watching Netflix and I only really have 45 minutes or an hour where I'm awake that we can do anything. 

I asked her what she's watching and commented that I wish I could be part of the shows she watches, or just offer occasionally to watch one of her shows with me. This gets into a huge, screaming fight where she tells me that I say she never does anything for me. I just keep trying to reiterate that she lives her whole life around binge watching and I'm ok with her having her own thing, but it'd be nice to be included occasionally.

I had to run out and do a chore that she asked me to do because she was too tired. She called me when I was out and told me she broke something, I couldn't understand her and she wouldn't pick up the phone after she hung up on me. 

In my very limited free time between kids, work, and her, I was trying to build an enclosure for my 3D printer, just to keep the heat in and the draft out. Nothing fancy, frankly it wasn't special, and all I did was the wood framing and I had the panels cut to attach to the sides and to make the door. But it was something I made. She smashed it with a hammer.

I honestly wanted to cry. I know that isn't a manly thing to admit to, but life has been difficult lately. To condense it a little, I am not even remotely successful in my professional life, personal life, or family life, and it's depressing. These little projects are sometimes the only thing that makes me feel like I'm doing something in my life correctly. Even if it's some small, relatively meaningless thing. 

It's the next morning and we're past the apologies at this point, and she ""apologized"" for that, but immediately said it should've been something more valuable like the actual 3D printer or my laptop (something I worked 50+ hours of overtime for weeks to earn), so it doesn't feel like an apology as much as it feels like a threat of future property destruction. 

So honestly I'm really sad about it. I don't really feel angry about it, I just feel really sad. It logically doesn't contribute much to anything especially in the shape it was in, but I worked on it and I was going to work on it. I tried to get her to understand by saying it'd be like if I tore up a page of poetry she wrote, or a short story, or a sewing project, etc - it was something I put my limited amount of time and energy into and it felt good to do it. Now I'm not sure how I'm going to get the motivation to throw it away (it's completely destroyed), much less try to make it again.

To sum it up in a question - is there a trick to feeling better about this sooner? How do I move to the forgiveness part of this? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b6xpg8/she_36f_broke_something_i_37m_built_in_my_free/,relationship_advice,1921,556,0.0
POLLYPACKETs,2019-03-29 11:49:09+00:00,I (19f) dumped and blocked my boyfriend (19m) for his comments about my neighbourhood.,"I don't want anyone having the slightest clue about where I'm from, so I'll be kinda vague.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a very poor hood with a problem with gang-related violence. It wasn't all bad, because there was also a community of people who loved and helped each other. It's home. Now that I'm at a huge university in my city, I've met people from all types of backgrounds. Of those people, is my boyfriend, who is from a well-off family. He's never had to worry about making rent or pretending not to be hungry so your mom doesn't cry when your parents think you're sleeping. But I was taught not to talk about money, so we really never covered that. We really did love each other and he made me feel complete.

In my neighbourhood there is a small ""establishment"" that offers free ""services""/""products"" to kids who get good report cards/GPA. That applies from elementary school and until the end of College. College kids who provide ID also get a crazy discount. Finishing high-school isn't something super common, so it's a great way to reward us. The good-grades thing usually stops after like 6th grade, so it's a great way to encourage kids.  

It's like, in my HOOD hood and hasn't been ""discovered"" yet by any of those people who think relative poverty is trendy. I think they're too scared to come this far out lmao. It's super lowkey.

I took my boyfriend to this restaurant and he was cool the whole time. He never seemed scared or judgemental. When we walked in, I was getting out my school ID. I explained to him the rule and how much it meant to me. He laughed. I asked him what was so funny.

He said ""They shouldn't applaud a fish for swimming"". I asked him to explain what the hell he meant by that.

He says that they're just giving out handouts for people who are doing the bare minimum. That getting good grades and going to school is an expectation, not something super revolutionary. I told him that IS where I live. It's not easy to stay in school, when nobody around you does.

I asked him how many friends of his dropped out, he said none. I have 3, and that's just in my friend group. They were smart kids, but they got caught up in dumb shit. It's really easy to do that in my neighbourhood. My mom goes to a new funeral every week. Some of the kids I grew UP with are in jail right now. My mom STILL hides from me whatever the hell my cousins are up to. He said that giving the kids free stuff for something they don't deserve is like welfare. That there's ""nothing impressive about NOT being a criminal, it's basic requirement for being a part of society"". And that shouldn't get you free shit from a ""ghetto ass 'establishment'"". That this is why people get dependant on welfare.

 At this point I told him I was done. I didn't want to debate, I didn't want to talk him. Not then, not ever again. We just went out separate ways. I broke up with him as soon as I got home.

He thinks it doesn't make sense for us to break up after something so small. That we're not going to be one of those couples that throws away everything over one conversation. I told him, yes the fuck we are. He's been trying to contact me but he's blocked on everything.  I think I may have overreacted with the block, but I want him to leave me alone. I don't want to work it out. 

I hope I made the right call here. All my friends agree with me, but they've lived in the same neighbourhood. So IDK

I'm not saying I have to be with someone who's from my hood. But I have to be with someone who at least gets it. Especially when ""it"" has shaped who I am today. Idk what kind of person I am, but I think I need to be in a relationship with someone who got the struggle.

martian071,2019-03-28 14:09:12+00:00,"I was best friends with a narcissist. She ruined my marriage and just when I thought I was free of her, she turned up in another aspect my life!","Seven years ago I was a happily married woman with 2 kids under the age of 6. I was a stay-at-home mom and my husband worked in corporate IT. I had become best friends with a woman across the street (let’s call her Jackie). Her daughter and my eldest (also a girl) had become best friends as toddlers. Her husband and my husband were friends. The two families did everything together. We hung out on  weekends and went on vacations. I kept Jackie’s daughter after school. Jackie and her husband also worked in the corporate world but for a semi-conductor company. Jackie was the bread winner. Everything was grand. Well in hindsight I now see she was constantly manipulating and controlling me. I had lost my identity in the years after becoming a mom. Staying at home with kids can be very isolating and I craved any adult interaction I could get. Her friendship was so convenient. Anyways, in the summer 2012 my husband and Jackie started meeting for lunches and happy hours. They said that it started out innocent. They said they needed to blow off steam and commiserate about working in the corporate world and being the bread winners. It was such a burden for them. Meanwhile I’m at home with all three of the kids losing my freaking mind. Their meetings eventually turned romantic. By the fall my marriage was falling apart but I chalked his strange demeanor up to his stress at work. He told me there was a huge project due. But he was actually falling in love with Jackie and was wrestling with the guilt and frustration of having an affair. Jackie was still acting like she was my BFF. We still hung out alone and I confided in her as you do with a girl friend. She took anything I said then and in the past and shared it with my husband. She twisted my words and thoughts and manipulated him into thinking I was undeserving of him and a horrible wife. Just after the new year things came to a head. They both asked for divorces but did not confess to their relationship. I didn’t think this was suspicious. I knew she was unhappy with her marriage. I was shocked by my husbands request though. I fought like hell to try save the marriage. We went to counseling. I poured every moment into trying to figure it out. My world was crashing. And Jackie was still playing the part of bff. She would come over and borrow nail polish or take me out for a girls night...all while secretly dating my husband. And my husband and I still had a regular sex life. I did not suspect he was cheating at all. In mid February, they finally confessed. I kicked him out and we began divorce proceedings. By July, the divorce was final. I sold the house and moved to the other side of the city to start my life over again. I cut ties with mutual friends.  In January of 2014 stumbled into my new career, craft beer.  I (nor my husband or Jackie) had not been into craft beer previously. We all drank beer, but this was a new world. I eventually landed a full time job with a brewery by the fall of 2016. (By then I had also met a man that I am marrying this summer, but that’s another story). As I started getting into craft beer I quickly started running into my ex and Jackie. They had taken an interest in craft beer as well. This is where I feel like I’m being stalked. Like she can’t have an original idea. She wants to take anything good in my life and make it hers. She still works in the corporate world but she “blogs” about beer. She shows up to every beer event and she became heavily involved in every beer group for women she could find. That’s all fine, but where I draw the line is one particular group that I want to be more active in. It’s an organization for women who work in the beer industry. There are 3 different ways you can qualify to be a member. One is to work in the beer industry and make at least 25% of your income from beer. Two is to own a brewery or bar. Three is to be enrolled in an accredited school to learn:train for something in the beer industry. Jackie makes six figures at her corporate job. She blogs for free or for minimal compensation. There’s no way it would come close to 25% of her income. And yet, her blogging is what she claims makes her eligible. I’ve tried going to the local and national group leaders. No on understands her ability to lie and manipulate. It just makes me look like a bitter jealous ex out for petty revenge. The truth is that I love my industry. I love this organization. I want to participate because it’s good for my career. It’s just a hobby for her. She feels special being in this exclusive group. But she doesn’t belong. I don’t know what to do. I should point out that since the divorce, I have taken the high road. I have not sought revenge. I’ve cooperated with all custody. I never talk bad about my ex or his new wife (they got married 2 years ago) to my children. Jackie is driving me crazy. My hate and anger towards her is affecting my mental health. I don’t know what to do about this situation. When we have to be at events together, we just ignore one another. That can be awkward when there’s only a handful of women present.  It’s all just so unfair. I’m also conflicted because if she hadn’t destroyed my marriage, I would not have been forced to find my true self again. I would not have met my fiancé, and I would not have a career that I am so passionate about. So, do I just go on ignoring her and be my badass self. Or do I try to get her removed from the group knowing there may be repercussions. Or do I find some clever way to “fuck” with her as payback for being such a shitty human being?

DisruptivePie67,2019-03-28 12:25:29+00:00,"I hosted my (M46) brother (M48) and sister (F51) in law in my house. They were terrible guests, were disrespectful and broke our 1 rule, not to use our toilet. After their daughter clogged my en suite toilet flushing pads I asked them to leave. Now they’ve pitied our family against us and want money","My wife’s sister , her husband and two teenage daughters came over to stay with us for a few weeks while they’re renovating their house.
Our son is away in college so we put my nieces in his room, and my in-laws in the attic which has a big sofa bed in it. There’s no bathroom in the attic or in our son’s room, but there’s a bathroom in the second floor that they can all use.
The problem we had is that none of them liked using the second floor bathroom and would only use my wife’s and I en suite bathroom in our bedroom. We made it very clear from the first day that we have no problem with them staying over but there were some boundaries that had to be respected in order for us to get along and not get on each other’s faces. We told them our bedroom and our bathroom were off limits because that’s our private space.
They ignored this and started using our bathroom. On the very first day I went use my bathroom and saw a shit floating in it. I let it go because I thought it was a mistake. But they kept using our bathroom and mistakes kept happening. We kept finding unflushed poops, unflushed pees and sanitary items inside the toilet. [Gonna spare the details because my post exceeded the character limit]
Apparently this is common for them. It kept going on for a solid week. My wife and I tried to keep the peace at home. We thought we had to be the bigger person and try to work it out so we could all be under the same room without murdering each other. But still, they kept using our toilet and denying it. When confronted they had the nerve to play the victim and say we were making them feel like they were a trouble for us and they’d never disrespect our house rules.
Yesterday one of my nieces calls me over and says something’s up with our toilet that’s clogged and I should fix it. I go over there and see 2 bloody pads clogging the toilet so I told her to pull them out. She started crying and screaming that I was abusing her because I was forcing her to touch something where everybody was doing their business. My in-laws came running when they heard her scream and started saying what the fuck is my problem why can’t I just pay for a plumber to come fix it instead of making their daughter do it herself.
I reached breaking point and told them to get the fuck out, they aren’t fit to live with others, they’re fucking pigs for never flushing their shit and asked if they have a scat fetish and get off in my wife and I having to find their shit in our toilet. They got very offended and we got into a screaming match but I tried to collect myself (I had a stroke last year) and told them to just get the fuck out.
Now the rest of the family is blaming me because they have to pay for a hotel for the 4 of them for at least 1 month until they can move back into their house. So apparently it’s my fault they’re gonna run out of money. Not that any of them is offering them their house though.
Last night I sent my brother in law a text demanding he pays the plumber's bill for unclogging the toilet but he refused saying I kicked them out my house causing them to spend the rest of the little money they had in a hotel plus food for 4 people for at least a month. Not only that be he had the nerve to say I should reimburse him the money he has to spend in a hotel and food now because they didn’t count with having to spend any money while they would have been at our house and this is setting them back a lot.

In no world am I gonna pay him any money when his entire family is the ones who fucked up. Plus they’ve pitied my wife’s side of the family against us (particularly me), I’ve been getting texts from them belittling me and telling me how horrible I am.

I want to take it to a small courts claim out of principle, but maybe it’d be taking it too far? My wife says it's time to go no contact with her family and I support her but I'm afraid she might regret it in the future if she cuts out her whole family. Her family is not very all there but it’s her family. How can we deal with this?


TL;DR Extended family stayed over at our house. Broke our only rule which was not to come into our room and use our en suite toilet. Left their business there for us to see and had the cheek to deny it afterwards. Their daughter clogged my toilet and I lost it. I kicked them out my house and demanded they pay the plumber's bill, which they refuse since because of us now they don't have any money and in return want me to pay their hotel bill.

lil-kid-tit-tat,2019-03-28 06:29:47+00:00,My [22f] boyfriend’s [24m] new tattoo makes me feel like a pedophile,"Hey guys, throwaway account because my boyfriend knows my normal account. 

I don’t really know how to begin so I’m just gonna dive right in. We’ve been together for four years now, living together for 2 and every aspect of our relationship is honestly perfect and I have a sneaking suspicion that he’s planning to propose sometime in the near future. 

Last year however his younger brother who was only 6 years old, passed away. This took a major toll on my bf (obviously), but especially because he was extremely close with his little brother. His parents are major screw ups to put it bluntly, and as a result his little brother spent a lot of time living with us. To the point where we practically became like a mum and dad to him and even discussed filing for custody. 

The problem arises when a few months ago my boyfriend mentioned he wanted to get a tattoo to commemorate his little brother and asked what my thoughts were on this idea. He has no other tattoos and never expressed wanting one before so i was a little surprised but completely supportive. He talked about getting his brother’s name or date of birth or something equally sentimental. Cool, I thought. That all sounds beautiful. 

We didn’t really talk about it again until he told me he had booked a time in with a tattoo artist. It was on a day I was working so I couldn’t go with him and when I asked what he had decided on he said he wanted it to be a surprise. I was really looking forward to seeing it, thinking it was going to be something small and cute.

I did not expect him to come back with an almost life-size headshot of his little brother slapped across the majority of his feckin chest.

It was definitely a shock but I reacted positively and told him it looked really good. It was only the outlines and such at this point and he said he was going to go back and get it filled in...

It’s been a few sessions now and he’s had the whole shebang done to it. Colours, shading, everything to the point where it could be mistaken for a photo now. I can’t deny that it’s a seriously incredible piece of artwork. Bf is super proud of it and I honestly think it’s pretty cool as well. 

My only issue with it is during sex. 

It takes up such a large space on his chest and it’s the only tattoo he’s got. It doesn’t help that he’s pretty pale and doesn’t have much hair so the tattoo REALLY stands out and my attention is constantly drawn to it. 

Not to mention this thing is like the Mona fu*cken Lisa. 

Any position that we’re facing each other in, I always end up making eye contact with it. And every time I do it makes me feel so uncomfortable and absolutely kills the mood for me. Every time. Ignoring the fact that this kid was practically like a son to us, I doubt I would be able to have sex while looking into the eyes of ANY six year old. 

It’s honestly ruining our sex life. 

I haven’t told my bf any of this because I feel like I can’t say anything negative about the tattoo because of its meaning and the fact that it’s permanent. (I know lasers exist but I doubt he’ll ever get rid of it) 

Lately we’ve mainly been having sex in positions where I’m facing away from him, or while we keep our shirts on and he’s started to notice this and has told me he’s worried I’m not attracted to him anymore.

I am attracted to him. I’m just not attracted to the six year old on his chest. 

What can I do in this situation? The thought of telling him this, or anything negative about the tattoo makes me feel like a monster. But looking at it during sex is making me feel like a monster too. 

Should I talk to him? Am I overreacting? Is our sex life officially dead? 

Thanks for any help you guys can give. 

tl;dr- My boyfriend got a massive tattoo of his recently deceased six-year-old brother on his chest and I can’t stop making eye contact with it during sex.

Rayray0099,2019-03-27 23:16:09+00:00,UPDATE #4 - I (42M) Think Wife (40F) Might Be Cheating," [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/95ywup/update\_3\_i\_42m\_think\_wife\_40f\_might\_be\_cheating/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/95ywup/update_3_i_42m_think_wife_40f_might_be_cheating/) 

&amp;#x200B;

Life has been chaotic but I wanted to log back into this throwaway account and give an update on my situation. I had discovered my wife having an affair and also found out that she thought I was stupid, and a loser for not earning a high salary. I filed for divorce and it should be wrapped up next month. We will have 50/50 custody and she will be paying spousal support, since she out-earns me by a large margin. That is the current legal situation. Now on to the other fallout.

&amp;#x200B;

I am heartbroken, as are my kids. I never thought I would be a single dad but here I am. My wife seems to be falling into some kind of depression. The guy she cheated with decided that she wasn't worth the trouble. From what I am told, she has started drinking and going out with a lot of random guys that she meets online. There have been more than a handful of times where she called me and begged me to take her back, so she can have her old life back. Part of me wanted that but I have held strong. After she found out how much money she will have to pay me every month, that seems to have made her angry towards me. So I don't have to worry about her calling. 

&amp;#x200B;

My kids don't understand. Every second they aren't with me, I feel miserable. I am also lonely all the time. I haven't spent much time with friends and mostly just stay home. The girl that works at a coffee shop I frequent even asked me if everything was okay, because I looked sad. I guess am not hiding it as well as I think. There are people I know that want to set me up with women they know but I don't want to do it because I feel like I am branded as the guy whose wife cheated on him. It has been so long, I have no idea how to date. I had a few fighters do really well on a pretty public stage and that has been the only spark I have felt in a long time. I really don't know what I will do next. At some point, I need to snap out of it and move on. I just haven't reached that level of motivation though. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did have somebody I know get into contact with the other guy's wife, and show her the proof I had. I just couldn't live with nothing happening to him. I am not allowed to go after him, so this was the next best thing. She didn't believe it at first, but then I heard about there being major marriage issues for them. As far as I know, they are together but on the rocks. I have a lot of anger over everything. It is crazy to think how life can be fine one minute, then completely upside down the next. 

&amp;#x200B;

One positive that has happened is that I did meet a girl through some friends that I am interested in. I haven't asked her out or anything though. She is stunningly beautiful but is about 14 years my junior. I don't know that's a major issue but that is a pretty big age gap. Given what I have been though, I think my confidence has really been dinged. I feel like she is too attractive for me. She might actually be, I suppose. But I have been thinking about her a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

So that's been the last half-year of my life. I have to say it has been the worst I have ever felt. I have always been a very happy person but just feel dark and gloomy now.

throwawayrunner81,2019-03-27 13:04:49+00:00,"I (37M) started running almost two years ago, wife (43F) has become more and more jealous overtime and it's getting really hard to endure.","I'm tall and lean, but not muscular; near no body hair, wear glasses, definitely not so immensely attractive that my wife should have any cause to worry about having a bunch of women chasing after me. I never had a specific workout routine, but I was always very active (prefer to walk or bike to places instead of taking the car for example) and about two years ago I started running after a conversation with a (female) coworker. I quite got into it, because I find that while I'm running my mind tends to dump all the problems and stress away and I can relax, something that I always had issue with. For a while this was no issue and my wife didn't even pay attention to the activity.

&amp;#x200B;

That changed last year when said coworker had an extra ticket for a 10K because the friend of hers she was supposed to go with sprained her ankle shortly after. I had never run a race, so I accepted. I liked the race a lot (running with a crowd really gives you an extra ""push"" to perform better, and I was actually very surprised that I finished slightly over an hour) so I commented I might start doing races whenever there's one nearby. That's about when trouble started.

&amp;#x200B;

Initially it was subtle, like asking to track my cellphone via GPS while I'm out running ""just in case you have an accident"", to which I didn't think twice about and just permanently enabled Location Sharing on Google Maps. She asked to accompany me to the races, to which I was happy about, but she quickly got bored of having to wait in the car for an hour and stopped doing so. Most of the races I did alone and I was unaware of any issues, until there was another opportunity to race with my coworker and her friend, who had recovered from the sprain. We ran a 10K and had a blast afterwards, taking pictures and posting them on Facebook to celebrate the completion, then I went home.

&amp;#x200B;

She was a complete nervous wreck and in tears. She has been convinced I'm cheating with my coworker, her friend, or some other runner, and made me quite aware of the high ratio of attractive female runners in the races. I was completely unaware that she saw our age difference (she's older) as an issue, and accused me of sleeping around with someone younger.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually she calmed down, but it has really not been the same since. The accusations and guilt-tripping every time I go on a run, just around town and not even a race with anybody, are getting more and more difficult to endure.

&amp;#x200B;

Last month I ran a 21K by myself, and had a 2 hour time, which I was very very happy about. My happiness faded away very quickly when I got home to accusations of cheating, again, because Google Maps had not been able to track me for a portion of the run for whatever reason and just showed me stopped in the same place, so she is convinced that, in the middle of a half marathon, I stopped somewhere, fucked someone, then managed to finish the run under 2 hours anyway. Showing her my Strava tracking with the actual movement during the entire run didn't change her mind.

&amp;#x200B;

I actually haven't run AT ALL since then because of it, and I really miss it. I just don't know how to deal with the situation. Bottom line is that she sees my running as an excuse for cheating and nothing I say will convince her otherwise. And to be perfectly honest, in a way I can't tell her to her face, I think her demands are fucking bullshit and she needs to leave me alone and stop ruining my hobby.

I am very exhausted and haven’t really slept, so I’ll try and give updates as I can. Fortunately, she is safe and protected by people so that she cannot do any type of self harm.

It went really well! Ben came over to hangout .  I told him the truth about how my feelings for him were changing but I didn't pressurize him into anything. I just wanted to let him now how I was feeling. I was a nervous wreck, but I took a chance and it paid off. HE FELT  THE SAME! We talked a lot about what was going to happen next? We've decided to keep this between us for a bit so we can establish ""us"" first. As for Andrew- THE relationship is over. He's moving to the other side of the country (Pittsburgh. We live in LA), and Ben isn't down with long distance. 

We basically talked the whole talk. He spent the night (as he normally does) but this time he was in my bed with me. We didn't sleep all night(noting sexual). We cuddled and talked. I  took another chance when I kissed him but luckily he reciprocated. So that's basically all we did- cuddle, talking and light pecks all night. It took everything in me to not devour him (He was very soft lips). I felt like I was flying. Going to work was really hard. I was missing him so much.

Wow, just wanted to say thanks everyone for the advice.  As expected I received a ton of different opinions, and I thank you all.  However some of them really helped put me in a better state of mind.  Specifically those of you that opened my eyes to the fact that it may have still been abuse despite the texts, and even shared some of your own personal stories that relate to my wife's story.  It helped me approach her in a less accusatory manner.  

&amp;#x200B;

I had a long and productive discussion with my wife last night about the things that I had found and that bothered me.   
 I told her I just wanted the truth, and that I wasn't angry.  She explained that while she was abroad she was partying and drinking pretty heavily, and at the time that F took advantage of her, she didn't fully understand what had happened.  She was in denial after it happened since she never expected a friend to do that.  She was surprised she even sent some of those texts to him, and she said she was likely drunk and trying to convince herself that it was okay.  When F finally left the country a couple days later and she had time to really think about it, she realized that what had happened was wrong.  She had told F to stop but didn't have the strength to physically stop it, she had no choice in the situation.  She also pointed out that once F left, she had stopped talking to him because of this, which was true in the texts.  They went from talking nearly every day to nothing instantly.  There were also some other things she pointed out that line up with the texts to suggest that after it happened, she took some measures to avoid having sex with him again(for example, sharing a bed with someone else when the option to sleep with F was available).

&amp;#x200B;

I know some of you wanted me to talk to F.  But I have no desire to, and I definitely would have a harder time believing anything from him.  There was plenty of texts from F to W lying about me in order to give himself an opportunity with her.  He lied to her saying I was getting back with my ex(who lived 1000 miles from me, and had a boyfriend at the time), and told W countless times she never had a chance with me.  W had told me these things in the past and the texts all back that up.  

&amp;#x200B;

My wife's story is consistent with any other time she has ever told me, and after our discussion I'm sticking by her side.  We discussed our other relationship issues too.  Like I said, we had been struggling recently.  But the past month has actually been better than the previous 6 or so.  Not perfect, but definitely an improvement.  She told me that the main reason for some of her actions and words was simply being pregnant, uncomfortable, and not having anyone besides me to vent her frustrations out to.  She was sorry for how she treated me and is going to work on herself to be better.  She wasn't mad that I looked through her messages, she even said I'm welcome to look.  But she promised she has nothing to hide.  Whether you agree or disagree with me, I married this woman for a reason.  And while we may be in a bit of a difficult time, I believe we are on the right path.

She was such a great person when I met her and I thought we would be great together.

Unfortunately, for the past month, she’s started to insult me for everything. For example, I could not hear a line of what she said over FaceTime because of internet issues and she flipped saying I don’t pay attention to her. Proceeded to call me names or whatnot. Usually, I just took and it moved on. However, today I just snapped and told her to leave me alone. So I proceeded to put my phone on do not disturb and I check my messages 45 minutes later to find 30+ messages that are a mix of anger, sadness. 

I just ignore it because I really did not feel like it.  Then she tells me she’s bleeding into the sink and proceeds to send me a video of her doing so. I honestly think I’m traumatized from those videos, I can’t seem to get them out of my head and I feel responsible for them. I texted her father, however it was late so he’s asleep. Thankfully she’s still alive and I’ve managed to calm her down by apologizing, but I don’t feel right. 

I feel trapped, and very fucking sad. I feel as if I’m a monster and I’m causing her to do these things to herself. I never say anything badly to her, I just want to be left alone and it ends up like this. I apologize for my rant but I don’t know. My emotions are a mix of me feeling responsible, feeling trapped and feeling regretful.

I hope I can get some advice. For some insight, I don’t ever insult her, not even jokingly. She gets annoyed that I don’t give her attention, but I text her and hang out with her as much as I can possibly give, I am human and a student with responsibilities, I can’t spend 24 hours with her.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife(W) and I started dating about 5 years ago and got married 2.5 years ago, and we've had 2 kids since getting married.  We've known each other for over 10 years however, and I always thought she was a trustworthy friend.  She expressed her feelings for me a year before we started dating, but we had both just gotten out of other relationships and needed time to heal.  She then studied abroad for half a year.  When she got back, we hit it off and started dating within a month.  When W and I became ""exclusive"", my best friend(F) ghosted us.  I couldn't figure out why, seeing as how the three of us were all good friends, and had hung out several times since W had gotten back.  I had even talked to F about W and I possibly dating multiple times, which never seemed to bother him, he even encouraged it.  F had a girlfriend of his own at the time anyways.  

&amp;#x200B;

About a month into dating, W tells me a story of something that happened between her and F.  4 months prior, F went to visit one of his friends who was studying in a neighboring country to W.  He also decided to stop and see W for a couple days to see the country she was in.  In W's words, they went to a bar one night and she had way too much to drink.  She woke up in her bed that night to F taking advantage of her.  She pushed him off but he kept on trying over and over.  I hear this and instantly I am livid with F.  He had already been avoiding me for the past month, so I just stopped any attempt at talking to him.  I figured F stopped talking to us/didn't try to explain himself because he was ashamed of what he did.  W said she was confused about the situation and didn't really get angry about it until she had returned from abroad and seen F in person.  I had no reason not to trust W at this time and she seemed very sincere and upset talking about the whole thing.

&amp;#x200B;

That was 5 years ago.  Throughout the years when F comes up in conversation, W always talks about how gross what he did was.  Recently however, W and I have been going through a rough patch in our relationship.  We started to fight a lot, which exclusively is always started by W.  She would complain about things I did(or didn't do) around the house, which would lead to name calling, threats of divorce, and even accusations of lying and even cheating on her(which is not true).  Our sex life went from okay(I'm the HL in the relationship) to a dead bedroom.  She blamed it on hormones(pregnancy/postpartum) but it really was getting extreme.  These things made me suspicious of her.  I thought maybe she's feeling guilty about something.

&amp;#x200B;

So I snooped.  I know its a kind of shitty thing to do, but things have gotten bad and I wanted to know if she was hiding something.  I went on her laptop when she wasn't home, and I found all her iphone backups.  Long story short, nothing incriminating came up since we've been together.  Just texts between girlfriends about kids and whatnot.  That's a relief.  But then I found the texts from before we were dating.  I know she had some experiences when studying abroad, she's told me everything(or so I thought) so I took a peek.  And there they were, the texts between W and F talking about hooking up when they were abroad.  W saying how great the sex was, how F should visit again so they could do it again, and how she felt bad because at the time he had a girlfriend.  Plenty of graphic details that all seem 100% consensual.  

&amp;#x200B;

This honestly crushed me, and not because they hooked up.  But because she's been lying to me for FIVE YEARS about this.  She convinced me that my best friend raped her.  I've even told my family about how much of a scumbag he is, and I erased him from my life entirely.  There were plenty of other lies about her past that I found throughout her phone that just twist the knife even further.  I feel like the last 5 years of my life has been shaped by this series of lies.  Had she told the truth from the start, I probably could have looked past it.  Had I found out the lies the morning of our wedding, I would have called off the wedding.  But here I am, just learning about these things now in an entirely more complicated situation.  I don't even know how to start a conversation about this with her.  I don't even know if I can forgive her.  Whats the best course of action here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b5dgn5/i_27m_just_learned_my_wife_27f_lied_about_her/,relationship_advice,3017,376,0.0
minniee17,2019-03-25 12:45:53+00:00,Boyfriend got very drunk and was brutally honest about our relationship,"My bf and I have been together for over 4 years. When we first dated, we were both in college, but due to financial reasons he had to drop out to support his family. We stayed together long distance until I graduated and moved back home. We have lived together for about 2 years now. 

Life was very rough for him when he dropped out. His parents had hospital bills and he couldn’t make enough to support them so he had to take out loans. He is still paying those loans up to this day, and works 14 hours a day to just make meets end. Because of this, I have lent him money over the years. I was very fortunate in my situation where I went to school debt free and found a job immediately after graduating. I have been paying rent for him in addition to lending him money and he slowly pays me back whenever he can. One thing about our relationship, we have very different personalities. I am very ocd and have a way of doing everything whereas he is very laidback and carefree.

Last night, he got very drunk and as he was throwing up, was very honest with me about our relationship. He told me several things: he feels like he is indebted to me for helping him out in life and that he feels he needs to make me happy whenever he can. Because of this, he will let me have my way, even if it pisses him off. My ocd makes him very stressed out at times and it is making him unhappy. Sometimes it is very difficult to be with me because of my attitude towards doing things. (For example, we moved last week and I wanted everything moved in a day whereas he is a slow mover.) It makes him feel less of a man because he has to borrow money from his girlfriend, and that sometimes he’ll pay me before paying his credit card bills even if he gets hit with the late fee. But he still loves me, not because he is obliged to due to money. 

I am very confused about our relationship right now. He will not remember this when he wakes up, but I don’t know how to approach him with the things he said. I love him very much and want him to be happy as well, even though sometimes our personalities clash. But if it is so difficult to be with me because of our situation, what should I be doing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b5a8w4/boyfriend_got_very_drunk_and_was_brutally_honest/,relationship_advice,13617,891,0.0
temporaryanxiety12,2019-03-25 00:41:01+00:00,UPDATE: Fiance (30f) deleted old conversations after I (32m) found them. What do?,"[Original Post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b47nc2/fiance_30f_deleted_old_conversations_after_i_32m/)

I spent Friday night and Saturday at my parents' house a few towns over.  Thank god for them.  It was emotional, but they support whatever decision I was going to make.

She had tried getting in touch with me Saturday morning, and was texting me throughout the day asking to talk, and writing paragraphs of reasoning and fears etc.  I actually appreciated it, because she hadn't given me anything to process before that.  I simply responded that I was reading the messages and thinking about what she was saying.  She asked for me to come home, and I said I would be on Sunday morning.  

This morning I went back to the house and started shaking almost immediately after I got out of my car.  I didn't want to be there, didn't want to talk to her.  But this is someone that I planned on marrying.  I say to myself how I deserve closure on this relationship, now.  

She didn't want to start the conversation.  We sat down in silence for a few minutes.  I got fed up and asked her if there was anything else she wanted to say to me.  She basically repeated the story she told me through text...  She wasn't active on Tinder now.. she didn't tell me about this instance a year ago because a) nothing ever came of it and b) she was afraid I'd leave her.  She didn't want me to leave now.  She told me how much she loved me and wanted to build a life together.  

I told her that it didn't matter if nothing ever came of it, because she deleted all evidence about it, and her word was the only proof in this situation.  She proved her word wasn't reliable, so I can't come to any logical conclusion to help me get over this.  If she had told me about this when it happened 1 year ago, we would have had a difficult discussion, faced the consequences and things would be different.

But this happened a year ago.  She never told me.  She deleted all the evidence when I found out.  And she shelled up when I asked her about it.  I told her I could not build a life with someone like this.  

She was a mess.  I was very sad to see her like this.  I told her we would talk about how to move forward on our own when she was ready.  I wanted her to know that I care for her.  She really is an amazing person.  But I told her that she blew her chance with me.  I told her that I don't hate her, but one of us is moving out and we are not together anymore.  

She doesn't have anywhere to go right now, so I will stay in the guest room.   I'm probably going to get a new apartment and break my lease here.  I will give her 1-2 weeks to make her decision if she is staying for the 45 days it takes or not.  I'm not particularly fond of this place, but I'll stay if she leaves after 1-2 weeks.  

This is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.  I'm very emotional, but need to keep myself composed because I have a very busy 2 weeks coming up with work that I need to get done.  It will help.  

Thanks again for your support.

eilleen01,2019-03-24 23:02:18+00:00,Boyfriend forced me to get his name tattooed on me. Please help.,"I'm 17 and my boyfriend is 27. We've been together for just over 2 years now. Everything started out amazing. Seriously we were so so so happy. We had been friends online for a while (we both had somewhat ""facebook famous"" accounts) until we realized that we we lived in the same city. We were together all the time, and everything was good. But a while after we started dating his mom got sick in another state, and he had to go stay there to take care of his little sister and his mom. This is when things all started getting odd. First it was small things like him not wanting me to go out late, not wanting me to hang out with lots of people and stuff like that. Then he stopped allowing me to use social media, and made me cut off all my friends. Which I did, because I didn't want to lose him. That was all okay for me at first. Just seemed like he was being protective of me (we have a somewhat ddlg relationship, he thinks of me as something like a daughter, and I look to him as a father) But after a bit, he made me stop talking to my family members for a million different reasons. My family can be very abusive and they're all into hardcore drugs and partying, including my mother, so I can understand why he wouldn't want me around all of that. Then he stopped allowing me to leave the house. When I say ""allow"" I mean he would say if I did whatever he didn't want me to do, he'd leave me. So I always did whatever he wanted. It ended up to me being able to maybe go get groceries, but he sets a timer and makes me take pictures to prove that I'm actually at the store. He also does this thing where he won't let me wear nice clothes. I'm not talking about slutty things, he won't even allow me to wear jeans and a t shirt if the shirt isn't super baggy and goes down to my knees. He says this is because my body and doesn't want guys to hurt me. This is just some of it. If he catches me wearing clothes he doesn't approve of, he flips out and tells me to hurt myself and things. Same goes for if I ever do anything he doesn't like. He decides when I sleep, and for how long, to the point I have to take pills and pills just to sleep. I am not allowed to be awake when he isn't. We bonded over sexual stuff, because one, he understood and went with my need for a ""father/daughter"" style relationship and also bdsm. I am very open to everything and anything, but for about the past six months he's been super into wanting me to send him videos of me with other guys. Sometimes he wants it to be just one guy, sometime he wants me to get dp'd and more. He talks a lot about how much he'd enjoy having a gangbang (sorry for this being detailed). At first this didn't surprise me because we've always been into doing stuff with other girls, but he gets so crazy mad if I am even in the same room of a male stranger. I just don't understand it. On everything he flips back and forth with a snap of the fingers, hot or cold no in between. He used to work but now he won't, all he really does is play his video games for hours and hours. Which is cool I'm happy he has something he likes to do, but he wants me to come live with him (I live in Florida, he lives 10 mins from the border in Texas)  but I have no idea how we will be able to support ourselves. I got a job recently, I actually start tomorrow, but he says I can only work long enough to get a plane ticket to fly out and live with him. But I don't know how we will take care of ourselves if we do that. His mother pays for all of his stuff, but she won't and I don't want her to do that for me. He is also super into the devil. I used to brush it off as like an aesthetic type thing (hes got a massive baphomet tattoo on his chest, and a pentagram on his arm) But I've caught him alone in his room ""talking to the devil or demons"". He always says they're going to kill him and me too. He also forced me to get a tattoo of his name on my ankle. It was done very crappyly by a friend of his, it's a stick and poke. It looks horrible because he held me down to get it done and I kept moving. He just paid his friend more to do it for me being "" so annoying"". I have a massive scar on my thigh from him cutting me while I was tied up (we have blood kinks,but my rule has always been don't go so far it will scar). I thought we were just going to mess around but he ended doing that and saying scars on my body from him are just him marking me as his. Idk. Any time I try to talk to him about it,he gets very angry and mean,which makes me cry. Then he pretty much almost kills me because he hates it if I cry. I don't know what to do. He can be so amazing if he wants to. Makes me feel like the happiest girl in the world. Especially when he treats me like his daughter. He will get me so happy then turns around and goes crazy. There's so much more, but it's all too much to put into a text post. We've been together for so long (2 years is a lot for a 17 year old) I honestly can't tell if I am overreacting and if this is just normal or if I am in a bad place with him. I just wish things would go back to how they were before he had to move. Please help me. I don't know if I should try to save what we have or try to get out. I have literally no one. My parents aren't around, and I like in a house with a bunch of random people in it. But they don't like me anymore because I'm not allowed to speak to anyone but my boyfriend. I am very lost.

We haven’t gone out on a date in months. However, he always wants me to cook for him or if he needs something bring it. He never brought me a Valentine’s Day gift because of his finances but ended up buying two tickets for an event a month later for him and his friend. My breaking point was that this whole week he was sick. Friday I had called around got his medical insurance information because he didn’t know it. Followed him to three urgent care centers that didn’t take his insurance. Then drove to 30 minutes away to go to another center. There were no thank you no anything. It was around 1am when we finally left and I crashed at his place. Yesterday we spoke briefly and he said he was still sick. This morning, I woke up to see him post that he’s at a club partying it on up. He’s near the end of his 20’s and I’m at the beginning of mine. I can’t allow myself to take care of a man child. So I blocked his number from contacting me and deleted him off all social media accounts. It was a long time coming but I’m so proud that I finally did it.

Bootymasssgeuh,2019-03-24 11:49:07+00:00,"[UPDATE] I feel like my white boyfriend is mainly with me for the novelty of being with a ""pretty black girl"" and clout.","We didn't get the chance to see each other all week, but we managed to link on Saturday. I wanted to speak about things in person.

I didn't want to go in all accusatory so I just started to say how I feel (it's a good idea who knew lmao). I talked to him about how hearing his friend stereotype black people, and my boyfriend laughing and agreeing with him made me feel.

How ""Cool black kids"" were a prop for them at their partners. Just a source of entertainment and that upset me. They let them in with the expectation that they'll dance and turn up in a way that'll make the party cooler. There is ALWAYS a moment at these parties always have the black people dancing in a small small circle doing their thing and everyone else surrounds and sc them. It's like a show. I thought it was a coincidence until I knew it was kinda...orchestrated? Black guy walks in and they throw them the aux. Not to mention there were no black guys in the frat or in any of their inner social circles, but they love to have them around to dance for them. I told him that I didn't even want to get into letting ""hot black girls in"" hoping they'll twerk. But I talked about how it felt like that's how he saw me. He listened to me the entire time without jumping in and I've never had someone do that before so I appreciated it.

He spoke and said that because of where he grew up, he was used to tolerating fuckshit. That's just how people talked around him and way worse behind closed doors. But never spoke up or anything and he thought that was cool as long as he wasn't saying it. He sees things differently than I do sometimes, but being with me, he's trying to do better. Also that, choosing who gets into a party and who to hook up with is purely superficial. But you can't be with someone for almost a year just because they have a pretty face. Then we talked about why we were with each other and I won't get into it, but it was really sweet and emotional.

Then we started talking about the ""Drip or drown"" for guys and **""If she's not a nine, she stays outside""** for girls.

We both agreed it was an awful way to talk about people. He was Frats parties are superficial, and so are clubs and they let people in the same way. But the more people want to get in, the higher the standards get. At the end of the day, they can let in whoever in they want. It's their home and they don't have to make it available for everybody if they want to.

His dad was in a frat (his cousins too) and his sister was a sister. It offers a life-long brotherhood, networking and advantages for the field he's pursuing. Plus, they're just fun to be in.

So everything worked out and we're just taking things day by day.

Also people got so mad because I called myself pretty. Women are told to accept compliments all the time, but I do it...it makes me conceited? I'm hella pretty and I know it. Stay mad.

I can't sleep because this is keeping me up. 

The last few months its like a switch has been turned in my head. I'm getting fuzzy memories. I think they are memories at least. However they aren't clear and sort of feel like a dream at times. Part of me really hopes they aren't real. I think all started because my dad has repeatedly brought up my sex life with my husband on multiple occasions over the last few months. In really creepy and weird ways to where I'm fake laughing and trying my hardest to change the subject because my dad and I have never talked about sex. I'm 27 and married, I don't need a sex talk anymore, that ship has sailed. Him bringing it up at all, was just really out of place for our relationship and for some reason made me extreamly uncomfortable.

One memory is where I'm about 7 or 8. I'm home sick from school and in the garage with my dad helping him with stuff. I'm talking about a boy I like at school. My dad asks me if I've ever french kissed anyone. I'm confused and don't even know what that is. To put it lightly, he proceeds to teach me how to french kiss. 

Heres the thing though, I filled in a lot of blanks above. Its like peices are missing from my memory. I don't remember exactly how old I was but I remember, crystal clear, I was home sick because I had a test I didn't study for and faked not feeling well that morning. I also don't remember him kissing me, at all. I remember him asking if I had french kissed anyone pretty clear but after that its like the rest of the memory is gone. But somehow I *know* he taught me how to French kiss after he asked me that. I get a sense of feeling very uncomfortable whenever I get to that part of the memory. 

My sister is the black sheep in our family. She got pregnant in highschool, dropped out, got into drugs pretty bad, and has been in and out of rehab/mental institutions her whole life. Shes 5 years older then me. I tried helping her when I got old enough to get over my childhood mad-ness. My parents drilled it into me after she got pregnant and dropped out that she was the problem. I believed them for so long. Then I got older, got out of my parents house and realized life is not black and white. She wasn't a bad person, she was going through a bad time. I *tried*helping her. But she burned me too many times and eventually her lies and manipulation made me cut her out of my life. 

A few years ago she came out to everyone in my family saying my dad molested her. By this time I hadn't talked to her in years. My dad works a high profile job, an accusation like this would basically ruin his career. She had lied to me my whole young adult life about almost everything that it was easy for me to not believe her. I saw my dad as my hero, there was absolutely no thought in my mind that he could do the things she said he did. 

Until a few months ago. 

Another memory I have now is when I was younger, about 5 or 6, and its sort of like a ""this is how it always was"" kind of memory. Its not of a specific time but its like I'm re remembering something that was really common and happened a lot. My sister and I shared a room and at nap time she was always be in her bed next to mine when I fell asleep, but when I woke up she wouldn't be in the room. Whenever I'd go and find her she'd be dazed and not in a good mood. It makes sense. In her accusations she said he would always wake her up at nap time and they'd go to his bedroom. 

I don't know what to do. I didn't believe her. Part of me still doesn't want to believe her even though I know thats really fucked up. Ive not spoken to her in years. My whole outlook of my dad being my hero is tainted and smashed. I've been ignoring his calls these last few months, avoiding him. 

I ache for my sister. She must have went through something so tramatic and her way of dealing was the drugs. I know abuse can tear people up and cause so much mental illness problems. I feel horrible because I thought her crippling anxiety that caused her to loose every job I got her was her way of getting out of working when in reality it was her way of dealing with the abuse. I feel lucky that my mind somehow blocked it out and I really want the memories to stop because I feel like if they continue I'm going to be just as messed up as she was/is. 

I don't know what to do. Do I call her? Tell her I believe her? Do I apologize? Do I throw open the roof and accuse my dad? Or do I do what I really want to do and ignore all of this like it never happened. I know, fucked up, but I wish it never did. I don't want these memories. I miss my dad. I don't want to ruin his life by accusing him of anything that I'm personally not 100 percent sure of but I also don't want to let my sister continue to suffer and think no one believes her. And, my dad has always been very friendly to kids. Most people think hes just good with kids. But now, I think its because of this. I haven't been home in awhile, but if hes anything like he was when I was there he's making friends with the neighbor kids. If I don't say something am I forcing another kid to be abused? Was it just his own kids he did this to or did he move on to other kids when we grew up and moved out. I can't be sure of course but in the back of my head its like, I know he was too friendly to the kids in our neighborhood in light of my recent memories. It wasn't normal. 

I'm sorry that was so long. I can't tell anyone about this, I'm scared to even tell my husband because I know saying it out loud will make it all true. I know my husband would support me in anything I wanted to do, but telling him seems like this big chore that I keep putting off because I don't even know what I want to do. I'm not sure how to proceed here. I don't even have my sisters number, I don't even know what I would say. What if its too late and she doesn't care that I believe her. I've heard she's doing better and had been in a good place this last year, what if me bringing this up again hurts her progress? Maybe she's gotten past some of it and bringing it up will only hurt her? What if no one believes me like no one believed her? 

I feel like I'm just rambling and going on about what ifs at this point so I'm going to end here. I don't even know if reddit can help me with this. I know I need to see a professional but I'm scared to remember more and I'm scared to talk about this.

feelguud,2019-03-23 20:36:25+00:00,"(UPDATE #2) My husband's [M32] ""sabbatical"" has become pathetic and I [F30] want it to end right now.","Thanks again to all who responded to my prior thread, even if I didn't agree with the characterization of my relationship by many of the commenters. I did take some advice to heart though, including not sharing my husbands issues with my friends.

&amp;#x200B;

My husband continues to sleep in the basement. I asked him a few times to start sleeping in our bed again, he'd say ""maybe"" but never actually do it. We have stopped having sex entirely, but I have heard him watch porn in the basement.

&amp;#x200B;

On the morning of March 1st, we had a horrible argument when I asked for his half of the monthly bills. He e-transfered me about 2/3 what he should have, and when I asked for the rest he exploded. He just kept saying ""fuck off"" louder and louder, over and over as I tried to say that he needed to contribute his fair share. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then he started talking about his depression again. Literally the only time he will up his ""depression"" is when I'm criticizing his shitty life choices. He hasn't even seen a doctor or been diagnosed, yet he uses it like a ""get out of jail free card"" to be totally unproductive and not pay bills.

&amp;#x200B;

So I told him point blank: ""either see a doctor for your depression and start fixing your life, or this marriage is over"". It sounded so harsh but those are honestly the only two options at this point. He made some quip about me paying him alimony if I divorced him (not the first time he's said this) and that was the last we spoke of it.

&amp;#x200B;

We have briefly seen and talked to each other since then, but there's no warthm there anymore. It's like we're roommates. Last week he told me he booked a doctors appointment and I was happy for him, but as far as I can tell he never ended up going (even after I offered to take the day off and drive him to the appointment). I don't think he's left the house in over 2 months. I have stopped cooking him meals so he now subsists on instant noodles he bought off Amazon. 

&amp;#x200B;

I met with a divorce lawyer for the first time earlier this week. He was excellent and gave me a comprehensive rundown of all my options. When I told him about my husband's alimony comments, he laughed and said ""not a chance"". He voluntarily quit his job against my wishes, he has no official diagnosis from a doctor that would preclude him from working... I don't know where he got it in his head that he'd be entitled to alimony from me.

&amp;#x200B;

I am holding on to a shred of hope that my husband will put forth some kind of effort to get better and repair our relationship. I pray every night that he'll do a complete 180 and start being his normal self again. But if nothing changes, I plan to meet with my lawyer again sometime in early April and officially file for divorce.

What are my options?,"This started a few weeks ago out of the blue. I really can’t just walk away from my job because my husband and I have a 2 year old daughter and my husband is a stay at home dad to cover daycare costs right now and for the next couple of years. 

I’ve had this job for three years and my coworker just started a few months ago. He always seemed a little strange to everyone, but nice enough and no big deal. We always invite him out to happy hours and everyone likes him. 

But a few weeks ago I was startled when a minute after I went to the bathroom he followed me in (it is multi stall). I asked what he was doing and he said the men’s was full (this a huge building so there would have to be at least 5 men in the bathroom for it to be full). 

I thought it was weird, but no big deal. But it kept happening. And I’ve noticed he only does it when I go to the bathroom, like every time because I have to pass by his desk. I’m one of only 4 women on our floor as opposed to about 12 men. 

I’ve gone to HR and they told me that they had complaints from other women and spoke to him. He told them that he is gender fluid and sometimes identifies as a woman, sometimes as a man, so there is nothing they can do. 

I’m not transphobic, I’m not a bigot, but I don’t know what to do. He is getting creepier and creepier. Even other people in the office have noticed he is following me to the bathroom. 

The last few times he hasn’t even used it, it just sounds like he stands in the stall until I leave. 

Is there anything I can do? I don’t feel like this is right and I don’t think I should have to leave my job over it. I support my family with this job. I cry when I’m alone because of this. I haven’t even told my husband because I don’t want him to worry.

Right after she told me I went to get tested and thankfully everything came back negative. I feel so bad for leaving her because she was born with the disease so it’s not her fault she has it. When we started seeing each other she started making an effort to take her HIV medication on a regular basis, workout, eat healthy, and even decided to go back to schooI...As someone who still loves her, I want her to continue doing all of those things even without me in her life.

Bootymasssgeuh,2019-03-22 10:14:37+00:00,"I feel like my white boyfriend is mainly with me for the novelty of being with a ""pretty black girl"" and clout. (19all)","I've only ever dated and been interested in black guys. It never crossed my mind that I'd be dating a white boy. I was really hesitant to get into an interracial relationship, because they can be hard in 2019. But you can't help who like. We vibe so hard with each other and have the same sense of humour. He's always there for me, and gets me more than anyone else. I really love him. We've talked a lot about race and he always supports my ""black"" activities (Idk how to explain them).

Last weekend, his frat was throwing a party and there was a very long line of people waiting to get in. Different brothers would stand at the door and decide who does and doesn't get in. Then came my bfs turn.

The entire time he was at the door, I was akekeing with him, cracking jokes and keeping him company. When his brother came to relieve, my boyfriend dapped him up and passed on a message. **""Don't forget. If she's not a nine, she stays outside""**

I wasn't going to make a big deal out of it in public, so I let it slide.

When we were inside I asked him and our friend what's up with the 9 quote and they said it's how they decide if a girl gets in or not. For guys it's just based on fashion/how he's dressed and if he acts weird.  They always look at his shoes, it needs to be""Drip or drown"" for guys. For girls, it's her overall appearance, her attractiveness and if she asked weird. I asked them if guys are let in based on their attractiveness and our friend said ""pause, that's gay"".

I told them that everything about that was whack and I expected more from those two. They jumped to defend themselves. My boyfriend said he's not superficial, but he can't control what the house wants. He can't let people in who aren't wanted, even if it's mean.

Then started talking about how they always let black guys in, whether they go there or not. Apparently they always make the party cooler and more fun. Then his friend was talking about how hot black girls always let it in, because they make the party cooler and more too. Because we can all dance, ""get lit"", and have the best music and shit. I was silent, just so I observe how my boyfriend was responding to these comments. He was laughing and agreeing with them.

They were being crazy superficial and stereotyping black people. I've had my fair share of white girl groups trying to recruit me as their ""crazy black friend"" who can crack jokes and teach them how to twerk. So this bothered me in more ways than one. 

I feel like a novelty at this point. I don't feel like he's with me for me. I feel like he's with me because I look good on his arm. I'm pretty and black, so I get him clout. That's all. I think about all the cute posts we have on social media. My friends and I always found it cute that he alway's showing me off. Now I'm wondering if I'm a trophy. When he posts me he gets crazy retweets and more likes on ig.

He has no problem getting gorgeous girls, I know that. But being the ""cool, pretty black girl"" gives him more clout because 

I tried bringing it up to to him like the next morning and he dismissed me before I could even finish expressing myself. He said ""How I pick a girlfriend isn't the same as picking who gets into a party"". I didn't even bring it up because we had midterms to study for and I didn't want to be distracted. I put this behind me so I could focus on studying

So I finished my last midterm.

How do I approach this? Is it wrong to bring up something I technically moved on from. Some of my friends are telling me to break up with him and others are telling me not to throw away a good thing over something so small. Especially if we love each other.

CandiedDayz,2019-03-22 05:02:38+00:00,Is my friend being inappropriate with my boyfriend?,"Best friend (23f) says she’s just friends with my boyfriend (24m) and I’m being crazy/jealous about their friendship. I think I’m justified in telling her to back off because she’s crossing lines. 

Context:
We both met him at a party a few summers ago and he and I started dating soon after. She’s never made any indication she was romantically interested in him and encouraged the two of us from the beginning. She’s also been obsessed with her on again, off again boy for years and no other guy has really caught her interest. 

She and my BF text a lot. They’re really close, but it’s never been an issue before.  She asks him for advice on her man, and he gives her a dude perspective on it. But then stuff got weird. She started joking about how if I don’t hurry up and “lock him down” she will because he’s such a great guy. She’s said it around him before and he just shrugs it off but I find it uncomfortable. She tells me I’m too sensitive and have no sense of humor, and that the only man she’s interested in is her dude. 

Then she started texting us whenever she knew we were together, with all of her drama, asking for advice like the world is ending. So we both stop and respond. 

Then she started inviting herself on dates with us. (“Oh, I’ve been dying to see that movie / try that restaurant / do that thing”). The three of us hang out ALL the time, but she’s suddenly super needy and not letting my bf and I be a couple. For his part, he’s oblivious. He thinks we get plenty of alone time since we live together. 

THEN she invited him on this backpacking trip she and her brother are taking across Europe. I was not invited. I only even found out because my BF mentioned he’d need to take off two weeks to do half of it with them (they’re doing a full month). He only has two weeks of vacation time as a new hire so he can’t do her trip and the trip to Florida we were planning. He asked if I would be okay with that, and if I would want to go with them instead of Florida, but I’m not big on the whole backpacking experience, especially the hiking parts. I’m so hurt that he’s even considering her trip over ours. And when I asked her why I wasn’t invited, she told me I could come, but I wasn’t going to be able to keep up with their itinerary (I have an old knee injury from soccer that kind of kills my hiking abilities and means i walk slow as hell after a while because it hurts like a b*tch). 

Am I being a jerk? Is their relationship normal and I’m just being paranoid? At this point I’m just waiting to hear that her brother suddenly can’t go, and it’ll be just the two of them... I’ve told him how I feel about her, but he thinks it’s just her personality to be needy. I can tell he’s frustrated that I’m upset, but he’s also frustrated because he feels like he has to choose between us.

Ben_Levis,2019-03-21 20:16:07+00:00,My GF of 5 years (27F) broke her phone and I (32M) lent her my backup phone. All her photos were saved to my Google Photos account. That’s how I found out she cheated on me with common friends. Please wake me up.,"One year ago I quit my job and moved to Canada to be closer to my GF and find a job. We were apart for 4 months before I came and as you would expect, long distance relationships are hard. We managed to make it through. At least that’s what I thought. I was happy to be back with her but I couldn’t help thinking something was off. The sex was almost non-existent despite being very attracted to each other. I always thought that it would get better with time but she told me she had a low sex-drive since she got her new birth control (switch from a ring to IUD). She only seemed aroused and flirty when inebriated. We had crazy parties followed by amazing sex but that’s pretty much it. No sober sex. 

I noticed she was very close to some of our common friends, which is absolutely fine with me. I encourage her to have male friends. 

Two weeks ago, she damaged her phone beyond repair so I lent her an old one. She put her SIM and micro sd card in it and without us knowing it started saving all her pics to my Google Photos account. As you may know, Google Photos can automatically create Albums and push a notification when it has been created.

This is how I found out she had sex sessions when I wasn’t in Canada but also when I was there passed out in the room next door. The Cherry on the cake? It was with our common friends. I am devastated. I haven’t confronted her/them. I feel like such a creep for looking at her photos on my phone. I feel betrayed by her but also by my friends. I talked about it with other people (Canadians) and they seem to agree on this: “It’s not that bad if it’s only oral sex, as long as she doesn’t have feelings for them, they were probably wasted”. I must have lived under a rock if that’s something accepted nowadays...

I am now about to leave the country because my Tourist Visa is expiring soon and no company is willing to sponsor me for a work permit. She’s convinced that if we get married, it will be easier for me to stay in the country. Why would you want to get married if you know you're unfaithful. It's certainly not for the money, I'm struggling after being unemployed for a year. I told her I will come back again on a Tourist Visa (if they let me in a third time…) and start the paperwork for Permanent Residency. I don’t know what to do anymore. I really don’t. I love my life here with her but knowing these secrets I don’t think I can do it anymore. None of it was part of a mutual agreement. I wish I was more jealous. I wish I was less naive. I could have seen it earlier maybe.

wifeneedshelp123,2019-03-21 04:10:27+00:00,HAPPY UPDATE: It has been 7 months since we learned that my wife (34F) can’t have kids and she still has not “gotten over” it. I (35M) am seriously considering a divorce.,"Hi all. First off, I want to apologize for not responding to every single post reply or PM. I am genuinely touched by the sheer amount of support I received and I spent quite a few hours crying my eyes out as I read your messages and well wishes.

The night after I wrote my original post, I wrote my wife a short letter (thank you /u/Witchy_Woman420 for the idea) that went something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

“Dear \[Wife’s name\],

I love you more than you can imagine and the most I want in this world is for you to be happy. I understand that as a man I probably have no idea how intense the pain that you are feeling is. I’m doing my best to help you but the fact that you won’t help yourself is taking a toll on our marriage. I honestly cannot continue living like this for much longer and our marriage is in jeopardy if you don’t make an effort to get better. However, I want to get over this bump together and start working in the right direction together. I’m ready to talk whenever you are.

With all my love,

\[My name\]”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I put the letter on top of her laptop and went to bed. The next morning (March 16th), I woke up a bit earlier than usual to fix her a double helping of her favorite breakfast: blueberry pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, and fresh squeezed OJ. When I walked into the bedroom with her food, I saw her reading my letter. When she saw me, she put the letter down, got out of bed, threw herself into my arms, and started crying. Full on, Niagara Falls level crying. I hugged her tighter, told her “I love you so, so, much”, and started crying too. I honestly don’t know how long we stood there hugging each other and crying. It could’ve been 10 minutes, it could’ve been an hour, I didn’t care. When she stopped crying, she promised me that she would go to therapy. Reddit, you guys don’t know how thrilled and proud I was when I heard those words. She then asked me if we could go on a trip to Japan because in her words “I really need to leave this fucking house for once and get some fresh air.”

I was so fucking proud of her when she took the initiative in planning our trip. She’s always been a methodical, organized person and as she booked the flights and hotels I saw in her eyes the same spark that made fall in love with her 8 years ago. We just finished packing for the trip and she fell asleep with the faintest of smiles on her face not too long ago. We have a 5AM Uber to catch, a trip to enjoy, and both therapy and dog-shopping sessions lined up when we return. 

We’re not quite out of the tunnel yet, but we can see the light at the end.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b3m2gk/happy_update_it_has_been_7_months_since_we/,relationship_advice,57215,2076,0.0
MelMo426,2019-03-20 20:51:00+00:00,Why would a man leave his wife and child to pursue a relationship with his dead brother's ex-girlfriend?,"My brother in law was very sick and died about a month and a half ago. My husband came out to see him before he died, and I (and our infant daughter) flew out to support my husband the day of his death. The first couple of days were good. I took care of the baby and tried to be supportive of him and his family. On the day of the memorial service, we got into a stupid argument, and he banned me from attending the service. Afterwards, he got very drunk and ended up in the hospital (possible suicidal ideation and blackout). Angry over the situation, his family kicked me out, and my baby and I had to stay in a hotel, alone, until my flight back. While I was home and figuring out how to reconcile with my husband, he was becoming romantically involved with his dead brother's ex-girlfriend, the same woman who was flirting with him because he ""looks like his brother"" and had told his brother on his deathbed that she loved him. When my husband returned home a few days later, he announced he wanted a divorce and immediately proceeded on the process. That week I discovered he was indicating that he loves this woman, he is seeking a long distance romantic relationship with her right now, and is considering moving back to be with her and his parents.

babynoonwraith,2019-03-19 20:48:39+00:00,UPDATE: I (20F) found explicit child pornography on my boyfriend’s (27M) phone.,"It’s been a long night. Thank you all for staying patient. Also this will be an immensely long post, so buckle in.

First off I just want to say thank you for the massive outpouring of support and love. I’m still trying to work through all of your PM’s because I’d like to respond personally to each of you who were kind enough to send me loving words of support. I have been pretty overwhelmed by the amount of people who have commented and through reading every last one of your thoughts. I never imagined this post would gain nearly this level of traction and visibility and it’s my hope that if I can provide some description of the course of legal action taken and what advice I used from Reddit users, other unfortunate partners who stumble upon CP and find this thread (at least in Canada) will have some idea of what recourse they can take.

I also want to state that for anybody who doubts the validity of my claims, I understand. This is an absolutely fucking insane sequence of events and as much as I wish I had the energy to make something like this up for some arbitrary Karma, I don’t. To provide proof I have sent photographs of identifications and the related arrest paperwork to mods and have worked with them to verify all of what I have written.

Yesterday I was picked up by my best friend Alex around 2:30. We drove around and talked for a while. I went to school, discovered it was closed (my scatterbrain completely forgot about spring break) and then we went back to his house to discuss all of the comments you had been leaving and come up with a course of action. We drank, talked and after a few hours took a short break from staring at my phone to play some apex. 

Alex dropped me back off at my house around 930. David was home, in my room, and immediately I noticed how he was exceptionally quiet and distant. He said he had to admit something to me. I prepared for him to admit to possessing CP but instead he told me about how he had taken some photos of me sleeping; he felt really embarrassed about it but he just didn’t know how to bring it up. I feigned surprise and asked him if he had anything else on his phone he wanted to admit to me. He  said no. I asked him to look me in the eyes and tell me that, and he did. I don’t know why I was hoping so badly that he would be honest with me about the CP but I really thought he’d admit to it then and there. Instead he admitted he had been feeling suicidal the last few months but didn’t think he would act on it. He asked me if that changed my perception of him and I said no. He grew quiet again and I left to go shower. When I came back he was getting changed and said he was going to walk for a bit and grab some food. It was about 1030 at this point. When he left, I finally lost it and broke down. I grabbed my cat and hugged him and cried and cried and cried. I was so tired and wanted to shut my brain off so badly. 

I grabbed my phone and dialed the non emergency RCMP line for my city. Shaking and crying I explained to the lady on the phone that I had discovered CP on my boyfriend’s phone. She put me through to the report line and I spoke to another Constable who told me I would be contacted by another officer who would provide more details. I waited for around 10 minutes. The officer advised me that he would need me to come in and provide a recorded audio/video statement. I asked if I could do it over the phone and he said no, it must be done in person so that if this goes to court, Crown Counsel has clear evidence that I was not coerced into stating what I witnessed. I don’t have my full licence yet and because of the late time I wasn’t able to make it down there on my own via transit so the cons table said he would come pick me up, asked me if David was there and if I could safely leave without arousing suspicion. Luckily David knows about my close family-like relationship with my best friend, so I made up a lie about how my best friend got in a fight with his dad and he wanted to talk to me about it. David didn’t seem to question it and I waited for the officer to arrive. 

He called me from a blocked number and I walked outside and down the block to his SUV. The constable and another officer greeted me,  I got into the front seat and we drove to the station. During the ride I asked him about whether seizing the phone on my own was a good idea. He explained that I had done everything correctly; laying low and getting my thoughts together to take it to police without notifying David. He said if I had taken David’s phone on my own that it would not have been admissible as evidence in court; they would have returned it back to him and he could have deleted all the evidence since suspicion had been roused. It was about 11:15 at this point. They placed me in an interview room and I sat and waiting for about twenty minutes. The officer came back in and explained the process of the interview, that it would take some time and to be as thorough as possible with my answers. He said we could take breaks and brought me some water.

 He started off by asking me details about my life, where I grew up, past employment etc. After that portion he asked me about David, what our relationship was like, whether he was nice and kind to me and anything else I knew about him. I told him he was sweet, that he had been nothing short of lovely in the time we’d been together but I did express that things had been moving very quickly. He agreed. He then got me to explain how I came upon the photos in question, so I did. Then came the worst part. He asked me to go through, one at a time, the photos I explicitly remembered details of seeing and to describe it in very, very graphic detail. ie positions of the children, their ethnicity, any identifying characteristics such as clothing, circumcision etc. It was intense but by some grace of God I was able to keep my composure and not burst into tears (mental/emotional exhaustion was fully setting in and I was almost thankful for not having energy to bawl) and provide a clear statement to the officer. He asked me if I would testify in court and I said I would. The officer left a few times during the interview to discuss with his supervisor more questions to ask during the interview and the legalities of the seizure they would attempt. The full interview took around three hours including all the sitting and waiting.

After I had been sitting for what felt like an eternity the officer came in and explained that they felt my interview provided enough reasonable cause to seize his phone and place him under arrest. They explained how the process would go and whether I wanted a no contact agreement.  I said yes initially but the officer asked me if it would be easier to not have one in regards to sorting out his belongings. That made sense to me so I chose not to move forward with the no contact agreement. 

We got in the constable’s car and drove down to my house with 2 other officers in 2 different vehicles, 3 in total. I told them I was more comfortable in a squad car than standing outside (I didn’t want to face him) so they moved me to the back of the cop car. I’ve never felt so anxious in my life. I asked them to be mindful of my cats and not let them get outside; they promised they would make sure of that. About 15 minutes later I saw them bringing David out in handcuffs. My heart which had been dissolving in my stomach’s acid all day felt completely gone. I curled up in the fetal position in the back of the squad car and waited to be told I could go back inside. After another eternity (my phone had died by this point but I know it was well past 330) they came back and explained he was under arrest but being released with promise to appear in court at a later date. I was told by the officer I could go back in, and that they would help him find his way back to the place he had been staying previously. The officer gave me a victim services card and a hug and instructed me to snuggle my cats tightly, that I did a brave thing and to be well. 

I went back into my house, put Planet Earth on for background noise and called my other best friend Paige who had been keeping up with me about this since I sent her my reddit post. We were talking for almost 45 minutes when my door burst open. It was David. He was frantic, his eyes were wild and he was hyperventilating. My jaw dropped; officers said they would be escorting him back to his prior residence and I was not at all mentally prepared to see him again. Paige asked me if everything was okay and I told her David had walked through the door, I would call her back. Immediately David came to the bed where I was sitting, dropped to his knees and sobbed violently. He said he didn’t know I would be here, he just came to grab a couple more of his belongings. He asked me what the cops had asked myself or told me. I lied and said that they said they had only told me they had suspicions of possession of child pornography. He sobbed more and loudly said “That isn’t me, that isn’t me, this isn’t who I am” and cried more and more. His body was wracked with sobs and he apologized over and over again. It was immensely difficult to witness and I wish I could have told him to get the fuck out but I just sat there immobilized, in shock. It was well close to 5 in the morning and I hadn’t slept or eaten much in nearly 48 hours at this point so my body and brain felt like they were essentially non-functioning. 

David began and said that this had been something he struggled with after developing an intense porn addiction in his early 20s. I asked him if he had ever been abused sexually and he said no. He said he knew how horrible it was to seek these images out, but had no inclination or desire to ever touch any children, he had never acted on these thoughts and never would. I asked him why he had never sought treatment before, and he admitted that he was terrified of what people would think, he had no idea what resources to access and he felt ashamed. He said his previous suicide attempts in years prior were directly linked to the fact that he considered himself a pedophile. I nodded. I asked him if they would find anything on his phone that would incriminate him and he said yes, they were going to. He admitted they were very explicit photos and I asked how he even found them; I don’t recall we ever got to that. He promised me he didn’t use my internet to access it but I don’t really believe that. He apologized to me more times than I could count and asked if I hated him. I told him I wasn’t sure that I felt hatred for him but I was sure of being beyond disappointed in his actions; I told him how terribly I felt betrayed and hurt and violated. I expressed my sadness in what he had done, the innocence of these exploited children, how he had so much potential to do so much good in the world and how disappointed this was the route he chose.  

Then I heard a loud knock on the door and lights outside my windows. Three officers were outside, two of whom I recognized from earlier and they asked me if David was here. I said he was, and they said they were coming to perform a wellness check because Paige had called in. I realized I had completely forgotten to text her back and let her know I was okay, bless her heart. The officers took David outside and they each asked him if they had any cause to worry about his actions tonight and he promised them they did not. I told them I was okay; that I would finish my discussion with him and if I had any issues I had them on speed dial. They nodded and left. 

David sobbed and sobbed for what felt like a millennium and I just sat and well, endured it. Tears just ran and ran and ran from him. He said he knew what he was saying was cliche; that he was sure I expected to hear this great big apology. He said if I thought he was being manipulative he could understand but assured me he was at his rock bottom and wanted me to know how horrible he felt about not only what he’d done, but what I had to go through. I just nodded. There was silence for a long time, I think by this point it was around 8 or 830 in the morning. I don’t know how long I stared at my TV screen that said “Are you still watching: Planet Earth?” but it could have been a lifetime. I had no concept of time or what to do or say or what was the right way to feel. I think David was either silent or had fallen asleep against my bed. I didn’t know or care, I was just numb. I would have probably sat like that until I died but two of my four cats descended on my bed and meowed for food. I got up, fed my little critters and cats and came back to my bed. My brain wasn’t capable of thought so I stared at my tv screen until I passed out sometime around 9. 

I didn’t sleep for long because when I woke up and checked my phone it said 11:30. David was awake and crying still. When he realized I was awake he sat up and looked at me immensely pained. I just stared at him. He started apologizing and apologizing more. He expressed his life was over, he had nobody and nothing and that I was his greatest light in life, how he never wanted to lose me. He expressed how much he cared about me and how he would do anything to win my affections back; to get me to give him a second chance. I shook my head and he sobbed, sobbed, sobbed,  apologizing non-stop. At this point I finally asked him to leave. I told him I needed space to sort out my emotions, and I needed to get some sleep.  I asked him if he would be okay. He nodded and grabbed his things. He said he would get out of my life and not contact me if that’s what I wanted him to do. I said nothing. He expressed how much he loved me and again how sorry he was, and that if there was every any chance of anything happening between us ever again that he would be there. He said I love you about ten million times and grabbed his bag and stepped out of my door.

I’ve been laying in bed since then and writing this. I just want this to be over. I just want to move on and figure out how to sort the mess that remains. Also I think I forgot to add that his court date is set for June. As far as sentencing, if he’s found guilty of possession of child pornography I believe he could be sentenced to 18 months max and a minimum sentence of 90 days.  I will post updates again if I feel  they are important; otherwise I will update again in June when he has been sentenced and let you know what charges are laid.

Thank you all again for your support, kindness, and love. I have never in my life experienced such an outpouring of generosity and compassion and I would have been so lost without some of your advice. I’ll continue working on replying to your PM’s, but in the meantime I think I’m going to try and finally get some god damned sleep.

TLDR: Filed a secondary report over the phone, provided a audio/video interview to police and they arrested David and seized his phone. He signed a promise to appear in court in June. He awaits sentencing.

IWillFindUinRealLife,2019-03-18 23:53:25+00:00,"My girlfriend (24f) and I (25m) were on the brink of breakup. Several months later, were back and better than ever! *encouraging post*","Hey everyone. So... far too often on this sub I see people desperate to fix their relationship. More often than not, people will encourage the OPs to leave their relationships. 

This was my experience as well. I posted here several months ago from my other account and I was encouraged to just give up and move on. I didn’t and I thought I’d share my story for those of you who are currently in the situation I was in.

To clarify, there was no abuse, cheating, etc. if that is your situation, please do not use my story to hold on hope. Abuse is NEVER okay. Okay now back to bizz.

Background: 

My Girlfriend and I have been together for nearly 6 years. About a year ago, we moved to a new city. The stress of the upcoming move had slowly began to eat away at our relationship. The months leading up to our move, it was apparent that our relationship was in trouble. Nonetheless, we decided to go forward with our move, hoping it would be a fresh start and a new beginning for us. 

Wow. What a great thought that was. Nothing at all went to plan once we arrived. Yes, we both got jobs and the financial stress disappeared but our relationship was going off the rails. It was as if we both began to blame eachother for everything bad that would happen and we both became very resentful towards eachother. It’s as if we were mirrors that would just project and amplify our growing emotional distance and blame back and forth. 

One day, it was too much. She was actually the first to say it. She said that she had been thinking about breaking up. I knew it was true but it still hurt all the same. I felt similar but I wasn’t ready to give up yet, although when she said that I was ready to accept it. 

5 years of our lives spent together. 4.5 of which were very happy and loving. My heart ached like I can’t explain. Anyway.. this conversation happened after a night out. We had shared a bottle of wine and we’re both emotional so we decided that we shouldn’t make any final decisions in that state of mind. 

The morning came and we decided to address the situation. We still felt the same. There were tears and right before we were about call it quits I said something along the lines of “stop! I hate that we are here but I still love you”. She reciprocated but our flicker of hope was almost gone.

I got her an airbnb for 2 weeks. In this time we did not talk, no communication at all. I was worried that this was the dumbest idea I’ve ever had. The weeks were rough. Very rough. So many thoughts going through my head. 

The two weeks ended and she came home. I had never been so happy to see her. This surprised me, before she left I almost couldn’t stand to see her. 

We talked for hours and we had the most honest conversation I think we’ve ever had. We both talked about the situation, how we felt and why we both felt that way. It became pretty clear that we were neglecting eachother emotionally in different ways. 

Since then, things have gotten better. At first it took a lot of effort to look myself in the face and accept responsibility for my part in it. Every day, I did my best to make her feel loved, thought about, cared for, something that I had stopped doing so much after years of being together. She did the same with the issues that I raised.

Today, we are so healthy and our relationship is almost effortless. I’m honestly happier that we were before when things were good. Probably tmi but even our sex life is through the roof. It’s been about 8 month since we almost broke up and each day brings its own challenges but we’re now taking our relationship in stride as a team. 

If you are in a rough spot in your relationship, consider taking some time apart. Consider being honest with your partner and with yourself. Own your mistakes and try to improve. 

TL;DR- gf and I almost broke up and we figured out how to make it work. I hope that if you’re in that situation, you can too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b2q13d/my_girlfriend_24f_and_i_25m_were_on_the_brink_of/,relationship_advice,1595,113,0.0
babynoonwraith,2019-03-18 20:18:07+00:00,"I (20F) found explicit child pornography on my boyfriend’s (27M) phone. I am sick, devastated and don’t know what to do.","First time poster so I apologize if this is rambly. To preface: I started dating David (not real name obv) at the beginning of February.  Only a few weeks after getting out of a 5 year relationship? I was nervous about getting into another one but we clicked so well. I fell hard and he did too. Things had been wonderful, and we were even considering moving in together at the end of the month (all 4 roommates moved out and I can’t afford the place by myself). He and I have also casually spoke about not ever wanting children and I have never seen him behave oddly around kids in the short time I’ve known him, so I didn’t really see any red flags there. Everything seemed to indicate he had a great head on his shoulders, and we spend almost all of our time together. 

Last week I came into my room after making us some dinner and he was obviously masturbating; he quickly shut his phone off and I played it off like I had no idea what he was doing. Fast forward to two days ago, I was curious as to why he would try and hide it from me (I don’t care if he watches porn) and curiosity got the better of me. So when his phone was unlocked and he left it on my bed, I quickly peeked through his search history. There was tons of porn - all the time - all conventional websites and mostly “teen”. I didn’t think much of that (though it does kind of gross me out) and kept scrolling and then I saw some search terms that made my heart drop into my stomach. “pedophile pictures” “pedophile pics” etc had been entered around 5 times. 

I quickly put his phone away and panicked a bit, I had no idea what to think but my intuition told me there was more to find. I couldn’t imagine someone just randomly getting the urge to look it up; I know enough to know these fetishes develop over a lifetime. So last night I peeked through his photos on his iPhone and was traumatized. There were photos of me taken asleep, of my breasts, close ups of my genitals and even photos he had taken while I’d fallen asleep on his chest and he had put my hands down his pants. I felt weirded out and a bit violated by these photos but it got so much infinitely worse. 

A bit further up in his photos I discovered around two dozen photos and gifs of young children (youngest was probably 5 or 6) engaging in sexually explicit positions, exposing their privates and even adults engaging in sex with small girls in a couple of gifs. They all appeared to be downloaded off of the internet. I was numb, i was angry, I was devastated, I couldn’t think and I was so disturbed at what I was witnessing. I have never seen CP in my life and I can’t get these horrible images out of my head. I scrolled pretty far up and didn’t really see anything else of children like that but there were definitely lots of photos of girls who would definitely fall into the “petite teen” category. 

I guess I’m just posting here because I have no idea what else to do. I don’t know how to confront him and I know I must separate from him immediately but I’m terrified of involving police; our local police are not very useful and I don’t want to get in trouble. He must have accessed these photos using my home internet.  He practically already lives here as well, and was going to help me finance a new lease somewhere else. Not that that gives me any desire to stay with him but financially I am fucked by this. 


Please help Reddit, I feel so lost.

throwawayaf12,2019-03-18 18:16:23+00:00,UPDATE: My [40/f] Husband's [44/m] Family Is Force Our Daughter [18/f] Into Family Marriage,"Just a recap, I married an immigrant Middle Eastern husband.  He's totally Americanized, came when he was a baby.  We have a daughter.  Only family he has in America are his parents.  Everyone else immigrated to other countries or still in the Middle East.

----

Thanks for all the replies!  I read them all over trust me I did, but it was too much to reply to.  

I let my husband know how I feel and he agreed.  His extended family is coming at the start of May and my daughter is going with my parents to ""see colleges down south"".  The truth is she is going to our local community college for two years to get her associates and then we promised we will pay for any school she gets into for her bachelors.  

We have about $60,000 saved up for her over the almost two decades of having her and we let her know that this can either be used as a down payment on a house when she settles down or she can eat into it for college after she finishes community college.  My husband behooved her to get scholarships or go to a state school so she'll always have that little nest to buy a house.

As for the extended family, apparently the boys can't stop talking about my daughter with their friends and family.  My daughter blocked them and just told them she isn't using social media as much.  My husband also talked to his cousin's parents (so I guess his aunt/uncle?) and was pretty clear that our daughter is not interested nor would she ever be.  She has a long future ahead of her that is her's to make.  He told me they tried to play it off that they were just joking and their sons are just joking but he was stressing it will never happened.

At least that is what it sounded like on the phone as I don't speak Arabic but this is what my husband said.  I have no reason to doubt him...and half of it was in English. 

The fallout with his parents and family is yet to be seen, if any.  I am still worried the boys might try to stalk her but my husband doesn't seem worried.  He told me ""brown people aren't used to white american girls talking to them"" so he said the boys feel like they have a chance as she's family and potentially ""open"".  Didn't really know how to reply to that but he again assured me not to worry.  Our daughter doesn't give off the emotion that she's worried and neither does my husband, but there's still that gnawing feeling in my gut so I'll stay alert when they do stop by in summer.  The three of us might end up taking a vacation to my parents then so who knows.

I would like to thank everyone again for the advise.  I hope nothing else comes up months or years down the line.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b2m2ki/update_my_40f_husbands_44m_family_is_force_our/,relationship_advice,3369,226,0.0

So here's an update... I have read all the responses to my previous topic but did not find time to respond and reply to each and every one of them individually. The common thought seems to be that I need to ""man up"" and ""take responsibility of my life"" and many have adviced me to ""kick out my wife"" or seek legal council and start gathering evidence. 

Financially speaking as a young father of soon to be three kids, I cannot just call up a lawyer like that. We are not Americans and we are not in America either so I do not know which laws do and do not apply to our situation. The guy she had her emotional affair with, however, is in the States but they lost contact and my wife claims she does not know his last name or exact location, only his first name. Some have suggested she was the one being catfished but she says no, because she actually had videocalls with the guy and he looked like the images he had previously sent her.

My wife admitted a lot of things to me in our talk... for example, she's a singer-songwriter, or rather, she tries to be one. She has written a lot of songs, passionate, romantic and sweet loving songs over the last half year. I was touched by them before, thought they were about me. Turns out they weren't. Turns out they were about *that guy*. This devastated me. 

The whole affair, my wife said, ""inspired her"". She told me about how hard-working the guy is. How he is going to a top university, how clever and bright he is, blablabla. She said she considers me lazy, not ambitious enough. That I am good with the kids and all that, a decent provider, but that I am not really someone she sees as being ""capable of greatness"". She likes the fact that I look good and our kids look good, and that I have a lot of focus on their well-being. But she ""needs a life partner, not just a babysitter"". This infuriated me because when I take care of my fucking kids, I am NOT just a babysitter, I am their father and I am caring for them because I love them and I am responsible for them.

She admitted she often thinks of ""going back to her own country"" and living with her parents (my in-laws are quite well-to-do and my MIL has a lot of time on her hands to help out) - my wife is not originally from the same country as me. My wife said she'd take the kids... follow her dreams in the city she studied in which she things will give her a better chance at success. She also regrets having married me in the first place. She says that she wouldn't have married me if she knew at the time ""how lazy I was"".

For the record, I am not lazy. I work night shift three nights a week, also work during days several other days. On the evenings I am home I manage to cook at least twice a week. I do groceries, pick the kids up from school, make them sleep too regularly. I handle the kids on evenings I am free to allow my wife to go to classes to develop herself. She is pregnant and I massage her at times for up to 90 minutes so her back and legs won't be too painful. I'm a fucking HERO to that woman and she does not realize it. Instead she compares me to some other guy she's never even met in person and somehow, I don't quite measure up because I didn't go to a top school, I'm not rich, I'm less ambitious and this makes me lazy and useless. 

So now I'm looking at my options. I'm 27 years old. I am in decent shape and I am not a bad looking guy. I'm a good father. I'm a good provider. I'm a good son and a loyal friend. I've been a good husband, too, but apparently I'm not good enough. Well, guess what, neither is she... she's far from sufficient. She's far from ""good enough"". But I never say even one percent of the hateful and negative shit she tells me. Never. 

I've told her all this. I have told her how I feel. I told her that I do not feel respected. That I feel like shit, treated like shit, tossed aside like shit. That I will not continue to support her and her dreams if this is what she wants to do. I also told her that she is not going to take the kids anywhere... that if she wants to leave, she can leave, but she will do it by herself. She is not a citizen yet of my country and I reminded her of the fact... whereas our kids are. I have taken hold of our kids' passports and now hold them with me as I write this, I am not letting go of them. If she wants to leave she can but it will just be her and the unborn baby leaving and she won't bring any of my stuff with her.

That laptop she has been using to chat to the guy, it's now with me too. I bought her that fucking laptop, I'm taking it back. I'm taking back control of my life. I am still considering what further steps I will take but whatever she has planned I'm not about to lay down and take it. 

Since telling me all this, and her hearing my response, all of us as a family have attended a family event. My wife pretended to be fine. She has stopped saying negative things to me. She's not on her phone any more. I distrust her. But even though I have told her where the door is, she has not left the house either. I think she is backing down a bit by now.

nhj163,2019-03-17 06:23:27+00:00,I just found found out my husband (32m) cheated on me (27f) at his bachelor party,"We are newlyweds been married less than a month. We lived together for 3 years before we got married and we dated for 4 years before he proposed. I've never had trust issues with him before, we even did long distance for a year when he had to travel for work and it worked out great. For his bachelor party half of his groomsmen were also engaged so they had a big blowout bachelor party trip in mexico. I was weary of letting him  go because I know his single friends party hard, they travel just to party with hookers and strippers on yachts. I've heard all their wild party stories. But he assured me there's no way anything will happen because there was only 2 single guys on the trip and none of his friends have ever cheated before. I'm not an insecure person because I'm confident young and attractive so i let him go. Even though there would have been a lot of temptation to cheat I trusted him. When he came back from his trip I asked him if anything happened, he said no everyone behaved, especially him! I asked his best man if he had anything to tell me before we tied the knot and he said my fiancée adores me and would never cheat on me. We got married as planned. Fast forward to today, a month after we got married. He left his phone on the couch where we were sitting, he left the room to take a shower. His phone is lighting up with texts from his best friend. Talking about the bachelor party. They wanted to go back to the same country that the bachelor party was at for his friend's birthday and were talking about a girl. I know his phone password so i opened up his phone and read ALL the text messages with his friend. Basically his scumbag best friend was bragging to my fiancée that he covered for him so well there's no way I'll ever find out about him cheating before our wedding. My fiancée thanked him and said that the bachelors need to go over their stories so that they all match. I found videos of my husbands friends cheating getting oral from hookers on a yacht. I found photos of my husband kissing a girl on his lap in a bikini which i'm guessing is the one of the prostitutes he was using on his trip. Basically every single guy on the trip had sex with prostitutes which means now not only is my marriage affected but I don't know if it's my responsibility to break 3 women's hearts whose husbands or fiancées were also on the bachelor trip. The things I found is going to break up the homes of all his closest friends and I don't even know if I should tell them or not. I screenshotted everything and sent it to myself. 

I don't know what to do because I don't want our marriage to end over this. Honestly I was willing to instantly forgive him if he owned up and apologized immediately after he came home. But the fact that he lied upsets me more than the cheating, is that weird? I don't know if he feels any guilt. I am especially seeking advice from people who stayed in a relationship after discovering infidelity. Is it possible to heal something like this or are we doomed for divorce? This is the first time I've ever been cheated on ever and I don't why I feel like I should be angry but i'm not - is there something wrong with me?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b22chk/i_just_found_found_out_my_husband_32m_cheated_on/,relationship_advice,4489,940,0.0
thrownitawaystdy,2019-03-16 15:36:36+00:00,Should I (48m) tell my wife (44f) that I received a sex tape of her in the mail?,"Throwaway.

This is an odd thing. Wife and I have been married 20 years. I’ve never suspected her of cheating and our sex life has been outstanding.

First of the year, I receive a package in the mail. It’s a DVD addressed to me, and a typed note that says “your eyes only”. It’s my wife having sex , separately, with three guys. She was younger, much younger, based on body and appearance and hair style it was around the time we were going out—either before, during, or after we were engaged (she grew her hair longer for the wedding and kept it that way).

First I’ve no idea who sent it to me other than one of those three guys in the DVD - none of which I know. I’m assuming it’s one of my wife’s ex. Second I’ve know idea why they sent it. Are they trying to say she was screwing around on me? The tape isn’t time stamped so I don’t have a frame of reference. She kept her hair short for years until we were engaged so it could have been during a block of time, certainly before we dated. 

And also what are they trying to achieve if this was taken before we dated? I know my wife had other partners. Hell I had three times the partners she did before we married but that was 20 years ago I think we’re past that. But apparently this person or persons isn’t.

The whole thing is strange. I’m not sure what’s going on. I haven’t told my wife, I’m not sure how she would take it. She’s very sexual and adventurous but I don’t think she’d like the idea of her past catching up to her. But I don’t think I’ll get to the bottom of this unless I tell her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b1tpdw/should_i_48m_tell_my_wife_44f_that_i_received_a/,relationship_advice,30455,7251,0.0

I dont think there is a need for me to see her again next week. So here’s what happened. 

-She texted me she got home and about to sleep at 11:44 PM (she’s closing deals in another city and has to rent a place)

-I tried to facetime her 11:51 PM just to say goodnight, she didn’t pick up. I tried messaging her but no response. 

Remember that spare phone that’s with me where her google account is logged in? I browsed on her activity history quickly to find out what shes up to, and was surprised there’s a “google assistant” command recorded at 11:48 PM.

I played and listened. There’s her voice and a voice of another guy. They were goofing around at the google home device. So yeah. 

I confronted her and barraged her with a lot of messages, she only replied at around 1 AM.  She kept on denying she’s cheating.

Then I laid all the evidences, all the screencaps and even the audio clip recording from the google assistant. 

She finally admitted. 

I am single.

Openitup9000,2019-03-15 03:01:10+00:00,Girlfriend [31F] wanted an open relationship. I [34M] reluctantly agreed. She freaked out now that I am sleeping with other women.,"About 4 months ago my girlfriend of 6 years brought up having an open relationship. At first I said no and was incredibly angry that she would even ask that of me. The thought of my girlfriend sleeping with other guys made me livid, so did the idea that she felt I wasn't giving her what she needs. 

After a few days she brought it up again and I reluctantly agreed to the arrangement. I decided to go ahead with it because I wanted her to be happy and not end up cheating behind my back. I do love her and realize that relationships consist of compromises and finding middle grounds.

I told her we could have an open relationship, but I don't want her telling me about other guys or where she is going when she does it. That she just needs to play it safe because I don't want any STDs. 

Anyhow, about a month into the new arrangement I realized she was meeting up with some guy for sex. I was pissed at first, but decided to start taking advantage of my new found freedom as well. There is no point in me sulking and being angry.

I started getting on dating apps and talking to new women and going out on dates. I, too, started sleeping with other women. I currently have 3 FWBs that I see fairly regularly. 

Anyhow, one of the FWBs likes sending me a bunch of nude selfies. She also likes taking videos of us having sex and sometimes sends me the videos. 

My girlfriend snooped my phone earlier and went ballistic. She asked me how many women am I seeing and why I am participating in sex videos. After yelling at me for a while she has been stuck in the bedroom sobbing and doesn't want to be around me. 

I am puzzled and really not sure what to do or even why she reacted the way she did considering she proposed this type of relationship. I am not sure how to proceed or even what to say to her. 

Tldr:

Girlfriend wanted open relationship

I reluctantly agreed

Girlfriend slept with at least one guy

I now have several FWBs

Girlfriend snooped my phone. Saw sexually explicit stuff

Girlfriend went ballistic and then started crying hysterically

Not sure how to console her or understand why she reacted like that

wifeneedshelp123,2019-03-15 02:19:58+00:00,It has been 7 months since we learned that my wife (34F) can’t have kids and she still has not “gotten over” it. I (35M) am seriously considering a divorce.,"Title may seem harsh so I apologize. Also using a throwaway because my friends know my real account.

Bit of background info about my wife: She’s an only child and had a rather lonely childhood. So to her, having kids and watching them grow up together is an important issue for her, if not the single most important issue.

To make a long story short, 7 months ago we learned that my wife is incapable of having children. Of course both of us were devastated and she ended up leaving her job. For the first month after learning this terrible news, all she did was cry and watch Netflix in bed. I brought her meals in bed, started working from home, and gave her my full support because it was the least I could do.

But now it’s 7 months later and she’s still crying and watching Netflix in bed all day. I ask her every day if she needs anything but all I get in response is variations on either “leave me alone” or “some peace and quiet”. Virtually the only times she gets out of bed are when she fixes herself some snacks, uses the bathroom, or takes a shower. I do all the cooking, cleaning, and laundry. I’ve suggested many things to help her recover, including but not limited to:

1. Therapy. She said that all therapists spew BS back at you.

2. Adoption or using a surrogate. She shot down both saying that it just didn’t feel right to her.

3. Moving to her parents’ city. She said moving 100 miles was too much stress.

4. Buying a corgi puppy (corgis are her favorite). She snapped at me saying that a puppy is no substitute for a real human child. 

5. Taking her on a weeklong trip to anywhere she chooses. Again, she said that’s too much stress.

Earlier tonight I had a talk with my wife. I told her that our relationship is just not sustainable if she continues to act this way and that she needs help. She said that she’s fine and called me an asshole for suggesting that she get help. 

Don’t get me wrong, I love my wife with all my heart. I’m doing my best to help her, but she is refusing that help and in total denial. I know that she'll be devastated if we get a divorce but honestly I cannot bear living like this for much longer.

So my post didn't get much notice but I know everyone here loves an update.

He left the night before the wedding, I hugged him good bye and put the last shreds of trust I had in him. 

The day of the wedding (it started at 3pm) he didn't call in the morning, he didn't call at lunch, he didn't call in the evening. He sent a text at 11pm saying he was ""finally done now"" with his day. I spent the day in a lot of anxiety. And it hurt a lot that my bf of 2.5 years couldn't take 3 min out to call me, especially when he knew how I felt that day. 

It felt like a light switch was flipped. I just didn't love him anymore. I broke up with him. I didn't cry that day and I haven't cried a day since. I feel good. I think the break up was a long time in coming and that last day was just a staw. And with a little distance I can see how wrong for eachother we were. And I can admit now that the relationship was probably dead a long time ago (9 months to be exact) I'm just glad it over. I haven't felt this happy in 2 years.

whatnamesarenttaken3,2019-03-14 20:00:06+00:00,Was I wrong to ask my roommate to not put up furry art in the common area?,"I live with two women, we’re all in our mid-late 20s. One of my roommates, let’s call her Zee, is a **very** proud furry. I have nothing against furries. I find the whole concept strange but ultimately it harms no one; who am I to judge for someone being different? I’m glad she’s not ashamed of herself and I applaud that she loves who she is.

When I moved in, there was very little artwork or an overall design theme. In the half year since, it now looks mid-century modern. Both of my roommates love how it looks, and i do too. Zee decorated the bathroom. She chose a Disney theme, and it actually looks pretty nice (it’s not cartoonish or childish and it flows together nicely).

Anyway, Zee said she wants to put up some art of hers that she bought. That’s fine. Then I saw what she wanted to put up. It’s furry art. It isn’t pornographic, but the art looks...you ever come across fan art on DeviantArt? Yeah. It looks like that. Imagine the Sonic “nothing personell” art style. I’m not exaggerating, it’s really that bad looking.

I’m throwing a big birthday party in a couple weeks and I’m mortified that the only thing people will talk about is the shitty furry art. I told her I’m just not comfortable with furry art in the common area. I told her that I don’t want a monopoly on the decor of the apartment, and that if I had put up anything that makes her uncomfortable, tell me and I’ll take it down, no questions asked. I would never want someone to come home to decor that made them feel uncomfortable.

Her response? “If my art isn’t welcome in the common area, then I’m not welcome in the common area.” And “it’s only two posters!” And “This feel like a personal attack.” From what I can tell, being a furry is most of her personality. I told her it’s not a personal attack, she is welcome in the common area, I want her to feel welcome, and I explained that it’s just a matter of different tastes and that I would never expect her to just be comfortable with just anything that I put up in the common area and I would hope that I can expect the same from her. Then she said “just forget it” and stopped responding.

Am I the asshole for not wanting furry artwork on the living room walls? I have a bunch of pride stuff that I only hang in my room because that’s my private room, so it’s not like I’m asking her to not do something that I am doing myself. It’s legit because the artwork is TERRIBLE.

ipreferhavingmydick,2019-03-14 16:52:23+00:00,[UPDATE] Trying to make my [M29] fiancé [27F] (somewhat) with me not fighting cancer that will mean losing my penis,"Original Post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b0qxle/trying_to_make_my29m_fianc%C3%A9_27f_somewhat_okay/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app

So rather than respond to hundreds of comments I thought I’d respond to most of the more prevalent ideas, questions, and suggestions and provide an update to my situation.

First off I talked a lot more with my fiancé. At first I told her that my mind was no longer set in stone and that I would try but I would need her to be open and honest with me through everything and not say things to just make me feel better throughout everything. I had a second opinion today and I asked her to come with me and she did and the oncologist said externally my penis matches my initial doctor’s findings but that he was going to give me a battery of tests and see what could be done to preserve my sense of self and as much penis as possible if at all possible which he stressed would be none if my original doctor’s findings were correct.

I broke down in the car and begged her for her forgiveness that my initial instinct was to just die. I told her that knowing that even if I stay alive knowing I hurt her in such a deep way by wanting to die over living as a man without a penis would hurt me just as much as losing my member. I just want her to not feel different about me. That’s pretty much what this is all about. I don’t want her to pity me or stay in an unhappy relationship over leaving me just because I am what I’m going to become.

  I showed her what everyone was saying to me on here and how most agreed with her and she just burst into tears that so many people could speak to me the way they did. I told her if she wants me to I will have the procedure and she said she doesn’t want me to live if I don’t want to. I told her I wanted to see everything she becomes even if I fall apart. She promised to take care of me and that nothing had to change as long as I was committed to her, the relationship, and living. I told her I was more afraid of wanting to get over it and not being able to so I drive her away.

A lot of people are acting like this is not a big deal. One DM I got told me that she having to read what I wrote was harder for her than me having to lose my penis. I realize going to the internet for advice was probably a mistake after that. Another girl said if I was worried about sexual urges after losing my penis I should lose my testicles too and they were 100% serious. Others advised sex change. I don’t think they realize how deeply hurting they were although it may have been on purpose.

The future

I’m taking it as a process and telling her everything. I am deeply ashamed of how I felt even though I really still feel that I don’t want to live like that. I do want her to be happy though and if that means living as a life I don’t want so she never has to deal with the pain of being alone. I want to ask her to elope so we can have the wedding night I initially planned but I don’t know if that’s fair to ask given how much she knows I’m in pain and might feel pressured to get married even if she doesn’t want to. I would still have a big wedding later if she wanted. 

We will be seeking couple’s therapy and individual therapy. I have an appointment tomorrow due to the emergency of my situation I was able to get in quickly. 

I am very afraid. Afraid of the loss. Afraid of how it will change my relationship and sense of self.

To most of the most common responses 

&amp;amp;gt;it’s no big deal/just chop it off

I am very insecure about this and how it will effect me.  All the things you don’t even think about will have a deeply wounding impact on me. I will lose intercourse with the woman who means the world to me, I won’t be able to pee standing up, I will be afraid to watch comedy movies because 90% have a dick joke somewhere either about small dicks or no dicks and it will make me cry, I’m not going to watch the last season of game of thrones because of the various characters who don’t have penises and will probably cry and it doesn’t feel right asking her not to watch and I know everytime one of those characters show up she will think about me, I am constantly aware of my penis and will constantly be aware of it’s absence, I won’t be able to go the gym or use a locker room, I won’t be able to hang out with guy friends talking about their sexual exploits, every guy who hits on my fiancé (which is a lot and I’ve always taken it in stride) will make feel inferior and afraid to stick up for myself,  I will not be the person I am now. I will be constantly paranoid about people finding out and constantly paranoid about not being enough for my fiancé or that my mental and emotional problems during my recovery would drive her away. Dying seemed better than her leaving me. Yes she’s perfect but I am not.

&amp;amp;gt; you’re being selfish

I am. 100%. I never denied that in my post. Now that I’ve changed my mind or at least am more open to it I feel like maybe I can live for her and when and if she’s done with me I can still live for her so she doesn’t have to have my death on her conscious.

&amp;amp;gt; you can always kill your self later

No I can’t. I won’t do that to her.

&amp;amp;gt; use your mouth, finger, toys etc

Yeah I know that but it’s not the same and it will never be again.

&amp;gt; get therapy

We and I are both getting therapy and I think she is too.

&amp;gt; you don’t deserve her

I know that and I’ll feel even worse about that after this. I will feel guilty forever that I told her I was going to die instead of try for her.

&amp;amp;gt; get prostate massages to orgasm don’t be afraid to stick things up your butt etc

I’m not afraid of that, if she had ever wanted that we’d be doing it already because I want her to be happy

&amp;gt; get a phalloplasty

I will be dealing with a lot of medical bills and this seems like it will be considered an elective procedure and potentially not covered.

&amp;gt; get a plaster dildo made from your dick

Yeah, the reminder would probably hurt.

&amp;gt; she loves you and that’s more important than anything

Yes I know that. I’m afraid she won’t anymore after I change physically and emotionally. I’m also afraid she’ll be disgusted by my appearance. I know I should take her at her word but I’m going to deal with major emotional issues for a very long time and I’m not even sure it’s fair to ask her to go through that with me.

&gt; no one has to know/it’s not a big deal if someone knows

I was bullied so bad as a kid my mom had to pull me out of school. I thought I was over that but this feeling over not being part of the herd because of my disability is bringing all of that back. I feel like a total outcast who will be not a full man and not worthy of a woman. I would not be able to handle a single joke or comment, I couldn’t handle the idea of people talking about me behind my back joking about me. I have discussed my fear and paranoia with my fiancé and she’s promised to be honest with me but also not share with anyone unless I ever do feel able to share.

&gt; what about your family and friends

My family and I haven’t been close since I went to college 11 years ago. We are not on bad terms but it’s a see you at Christmas sort of deal. I don’t know I want to have friends anymore.

In closing

I am in more pain now than when I thought I accepted death but I want her to know how special she is. I’m very afraid that I may have wounded our relationship too much by wanting to die. The responses I got hurt me a lot but some were very helpful even though they were against my initial thoughts but were empathic. I just want to be the person I am now because I know she loves that person. I know that is not an option but I don’t know she will love the new me. The thought of her with someone else after me and him being able to please her in a way I can’t hurts a lot more than I can handle and knowing that we probably would’ve had the perfect life before my diagnosis makes it hurt even more. I will do this for her because she deserves everything I can give her and more but I don’t know if that will be enough. 

I love you Megan if you read this. Please forgive me. Nothing in life means more to me than you. I want to spend my life with you whatever that means in whatever way I can.

This girl is a great and stable (first for me) and attractive and smart human being. I really like her and the friend who introduced us said the second I left her sight, she texted my friend about how hot I am which is a good sign. 

The thing is, I used to be able to draw back in like, 11th grade. She paints full canvases. I listen to music (but like really hard rock) sometimes I guess. She writes music, sings, and plays the piano. She’s an accounting major when I’m in graphic design but only just started so all I can really show her is a super low effort picture I took so I could keep up with the class. 

This girl is incredibly intimidating to me. She knows all these “show-off-able” skills and tricks and they’re really really cool and the best thing I can do is make fun of the shot-types used in Taken 3 and play video games. I have no idea how I can compare much less impress this girl and keep her interested. 

Note: we haven’t even hung out 1 on 1 but there’s obvious chemistry. Not enough to obscure the worries behind this post but we can hold an engaging conversation (neither of us have really talked about ourselves yet so idk if that even counts.)

Recently, he's taken to saying he grew up in the ""ghetto"" with blacks and mexicans. He's taken me to the area that he grew up in and called ghetto (north Phoenix), and to me, it seems like a perfectly nice neighborhood in comparison to where I grew up (south Chicago). He's also called the neighborhood we are living in now (in Phoenix) ghetto, too, even though it just seems like middle class apartments to me.

He uses his ""ghetto upbringing"" as a justification for saying ""n-gga"" with his friends as well as other things which he attributes to ""ghetto culture"", which bothers me. He's also made anti-Mexican jokes with his Hispanic friends, too. Now, neither of us are black, although we're both minorities (he's half white/half Vietnamese, I am Latina). 

I feel like he's just trying to claim an upbringing he didn't have to justify behaviors he knows he shouldn't do, and I don't know how to talk some sense in to him because he just laughs whenever I try to talk to him about it.

Fishyfishie,2019-03-13 21:49:53+00:00,Update- My (28f) boyfriend (32m) promised me a fish tank for my birthday. He got me sea monkeys.,"So I got next to no replies, but I'm still seething so I'm going to go ahead and vent here. 

I legitimately thought it was a joke. A bad one, but I seriously thought he couldn't be that fucking dense. Well.

I talked to him. He didn't want to get me a tank because it would cost more money than the sea monkeys and he'd spent all his cash on weed. He didn't want to charge something full price from the store  to his card, and didn't have cash for a used tank from Craigslist. He thought I'd buy that it was a compromise, apparently. 

I'm already moved back in with my mother. I literally linked him nice used tanks for $50. He didn't have a spare $50 to get me something nice because he fucking bought weed instead. 

I bought myself a 46 gallon bowfront that I'm going to fill with all sorts of cool fish and he can go suck a dick. I'm done. 

Tl;Dr he bought me a $8 child's toy instead of the modest tank I'd asked for because he wasted his money on weed again. I moved out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b0rvlp/update_my_28f_boyfriend_32m_promised_me_a_fish/,relationship_advice,2007,273,0.0
ipreferhavingmydick,2019-03-13 20:31:15+00:00,Trying to make my[29M] fiancé [27F] (somewhat) okay that I don’t want to fight cancer that will make me lose my penis,"Yesterday I got some pretty shitty news that I have penis cancer (penile carcinoma) after going in for an examination of discoloration/hard lump of skin on my penis last week. I got more tests and my doctor essentially told me that it’s stage 3 bordering on stage 4 and the only solution is total removal of my penis including the internal part of the member (called a radical penectomy- I learned a new word.). I would have to have my urethra rerouted so I peed through an incision in my pereneum. I’d still have my testicles. 

After a long talk about emotional support and what life would be like he was trying to schedule surgery and I told him that I had to think about it. He told me it was going to spread and I was going to die and I still told him I had to think about it. I asked if radiation or chemo could work and he said it was too advanced but could buy me a little time. He was trying to explain to me the gravity of the situation and I essentially said“ I get it I’m choosing between having a dick for a short while and dying or living to old age without my dick.” He tried to tell me that by the end my dick would be non functional and may turn into a deformed mass of cancerous tumors and I’d be peeing through a catheter in my abdomen.I know he was just trying to scare me into doing what he considered the right thing but I feel like this is better. My thought process is that while they may awful I wouldn’t have to deal with it very long as opposed to 50ish years without a penis. Before I even left I had my mind made up as I cried in the parking lot.

The hard part and the part where I may be very selfish is I had to break the news to my fiancé (I’d still marry her if that’s what she wants but I doubt it’ll happen now) which I put off for a couple days to not upset her and also explain myself properly.

 I considered lying and saying It was already terminal to spare her and I any conflict in the rest of my time with her but I didn’t want to live that lie when I wanted to spend so much time with her before I go or have her somehow find out later and look back on me differently. I felt I owed her the truth because I do love her very much and was planning on marrying her, so I told her that was going to let myself die instead of living without my penis. 

She knew about the tests and stuff but she didn’t know what the possibilities were because even discussing them made me feel uncomfortable and I didn’t want to worry her if it turned out to be nothing. I told her there was something I needed to tell her and that it wasn’t good news. I told her about the cancer and that I was not going to live like that. 

She didn’t say anything for a minute. She asked me if my dick meant more than being with her (this was not a passive aggressive or manipulation tactic she was legitimately asking) I told her that I loved her more than my dick but that I couldn’t see her body every day and get these urges I couldn’t at all act on (we have sex almost every night), I couldn’t deal with constant insecurity of not feeling like a real man or that I couldn’t please her and I couldn’t deal with anyone knowing. She said that there was other types of sex besides PIV and that we could make it work. I told her that I would not be the same person if i went through with it and she would feel stuck with me being depressed and angry but because she was the one that convinced me to live and I would likely never be able to find someone again she would stay in an unhappy marriage just so I wasn’t alone. She said that she wouldn’t feel stuck she’d take care of me for as long as I needed it and then we would just be a normal couple.I told her that I wouldn’t be able to function as a human being and she would either never vent to anyone ever about how I’m not the same or completely violate my trust by telling any person what was wrong with me that caused me to act like that. I couldn’t deal with anyone else knowing,  I couldn’t deal with being “the guy with no dick”. She said she’d never tell a soul and we could get individual and couples counseling for any psychological issues I would understandably have. I said no and that I would not live my life constantly feeling the loss but I did offer to seek therapy with her as long as it wasn’t about convincing me to change my mind. She said that she knew she couldn’t understand what it’d be like to be a guy without a penis but she felt that life was better than death. I said I wanted my full life and not one with a huge chunk missing. She told me I was stronger than I thought and we would have each other. I asked if she really wanted me to live a life where I’d rather be dead. She said “no, but how do you know you wouldn’t be able to adjust?” I told her that not being able to have real intercourse with her, having her see me deformed and me constantly worrying that she didn’t think of me as a real man or thought less of me, living with the fear that at some point I would piss her off so much she would use it as part of an insult, or that she would miss PIV sex and try to find someone else. To be clear she has never done anything at all to justify these fears, but I can’t deal with the fear of it. I said I would lose all self respect and would never feel like I could stick up for myself because I would feel so far beneath everyone as less of a man and unworthy of women. I can’t deal with the idea that she might tell someone and swear them to secrecy and then I’m talking to this person the whole time they’re thinking about how I don’t have a penis.

She told me she loved me that she would be gentle, kind and understanding, would always be faithful and would never make fun of me and that she planned to spend the rest of her life with me. I told her that I loved her that I hoped she would stay until the end but I would understand if she wanted to leave because I was making a selfish decision. She then went back and forth between being angry and then remembering I have cancer and trying to comfort me. I told her that I was sorry but my decision wouldn’t be changed. I also asked she not tell anyone about this especially my family who she is close with. I know I gave her the news and asked her to carry the burden by herself but I don’t want more people to try to talk me out of it and I don’t want people to know in general. 

She cried the rest of the day and kept coming up with hypotheticals like advancements in medical procedures to replace it one day and other ways I could feel “whole”. I told her that I loved her and I didn’t want to hurt her but I also didn’t want to hurt me. She was in our bedroom and I thought I should give her space so I got ready to sleep on the couch but she came and asked me to come to bed. We cuddled and she said we could always have this form of intimacy but I pointed out that my penis against her butt was making me aroused and that I couldn’t deal with never feeling that again. We then just sort of cried for a couple hours. Neither of us slept last night but I still feel the same today. She tried to talk to me more and how she was looking up ways I could still orgasm and testimonials of people who had gone through with it and were happy being alive. I pointed out these were all guys in their 60’s and up and I’m not even 30 yet. We both took the day off but i am treating it like a normal day off instead of whatever she wants me to be doing (either acquiescing or grieving I think) and so when I went to binge watch netflix she said I’m not taking my life seriously. I told her I do take my life seriously but I take the quality of my life just as serious if not more so. I also told her that me not taking almost anything seriously was one of the reasons she fell for me, I thought I was lightening the mood but she just got mad.

She asked what if I get to the point of no return and then regret not having saved my own life. I told her that just because I was choosing to die didn’t mean I wasn’t scared of it and that being overwhelmed I may make wishes about what I could have or should have done but right now while I’m of sound mind this is what I want.

She kept looking at me like she’s going to say something and then didn’t and I tell her that she can voice any feelings she has but instead she just says “I love you” or something when I know that’s not what she’s thinking. I told her I can quit work and we can blow through my savings on some trip or something but she basically said how she’d have responsibilities after I was gone and couldn’t. It’s almost 8 and she hasn’t asked me to come to the bedroom so I think I’m on the couch although she could just expect to go in when I’m ready. 

I just feel so torn because I know can’t expect her to be okay with this but I want her to be. I am having the thought that maybe we should end our relationship so she doesn’t have to force herself thought this. I don’t want to go through this alone but I’m not the one who’s going to have to deal with this through old age and she will. I love her and I want whatever is going to be best for her without having to live without my penis. Anything else I would be fine with as long as it was in her best interest.

I know that this situation will traumatize her but I think she’ll move on. I don’t think I could move on and I don’t want to try and feel stuck in a life I don’t want at all.

I just wish I could show her how much I cared without having to live with such a big part of my life missing. I am ready to go down with the ship but I want her to know how special she is and was to me. She is the one, she’s perfect for me and I wish I could stay for her but I know psychologically it will be too damaging and that she will likely suffer with my unhappiness for decades. I can’t stiff upper lip it and live a life entirely for her which is what i’d be doing if I did change my mind. I know that might sound selfish.

I believe she wants me to live because she thinks it’s what’s best for me not because she is being selfish in trying to keep me around. She has not tried to make it “aren’t I worth it?” Sort of guilt trip because she knows that’s not fair. We have always argued well. We haven’t had sex since I told her which is usually daily unless one of us is sick which I guess technically I am. If she decides she can’t handle me choosing to die and leaves she will be the last person I’ve been with no matter what opportunities present themselves.

I want to emotionally support her through this if she chooses to stay but I feel like expecting her to rely on me when I’m the one making a choice that will lead to her suffering is unfair to her.  I feel like I’m a lot more calm than she is and I don’t think that’s unreasonable but I want her to be at least somewhat okay with my choice. 

 I don’t think she’s in the wrong at all, I completely understand her feelings and they are absolutely valid but they don’t change my mind. I feel like even if she wants to leave she will stay until the end even though I stressed she is free to go if she wants to/needs to and that it wouldn’t change how I feel about her at all. 

P.s. I know that a majority of men would choose their lives and I don’t judge them for it or think less of them. This is about me and how I would feel about myself. 

TLDR: I’m choosing death over a life without my dick and my fiancé is trying to convince me to stay and I want her to be at least more okay with me dying. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b0qxle/trying_to_make_my29m_fiancé_27f_somewhat_okay/,relationship_advice,1516,706,0.0
Dingdongdante,2019-03-13 17:53:39+00:00,I [m27] found out my wife [25f] has been cheating on me online with a young guy [18m] and I also just heard he's had conversations with our kids as well on voice call doing impersonations of Sebastian the Crab from the Little Mermaid and gave my daughter a nickname,"She first started talking to this guy last year, when he was 17 and my wife 24. She became withdrawn, would let a lot of things side, lose interest in her hobbies, the household, the kids, her friends, me... she admitted to me, in tears, that she had started chatting a guy from Omegle one night when bored. They had exchanged contact details, she made a Snapchat just for him and so did he, they began chatting there regularly.

The is handsome, he's young, he's an athlete and he's fit as can be. He's funny. He's awesome. He mesmerizes her. Makes her laugh all the time. She finds herself falling for him, and she admits her mistake to me. I am so sad and upset... but I forgive her. She promises to block him. Remove her app. Things are cool for a while but months later I find out she still has Snapchat. She says it's ""for her other friends"", I push the issue, turns out she still talks to the guy. I am not okay with this. She says they are just friends. I tell her to block his ass. She says she does.

Around December last year I discovered she never did block him. Still talks to him. I am so fucking mad... I break into her phone one day, see her Snapchat open and a message from him. ""I love you"" it says. Scroll up more and see a picture of my own wife's breasts staring me in the face. She sent him her tits for his birthday... 

Once more she blocks the guy. I think things are fine but I am starting to lose my feelings for my wife. One time around Christmas my oldest daughter tells me, excitedly, that she ""had a phone call with Sebastian the Crab"". Like the buddy of Ariel the Little Mermaid from the Disney Movie? I shrug it off. I mean four year olds make shit up all the time right? And she has a very rich imagination. She constantly insists she's a real fairy or princess and claims to have magic powers and whatever. 

I find out just yesterday that my wife never stopped talking to the guy until this past February, when he suddenly ghosted her out of nowhere. Which makes sense because she was very sad and depressed at the time. She then deleted all her apps and accounts in anger, and now has no way of contacting the guy or being contacted by him. Not sure if I even believe that anymore, but sure...

She was sharing all she did to me. Like she wanted it off her chest. I just let her talk and talk, and she admits to it all. Says she really fell in love with him. Mentions how she read a lot on Quora about polyamory (Quora is her fucking Bible!) and that she feels like she can love multiple people at once, that her love for me has not diminished by loving another guy. I call bullshit.

Then she admits she even had voice calls with the guys at night when I am away (I often work night shift). At times our oldest daughter would wake up and he'd talk to her too. He sang her to sleep a few times. And he pretended to be Sebastian the Crab, which is what my daughter tried to tell me. She tried to tell on her mama, I think... but I shrugged it off. I am so insanely angry she would allow herself, as a grown woman, to fall for some boy on the other side of the globe. I am feeling betrayed by the fact that she showed her body to him.

What makes me the most mad however is that he talked to my fucking daughter... he even saw her picture and a video. He called her ""Little Dua"", like the singer Dua Lipa because he thinks she looks like a toddler version of that singer. The whole thing is so creepy. The fact that he was just seventeen when my wife and him met online is creepy to me. The fact that she allowed him to talk to our firstborn daughter. It's all messed up. I fear she may have wanted to run off with the guy. She's talked a lot about the place he lives, California, and I'm just weirded out by that, too. 

I don't know what to do. I'm heartbroken. My wife and I have a daughter, 4, another daughter, 2, and she is currently pregnant as well. She blamed some of her behavior on ""pregnancy hormones"", which is nonsense. She also tried to subtly push polyamory on me as well. I'm so... done with her. But I also love our daughters and do not want them to grow up in a broken home. She's gone back to normal in some sense... she does her hobbies, she cares for the kids and runs the household as before. She is sweet to me, at times. We make love often. But most of the time, as much as it pains me to say... I feel nothing. 

I'm 27 years old. I felt last year that I had it all. I felt on top of the world. Now I feel like I already lost it. 

**TL;DR:** My wife has had an intense online affair for months and the guy even talked to my daughter and gave her nicknames and did impressions for her and now I'm weirded out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b0ozv5/i_m27_found_out_my_wife_25f_has_been_cheating_on/,relationship_advice,1153,275,0.0

Help.","Boyfriend 32, whom I have known since we were both in fifth grade together, (I too am 32. Our birthdays are a week apart), and have been dating for 7 years after many years of being such good friends, is persuing his co-worker. He would always get so defensive of her if I were to ask why she blocked me on Facebook, when I have never met her yet she works with my boyfriend 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, and goes to the dog park together, unbeknownst to me. Found that one out by finding a video clip of her on his phone at dog park. Then I started working at same company, and happened to walk past her in the cafeteria area for employees, and she went out of her way to not even look at me. As well as my co-workers, ( boyfriend and I work in different departments even though it's the same company), saying it seems like he is embarrassed of me or something, the way he never wants to hug me, or say love you have a great rest of your day when we do accidentally run into eachother in the hallways. Yesterday, March 12th he tells me all casual and nonchalant, "" oh I got my birthday off from work"", ( I should mention his birthday is March 17th, so he is now just letting me know, five days before his birthday, and about a week and a half too late for me to request off from work to be with him), so I reply very confused and offput, "" uhhhh, why are you just telling me this. I didnt realize you were going to take the entire day off, I would have too. He instantly quips back with, "" oh well you wouldn't have been able to anyways, you don't have enough time saved up. So I say back, "" what are you talking about, had you given me proper time as you know, you work there too, I could have just request the day off. By the way, that happens to be his co- workers day off. Then came the major break, he fell asleep on my bed after basically agreeing with me that he's not in this anymore, ( whilst scrolling through his phone barely looking up as if I'm bothering him to be so concerned of the subject), so I looked at his messenger between him and her. WOW. He has been straight up saying to her, "" well if you need a viewing partner let me know"". Another occasion he says, ""you should invite me over to watch with you. I have insights, lol"". Another, she replies with, "" well my mom would probably have you watching cops with her"" he replies, "" I like cops. I'll watch that"". Then another time saying he would keep her company whilst she's out of work for surgery, even if it is just watching cops together"". He went out of town on his vacation to Ohio to see his nephew, and was messaging her pictures of him with the baby, and pictures of his sisters dog, and how they both just miss being at work :/ Mind you I NEVER ONCE RECEIVED OR HARDLY HEARD FROM HIM while he was gone, let alone pictures :( I always asked him if they talked, and he would say, "" I'm making shit up in my head, and that they only ever talk about work stuff.

PurpleLawn87,2019-03-13 00:25:40+00:00,Update: My (22F) neighbor (70sF) told me about a woman (20sF) visiting my boyfriend (22M) when I'm gone,"Follow up after this: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/azm70y/_/

I almost didn't make this post because I feel so stupid, but there were so many people who wanted an update so why not. Thanks to everyone who gave advice last time.

The next morning I decided to confront my boyfriend. I wanted the truth from him, I was very upset to say the least. So I asked him who the woman was that was coming over when I was gone. He looked kind of confused, and then started chuckling. I asked him why he was laughing, and that I wasn't joking around.

He's been preparing to propose to me and one of my best friends came over to look at rings and talk about how and where he should do it. I felt really guilty for assuming that he was cheating, but even he admitted that it didn't look very good. He showed me some of the plans they had made and the texts between them, but that he is going to change things up now that I know. I kind of ruined ruined the surprise, but oh well. I called my friend afterwards and she couldn't believe what happened and we shared a few laughs. He's been working overtime to get me a ring and I don't know how I missed all the signs. She only came over twice so I guess my neighbor is not that sharp anymore, lol.

Looking back it all makes so much sense. My friend has been low-key asking about getting engaged, what kind of ring I would like etc. I feel really stupid and bad for assuming the worst, but my boyfriend doesn't hold it against me and said he would probably have handled it the same way. I'm SO happy that we're cool now, the thought of cheating was so tough on me I already called in sick Monday.

For anyone wondering, I already told him I'm going to say yes :)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I took the advice you guys gave me and had a serious conversation about boundaries and rules in the relationship. I told him I don't like that he's been sexting other women and that to me, its cheating. He apologized for what he did and told me that he sees a future with me and does not want to mess up the relationship that we have. He promised to stop talking to these women and make serious changes to his desires and behaviours. 

&amp;#x200B;

But you know when your intuition is telling you he lyin? Ya, I had that. 

He gave me his phone, (unlocked) to prove to me that he isn't talking to these women anymore and that he is serious about changing. Fair enough, he did stop talking to them and blocked them. So far, I guess it's all good.

&amp;#x200B;

He has a group chat with his boys and one of them messaged him as I was on his phone. I began to read their conversation (I know, I know, I shouldn't have), but what I saw made me want to punch a wall. Earlier in the week, he had asked his boys about downloading Tinder. They all suggested getting the app because ""no need to be faithful to these bitches"". I notice his recent purchases on app was Tinder. I called him out on it and demanded he log in. He had set up an account and was basically ready to be unfaithful. His new reasoning/excuse was ""I didn't even use it yet. I was going to delete it."" 

&amp;#x200B;

This man is pure ass.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, I broke up with him and honestly, I feel relieved. I can only imagine what would have occurred if I stayed with him. As much I wanted to break everything in sight and go off, I know that's not the right thing to do. I was civil. I told him thats it, I will always support you, but this shit is not my cup of tea. 

Thought I'd update you guys on this BS. Thanks for all the supportive comments. They mean a lot.

Beepbeep912,2019-03-12 13:10:33+00:00,I [30F] am inheriting 100k and I want to keep it a secret from my husband [32M] who has a history of gambling,"I'm a 30F married to 32M for 5 years, we had a 2 yo son. My husband unfortunately had a gambling problem early in our marriage which resulted in over 50k of debt on credit cards. We have been working hard to pay off our debt, but we still have more than enough. We converted all the credit card debt to personal loans with better rates, we also have some student loans, a mortgage and a car loan.

As the title suggests, my grandmother is going to be giving me somewhere between 100k-200k in the next year. She was unfortunately involved in a bad car accident last year due to an impaired driver and she is expecting a close to 1mil settlement and intends to split the money she gets between her grandchildren.

Heres the thing. I want to spend the majority of the money to pay off our debt (credit cards and loans first, then perhaps some towards the mortgage.. I'd also like to put some into an emergency fund or invest some perhaps and put away for our sons education).... I deal with ALL the bills due to my husbands prior issues I just dont trust him, and I'm way more organized than him. So I could easily pay off all this debt without him noticing.

My husband is no longer gambling, he went thru gambling anonymous and it's no longer a problem, however, I dont believe that he could NOT relapse at any moment and I worry that if I had an extra 100k in the bank he wouldn't go in and just take a little. 

Before everyone gets out their pitchforks, my husband and I do have a good relationship and we have trust. That being said, anyone knows an addict is always an addict and I feel like him knowing there is 100k in the bank would be like telling a drug addict in recovery that there was 2 lbs of drugs in their bedside table. Does that make sense?

GlumBison,2019-03-11 23:35:02+00:00,[UPDATE] I (20M) slept with one my senior managers (42F). She is pregnant and wants to keep the child. She asked for my permission.,"[Previous Post is still on the front page but whatever](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/azk46u/i_20m_slept_with_one_my_senior_managers_42f_she/)

Hey, it’s a bit long but you guys asked for an update.


So, I met up with Claire (not her real name), I asked her out for coffee to a quaint little coffee shop so we could be alone. Firstly, I made it clear that she did not require my permission to go through with the pregnancy. I’m happy for her. I just wanted to bring up the points everyone made. She thanked me for giving her this opportunity to be a mother.


Claire’s been married twice and is currently going through a divorce. Both of her marriages have ended because of her inability to conceive. She and her current husband have been separated for 2 years and the divorce is about to be finalized. He cheated on her with a younger woman and got her pregnant. Fucking scumbag blamed Claire for ruining the marriage because of her body and in his words for deceiving him. He abused her emotionally and physically. She blamed herself and depression took a hold of her. Makes me sick how he treated her. She is going through a lot right now emotionally. I told her that I am here for her and I can be her rock for support if she wanted that.


I asked her if she wanted me to be involved with the child. She told that was my right and she would accept any decision I made. I’m going to do this. I want to be in my childs life. I brought up the concerns about the financial and the health concerns. She doesn’t expect me to provide for her financially, but she is a little concerned about miscarrying. She would sign any document absolving me of my financial duties and retaining my parental rights. It’s not a scam, her income is beyond what I would have imagined myself earning.


She was crying through the entire conversation. I noticed she was looking at her phone a lot. I brought it up and she told me that her phone was blowing up with support from friends and family. Her mom wanted a picture of me, but I declined. I haven’t told my own parents yet. A drunken affair has made so many people happy. It was getting late, so I wanted to hug her before we left but she made the first move and kissed me on the cheek. I went home and I just realized that I forgot to ask for her number. Lol. I must admit reddit, I am madly attracted to Claire and I want to have a serious relationship with her. Any advice for dating someone with such a large age gap?


I sat my parents down and as expected, once I mentioned that I got someone pregnant my mom went off like a loose cannon. How I’m still her baby and babies can’t be raising babies lol. My dad had a smug grin on his face until I mentioned Claire’s age. Mom (41) started to cry and dad (39) stared into the abyss. My mom just hugged me and told me that whatever decisions Claire made, I had to accept them. They are happy to be grandparents.

I’m going to consult a family attorney to draw up a draft proposal to send to her legal adviser. A friend at work put 2 + 2 together as he saw us leaving together. I'm a fulltime student so I don't really care about this job. It won't be a problem for Claire. No ethics or company policies have been broken. I will make sure to update you guys in 9 months.

Misofobeeuh,2019-03-11 17:52:24+00:00,My wife (30F) suffers from extreme germophobia and anxiety. I (30M) take as many as 30 showers a week to ease her fear of infection. Our relationship is not sustainable and I need help.,"  

Hi, everyone. This will probably be lengthy as I have nobody in my life to talk to about this. This is as much an advice thread as it is a place for me vent and it feels good to air this out.

   
 

My wife suffers from intense germophobia and anxiety. We have been together for 11 years and married for 8. She has not always been like this, she was relatively normal while we dated but it started to get worse after we got married. She previously worked at a hotel as a receptionist and was occasionally required to handle and wash guest towels. Well, she ended up contracting a staph infection and had to be hospitalized to have the infection drained. Following this, she had to be on antibiotics for 30 days. Ever since that experience, her anxiety and fear of infection has steadily grown over the years up until this point. We also have two children - 2 year old boy and 5 year old girl - and her tendencies affect them, also.

   
 

The following list is my attempt at a comprehensive germ-prevention ""Standard Operating Procedures"" of our household:

&amp;#x200B;

* If I touch a light switch I need to wash my hands
* If I touch a door knob I need to wash my hands
* If I go to the garage I need to take a shower before I      can sit down or do anything
* If I touch her pajamas or I touch towels then I need to      take a shower
* If I *even enter* the guest bathroom then I have      to take a shower
* If my kids enter the guest bathroom they have to have a      bath
* I am not allowed to use her toilet in the master      bathroom
* She stops up her toilet everyday and requires me to      plunge and clean it (she uses 3x as much TP as a regular person would).      The cleaning process is 3 Chlorox wipes - one for the seat, one for under,      and one to use to flush it with. I have to immediately shower after this.
* If she spills excess *water* on the floor then I      have to mop it and anywhere I walked to include the **entire** house if      that is where I walked after stepping in the water.
* She goes through entire loads of her pajamas daily just      trying to change her clothes. Every time she uses the toilet, she has to      change her clothes. She washes her hands and arms up to her elbows and      then her face. If she gets water on her shirt, she will change it. If,      when putting on her shirt she touches it to her body, she will change it.      If her pants touch the floor when she is putting them on, she will change      them. She discards the top shirts in her drawer every time she gets      dressed. She uses 6-7 towels after a shower, discarding half of them      because ""they touched my chest."" As you can see, this adds up      and I end up folding laundry for 60-90 minutes everyday. This doesnt      include the time it takes to actually change it out and take showers.
* If I even *touch* the dishwasher I have to wash my      hands.
* If she takes a shower and gets in the bed, she will NOT      leave the bedroom or she considers herself dirty and would have to shower      again. This means if she is hungry or thirsty I will bring it to her.
* Her showers last around 40 minutes. She bathes 3-4      times and washes her hair 2 times. Our water bill is ridiculous.
* If my son (2 YO) takes one step outside of his playpen      then he has to have a bath before he can go in his bed. This includes      naps. If I take him outside (even just for *1 minutes*), he would      need a bath before he can get in his bed. Not even changing his clothes      would suffice.
* When I clean the house (which I dont mind, btw.      Cleaning your house is necessary), everything has to be done in a **very      specific order**. No deviations from this order or it has to be re done.      

&amp;#x200B;

1. Change out laundry and leave washer free
2. Wash hands, face, and arms and change clothes
3. Sanitize all toys on floor and put away
4. Pick up all clothes and put in baskets
5. Sanitize all counters
6. Clean kids bathroom
7. Take out master bathroom trash, wash hands, replace bag
8. Take out kids trash, wash hands, replace bag
9. Take out kitchen trash, wash hands, replace bag
10. Clean guest bathroom, wash hands, take out trash, wash      hands, replace bag
11. Sweep entire house in a very specific order
12. Mop house in very specific order

I want to make this clear - I have no problem with cleaning but I often do something in the wrong order or forget to wash my hands and I get berated. My wife has little patience for mistakes that involve germs. Often, I have to clean the house late at night after the kids go to bed so I will be doing it after midnight. Of course I will make mistakes when I am mentally exhausted.

&amp;#x200B;

* If I bring her water, I have to wash my hands and then *hold      the cup over my head* as it clears the kitchen counter. She thinks that      if I hold her cup around my chest that it will touch the counter and be      dirty. I do the same thing with plates and utensils.
* If I have to discard a piece of clothing on the floor      in her vicinity, she will change her clothes and get pissed. She thinks      that the **air created when the clothing hits the floor will blow      bacteria all over her**. This is perhaps the one that triggers me the      most. 
* If my dog gets out, he has to have a bath before he can      come back. He gets out often because she wont close the door. 
* My wife **will not touch doorknobs**. She uses her      foot to close the door and she will just fucking leave it open over      actually closing it - even when she leaves the house.
* If I leave the house with my phone, I cannot bring it      back into the house until I sanitize it. That includes washing the phone      case with soap and water and then using alcohol on the phone.
* No shoes on the in house, ever. I had contractors over      a month ago and they wore shoes. I had to sanitize every object they      touched, and mop TWICE where they walked. 
* Her depth perception is abysmal. We get in so many      fights because she thinks that I touched her with a dirty object when I      was *halfway across the room.* When she gets dressed, I half to watch      her and verify that she doesnt touch her body with the outside of the      shirt. Same with pants.
* We never have people over because of her fear of      infection. Plus, I am the one who has to clean and sanitize so I am      reluctant to even mention hosting an event or having a party at the house.

   
 

There is more things I have to deal with but I cannot remember every situation right now. The worst of it for me is the constant laundry (3-4 loads a day - sometimes more) and showers (4-5 showers a day). I have taken as many as **9** showers in one day and as many as **35** showers in one week. I wash my hands over 50 times a day. I have gotten to the point where I just pretend to take a shower or wash my hands if she isnt in the room. I fantasize about just being able to get through my day not feeling like a puppet on a string. I get no sleep (maybe 4-5 hours on average) and have almost no free time. And this is not because of my kids.

   
 

You may be thinking, ""dude, go to marriage counseling."" We did that about two months ago. My dad may be the only person who really knows what I am going through he told me to be completely honest - hold nothing back. That is exactly what I did. I told the counselor everything that I just revealed to all of you. I have had this talk with my wife already but she says, ""you can leave at anytime, if you cant handle it you dont have to be here."" The counselor was speechless for a second but then began to address my wife and asking her if it was all true. My wife just shutdown and barely refused to acknowledge it. After the session, my wife got upset at me for ""throwing her under the bus"" and canceled all future sessions. 

   
 

I want to say one last thing. Before she went deep into this fear of infection, we had a great relationship. We loved each other and felt we were meant to be. I still love her and want it to work. I have been dealing with the worst of this for nearly 3 years now. I am physically and mentally exhausted. I have thought of leaving multiple times but I am afraid of how it will affect my kids. We also bought a huge house and invested sums of money into it that we would lose. My wife refuses to take medication for her anxiety (I dont blame her, most of it hasnt worked in the past). 

   
 

Has anyone ever been in situation similar to this? Thank you for taking the time to read and I appreciate any and all advice.

   
 

**TL;DR** \- My wife suffers from extreme germophobia and it severely complicates my life and my childrens' lives.

caramelclit,2019-03-11 13:49:52+00:00,Today is my [20F] boyfriends [24M] funeral. His family is ignoring me and I want to see him before it’s open to the public. I took a pregnancy test today and it came out positive. How do I approach this situation without being a burden on his family?,"My boyfriend (24M) and I (20F) were in a long distance relationship for about a year. We were bestfriends for a couple years before that. About a week ago I noticed he was missing and called the only family members he introduced me to. They didn’t update me and I found out he was dead through a GoFundMe account. He was staying with me for a week and returned home and his grandmother kicked him out of home saying hurtful things about his late mother. Turns out that he relapsed and OD and was found in a shelter bathroom. 

I kept asking his family for updates and I tried talking to everyone wishing my sympathies. I was trying not to burden them. But then I realized they weren’t even planning on inviting me to the burial. I didn’t say much except the fact that 
1) I had been speaking to over 50 people for them, I was the ONLY person that knew all of his friend groups and the family. I was the bridge.
2) I raised almost all of the funds in the GoFundMe. Which isn’t a problem but I did it on my own and have received no acknowledgment as his girlfriend. They basically have been ignoring me as much as possible.
3) They weren’t going to let me say goodbye to my bestfriend and that would be a lack of closure for me. 
4) He was going to propose to me. He had a ring ready and all of his friends said he was waiting to introduce me to the rest of the family, and for my birthday in July. 

I let them know I wouldn’t fight their decisions but to rethink it.  They basically told me they were unsure of the nature of my relationship with him. After knowing that I was the only person that would talk to him 24/7 and I was able to give the detective all the answers they couldn’t including bank account log in info and passwords. 

The family changed their minds out of nowhere and said everyone is welcome to all three days. I traveled to New York and now I’m here and they all have seen my GeoTag location because I sent it to them. No one has reached out to me to try and meet or anything. I don’t want to be selfish but I just feel like they are treating me like I didn’t matter to him. 

Today I took a pregnancy test, and it came out positive. We had been suspecting this for a couple of weeks. I want to make sure it’s right before I say anything to them. I might just never tell them and get an abortion if I am, I can’t do this alone. I don’t know what to do. Also I don’t know if I should just show up to the funeral at the scheduled time? I’m scared to ask them if I can see him beforehand. 

I have a painting of him and his late mother I made him for Valentine’s, also a handmade diary with photos of him and their family that I made his favorite cousin. Do I just give them these things at the funeral? I’m also way too calm I haven’t freaked out yet and I don’t know if I will in public. Im definitely disassociating. I’m attending the funeral alone because I don’t have anyone else.

anonyup,2019-03-11 12:55:39+00:00,"I left my husband this past week for treating me badly, now his family is threatening me.","I just want to start off by saying I left my husband so we could both reflect and think about what to do going forward. Giving us space and reaching out to a marriage counselor, etc. 

He told his family that I left and his mother has been blowing up my phone. She threatened to make me homeless, turn bills off in her name (there are no bills in her name besides HIS phone bill - mine is taken care of) and she also threatened to have my car reported stolen even though the title is in my name, her name is also on the title under the lean holder portion. I’m not sure why, I paid for the car in full up front - looking back this seems like a manipulation tactic. Regardless it’s a marital asset, so I don’t think she can just waltz in and take the car. 

Fast forward a little bit, my husband and I have been talking. He’s agreed to get personal counseling and seek marriage counseling with me. He’s expressed serious remorse and love for me and the kids. But after what’s happened with his family and how he let them speak to me and treat me, I’m having doubts. 

What would you do?

PurpleLawn87,2019-03-10 23:48:08+00:00,My (22F) neighbor (70sF) told me about a woman (20sF) visiting my boyfriend (22M) when I'm gone,"Ok, going to keep this short because I really don't know what else to say.

Been together with my boyfriend for 3 years, and he moved in with me last year. I was already living here for a year or so, and developed a friendship with my lovely neighbor. She's retired and a really sweet lady, she basically knows everyone in the neighborhood and sits at home most of the day. 

Today she came up to me and said that she had something to tell me, but that I shouldn't get mad at her. I told her I would never get angry with her and to go ahead. She said that when I've been gone (probably a late shift or when I'm visiting someone idk) she has seen a woman come into my house and leave before I come back. 

I pressed her for more details and she said that as far as she knows she's seen her come by 3 times, and that she thought I should know. When she leaves she hugs/kisses my boyfriend and she believes she stays for at least an hour or two. Got some generic details from her appearance but nothing specific.

Of course all alarm bells are going off in my head. There are no signs my boyfriend is cheating and we've talked about how we would rather end things instead. He did start working overtime more but I have a friend at his company who talked about this too and he's bringing in bigger paychecks so that adds up. I don't want to jump to conclusions.

How do I approach this. What do I do and how do I confront my boyfriend. I don't know anything for sure and it could be anything at this point.

throwawayaf12,2019-03-10 13:05:22+00:00,My [40/f] Husband's [44/m] Family Is Force Our Daughter [18/f] Into Family Marriage,"Obviously throwaway because my husband knows my reddit account but as long as this post isn't on /all I should be good.

A little bit of a background, my husband is an immigrant from the middle east.  He came here when he was a baby.  Outside of skin-tone you wouldn't know he was an immigrant.  He really is the personification of a melting-pot if it was a person.  He listens to all genres of music (even country!), is middle of the road when it comes to political issues, and even for a time worked for the government when he was in his younger years.  His parents are similar in nature but their immigrant side does come out time to time.  I am a blonde, blue eyed girl who was born and raised outside of Texas so it was a big shock for them when we got married.  He does have a strong faith in god but doesn't go to the extremes to practice it.  He does drink but does not eat pork, he says that's the one sin he can control lol.

I've had an amazing 20 years of marriage and have a wonderful daughter.  We must've hit the jackpot because she has all my husband's best traits and features but he in turn says she has all my beat features.  I am in no way trying to brag but she really is a beautiful girl.  

The issues are coming up when his FOB relatives visited us in America and my husband's cousin's male kids were trying to hit on or just compliment my daughter.  Some of them were too scared to directly look at her so they would creep looks when they thought no one was looking.  These families are faaaaar more religious than both my husband and my parents-in-law.  It is just super creepy they way some of the older boys look or talk about her.  Like she's some prize to be won from god for whoever god blesses.  

It's gotten to a point when my daughter stupidly gave them her number and social media to connect.  They now try to talk to her daily and even bring up how cool it would be if they got married.  

My daughter told us and how it creeps her out.  My husband wants none of this because he said it's incest and they are culturally incompatible and they aren't American.  He told his parents and my in-laws agree as well.  However, the in-laws are getting contacted by their siblings that my son should consider it and he is family.  

It's getting to a point when they want to come visit America again this Spring and summer so they can socialize with our daughter.  My in-laws are too worried about hurting relationships with their brothers, sisters, nieces, and nephews.  My husband is too kind to flip out on them but I know if he's pushed hard enough he would.  

My husband has no family here in America outside of his parents, so I don't want him to lose contact with his family overseas.  They are still family.  He did tell our daughter to be careful and to block them if she had any inch of worry. 

I don't know how I can try to help my family not cutting ties with everyone but none of us want our daughter to be the center of the issues.

Philip_McCrevasse,2019-03-10 01:30:46+00:00,Update: I [31/m] caught my gf [32/f] cheating red-handed with her ex.,"Previous post for context: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ay7v9w/i_m31_just_caught_my_girlfriend_now_exf32/

I haven't contacted her since I caught her.  She called and texted me today but I ignored them both.  She said she wanted to come by and get her stuff and drop off my key.  Okay?  Throw away the key and buy new bedsheets.  That's literally all she had here.
She showed up at my house almost immediately after I got off work.  I had the door open anyway, and she tried to just walk in, and I stopped her. 
She said, ""Oh, you can barge in on me but I can't barge in on you?""  I was stunned she had the audacity.  She continued with, ""Ya, you come to my friends (her ex...that answered covered in nothing but sweat and a pair of underwear.) house and night, banging on the door when his kids are trying to sleep. But you don't like it that i'm trying to barge in on you?""
I was stunned, I honestly didn't even know what you say.  I just told her I forgave her then asked her to leave, and she refused, and said, I'm not here for forgiveness.  She tried to push through me again but I didn't budge.  She begged me for 10 minutes of my time.  She said I don't have all the information and there's things she needs to tell me.  I told her I have all the information I need, there's nothing more to discuss, and she continued with trying to convince me that there was something important for me to know.  I told her she gaslighted me and manipulated me for the entire relationship, she denied and continued saying there's things I need to know.
Again, I asked her to just please leave that I had somewhere to be.  Then she just deadlooked me in the eye and said, ""somewhere to be huh? So you already had someone else anyway?""  I said, ""no, actually I've never even considered cheating on you.""  she responded with, ""Ya right, that's bullshit.""
Then went straight back into asking me, ""why wont you talk to me?  Why are you doing this to me?""
I responded, ""you mean standing up for myself?  I don't love you anymore.""
She said, ""Yes you do, you can't just turn it off it's not a switch.""
I told her that the person I loved never existed, and asked her again to please leave.

She said, ""you know what, you're not a fucking victim here not everyone is trying to fuck you over.""
I said, ""You're right, there are good women out there and I'll find one that deserves me one day.""
She responded, ""Not if you keep doing stupid shit like this you wont.""  Then walked off and finally left.

My head is swimming, did I handle this correctly, should I have given her a chance to talk to me?  I just feel like it's pointless, we can't be together, I'd never trust her.  On one hand, I feel like I could've handled it a little better.  I know I told her I didn't love her anymore, and I'm still so heartbroken,  I loved her really deep, and I still do to be honest.  I honestly don't know where to go from here.  I'm starting to feel a little bad for not letting her talk, but I just don't see the point.

My best friend and I are going on 15 years of friendship, and we (along with our friend group) planned a vacation. The day of comes and since I have the largest car I volunteered to drive us to airport parking. It’s about a two hour drive from our small town to the airport, so Uber or Lyft was out of the question. We’re all excited for the trip, listening to the radio (a rap music station.) 
and about an 45 mins in, my best friends boyfriend (who is hispanic, it’s important to know) starts complaining about the music. It was about 3 AM (yay early flights) and I didn’t feel like being on AUX and my car won’t allow others to connect to bluetooth while it’s in movement. Other members of the group also say they’d rather listen to this than whatever the pop stations are playing at this hour. After about 10 more minutes of sly remarks and complaining, he blurts out “I WISH you would turn off this damn N****R music!”. 

It felt like time stopped. Now, our group is pretty diverse. Mostly Hispanic, but a few white people and a couple of black. I’m not black, but i immediately looked at my girlfriend who is and i could see the shock and anger on her face. Before anyone could say anything I pulled over to the shoulder and parked. I told him either apologize or get out. He refused. Now I’m not a confrontational person, and he knows this. We’ve been acquaintances for more than 5 years. So I assume he thought he could just say no and I would budge and continue driving. Of course I didn’t and repeated that he has two choices, either apologize, or get out. By now My best friend started apologizing for him and saying we need to go to make it to the airport but I responded saying I wasn’t moving until he apologized for his racist remark. Others in the group told him just to apologize so we can go. He doubled down saying if I had changed the music this wouldn’t have happened. 

Now I admit it was early, I was cranky but long story short he got out of the car with my best friend with him. I drove off after they got their bags. The rest of the ride no one spoke. While boarding the plane I made mental note that My best friend and her boyfriend weren’t there. When we got to the hotel I apologized to my friends for making things so tense, because at the time I felt like I had ruined everything. They let me know that they agreed that what he did was wrong, but the group was 50/50 on if I overreacted. 
The next day they were both back with the group, but we weren’t speaking. About three days into the 5 day vacation she messaged me saying it was awkward and we all should get together to hash it out. I told her we can, as long as he apologizes. She texted me back that he felt the same way, and I needed to apologize to him for trying to control him(?)
So that’s where we are. I don’t feel like I should apologize because while I feel remorse for making them miss their flight, it 100% could’ve been avoided. It’s really causing a divide for us, this is our biggest fight. Her boyfriend is a bit controlling so talking to her by ourselves isn’t an option. At the core I feel like he shouldn’t have said it, and he said he feels like I have no right to tell him what he can and can’t say. What should I do? I want to apologize for kicking them out, but I can’t see the conversation going anywhere.   Her friendship really means a lot to me. 

TLDR: Best friends boyfriend says racist stuff before a vacation. I kick him out and she goes too. I want him to apologize he wants me to apologize. no more friendship.

InternetIntroverts,2019-03-08 14:07:39+00:00,I [F25] received a letter from my mother [F49] yesterday in the mail. I’ve never cried harder.,"So around a week ago I posted on Reddit that I was having issues with my mother. My husband and I took in my best friends two children after she past from cancer. We are now working on adopting them. She has been totally unsupportive and down right mean to my children, husband and myself. So I decided to take a step back from her.

I’ve been ignoring her phone calls and today get a letter in the mail addressed about a week ago. It broke my heart and I broke down in tears. Probably the most I’ve cried in so long.

It was such a heartbreaking letter. She said that “I was a worthless space of a human” and that “Those kids would be better off in foster care then with me”. It was a full page of just insults. The one that really got to me was “You’ve never accomplished anything and you’ve never made me proud”. I broke down that line. Throughout my life all I wanted was to make her proud.

I ended up booking an appointment earlier with my therapist just to let these emotions out. I’m glad that the kids nor my husband were home at that time. I talked to him last night and he just let me cry to him. He truly is my rock.

I truly can’t believe my mother would do such a hurtful thing. It broke me down but now I have to pick myself up. I fully think this would be enough for me to cut her out of my life forever. Does anyone have any advice? Anyone ever cut a parent out forever?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ayqnk1/i_f25_received_a_letter_from_my_mother_f49/,relationship_advice,17753,2643,0.0
Nellynervous,2019-03-07 23:45:54+00:00,My(24F) coworker(50F) blamed me for my miscarriage (UPDATE),"
It's been a long day. First, I want to again thank everyone for their love, support, and advice. I wasn't able to answer everyone but know I tried to read all of them. Thank you.


So, this morning ended up being a meeting with my boss. Now, yesterday I was given a run down of how she made a complaint of interrupting her work day and not being told important information. She did have an 'example' but it was very stupid one.


Co-worker when she was at my desk had apparently been staring at my screen. She saw that the usual application to log data we use wasn't up and went straight to assuming I wasn't working. What she didn't know is me and two other senior employees were using a new application that we will be switching over to and was running on that application (with the old one minimized) she then came back to ask about lunch and saw 'I still didn't have the application up' and went running to boss to tell him I wasn't on the application and I wasn't working, making it hard for her as she had to pick up the slack. 


My boss calmly assured her that I was working on a different application and all productivity is monitored (I get my shit done) she then, not wanting to be wrong I guess, doubled down and was upset I hadn't communicated that to her. I didn't even know. My boss asked her to elaborate on that and she brought up the application again and I guess they talked in circles for a bit. He let her know that he takes these matters seriously and asked her for any examples of me not communicating. She had nothing. 


When I spoke to my boss, at this point I was upset. I finally just told him what happened and explained what happened yesterday. He was not pleased. He did let me know I don't have to explain myself and that next time if I'm in that situation to go straight to him. He offered his condolences for my loss.


As for her, she is no longer allowed to speak to me. Anything work related must be done through the messenger we have or email. Though, he assured me that as we are working on different applications, she shouldn't be reaching out to me. She has a laundry list of people to ask before me. He told me to document everything. Anything she does say document it for the time being and be as curt as possible.


Today, she hasn't been around me. She even moved her monitor and keyboard so she's facing away from me. She hasn't said a word all day. It's been a wave of relief for me.


TLDR: coworker tried to report me for something stupid, it didn't work. She is now not allowed to speak to me.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/awot5j/boyfriend_25m_told_me_he_used_to_ask_out_fat/)

Quick update. I confronted my BF after his friends left and told him that I was genuinely concerned about his treatment of those girls. I said he lacked empathy and I can't believe he doesn't see what was wrong with his actions. He finally acknowledged that yes, what he did was mean. He says he didn't want to seem ""boring"" to his friends. I said I thought he was better than that.

I told him I was worried about how he'd treat me if I gained weight in the future. He said that I was the type of person to ""always stay skinny"". I said he can't be so sure of that, especially if I get pregnant. I said I was scared by his shallowness.

Long story short, I broke up with him. He's super sad and has been apologizing non stop via text. No matter what he says I just can't get his cruelty out of my head. It's made me much less attracted to him, and I don't want to be associated with that kind of person, as I am a new grad nurse in a eating disorder clinic, and I see the kind of effect that rude comments and actions have on young women. One of the teenage girl patients is anorexic because she used to be fat and bullied in school. I am disgusted to think that my boyfriend embodies the cruelty of her bullies. 

TL;DR: Broke up with BF even after he acknowledged that he was being ""mean"" and apologizing. As a nurse, I hope I never have to interact with him in a professional setting.

I believe her because we never lie to each other. We're going to leave after he leaves for work. Someone suggested I call and report an ethics violation on his part. I think I'll do that and find a shelter for me and my sister to go to until I know what to do next.

My coworker/'friend' has been in a sour mood because I was given 'lenient' clock in clock out times the week of my miscarriage ( I took no days off, and only came in and left early the first two days as the cramps were horrible) finally, after she was being talked to about coming in late she came after me, yelling at me asking me why I'm not in trouble as well and how it is not fair she is getting yelled at but I'm coming and going 'as I please'.


Me, thinking we were friends, confided to her that I had a miscarriage. Her response? 'I told you you were pregnant! Why the hell are you here? You need to be home! This is why you had the miscarriage! You don't care about yourself, you're being selfish working when you should be letting your body recover. What is wrong with you? You are being so stupid! You don't take care of yourself and then you wonder why you had a miscarriage. Come on, really. Who do you think you're telling this to? I'm a woman! I have gone through things like this! Don't look surprised if you find you can't get pregnant after this. Honestly, take care of yourself. '


And then with that she announced she was going on break and I sobbed in the bathroom. I pulled myself together and didn't speak to her the rest of the day. Then it was the weekend then she was sick and was gone and then she had a family emergency and has been back but I've moved desks. I'm hurt and angry and honestly, am not her friend. Today she tried to send me a birthday gift and I refused. She is pissed and doesn't understand my change in attitude. She also tried to coordinate breaks with me. I, of course, insisted that I break at a different time. 

This is making her frustrated and I am honestly at a loss for words on how to explain to her why I no longer want to engage socially with her.

RadicalSmarm,2019-03-06 00:51:23+00:00,Is it a dick move to break up with my boyfriend right after he had brain surgery?,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

I (39F) have been with my boyfriend (38M) for a year. In late January I took him to the ER after he had a seizure. They found a brain tumor. It was benign (thank god) but it was putting pressure on his brain and causing problems. 

We live in a rural area and he had to go to a larger city in the next state over to meet with a neurosurgeon. The neurosurgeon said that, although it wasn’t cancerous, it would continue to grow and make his problems worse so surgery was scheduled immediately. 

He had to travel to the same state again for the surgery but insisted that he didn’t want me there. He said that his parents and children and other family would be there and that he wanted me to use the time I would be taking off work to help him in recovery once he got home. 

He’s been texting and FaceTiming me sporadically while there but not as much as one would expect when someone is confined to a hospital bed 24 hours a day. I just chalked it up to the fact that texting is probably difficult in his condition etc.

However, this morning I received a Facebook message from a woman who said she had being seeing him for several months and that she just found out about me at the hospital. She took him to the hospital for surgery and she’s been staying in the hospital with him every night (she lives in the same city where the hospital is). He’s been traveling to see her while telling me he’s somewhere else for business. 

Obviously, I’m devastated. I reeeaaally want to dump his ass but, under the circumstances, i question whether or not I should. I feel like brain surgery is a big enough deal that he’ll actually need some real help when he gets home. And I wonder whether or not my hurt feelings should outweigh that. 

Should I still help him recover? Or should I tell him what I know and leave? He’ll have friends and family who will help him if I don’t. It just feels so mean, though.... ugh. I don’t know.

You guys are right. I can't force my family to accept my views of no contact with my father. I resent this man so much. I can't stand the sight of him. 

After I posted yesterday, I was ""invited"" to have dinner with my family. To no one's surprise, my dad and his new family where there. I picked out the two most expensive dishes on the menu and we had a chat. I heard his thoughts on the matter of being an absent father but I didn't bring up any of our hardships. My mother and sister made more attempts to make me forgive him. I did, I forgave him but that didn't mean I needed to have a relationship with him anymore. Again, my family protested that I'm being cruel and heartless. I'm not, many people survive cancer and his lung cancer is in the early stages. I told them I would not be present at any family events if he was there.

My sister shouted at me claiming ""He is our dad. You asshole"". Yes he is, to which I relied that he needs to take over his responsibilities as a father. I told them I had cancelled the tenancy on the house and we need to move out by end of this month. My sisters need to return the iPhone's that are on contract as I am cancelling those. Driving lessons will be cancelled, gym membership will be cancelled, subscription services will be cancelled and everything else that I pay for. These are dad's responsibilities now. Ate my dinner and left them with bill as a little act of petty revenge.

I have been staying with my girlfriend and have not answered any texts and calls from them. I need a break.

I'm done. I'm done taking over dad's role. I'm done will the financial responsibilities or acting as the parent. I'm 25 and I need to live my own life now. I don't think this will burn bridges. It's just a wake up call for them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/axkv7v/update_dad_left_us_and_a_decade_later_wants_to/,relationship_advice,18483,1540,0.0

I and my wife are currently on the same team working on a prestigious project. We both worked real hard to be here. So, while I'm working, I noticed something which could be optimised for better results. I worked on it for a month before I finally figured it out. I told my wife and she was very happy for me. 

I was getting ready to finalise my submission, but the next day before I had my final draft ready, our team announced that my wife did something wonderful. I really wanted to know, because she didn't mention anything. But when I came to know what it was, I was shocked. She just copied what I shared with her and submitted it. Everyone congratulated her for her brilliant idea. 

She didn't even look at me. I just stood there shocked. Our team threw a party for her and she was promoted. While I just drank away. She even told everyone that I ""supported"" her and helped her do it. I even got a round of applause.

When I just asked her why she did it, she just started crying and told me that she was really stressed and didn't mean to do it but it ended that way. I just want to quit my job, but I'm afraid I'll be painted as the jealous husband. I'm really depressed and I don't even want to look at her. She wants to make up. We were planning to have kids.

punani_miller,2019-03-05 03:17:05+00:00,UPDATE: Fiancé [24M] locked me in the bedroom for a whole day after an argument.,"Thanks for all your suggestions. I’m at my parents house currently. A lot has happened in the past 2 days. 

I took people’s advice and called the non emergency police line. The police officer didnt really sound like he knew what he was doing to be honest. When I told them I had an abusive fiance and I needed a police escort to pick up my things, he was just like...ok....we dont really do that...and we don’t have any officers available right now. He told me how to file a restraining order though so he wasn’t completely useless.

I did that. And then when I knew he was at work, I went to pick up my things. I explained my situation to the superintendent, who knew me and let me into the apartment. I got the essentials like my phone, car keys, wallet, laptop and a few clothes. I just left his engagement ring on the kitchen table.

Also I turned off the location tracking on my phone...and blocked his number and social media.

I then took a few days off work, and drove myself home so I be with my family. They encouraged me to find a job in my hometown so I can live with them and be safe from him. 

Anyways, my now ex fiance made a new burner number and has started texting me from it. He was very apologetic at first and when I didn’t respond, he started saying really mean things like “have fun trying to get guys to date you, you boring, flat chested, ugly bitch”, and “enjoy dying alone and miserable” and “congrats, you just threw away your future” plus some borderline racist things.

THEN, this afternoon, he showwed up at the front door. My mom answered the door and he kept on trying to get in, we had to call the police. They questioned him and us, I gave them my testimony. They said “ok” took their notes and left after giving him a warning. They said if he bothered me again they would arrest him. He cursed at me after the police left and drove away. 

I still don’t feel safe. I feel like he’s always watching me. I have nightmares about him. I’m afraid of stepping outside. My mom has suggested that we get a guard dog.

I don’t feel ready to go back to work and return to the city. I don’t want to live in the same city as him. I think I will resign and find a job in my hometown if I can. I just want to pretend like he never existed. 

I don’t think I will find love again, because he’s kind of right about my looks and personality, but I honestly don’t care. I was perfectly happy for 2 decades of my life being by myself, and besides, my family loves me. I think I will try to work on myself and my career for the next couple of years/decades. This experience has put me off dating for a long time. I can’t really trust anyone anymore. Like he started off so normal and sweet and then he turned into a psycho. Who can you even trust.

Thanks for all your help and suggestions! I will stay vigilant and focus on getting a job here in my hometown, and staying away from him.

TL;DR: Left fiance, who followed me home, called cops on him, he was left off with a warning. Just living my best single life rn.

EquitesCatafractarii,2019-03-04 22:20:42+00:00,A Tinder experiment with my [28M] girlfriend [27F] of 3 years has gone horribly wrong.,"Hi all. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been with my girlfriend for 3 years and thereabouts, and all was going pretty well. I met her IRL, but before that I was having no success with the Tinder game. She, herself, never used it ever.

&amp;#x200B;

2 weeks ago, she was telling me about some of her friends' horror stories on Tinder, and I laughed with her and added ""Tinder's way worse for guys, though"". She didn't believe me when I told her most guys get 0 matches, and I wouldn't either. So we decided to play (what seemed at the time) a fun game : set up Tinder profiles of each other and see what happened. And the obvious happened: after one week, I had pretty much no matches except bots. On the other hand, she was bombarded with matches and messages, quite a few of them from pretty attractive guys (or at least, what I judge to be attractive guys). She admitted I was right and that it was an ""eye opener"". We agreed to shut down our profiles.

  
The problem is, ever since, she's grown slightly more distant and cold, and it's now beginning to be noticeable. Basically less happy to see me, much less in the mood for sex, not as physical or cuddly as before, and more importantly way more monosyllabic in our conversations. etc. I sat her down yesterday to talk about it, and she was evasive. When I asked if the Tinder experiment had anything to do with it, she looked away and just vaguely said ""I don't know, maybe"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I've played myself here. Is this doomed or is there any way I can save it? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL ; DR: played a Tinder experiment with my girlfriend and now it looks like she's way more distant and cold towards me.

Backstory: We started dating when I was 18,but met younger. He is a very sociable person,charming and very ambitious.He acted aloof but was very understanding,caring and kind.He also loves any extreme sport;skydiving,bungee,paragliding,skiing.scuba diving,you name it, he will do it or has done it.He was perfect in any way and if anyone asked me about any of his flaws before this I would have been stuck trying to answer,I still mostly can not. He seemed perfect in every possible way and I believer that we were soulmates. His personality was perfectly suited to mine and he could tell what I wanted,when I wanted without even saying anything.

Issue; I have been spending more time alone recently due to my husbands work drastically increasing for a short period of time,this has led me to be lonely and neglected.His temper has also become even worst after he was kicked out of his Martial Arts team.My BIL visited my husband this week and last night,as I was making my way to check on the twins,I overheard them speaking and drinking.(This was late into the night) The gist of the conversation was both of them joking about him being a psychopath, a narcissist and how well he is covering it up,boasting about his control and my husband even called me his pet.

I went to bed immediately after and spent the whole night thinking over it. The more I thought about it, the more frightened I became. I have no friends. WE have mutual friends but our closest friends are only people my husband new first. I rarely speak to my best friend and even missed her wedding as my husband booked a surprise vacation that month and I am not in contact with any of my old friends. I live in a different country from my parents and brother. My relationship with my brother became horrible after I turned 20 and we have not spoken for a long time. We occasionally visit my parents during holidays.

I feel like I have zero personality. I do not remember ever saying no to anything. Somehow it always feels like we both agree with his suggestions. I own nothing,everything is under his name. It did not start out like that but slowly and steadily he managed to change it all and convinced me it was better this way. I with his suggestion for anything and even act more like him.

He has a lot of friends and a lot of female friends. He introduced me to many of them and I was afraid to be replaced so constantly tried to vie for his attention.He loves making me jealous,angry,sad,excited and all kinds of emotions, saying that my reactions are cute. He loves control. He becomes involved with all of his friends lives, their relationships, anything. He planned how many children we have,their names and in what order,that is fine, but when we found out we were having twins he was angry that it was not as expected,but it is not like we cant afford them.

His brother,same age as me,worships the ground he walks on. Shares everything with him,trusts him unconditionally and has apparently even shared his girlfriends with him.

I have no career. How come? I became pregnant and then had an abortion. Between all of that my mental health was already bad enough and we decided it was better if I dropped out. How is this his fault? Well he was always very careful with sex. Brought his own condoms, convinced me to take the plan B and rarely did it on unsafe days. Well one month before that, my pills went missing. He told me that he did not care and it was fine,we had enough protection already. We then proceeded to have sex multiple times a day and did not stop until I took the pregnancy test.

For someone so scared of pregnancies he was also strangely calm and even amused.He was calm,collected and had everything available beforehand.He even paid for it. However he is always like that.I have never seen him phased,scared,worried,anxious,guilty or regretful.He has absolute believe in himself and never doubts any of his decisions.He says he regrets nothing and is never at fault.Never,the truth is always somehow twisted and someone else is to blame.And when it seems he is at fault,he always seems like a victim.

Pets is another thing I am doubting. He is indifferent towards animals yet we have had at least 4 dogs and 4 cats in total. What happened? They die. Poison,car,run away.Always something happens to them. I was never worried about it before and I never really noticed but now its alarming.

It feels like my whole life is a doubt. Like I never had a choice in anything. My free will was fucked so hard. I am lost. He seemed so perfect,my soulmate,perfect personality, everything I found attractive. Half of me loves him so much and claims that I'm crazy,I'm imagining stuff. It could be true.I hope its true.

The other half of me is doubting everything. In hindsight some of the manipulations are obvious but how many do I not know? What else have I been mislead about? There are so many instances where it could be a coincidence but it might not. I am doubting every decision I made. It feels like I was a puppet until now.

I'm afraid for myself. but I am mainly afraid for my Children. Should I be afraid? I have no wish to confront him as I am without a doubt certain he will be able to convince me I am in the wrong. What can I do? What should I do? I want to pretend everything is normal while searching for more information. How can I achieve that without letting him notice? Also he has not done anything Illegal,at least to my knowledge. Never hit me,in a non-consensual way, and never was directly verbally abusive. I don't know what I even want. Maybe I should just stay with him regardless of if it is the truth? 

I need help

CapableFold8,2019-03-04 11:14:53+00:00,Update: She[20f] lost her virginity while we were taking a break,"Original: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/atuxe9/she20f\_lost\_her\_virginity\_while\_we\_were\_taking\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/atuxe9/she20f_lost_her_virginity_while_we_were_taking_a/?sort=new)

Hey guys. First of all, thank you all so much for your responses, it really did affect me.

So, long story short, 3 days ago I ""broke up"" with her for good.

Now, you guys might not agree with the way I did it, but I did not want to have revenge sex with her, hurt her or hurt her ego. Even though I am sad and disappointed, at the same time I understand she wanted to see other options and I respect she didn't outright cheat on me. That being said, I am also not a backup plan and I deserve to be someones first plan, someone that will make love with me and not consider it a ""godly gift to me""...

I didn't see her anymore and I finished it with a message, here's a translated version:

""Hey \[name\], first of all, I don't want to hold you in suspense, so yes, this is my final break-up message. I took some days to think about it and I realized that if we did continue where we left off that the other guy would be in my head non-stop and I would always be paranoid of you doing it again when you get bored of me. I understand we were (and still are) young when we started our relationship and that you wanted to explore other options and gain experience. Sadly, in that process you lost my trust and hurt me greatly. I respect you wanted to ""take a break"" instead of cheating on me but that still doesn't make it justifiable. I wanted to thank you for all those years and I wanted to apologize for any wrongs I did to you. I want you to know that I am not mad or sad and that my head is the right place. I hope that going forward you will be okay too and please don't punish yourself for what you did. Goodbye, op""

The message was supposed to be stronger and stuff, but I realized I am already getting over it and that I no longer see the point of putting more effort and thought into it. She replied with an equally long message saying she is sorry bla bla bla. So, thank you guys for opening my eyes, if it weren't for you, I am almost certain that I would accept her back. So yeah, until next time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ax601h/update_she20f_lost_her_virginity_while_we_were/,relationship_advice,18675,1530,0.0
ellebelle242,2019-03-03 20:16:47+00:00,Cheaters are the effing worst,"This is gonna be a long one.

I’ve (23F) been dating my now ex-fiancé (27M) for a handful of years, typical ups and downs. It’s important to mention that we’re not particularly active on any of the social media platforms. I will call him EF from here.

A week ago I got a fb message from a friend of my old college roommate. Her message read “Hey OP, this is hard to tell you but I would want to know. Over the past six months, I’ve been seeing EF. He told me you had broken up a year ago, but I learned that it’s obviously not the case”

I’m really pissed but decided to take some time to think about it and then pick the best path forward. I doubted her story a bit, it just seemed so out of character for EF.

This past Friday, I met up with a good friend of ours who went to grad school with EF. After a few drinks I pulled out the messages to show him and asked what he thought. He seemed to think it wasn’t that big a deal. I was confused by his reaction and then he tells me that my BF had been telling his friends that I HAD ASKED FOR AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP. But of course he said not to mention anything to me because I wanted it to be private. Our friend estimate that he’d been seeing 5 or 6 other girls that he’d picked up in bars. 

I’m livid. And mostly embarrassed that I didn’t pick up on any of this over the last year. When I get back to my apartment the next morning after crashing at my friends place, I find EF asleep in my bed. I woke him up and said I wanted to talk.

I explained the events of the past week and this motherfucker has the audacity to lie to me for an hour before I pull out the messages he got and demand to see his cell phone. If there’s nothing he’s hiding why can’t I see the phone. He clearly knows he’s in the shit so he tells me he’s been seeing 2 girls, just in the past 6 months, but he’s willing to go to counseling, cut ties, make it up to me, blah blah blah. I’m not about to take his word for this so I tell him if he wants any chance he needs to show me his phone.

After threatening to kick him out and cutting ties for good, he gives me the phone. There are messages back and forth with at least 10 different women, a few that lead me to believe he’s been cheating for our entire relationship. But I’m not done. I start reading the messages back and forth with his buddies and I start seeing messages about how he’s so excited for when I turn 25 and we’ll be married and how he hopes I’ll trust him enough to not get a prenup even though he out-earns me. This strikes me as odd.

Then it hits me. My incredibly generous parents saved money for me and my brother. I’m not exactly sure how much money it is (I’ve never asked since I know it’s really my parents money and they could take it away at any point) but I do remember that I can take control of the find when I turn 25. Not only did I not catch on to his years of cheating, I didn’t know that he has only thought of me as a meal ticket. 

I keep this to myself for the time being and start asking him why he would do something so terrible. He’s scrambling and trying for any excuse, how he’s been lonely and depressed and not feeling loved and then he says:

EF: You know, it’s not your fault

I hit the roof at this one

Me: Uhmmm no fucking kidding it’s not my fault! Are you on JUPITER! In what world would it be my fault that you cheated on me?

Now he looks like he’s gonna start crying. I tell him to go out and take a walk and give me an hour to think to myself. Then I call my dad and tell him I need him to come over to my apartment. He arrives twenty minutes later, then my big brother arrives. I fill them in on what happened. I need them to be there when I tell EF he needs to leave and take whatever things he has left at my apartment and never come back.

When EF returns, I don’t say anything to him and my v scary dad explains to him that he’s going to pack up all his belongings, return his key, and GTFO. He tried to talk to me a few times through the hour that he’s taking to pack. I just sit at my dining room table, occasionally saying that he’s grabbed something that clearly belongs to me. He’s halfway out the door when I stop him. It occurred to me that I gave him a credit card of mine for him to use so I get the points and he just pays be back for whatever he charged.

Me: I need my card back

EF: What card?

Me: The delta card

EF: I don’t have it, must have given it back to you

Me: Can I see your wallet?

EF: Seriously?

Me: Fine I’ll just cancel it

EF then grabs him wallet and practically throws my credit card at me

He turns to say one last thing to me and my brother just slammed the door in his face.

I wasn’t quite done with him yet. We were going to take a trip to Vancouver at the end of March with two other couples as sort of an engagement celebration. I got online and cancelled our plane tickets that he had me pay for without reimbursing me. I texted the group and said I wouldn’t be going on the trip and that something had come up. I haven’t yet decided whether I’ll be telling him I cancelled his ticket too or whether he deserves to show up at the airport excited for a free vacation only to discover he has no reservation to go to Canada. 

My parents felt so bad for me that they ended up booking a girls trip for me and my mom for a spa week.

Hey, at least I found out before we got married and he had any claim to my parents hard earned savings.

Also, word spread pretty fast through our friend group about what transpired and his lies after my talk with our friend on Friday. Most of our group has decided that I get them in the break up, except for a bunch of fratty guys that I never really cared for. And of course, the two friends of mine that had been fucking EF behind my back (another story).

Anyway, moral of the story: if someone cheats on you, it’s obviously not your fault and only their fault, never let anyone think you might be at fault for their infidelity. And, when someone chooses to show you their true colors, don’t go color blind

TL;DR: Asshat cheats on Fiancé, pulls typical cheater crap, admits to using her financially, they break up, she moves on after cancelling his free vacation without telling him",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/awy1eq/cheaters_are_the_effing_worst/,relationship_advice,2017,214,0.0
throwawayyy311,2019-03-03 18:41:48+00:00,"My wife [32f] bought me [31m] a massage for my birthday. When I went, it had a happy ending. I thought that's what my wife intended. It wasn't and now she's furious with me.","My birthday was last month and my wife surprised me with a gift certificate to a local massage parlor. I've started to get back into weight lifting after several years of being too busy and that makes things extra sore, so it was a thoughtful gift.

I went yesterday, and on my way out the door, my wife said ""I hope you enjoy yourself"" and winked. The massage was thorough, but I was caught off guard because towards the end, the masseur started to rub my genitals. I almost stopped her, but then I remembered what my wife said as I left and assumed she had intended this to be part of the experience. I got a happy ending and left.

When I got back home, my wife asked how the massage was and I said something like ""it was great, I didn't realize your gift would include all that."" She asked what I meant and I told her about the happy ending.

It turns out my wife did NOT intend for that to be part of the experience. She had no idea the parlor did happy endings and if she had known, she wouldn't have bought me a massage there. She asked why I went through with it and I explained how her comment and wink before I left made me think she had planned the whole thing. She said she winked because she planned on having sex with me when I got back after I was nice and relaxed (sometimes I'm too sore from lifting and sex can be painful).

My wife is devastated and says that I cheated on her. I said I'm very sorry but it was a mistake. She left to go stay with her sister and I haven't heard from her today. I miss my wife, who is my best friend in the world. I wish I didn't hurt her.

MySocksAre,2019-03-03 18:05:49+00:00,I [28/M] recently found out my gf [28/F] of two years is a transgender woman. She never told me about it.,"TL;DR at the bottom. 

Right, so I need to give a little of background first. 

In December 2016 I moved to the East Coast for work. I have never left the West Coast before and didn't know anyone here. I signed up for a few clubs and joined the gym hoping, at least, I would make some friends. That's where I met Sara (changing her name her for privacy reasons). 

She used to come to the gym every Tuesday morning and was always really friendly to me. We started working out together and a few weeks later I asked her out. We started out relationship by the end of January 2017. 

Sara never talked about her past. A month into our relationship she told me she had two daughters, a 5 year old and 3 year old. I was a little taken back because I had just moved here and didn't want to jump into being a step-father figure. She assured me she wasn't expecting anything from me and we continued our relationship as it was. 

I met her daughters for the first time by the end of April of 2017. We got along very well and her kids seemed to really like me. It was at that day that Sara told me she **dated** this **guy** from high school for a years years and had the kids with **him**, but their relationship never worked out. 

Every other weekend the girls would come to town to stay with her. ""The girls are going to her **Dad's** later tonight"" is what I would usually hear every other Sunday evening. I never saw/met the guy. Sara would always pick them up and drop them off. I asked why she didn't have her daughter's custody and she said she couldn't financially afford to take care of them. She had recently changed jobs and was living with a roommate. 

Whenever I was at her place she was seemed very on edge, but I always thought was because she was self conscious of her cluttered room and her annoying roommate (her words, not mine). 

On Thanksgiving I met her mother and sister. They seemed very nice but again, nothing about her past was brought up. 

I had a feeling something had happened in her past but figured she was just still scared from the relationship with the **father** of her daughters.

In the beginning of last year I was making a bit more money and our relationship was going well, so I offered her to move in with me. At the time she was working as a receptionist and still couldn't afford to live on her own. 

We moved in together on March 2018. That's when some red flags started to be raised. 

A couple of my childhood friends came over for the summer. They came over to our place on a saturday night and we were having a good time. At one point they were telling her the most ridiculous things we did as teens, and when they asked her about some of her stupid childhood memories, she flipped on them. Called them nosey. ""Why are you guys so obsessed with me"". It was really, really embarrassing. 

I tried and talk to her and she accused me of taking sides. Told me I should be defending her. The argument got really bad and she eventually left the apartment. 

(I should also point out that, until this point, I have never, ever met any of her childhood friends. Actually, all her girl friends were women she had met in the past two years. She had told me a lot of people had ""back stabbed her"" and she cut them off her life.)

After my friends left I tried to contact her to make sure she was okay and for her to come home so we could talk about it but I didn't hear from her until Sunday morning, when she finally came back with her mom. 

Her mother sat me down and told me Sara had a really rough childhood and didn't like to discuss her past. I asked her what had happened but she refused to tell me because it was ""that bad"". I asked if she had seen a specialist about it but she said no, Sara wouldn't talk about it to anyone else. 

Sara and I talked a bit after and she basically told me the same thing. ""There's nothing for you to know about my past, it's dead to me"". 

A month after Sara got fired from her job. She didn't tell me the reason why, just that her boss was an ""utter bitch"". A few weeks later I discovered that she was involved in an MLM company and that was the reason for her being fired. Apparently she sent an email to everyone in the office trying to recruit them. 

We had, yet another serious talk, and I tried to explain to her how MLMs don't work and she would just end up in debt. Our relationship was also crumbling and I gave her an ultimatum. If she wanted to make this work she had to be honest with me about things. 

For about five months things seemed to have improved, Sara had gotten a new job and was going to go to College (she never did any post secondary education, she said it was because of her daughters). But things changed two days ago. 

I flew to my hometown on the 28th for a friends wedding, one of the friends that Sara dislikes so much and was (am) planning to stay here until the 7th so I could also spend sometime with my family.  

I was checking my emails two days ago when I saw an email from someone named Andrea R with the subject. ""Hi Mysocksare, I think you should check this out before you go back home"". 

When I opened the email there were about 20 attachments, a few news articles and an Youtube link. No body message. 

I clicked on the link and that's when everything changed. The link was a compilation of many videos Sara had created when was still a male.

Sara/Andrew had recently come out and was documenting every step on her/his youtube channel. 

""Hi, I'm Thomas"". He was sitting on a chair at his kitchen while he explained everything that was happening. This video alone was over 40 minutes long. At the description of the video there was another link with ""Part 2"". 

In total there were 6 parts. Each video over 40 minutes long. They were all uploaded to a channel that seemed to belong to the alias that sent me that email. 

The first few videos was Thomas talking about his coming out, about his divorce, how he was still interested in women and still loved **his wife**.

Other videos were Thomas talking about voice change, voice coaching and how he had narrowed down his new name to two choices. The next video he introduced himself as Sara. 

There were also videos of Sara (now looking more like the person I know) crying and saying how horrible her ex was, that she was broke, in debt and that her ex was trying to ruin her life. 

Sara apparently also went to Thailand with a TV show to get breast implants. Sara talked about a latex vagina that she was promoting to her ""fans"" that she would wear on a daily basis. Sara was talking about all the hard steps to get approved for a gender reassignment surgery. Sara was celebrating getting approved to that surgery. 

It felt like a really weird dream but I watched all of those videos. All six parts of them. 

I also checked the PDF files that were attached. It was facebook posts, from Thomas profile's that no longer exists. Some PDF files also contained images of  Sara's facebook profile (that seemed to have been deleted) of her talking about her surgery, breast implants from thailand and all sort of documents/images of Thomas's old business.

There were also some news articles talking about Thomas being arrested for misdemeanour and being charged 10k for owning a pit bull (banned breed) and having that dog attack his neighbours daughter. Thomas was also apparently a drug dealer.

So here I am. I have no idea what to do, what to say to her and I feel extremely cheated. I haven't told anyone about it yet, I'm not even sure how I would. 

TL;DR: Found out through an anonymous email that my girlfriend of two years is actually a transgender woman. She never told me about it.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/awwkh4/i_28m_recently_found_out_my_gf_28f_of_two_years/,relationship_advice,3312,871,0.0
punani_miller,2019-03-03 01:49:46+00:00,Fiancé [24M] locked me [22F] in the bedroom for a whole day after an argument.,"My fiancé and I have been dating for one year. We have been engaged for one month. Although I love him, I admit that he has his faults. For one he has a very bad temper at times. Sometimes his temper tantrums can last hours or can they can last days. He’s prone to yelling but he almost never gets physical when he’s angry.

Yesterday, he got mad at me after I got home from work because he was tracking my location through my phone and found that I was at my friends house after work. I told him that it was my friend from work I was there just to pick up something. However he still got mad at me because he said I wasn’t telling the truth, even after I showed him the thing that I was picking up, and even after I told him that this friend was a woman. 

Anyways at the end of our argument he went out of the bedroom, and slammed the door really hard. I lied in bed just to take a break and collect my thoughts. Then, I heard the doorhandle jiggle a bit outside, And then it stopped. I went over and tried to open the door, and realize that I couldn’t. I yelled at my fiancé , “what is happening, open the door!” He replied, “You’re staying in there until I can trust you.”

It turns out he had jammed a chair or a box or something underneath the handle so I could not open it, hard as I tried.  He went to work (night shift), and came back in the morning. He did not unlock the door, and instead slept in the guest bedroom. He had taken my phone too. I was in the room until this afternoon when he woke up and wanted me to make him food.

I yelled at him and he apologized, saying I had made him angry and he needed to vent. After dinner, he wanted to have sex, which I refused. He said jokingly “dont make me lock you in there again”. I called him a psycho and left the apartment before he could stop me. Im currently staying at my friend’s house. She called him a freak and said I should break up with him, despite his handsomeness.

However, I am hesitant to, because he has compromising pictures and videos of me. He has threatened to send them to my family if I ever left him.

What shall I do?

AstroWavve,2019-03-02 21:38:40+00:00,[UPDATE] I (27m) am almost certain my fiancé (25f) messed around with another guy on our engagement cruise vacation. (I confronted her),"Original post is here: 

[original post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/awcmjf/i_27m_am_almost_certain_my_fianc%C3%A9_25f_messed/)

First off I want to start by thanking everyone for their support and advice, it was all extremely helpful, I have never been good at knowing what to say or when to say it, and all of the comments have really helped me think things through. 

Last night I spoke to my fiancé. I got a drink after work and came home around 11:30, I needed the time to collect my thoughts and read through all the advice on here. 

I started with something a lot of people suggested, I just asked her calmly if there was anything about the night I was sick she wanted to tell me about. She immediately got extremely quiet, and stared at the floor for a solid 5 minutes. I didn’t say anything, I was just waiting for her to say something. Eventually she just looked at me and asked me why I’m asking her. I said I’m asking because I feel like I have a reason to be concerned about it, but if you would just explain yourself I wouldn’t need to be concerned. Things went really bad from here.

She started crying and yelling at me, it’s hard to remember all the things she said but it mostly followed “you don’t care about me”, “you don’t trust me”, “why did you ask me to marry you if you don’t trust me”. I told her that I know she wasn’t wearing her ring that night, and without going into detail to her I said I know from someone else that you were with someone. I don’t know if she just couldn’t handle the situation but she really broke down after this. But through all the yelling she admitted to taking her ring off and flirting with another guy. However she kept denying that she slept with anyone else. I just don’t see how you flirt for 5 hours and that’s it. I don’t believe her, and she knew that. 

After an hour of me asking the same questions non stop in a loop: why’d you take your ring off in the first place? The show was 2 hours, what did you do with this guy the other 3 you were gone? Why wouldn’t you have sex with me after that night? It was clear we weren’t getting anywhere. I told her I don’t trust her, and I don’t want to get married unless she can somehow explain any of this, and that I think we’re done. 

As I planned before going into this, I don’t think I should have to leave my condo because she cheated on me, so I said that. I told her if she doesn’t wanna tell me what happened she can leave. She has family where we live, I do not. I’m very surprised but she actually agreed, and left. The last thing she said to me was, “this isn’t over, we’re not done” and “you can’t just drop me like this”. I said nothing back as I honestly was speechless. 

I have dealt with depression since I was 14, and I’ve been cheated on before. I went to a really dark place after that, and I know it’ll happen again now. Luckily I have a sister in my life who is one of my best friends and she knows what’s going on as of last night and is coming to stay with me for a while. 

I still have a lot of unanswered questions — I still don’t know what really happened. But other than that, is she going to come back and try and manipulate me? Will I get my ring back? How are we gunna deal with our shared condo? 

I feel very lost, and like my life has no direction right now. I wish I hadn’t wasted so much time on her. 
Thank you all for helping me. I’ll give another update if anything significant happens.

There was a few idiots telling me I needed to be Alpha and be more manly.. but whatever. 

Anyway the consensus with my RL friends was I needed to tell her. We do Brunch on Saturdays because she does Yoga Sundays so we met up this morning. 

I could barely eat and she could tell something was up. She got worried thinking I was going to say no or something worse so by the time we took a walk both of us were nervous wrecks. 

I sat her down and told her everything how I realized I was in love with her several years back but was to much of a chicken shit to come clean. I told her that I never said anything because I did not want to jeopardize our friendship. Her face turned white then a myriad of expressions came over her face then she started laughing till tears came down her face. 

I honestly was stunned, my stomach was in my throat and I honestly thought that almost 12 years of friendship were down the toilet.      Then she started crying like sobbing and she lightly hit my chest. She half laughed and sobbed that she was in love with me too but she thought that it would also impede the friendship we had and she wanted nothing to impede that. 

We hugged and I told her that there is no one on this earth I would want to have a child with but her. We talked for hours in fact I just got home. We have decided that we want to focus on us for now. I want us to be at that point that we can do it together. 

I know that this isn’t a rom com, and that things could end up not working out  for us in the end. 

However I am pretty sure if there is such things as soulmates she is mine.

Hello everyone, I said that I'd post an update, in large part due to the massive response I got yesterday. In many ways, I was only posting to repeat the situation in my head, but I found many great pieces of advice in there and support as well. Thanks to everyone who posted. 

&amp;#x200B;

I spent last night at my mates, who was absolutely sound about the situation. He basically gave advice that was tantamount to what was given in the comments, to call off the relationship. We had a few drinks, a bit of banter, and this morning I went back to the flat and confronted her. She was there (neither I nor her work on Saturdays), and I set out my stake in as straight-forward a manner I could.

&amp;#x200B;

 Basically, I said that I didn't want to continue with the relationship, and that its better if we call the whole thing off. The wedding details are merely financial, and not too bad to call back, but at this rate we couldn't continue to be together as we clearly desired different things. She basically expressed what she felt then; that we still had a chance, that it could work, to give ""sexual freedom a chance"". Look, I'm no crazy prude, but this shit just isn't up my alley at all. I basically said that over the weekend I'd be over to collect my things (its rented flat in a town, no big obligation there), and that she can keep the place if she wants (I'll stay with my friend for a while, get myself sorted after) . Towards the end we had a full blown shouting argument, but I stood my ground and didn't change my course. Not this time boys and girls. 

&amp;#x200B;

I left, and there is nothing much more to say really. As I type me and my mate are having a few cans, and my phone has been exploding since 5 o'clock with her friends, her sister calling me a prick and a sexist (for some reason). I'll be grand, being totally frank I feel a bet liberated (if thats not too cheesy).  The coming days I'll get everything sorted, the moving and that, but as my father used to say, ""theres always fucking worse"".

eloisecolemangrill,2019-03-02 14:15:45+00:00,"My [27M] girlfriend [25F] spent the night with another couple. I know it's over, but I don't know how to deal with it.","Last night my live-in girlfriend of 3 years spent the night with another couple. A couple that we are very close to. The other couple is married and are male and female.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past year or so my girlfriend has been starting to experiment with women in the form of making out, dancing, etc. Overall I was okay with this as it's somewhat of a fantasy of mine in a living-through-her-vicariously way. Since I was a kid I have been stuggling here and there with a little body dysmorphia and often fantasize about being a woman with another woman. Normally in my day to day, however, I am very comfortable in my own body. So, like I said, I wasn't against the experimenting in any way.

&amp;#x200B;

After talking to her about it numerous times, it went from just having a good time to not being comfortable with taking things forward to maybe having another person in the bedroom would be a fresh take on things. Typing this out it sounds like the classic she's-been-cheating-all-along, but I truly believe it's more of a discovery process.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her I would definitely be willing to bring another girl into the bedroom and we agreed that the person would have to be right and someone we were both attracted to. Around New Years we were at our favorite bar for a party and I suggested we take a friend of ours home (not one from the couple). My girlfriend was hesitant, and I did not push, so that night we just went home and passed out together.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to last night, my girlfriend made plans to go out to an event with a group of our friends, but I decided to stay home and try to take care of some backlog projects I've had going on. She had been messaging me all night, and finally around 1-2am she said she was coming home and would see me soon. It got to around 4am and I decided to log into her Apple account to use Find My iPhone just to make sure she was somewhere safe. This is nothing uncommon, yet not a frequent occurrence. (inb4 comments about being overcontrolling and other accusations). I figured she had been drinking quite a bit and decided to stay at the couples' place.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a bit of insomnia lately due to stress from work and side work, so I finally climbed into bed around 5am. Then I heard the garage door open and she came up to the bedroom. She said we should talk about something important. She then said that she slept with the wife. For the first 15 seconds I was happy for her, but quickly realized there was more on the horizon. She then explained that the husband was involved, but was more focused on the wife. Though she did let it slip out there was penetration (not that it matters that much in my mind at this point).

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend has endometriosis which makes vaginal sex extremely painful. After talking for a while, our recent struggles with my work stress coupled with her worsening condition made it obvious that our sex life hasn't been great. That's when she let it slip that while the wife was a good experience, she still hurt (which only happens with penetration).

&amp;#x200B;

That's when it finally hit my that I had been cheated on. I explained to her that it's one thing if we're both on board for bringing another person into the bedroom, but to not even be consulted on potentially sleeping with another woman, let alone a couple, is beyond the limits. I love this woman, but between this and our diminishing sex life with a dash of pettiness that comes to mind, I realize this relationship is over. This is my first real relationship, and first sexual relationship. Right now I am just afraid of having to start over. I've been taken advantage emotionally in romances before, and this has done nothing but drum these bad memories up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/awi5ll/my_27m_girlfriend_25f_spent_the_night_with/,relationship_advice,4260,326,0.0
buggybabybumperboats,2019-03-02 02:48:37+00:00,My [32 M] best friend asked if I would be her [30 F] sperm donor for her surrogate and I am in love with her but she has no idea.,"So for a bit of background we met in college and have been best friends since then. We hooked up once years ago,It was a drunken exchange and I honestly chocked it up to we were both drunk and in the right place.

She got ovarian cancer that was stage three a few years back and survived and has been in remission however she had to have a complete hysterectomy. She had mentioned a year ago she was considering surrogacy. She had told me she planned to use a donor as she has been single for a while.

Thing is I am in love with her and I have been for years but she has no idea. I know at one point she had feelings for me but I was seeing someone then and out of respect for my gf at the time she never acted on it. 

I feel like before I give her an answer which will be yes I should tell her how I feel. 

I want to make her dream of motherhood come true and I am honestly touched she thinks so highly of me she wants me to be the father. 

Regardless of how she feels, I will still donate and If she doesn’t still feel the same way I will love her as my best friend.

Guess I am trying to find the best way to ask her and came to reddit for advice     

So how should I handle this?

I've always liked gay porn, I watch gay porn exclusively. I go to pornhub and start browsing. I'll try to not make this as graphic as it could be, but I clicked on a random video and it was definitely my husband. His face was fully visible, several unique tattoos. It was him. I knew  without a shadow of a doubt this took place after we were married because he had the goddamn ring on!

I was furious and disgusted. He had unprotected sex with multiple men. All I could think of was STDs. I didn't sleep last night. I called off from work, too. First thing I went to a free clinic to get checked. I haven't been home since. I don't think I can fucking look at him. I'm so fucking angry.

whattodobedroom,2019-03-01 20:34:09+00:00,UPDATE: I (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom.,"&amp;#x200B;

[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/avwpo0/i_28_think_my_girlfriend_26_has_been_using_my_gym/)

I've had a lot of time to think about what happened yesterday. I've also read through a lot of the comments. Thank you to everyone who gave me advice on what to do. There's been A LOT of development and a few requests to follow up, so here it goes. It's whatever at this point.

We had been texting off and on all evening. As promised, I agreed not to bring it up in person. When I got home after work her car was in the driveway and her sister's car was there as well. I was a little nervous not knowing what I might be walking into, but overall I just wanted to get whatever was going to happen over with. When I walked in it was clear so did she. Her sister was helping her pack up her things. I didn't know what to say, but I never expected this. I honestly thought everything was going to be okay when I got home. Her sister just looked at me and didn't say anything.

I walked by her sister and went into the bedroom where my girlfriend was. She didn't say anything either. She didn't even look at me. If she was going to leave I at least wanted us to have a discussion about it. Everything I had read in the comments about buying a bidet and OCD lead me to believe there might be more to all of this than I had considered. I started to talk and she just threw down the hangars of clothes and screamed at me. ""YOU PUT THIS ONLINE? I TOLD YOU TO NOT TALK ABOUT IT!"" Her sister ran into the room and told me to just leave until they were gone. She then accused me of cheating. WHAT? This whole thing has been crazy and I feel like I had dealt with a lot up to this point but man that was it. I snapped.

I told her sister I had never cheated. Not once. I would never cheat on her. Enough was enough, so I told her sister the reason she was there was because earlier I had found out my girlfriend had been going to the bathroom and wiping herself with my socks. Everything went silent. Like, no one said a word. Out of nowhere they both start crying. Her sister stared yelling at me and told me I shouldn't be talking about things I don't understand. When I asked her what in the world she was talking about she just kept on yelling at me and shouted back that it was normal and that I need to mind my own business. 

1. Her sister knows about it.
2. Her sister thinks it's normal.
3. I need to mind my own business? They're MY SOCKS!

I stood there all kinds of messed up so I just left. I went to a buddy's house and stayed the night. I also called off work today. I went home and all her stuff is gone. I didn't text her back. I think I'm done.

To clarify a few things: She insisted on doing laundry to keep my suspicion of her not having many socks at rest. She told me last night through text she always throws away the socks and never washed them. She reaffirmed it's not a fetish. She won't try a bidet because she doesn't want poop water splashing on her. I can't keep up with the comments. I'm pooped. (I'm trying to find humor in this because I'm really upset :(

So yeah.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aw9dzh/update_i_28_think_my_girlfriend_26_has_been_using/,relationship_advice,19491,2659,0.0
whattodobedroom,2019-02-28 22:03:13+00:00,I (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom.,"Throwaway, because reasons.

TL;DR: Found my gym socks in the garbage covered in poop. Asked girlfriend about it. She started yelling at me and crying and left.

I don't even know where to start with this. I'm dumbfounded. She just stormed out the house and I'm sitting on the bed asking myself A LOT of questions.

I live a pretty normal life, and I thought so did my girlfriend. We've been together for a few months and after things got serious, we moved in together. We started sharing a lot of the household responsibilities, but the one thing she was adamant on doing was the laundry. She would come home and find me in the bedroom getting the laundry together and would quickly ask me to go do something else. I'd come back to finish the laundry and she would have already started it. I always thought it was sweet and never her job to do it alone, but hey, if it makes her happy to do it all the time, I wouldn't stop her. 

This is where it takes a turn for the weird. I keep all my socks and underwear in the bottom drawer of my dresser. I also go to the gym frequently, so I always keep a good supply of clean gym socks ready to go. I never kept count, but I know by just a visual glance I several pairs. This morning when I went to grab a fresh pair to pack for the gym, I noticed there were several dress socks, but no gym socks. Again, not weird, they must have been in the laundry. I went to check the laundry basket and it was empty, so I checked the washing machine and dryer. Both were empty. I couldn't figure out where all of my gym socks had gone. So, I did the very natural thing of asking my girlfriend what had happened to them. After all, she is the one who does the laundry all the time. She went silent, turned red and ran out of the room. When I went after her to see if she was okay she wouldn't talk to me. I told her I wasn't mad, I was just looking for my socks. She kinda mumbled ""I'll don't know."" I still wasn't mad, of course, but I was super confused. Socks just don't disappear. So I asked her again, even laughed about it and she just looked at me and got mad and said ""I'll buy you new ones!""

The first thought that went through my head was she had somehow managed to destroy my socks while washing them. I thought the sight of that was actually pretty funny, so I joked with her about ruining my socks. Wrong. Thing. To. Say. She started immediately crying. Like, full on sobbing. At this point I don't care about the socks anymore, I want to know what's wrong with my girlfriend. I sat down next to her on the bed and put my arm around her and asked her of she was okay. She just kept saying she was sorry and that she would buy me new socks. I tried assuring her again it was okay. Even went so far as to say I would buy new socks and she didn't have to. I sat with her for a few minutes trying to calm her down and eventually had to get ready for work. I told her loved her and got my things together to leave for the day. 

On my way out I grabbed the garbage to take outside. When I got outside I lifted the lid off the garbage can and I noticed a small plastic bag sitting on top of the garbage already in there. I could see through the bag (kind of the semi see through ones) there were socks in the bag. Since I was sure she had somehow managed to ruin the socks washing them, I wanted to see for myself. I opened the bag and immediately regretted my choice. There, inside the bag, were several pairs of my gym socks covered in what looked like poop. As soon as the smell hit me I knew it WAS POOP. 

1. We don't own any pets.
2. We don't have any kids.
3. WHOSE POOP WAS ON MY SOCKS?

Work could wait. I couldn't go the rest of the day wondering why my gym socks were covered in poop and inside a plastic bag in the garbage can. I grabbed the bag and walked back inside. As soon as my girlfriend saw the bag she flipped out and started yelling at me. She said I shouldn't be going through the garbage and that I was disgusting for bringing it back into the house. I asked her to calm down and that I just wanted an answer as to why there was poop on my socks. I wasn't blaming her of anything, but she started accusing me of blaming her. That's when it clicked. I don't know what it was that lead me to ask this, but everything leading up to this moment had just been so crazy. I asked her ""Is this your poop?"" She started sobbing again and ran out of the house. I didn't go after her this time. 

So, now I am sitting on my bed with a bag a poopy socks on the floor and a lot of questions in my head. The only conclusion is that she used them after going to the bathroom. Which that alone has its own set of questions above everything else. I sent her text asking her to come back. She hasn't responded yet. I don't even know what I'm going to say when (IF) she gets back.

I wanted to make a new topic on *probably* the final update to my situation because the old one was getting a little messy.

&amp;#x200B;

First off, I wanted to again thank those that took the time to share their own personal stories, and those that offered suggestions on things I could talk about with her, or things we could do as a couple to get passed this. There were **a lot** of comments, and I read as many as I could. In a sea of hate, there are good people out there. I appreciate you folks.

&amp;#x200B;

She got home from work last night, I made dinner, and we sat down together to eat. It has now been four days since my last shave. Which would be considered *""too fucking scruffy""* in my household. We talked about her day at work, then there was a pause after the subject. *""You're really fucking scruffy""* right now she tells me. But she said it in a slightly comical manner rather than her usual dead serious tone. A hybrid between the two. Oh, the moment I have been waiting for since I shared my experience with all you fine folks I thought to myself. *""Yeah. I know. But, I wanted to make a little deal with you this time and from now on. I'll shave. When you do.""* All while staring at her chin whiskers that were still clearly there. She stayed dead silent for awhile playing with the last of her food. *""Fine.""* she eventually replies. After dinner, she went to the bathroom, pulled out her handheld hair puller thing and cleaned herself up. She comes into the bedroom afterwards, looks at me and says *""Happy? Now it's your turn.""* So I did. And we all lived happily ever after. So far.

&amp;#x200B;

Rather anticlimactic, I know, and I'm sorry if you were expecting more fireworks. But, I'm happy with the end result. Many redditors expressed ***""You're a fucking man! Not a child! Grow some balls and grow a beard if you want to grow a beard! man up!""*** You're not wrong, you're just an asshole. Lol. When we agreed to marry each other, we very well knew each others flaws, and we also agreed to make sacrifices for one another. If all I have to do is sacrifice the viking beard I have dreamed of to keep her happy, then so be it. As long as she is sacrificing her Sensei whiskers for me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/avhkks/update_was_i25m_wrong_for_telling_my_wife24f_if/,relationship_advice,2360,187,0.0

First of all I'd like to thank each and every one of you for your kind words of advice and consolation. It's been a rollercoaster of emotions for me the last few weeks and I really needed to vent anonymously. I'm sorry if I haven't been able to reply but the weight of the situation has been overwhelming to say the least but I've read nearly every single comment and message and it means the world to me.

Anyways, yesterday I planned a little date night at a restaurant we haven't been to in a long time but we both loved. I think this combined with my general nervousness lately set off some alarm bells in her head because she was quite concerned when she came home. I just wanted to enjoy the night and not get her too upset so I went along as if everything was alright.

When we came home later that evening I poured us some wine and sat her down on the couch to talk after muting Netflix. I started to break down a bit before saying anything and she instinctively reacted the same way by tearing up trying to get me to open up to her.

I told her I was dying and she gave me one of the most loving, caring hugs of compassion as we both cried together. We've been through some tough times but this definitely took the cake. She was obviously upset I had been going to a doctor and waited a few days to tell her but in the end she was very understanding. She just didn't want me to be alone. I was selfish to keep her out of the loop.

Now she's taken the rest of the week off of work so we can talk more about our future, continuing medical checkups, seeing about medical trials and setting up my end of life plans.

The one condition I made to her is I will NOT be doing chemotherapy. I've seen too many loved ones fall victim to ""chemo brain"" and don't want her last memories of me to be someone that can't even recognize her or is detached from reality. If it comes down to it I'd rather take the assisted suicide route which we both have always supported.

But for now we're going to be planning a special vacation to Italy come this summer and have a more intimate time together in this next year and a half. I'm going to be disconnecting from social media for awhile - I might be back in a year if I'm still kickin.

Once again, thanks for everything guys. Just wanted to give one final update before I go. Semper Fi.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/avgaf3/update_i_49m_dont_know_how_to_tell_my_wife_48f_i/,relationship_advice,27816,895,0.0
in2thebleach,2019-02-27 04:31:14+00:00,"My babies and I escaped to a shelter for victims of domestic violence at 3AM last night... I’m scared, my kids are confused... I don’t even know how I feel right now but nothing seems real.","My children’s dad and I have been together for about 4 and a half years. The insults, emotional abuse and mental instability were apparent from literally day one but I think I was so broken and damaged back then I was just happy not to go to bed alone.  The physical violence started within a couple of weeks. I still remember crying on my way to work within the first month of us dating asking myself “Why are you in this? Why are you allowing this to happen to you?” after he drug me by the hair the night before through the apartment to the bathroom after I didn’t clean it to his standards. 
When I finally told myself I would rather be lonely than treated this way and was prepared to leave I found out I was pregnant and everything changed. I was always told I couldn’t have kids so this was my miracle and I wanted to see if I could make this family work. I spent almost the whole pregnancy in the hospital with HG and cardiac problems wracking up medical bills and losing everything including my car since I couldn’t work. By the time my son got here though none of it mattered... he was my world and the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. On the way home from the hospital my ex’s sister asked me if he had ever been abusive to me and it caught me off guard... I just said no and stared ahead as she told me of his history. Another dumb move on my part just hoping I could make it work. 
Almost every day there was some type of conflict... any inner turmoil or demons he faced would turn into him trying to take anyone around him down with him. My name basically became “cunt” and the bruises faded and new ones came and faded again. 
I became pregnant with our second child and nothing changed still. I still have the photos from when he punched me in the face and busted my upper and lower lips open when I accidentally burnt his pizza. 
Our baby girl arrived and once again was the most precious gift to me but things continued to take darker twists with every unstable mood he would come home in.  His favorite thing to do was tell our toddler son to “get a knife and stab mommy”
Last night was the end though. I have been saving to leave and was hoping to be able to be out by summer. The day started with him angry about nothing and coming home from work telling me I’m a worthless piece of shit. He left to go to a bar and came back around 11pm so drunk he could barely put words together but was still able to throw soda cans, objects and food at my head, start yelling the “n” word over and over again and call me every name in the book through his drunken slurring. After he threw something else and tagged me in the face I finally called the police and before they got there he took off. I filed a report and locked all the doors. 
He started texting me saying some of the most psychotic things like “I hear you beating the kids, stop beating the kids, why are you doing this. Let me in, stop beating he kids”, so I had to take pictures all over the outside and inside of the house to make sure I have time stamped proof he was out of his mind. 
I called an emergency domestic violence shelter I was referred to and they said they would get us in at 7 am but before I could even get done packing he busted down the deadbolted door so I threatened to call the police again, picked up the kids and ran. We got to the police station where the shelter volunteers got us safely to the shelter. I have never felt so much relief in my life but so much anxiety of what is to come. 
He has been texting me all day going between threatening messages and apologies. Saying he would rather the kids end up in foster care than with me and that he will make false CPS reports against me. 
The shelter is helping me get a protective order and build cases against him for both victims compensations, CPS, and custody and are helping with counseling and legal aid. 
It’s so strange to say it’s over... there is so much ahead but I’m free. My kids are free....

Shortly after we moved in together, about two years into our relationship, I learned my wife has an issue with getting these whiskers that grow on her chin. She told me it was because of a hormonal imbalance, but she was very good at plucking or waxing them so I wouldn't notice. She was very self conscious about them, so she tried to make sure they weren't present as often as possible. I completely understood that it was out of her control that it occurs, and I hardly even noticed because she kept on top of it so well.

  


Day one of when we started dating, she made it very clear to me that she hates beards on the men that she's with. She thinks they're very unattractive. Well, not on every guy. She likes beards on certain actors. But definitely not on me. So I have stayed clean shaven for her. If I even forget to shave, even for a couple days, she won't even kiss me because she hates the beard that much. She'll usually comment on it multiple times a day until I do shave. Progressively getting worse until I do the deed. But it's whatever, having to shave often doesn't bother me. I'm in the habit now of shaving every day or at least every other. If I could, I'd probably try to grow it out and see how I look with a legit beard, but my wife would definitely not allow it.

  


Back to the my wife's whiskers: since we've gotten married, my wife has gotten.. Comfortable. These whiskers of hers; she now goes weeks, even a month + without plucking them. After a whole month, these 5-10 whiskers are as long as the hair on my head (I have average length hair). Now, I love my wife to death, no matter what she looks like, I want that to be clear. But these whiskers: I'm not a fan of them. They're not soft, barely visible hairs, they're long, shiny, and resemble thick fishing line.

  


She gets on me about my appearance, especially my facial hair. After a month of her not taking care of her issue, I finally said in the most loving way I could ""Hey, babe, your whiskers are getting kinda long. Your coworkers might notice, maybe you should pluck them or something?"" She got quite offended. But, she took care of the problem. A few weeks go by, and once again, she let her whiskers get long. I make another suggestion that she should take care of them, this time, she completely shrugs me off. Says she's ""too tired and will do it later."" Keep in mind, she bought a handheld battery operated hair puller thing for this very purpose. It gets rid of the problem in under 20 seconds. I make a suggestion again a few days later, adding in very kindly that I love her, and don't much care how she looks, but I'm not a fan of them. Which again, she was offended, but took care of it. Now I'm stuck in this cycle of she let's it grow, I suggest to get rid of them, she ignores me, then I have to mention it more and more times before she does something about it. Always getting pissed off that I dare say something. It's at the point where if I don't say anything, she won't do it.

  


A few days ago. She was ripping me a new one because I wanted to have sex, but I haven't shaved my beard for a few days, and she didn't want to do anything since I was ""too scruffy."" It's been about three weeks since she's plucked her whiskers so they're at least an inch long. I snap and say ""this is bullshit, I shave almost every day for you. To look my best for you. But you won't get rid of those things on your chin once every couple weeks for me, even though I've kindly told you I don't like them."" and I finish with ""If I'm not allowed to have a beard, neither are you."" Needless to say, she was incredibly pissed and we did not have sex that night. We're okay now. I've shaved since then. She has not.

  


Was I wrong to have said this? Was I wrong to look at this a double standard? Should I have approached this differently?

I've been married for 7 years to the love of my life but I don't know how to break it to her my time on this little blue sphere is being cut a little short. We've been best friends our entire life (met when we were stationed together in the Marine Corps) and have confided in each other ever since. We've always held it together through tough times by finding ways to lean on each other over the last 30 years.

I don't know how to tell her and I honestly can't bare seeing her heart break knowing we won't be able to have the future we always wanted together.

thwowawayw123,2019-02-25 21:44:06+00:00,Husband [31] makes fun of me [25] around his family for earning little money,"We are married for six months now. He started doing this about two months ago and does it often since then. 
He earns about 3k monthly while I get just 750€. I work as sales assistant in retail, he is a process mechanic. That being said before we married he tried to convince me to staying home and promised to care about me but I didn’t want that, I also wanted to work.
Now he makes fun about my earnings, mostly on family events. He says things like “I need vacation. What about you go to work and I take some free time for myself? Oh but wait, we would starve with your pay, right?” 
“Get a real job”
“What you are tired? I wish you could work at our company for one day, then you would know what it is to be tired!”


I felt awful maybe because he is right, he pays our rent our bills and everything but I tought we had a balance by me doing all the houshold and paying for groceries, cook and so on.
I told him that I don’t like it when he makes my job looking worthless but he just says that it’s the truth because I dont earn much money. We started to fight because of this almost every day. I don’t know what to do. I tough about doing a second job but I don’t know how to manage it because I also do distance learning. Any advices?

PorcupinePenis,2019-02-25 17:51:15+00:00,Relationship advice needed for my grandmother who wants nothing to do with me but demands I deliver my toddler to her so they can have a relationship. Shit got ugly.,"So my gramma is 70 and is an eccentric millionaire by marriage. Her husband, my step grandfather is worth roughly $80 million. She has 4 kids (2 girls and 2 boys). My dad is her son. She and her husband have supported and doted on my aunts and their kids their whole lives. She created a business for my aunts and their daughters to run, has paid for my cousins college, bought them houses and paid for them to travel the world. She has close relationships with them, but has had nothing to do with us in terms of financial support or creating a close relationship with my sisters and I or my uncles daughters. 

My sisters and I do not feel entitled to any money or support, but watching her fund our cousins entire lives while we got into student loan debt and mortgages like normal people do has been a little polarizing but we’ve never said anything about it outside of to each other.

We see them every Christmas and Easter and randomly at family events, we grew up spending summers at their house with our cousins but she could never seemed bothered to get to know us, she only gave an effort to become close with her daughter’s kids.

Recently I had the first great grandchild (my beautiful 20mo daughter). My gramma lives 20min from me but complains that she never gets to see her only great grandchild because I never bring her over. Every time I see her she complains about it instead of spending that time actually getting to know her. 

Meanwhile, my parent, my wife’s parents, and my moms parents, drive hours to come see her, understanding that I work 80+ hrs a week and I get 1 day at home. My grammas excuse for not driving to us 1 town over is her husbands health is poor and she has to take care of him (they have in-home hospice care...)

2 months ago my aunts daughter (her favorite grandkid) had a daughter and her sister is now pregnant. My gramma drove 18 hrs with my papa to go spend a week with them and get to know the baby. I’m 20min away...so I’ve finally had enough of her bitching and last Saturday at my cousins baby shower, I let her know how I felt.

I heard her doing the same old shit passive but pretty aggressive shit, she was loudly saying to my mom while looking at me in the corner eye “yeah we just never get to see (insert my daughter’s name) because (insert my name) never brings her. Holding my little girl I walk over and say, “well instead of spending every time you see her talking about not seeing her maybe spend some time getting to know her.” She responds “well I’m busy entertaining you need to bring her in Sunday’s so we can have 1 on 1 time” and I replied “I work Sunday’s, you should come over and visit.” She said “I can’t I have to take care of your papa” and then I hit her with the old right there Fred; “well that didn’t stop you from driving 18 hrs to go see (cousin)’s baby for a week, I’m only 20min away and you’ve never made the trip.” Her eyes bugged out and she just walked away. As I’m leaving she asks to take a picture with my daughter “first time she attempted to hold her” and my daughter screams bloody murder for me. She thrusts her back in my arms and creates a scene in front of 40 people at this baby shower and screams “this is your fault, she doesn’t know me! You need to bring her over!”

I just told her I’d try to find the time so I’d mitigate exposure of my daughter seeing her scream at me.

Am I wrong here? I grew up with my grandparents (other than her) coming to us and making the effort. Why would I spend the few days I get with my daughter, delivering her to a grandparent who never cared to have a relationship with me, my sisters and my uncles daughters. I’m getting to the point that I just want to avoid them. Would I be robbing my daughter of a relationship my gramma seems to want to have?

zenmonkey99,2019-02-25 16:39:21+00:00,My gf of 3 years returned the engagement ring because she didn’t like where I proposed.,"I decided to propose to my gf of three years on our three year anniversary. I flew her to Vietnam and after a couple of weeks traveling we ended up in Cambodia. She had wanted to see Angkor wat and some other temples that were on her bucket list. After a long day of hiking in the heat through ruins we retired back to our hotel and when we were alone together I proposed and she said yes. We kissed and I had planned to take her to the waterfall the next day to celebrate. It’s really beautiful. She took a shower and I laid in bed thinking what an amazing day I just had and how I would get to spend the rest of my life with the women I loved. When she came out of the shower however she was in tears. She handed me back the ring saying she couldn’t accept it because she didn’t want her memory of my proposal to be in a hotel room.

I played it cool and said I understood but truthfully it hurt. It seems to me that I had offered her something of value. A lifelong commitment and partner. I took her halfway around the world and helped her cross off something she had wanted to do most of her adult life. I felt that if she valued me it wouldn’t matter that the proposal wasn’t exactly what she wanted. It was me and our future together she was saying yes to and not my delivery. If she had found a million dollars in a dumpster she wouldn’t throw it back because of where it came from. So she can’t possibly value me or what I have to offer as an individual if she’s willing to reject it because she didn’t like the place I asked. 

I’m preparing to end things when we get back. She wants me to propose again and better and then she’ll say yes, but I’m done. Am I wrong? Should I do it over? What do you think.

My lady and i will be celebrating 4 years together this coming May and are in the midst of planning a wedding this November. I proposed to her this past Fall after lurking on this sub and reading some advice that put things in perspective for me and made me realize i really wanted it. Through all of the stress of planning and financing a wedding ourselves, we have realized that we are spending WAY too much time worrying about what will make the event memorable for everyone else and forgetting the most important part, us. So we decided to make a decision for us, to keep explicitly between us and go ahead and tie the knot early. As of Friday February 22nd, 2019, we got married! We have been trying to keep it a secret as the only person we have told about it is our 2 year old daughter who has no idea what we are talking about, but my beautiful wife has agreed to let me share the story with Reddit. 

I want to thank everyone on this sub for posting your stories and advice. Even though i haven't posted any of my own stories, a lot of the advice that's tossed around on this sub has indirectly helped me in big ways. You guys are awesome!

Also, a major bonus that our anniversary is on Steve Irwin's birthday.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aul5px/my_secret_marriage_24m/,relationship_advice,6190,247,0.0
angrywifey__,2019-02-25 04:07:02+00:00,My(39m) daughter (16f) came out today and my wife(39f) cannot take it.,"This is very embarrassing to put up on my original account so please excuse me for posting from a new account.

We have been married for 17 years, together since high school. We have three children - a son and two daughters (17m,16f&amp;12f). We all have an amazing relationship and we are super close to the children. 

Next week we are hosting a dinner for a special occasion. Everyone from our families is invited. My son's girlfriend is invited too.

So, yesterday my daughter (16f) wanted to talk to me and my wife privately. She basically told us that she was gay and we were the only people she confessed to. She wanted to invite her girlfriend over for the dinner. I must admit that I felt happy because my daughter chose to confuse in us. The fact that she was comfortable talking to us about it made me proud. Somehow it made me feel like a good father. 

I reassured her that it was not something to be ashamed of and she would have our full support. This is when my wife exploded. She yelled at my daughter that she was 16 and she's just confused. She asked her she should date boys first because she can't claim to be gay without going out with boys. She also told her that no one in our families is gay( this isn't true and I'll elaborate on this later) and there was zero possibility of my daughter being one. She told her that she was not allowed to meet this girl and she didn't want freaks in her house. 

I was so angry at this point. My daughter was crying and apologizing for letting us down. I basically told my wife to keep her bigoted views to herself and took my daughter out for some alone time. I just reassured her that I would always support her every decision and be there for her and she could talk to me about anything. After we got home she went straight to bed. 

My wife didn't want to talk and told me that I loved my daughter more than her. She told me that she was the one who supported me through all my struggles and was always there for me. After that she just told me that she'd divorce me if I encouraged freaks. I was so taken aback by her behavior. This was totally out of character for her. 

Now, before painting my wife as homophobic, I think I know where this is coming from. Her brother came out to their family as gay. His parents supported his decision but he ended up taking his life because he was bullied. None of the children kniw about this and it was a very traumatic incident for her family. I asked her if thus was about her brother and she told me that he was nuts and refuses to talk to me.

How do I approach this. I want to be there for my daughter but I want my family. I want my wife to accept my daughter's choices. I feel like she just gave me an ultimatum. How do I make things better?

melancholique_,2019-02-24 14:09:46+00:00,Husband [24M] threw away my [22F] new anti-depressants.,"I have been married to my husband for 1 year. We have a 2 month old daughter.

I feel like I’ve always been somewhat “depressed”(/low energy) since adolescence. Ive never been the type of person to be overly excited or motivated by life. I suffered from anorexia when I was in university, and although that’s recovered, the feelings of low self worth are still there.

My husband is a stoic, “no-nonsense” kind of person. He is not very emotional, but loving in his own way. He is a trustworthy, hardworking, and responsible man.

After I gave birth to my daughter, I had mild postpartum depression.I went to see a therapist but did not take antidepressants since I was breastfeeding. Now, I’ve decided to formula feed my daughter. I have just been prescribed an antidepressant to take daily. It is supposed to have little/mild side effects.

I took only one dose until my husband saw the drugs and asked me what they were. I told him they were my antidepressants. He said, “You dont need them. You’re fine.” Then said that they have a lot of bad side effects and I’ll end up hating my life if I took them. I told him I just wanted to give them a try.

The thing is, I felt very clearheaded after taking just one dose. Maybe it was a placebo effect but I did feel different.

When I came home from work, my pill case was empty. My husband said he had thrown everything away, including my sleep meds, because he said it was better for my health. He also said that he doesn’t want his wife to be “high” all the time. Which is hypocritical because he smokes weed a lot. 

I was so angry. I can’t afford to just get another prescription. How will I tell my therapist? My husband told me to calm down and said it was all for my benefit.
I told him hes not my doctor. He said he knew me better than the doctor did, and he knows Im fine and I dont need any drugs.

What can I do at this point?

Advise?,"I'm 28 but I look young (maybe 21-23). The only thing that kind of makes me look older is my grey hair and I work in accounting (people don't want a young kid managing their finances). I'm not full on grey but have a nice salt and pepper look going on. My girlfriend doesn't like it and has asked me multiple times to dye it but I have repeatedly told her that I'm not going to. 

I woke up this morning to her combing my hair. I asked her what she was doing and she just told me she wanted to see what it would look like if she combed it a certain way. I thought it was weird but it actually felt kind of good so I just let her do it. Fast forward 20 minutes and she tells me I have to take a shower right away. This is when I noticed that it smelled like really strong chemicals and my hair was all sticky. Turns out she put on a bunch of Just For Men hair dye in my hair and pretty much all my greys are gone. Not only that but it was the wrong color brown and I looked like I was wearing a toupe. 

I got really pissed at her and stormed out. Bought a hair clipper and just shaved my entire head. She's been apologizing all day via texts but I don't feel like responding. What should I do? We've been together for a year and everything else has been fine. I can't believe she would do something like this  because we've barely even fought before.

DeNined,2019-02-23 18:46:43+00:00,My (20M) girlfriend (19F) won't stop calling me Onii-chan during sex,"I'm sorry if this is long, but I have a lot on my plate right now. I'm using an old, shitty account from like 3 years ago for this because I don't want this to become a permanent mark on my main one.


So before I get into the meat (heh) of things, I want to provide a little context first.


My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 6 months, and recently we've started to have sex for the first time ever. We're both our firsts. I'm a mixed black and white dork standing at 6'1 while she's a pale, short dork standing at 5'4. She's always been a bit shy but that's probably what attracts me to her the most. I really want her to open up to me about anything and everything. Her interests, her anxieties, her desires, etc. I just want her to be honest with me while I do the same for her. I don't think either of us want to have some sort of surprise secret coming out of nowhere in the coming years, so it's best to be open early on. We're both looking for something long term and exclusive, likely to get married and settle, and possibly have a kid or two.


But there's one thing that's been bugging both of us lately.


Keep in mind that neither of us have any sort of Asian ancestry whatsoever. That's going to be important for later, probably.


About a month ago we played a fun, harmless game of truth or dare. We didn't do anything stupid, just talked about some of the interesting things that have happened in our lives so far. I asked her if she ever kissed a girl before. She said no but she did actually touch lips with a girl when she ran into her in elementary. Good, my girlfriend is straight. We laughed it off, I called her a dopy little klutz, harmless fun and games, right? Then the next question.


Have you ever watched hentai?


Now she's a big anime fan. Me, not so much. I would consider myself a very basic anime fan. I grew up watching DBZ and that's pretty much it. I've seen Akira, Cowboy Bebop, FMA:B, and a couple others on my own terms. But sometimes we watch anime together, and she's into some shit I've never heard of before. But again, it's all harmless and just for fun.


I told her yes, I have watched hentai before, but mostly as an experiment to see if I actually like it. I kinda did, kinda didn't. A lot of it is very rape-y and I like my porn to be more wholesome. I told her this and she says that she watches hentai semi-frequently. She told me she's glad that she was finally able to tell someone this. I'm glad that someone was me.


Fast forward to a week ago.


We decided to bump bellies for the first time and it was absolutely amazing. We do a bunch of twists and turns and all is well. But then she hits me with this:


A ""Yes, Onii-chan!""


At that moment, I tried to internally solve this with advanced algebra and calculus and shit. By the time I solve the Pythagorean Theorem of this angle she's as red as a tomato. She realized what she just said and starts breaking down crying.

For the next half hour I get her to calm down and told her that it was completely okay. People let things slip during sex all the time, and it's nothing to be embarrassed about. Harmless.


I take her home, tell her everything is going to be okay, and go about my night peacefully. She texts me the next day saying it won't happen ever again. Great. We both agree that our first time didn't count since neither of us got our socks rocked off.


Fast forward to last night.


We're rockin' and a-boppin' all night long, and again, it's fantastic. This time I got to ult and now it's her turn. I go to town down there and she hits me with another one of these:

""Right there Onii-chan.""


I unplug my lips from hers and what do I see again? Another cherry tomato. At this point we're both visibly frustrated. I take her home again, but this time I don't get a text.


I've never known what Onii-chan actually meant, just that it's used in hentai a lot, so I decided to look it up this morning. Apparently it means ""older brother"" in Japanese. So I'm connecting the dots and have come to the conclusion that she's watched so much hentai that it's started to affect our relationship. I don't want to leave her. She's cute, sweet, and we play Switch together. No one plays Switch with me.

My question now is, does she want tall, dark, and kinda handsome? Or does she want Onii-chan? Does she want me to RP as her older brother, or does she want me to go 2D like Paper Mario?


tl;dr My gf has called me Onii-chan twice now and it's looking like there's no end in sight. I am absolutely perplexed on what my next move should be.

We've been together for 4 years. At the beginning, like all teenagers do, we also fooled around, she was genuinely turned on and wanted to do stuff but we never got to penetration. We were both virgin and to her, virginity was always the best thing she can give me, it's ""the only thing she can give only to me in the whole life"" and to be honest, that's why I\[21m\] didn't push for it at all and wanted the take her pace.

Around 2-2.5 years ago, things started to cool down. She no longer wanted to do it as often and a year ago she started pushing away even though I would ask twice a month when I was sexually frustrated. I really loved her, and I still do, and I think she is smart, intelligent and beautiful and that's why that wasn't a deal breaker for me.

Two weeks after our 4 years mark, she said she felt trapped and that she wanted to take a little break from our relationship. I was crushed because I didn't see this coming at all. Her ""trapped"" definition was that she felt bad going to concerts and doing stuff without inviting me, and to be honest, I always encouraged her to go with her girlfriends and have fun, I have a feeling she trapped herself? I think she just wanted to take a break and couldn't come up with a better reason or the real reason was offending to me or she just lost attraction although she denied it. We talked it through and we decided that we will take a break and she will call me once the break is over. She was supposed to move in with me in may.

It took a toll on me, I performed bad at my work and I was distant from my family, I was crushed and I hoped she would come back and that we would cry together, agree it was a mistake and move on.

Well, after around 3 weeks, she messaged me and said she wanted to talk. I was so excited and I invited her to my house. When she arrived, shortly after, she basically broke down crying, saying she met a guy\[23m\] 2 weeks ago and that after 3 days they slept together. She said she tried to connect with him but it wasn't nearly as fun as with me and that she wasn't sure why she wanted to take a break from me in the first place. Now, I consider myself 7-8/10, I am tall and work out semi-regularly. She assured me that it wasn't my looks. She said she wanted us to be together again and that she would do anything to earn back my trust and make me happy. The guy she slept with was 10/10 and a lot of muscle, although I didn't him or anything about him.

This happened yesterday. I am broken. I couldn't come up with words and just said it's gonna be okay and later politely asked her to leave so I have time and space to think. I can't help it but feel like a backup plan, she sacrificed our 4 years together and basically made me a fool for waiting for sex and thinking that I am something special for her. It bothers me so much that she was ready to fuck some guy, less than a week after we broke up. Even if we get back together, am I supposed to have sex with her now or what... 

I will provide more information if needed, but I am really struggling for some advice on what to do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/atuxe9/she20f_lost_her_virginity_while_we_were_taking_a/,relationship_advice,3594,1461,0.0
awakenomad,2019-02-23 04:39:32+00:00,I just experienced the most embarrassing moment of my sexual history (35 F),"NSFW
I have been having a weekly hookup situation with someone I met on tinder (33 M) for about 5 weeks. Tonight he said ""I bet I can make you squirt."" And I was like ""Yeah.  Whatever. I don't do that."" 
Long story short, I do. 
After it was over he looked down and said ""why are your sheets so dark?""
I had no idea what he was talking about. I stood up and there was a huge dark stain. My first thought was maybe I started my period. It was dark and I couldn't see well. I played it off and walked him out of my apartment. Then I went back to investigate. 
I turned on the light. It was brown. I sniffed. It was shit. I literally orgasmed so hard that my shit liquified and leaked out of my ass and I didn't feel it. I realized that I layed there with my ass in a huge puddle of shit having pillow talk with him and I didn't fucking notice at all. 
I. Can't. 
I texted him the truth. I wanted to lie, but I didn't. He texted back ""have a nice life""
I died 
Then he texted ""just kidding. I'm proud of myself."" 
I'm still dying.

thekittymancer9000,2019-02-22 23:35:28+00:00,My (14f) girlfriend is being abused by her father and i really need help.,"I'm using a throwaway account for obvious reasons
Reasons and I do have her permission to post this.

I'm (15m) and I met my girlfriend 3 months ago, she has aspergers and is an incredibly sweet and amazing girl.

We met at a theatre group and when we finally admitted our feelings for eachother everything seemed fine, except for her over apologizing for everything.

When we met up for the first time outside the group we had talked on the phone for a while and she had said her dad was a bit harsh but I really had no idea how ""harsh"" that meant.

She told me her dad hit her and that was the first point that I got worried, I asked her if she ever thought about doing something about it and she told me not to worry.

Over our calls she tells me how she's made to feel shameful about basic things about growing up, being human and on top of that, emotionally abused to the point that she didn't feel human.

She also has multiple self harm scars from that time, but has currently stopped cutting herself.

At school she only has one friend who seems to a terrible friend and very manipulative/mean to her.

She's told me that essentially I'm the only one in her life that's genuinely nice to her.

She is worked to the bone because after 5 days of school she also has to attend a polish school and then have the theatre group leaving her with no days off at all.

It was at this point I became extremely worried.

Her family tells her she's fat when she's quite obviosily and in no uncertain terms, skinny.
I'm worried she could also develop body issues.

Here's where it gets bad though.
Today after having a lovely day together chilling and watching movies we lost track of time.

she was supposed to be home by 9pm and my mom thought that her parents were picking her up while we thought that my mom was taking us back so we thought that my mom would call us to go.
This didn't happen and by the time we realized it was already 9:02pm.

She called her parents and got picked up and I thought all was fine.

Obviously it wasn't.
She called me when she got home with tears in her eyes saying that we weren't allowed to see eachother anymore.

Later she texted me secretly telling me her dad screamed at her the whole way home and called her whore, slut, idiot, etc etc etc...
She then revealed that her whole family was told that she was a whore by her dad.

I finally ""snap"" at this point and suggest getting CPS (child protective services) involved.
She's hesitant as she has a hard time in new situations and is naturally nervous about possibly getting taken away.

I make the argument that either stay in the abusive home and possibly be further mentally scarred or be brave and take a chance for a better life.

She agrees and I ask her if there is anything else that her family has done to her for me to write up about to make a case.

The next part is so despicable that I don't recommend those who are easily saddened or disturb read further.

She tells me that her dad, when she was younger punched her in very sensitive spots, including her vagina.
And also that he ""accidentally"" walks in when she's dressing.
He gets physically close to her.
and undresses in her presence sometimes.

Also she told me that one time when she was self harming her dad caught her, and threw her across the room and mocked her.

When she cries she tells me she's also mocked by her dad.

She tells me that her mom and dad will hurt her if we stay together.

This is all I can remember.
Sorry for the grammar mistakes I wrote this in a hurry and in a rage.

As a moral person I cannot allow this to happen to someone I care about.

Please I need advice and if you can share this.

I'm deeply scared for her.

She told me that she's worried tonight her dad will hurt her while she sleeps.

kbratz85,2019-02-22 22:21:29+00:00,Thanks r/relationship_advice for being so blunt!,"I (33f) posted in here about 2.5yrs ago under an old profile regarding my marriage. The post was taken down by a mod for violating a rule or two, though I’ll be damned if I remember which. However, I did get some great comments. My old post had to do with the shit way my (43m) husband  was treating me—financially abusive, emotionally neglectful, cheating, lying asshole. At the time I was still a stay at home mom to my younger two girls, and he was becoming increasingly hostile towards my oldest daughter from a previous relationship. Well reddit, it took a while, and a few more really hard lessons, but in September 2018 I moved out of my marital home and into my very own townhome. If I had never posted here, I would only have my own perception of the relationship, instead of knowing how it looks to others. I now work full time, go to college part time. I started to open up to those close to me, and garnered the support I needed to gtfo. I had originally arranged to move out on a Monday while he was at work, but Murphey’s law kicked in at the last minute and HE STAYED HOME SICK THAT DAY! My oldest daughter had stayed home from school to help me move, and we had reserved a moving truck, so when she asked what we were going to do, I told her we would move anyway. He slept through my first load, having no idea of my plans because he’d have been even more financially abusive if he knew what I was planning. When he realized what was going on, he got very angry, lots of threats etc. But, I got out, we worked out a way to coparent without wanting to murder each other (often), and divorce is somewhere in the future. Sorry if this isn’t for this thread, but I just had to say thanks for being so blunt about my failing marriage that it made me cry sad and angry tears. I needed it.

PureNewt3,2019-02-22 19:37:30+00:00,My (23f) boyfriend (28m) says my vagina is too big,"So my boyfriend and I have been dating for about 5 months and he told me yesterday that my vagina is too big ""for my size"". I'm somewhat on the smaller side (5'3"" 135 lb) and he said I must be lying about how many guys I've been with. When we first started seeing each other we spoke about our past and I told him I've been with two guys before, both longterm boyfriends (which is the truth). We haven't talked about that since until yesterday with him saying that my vagina couldn't have been stretched out that much from just two guys and I had to be lying. I asked him why he is bringing this up now if it is such a problem and he said he always thought it was big and just didn't want to bring it up until now. I told him that really hurt my feelings and that was a horrible thing to say and he just said he just wants to hear the truth about who I've been with in the past. I told him he is an asshole and left and haven't spoken to him since yesterday.

I just want to point out as well that neither of the guys I was with in the past ever seemed to have a problem with the size of my vagina and neither of them were that big either (but both were bigger than my current bf). I don't have a problem with my boyfriend's size and enjoy sex when we have it, but he said he has a hard time finishing inside me because ""he can't feel anything"". When we first started going out it didn't seem to be a problem, but recently I have been needing to finish him with my hands or mouth for him to go.

I don't know, this just really hurts. He not only insulted me by saying I have a loose vagina and he doesn't enjoy having sex with me but also basically said I'm a slut and I'm lying to him. There isn't like there is anything I can do about it if I am too big (I looked). He is a great guy otherwise and I really love being with him and it is just really hurting me thinking he is going to end our relationship over this and that he is capable of saying those things to me.

cuddledishbone,2019-02-22 11:59:47+00:00,"Fiancé(31F) threatening to end relationship, if I (27M) go to training for work.","Backstory first. Growing up, I always wanted to work on cars for a living, but my family didn’t like this idea. After being pressured to take a state government job, I ended up working in Law Enforcement at 21 years old. I few years in, I became very withdrawn from everyone in my life and was diagnosed with severe clinical depression. At 25, I decided that I didn’t want to stay in that field for the rest of my life and left my job to go to a trade school to pursue what I’ve always wanted to do. While in school, I took a part time job to get by and to have some form of income. While working part time, I became romantically involved with my boss and we started a serious relationship. Eventually when got engaged and began living together. 

This all brings me to now. I few months back, I graduated from school and found the “job of my dreams.” As with most vehicle manufacturers, you are occasionally required to leave town to attend manufacture training for a few days. Recently I learned that I will be traveling several states away in April for a 3 day training. My fiancé lost her mind when I told her. 

Her first reaction was telling me that I will cheat on her while out of time. I have never cheated on anyone during my life and I don’t plan on becoming that person now. I calmly told her that I would never do that. She said, “that’s what all guys say before they cheat on their spouse on work trips.” 

Her second reaction was to say that, “you’re going to decide you’re happier away from me while you’re gone and decide to leave for good. You may never even come back.” I once again reassured her that this is not the case and that I love her very much. 

After trying to calm her down and explain that it’s just for work and to progress my career, she told me that if I go, it’s inevitable that I will cheat on her or leave her, so if I want to keep our relationship, I can’t go. She said if I decide to go, she will end our relationship in advanced to avoid the paid of me being out of town. 

I’m not sure what to do here. Do I save my relationship or keep my “dream job.”

OkServe6,2019-02-21 21:19:45+00:00,Update: My (22F) married sister (28F) and boyfriend (22M) had drunk sex yesterday,"Sorry for not updating earlier. I didn't know people got so invested into this. I tried to read most of the comments. 

Why didn't I do something when I saw them? I guess people have different reactions to certain situations. I was too shocked to do anything and went back to bed. 


I decided to talk to my boyfriend first. Tried going into it open-minded but I was still very emotional. I took him in our bedroom and asked him if he remembered ANYTHING from that night. He asked me why, and I told him that I had seen something happen and that's why I was upset. He looked really surprised at this point and went quiet. I asked him again, and he didn't respond. This was enough for me, so I stood up and wanted to walk out when he told me to wait. He said that he made a really big mistake but to please hear him out. I lost it right then and there. I started screaming and yelling, told him to get the fuck out the house. My sister came into the room and she started crying and telling me to please calm down and allow them to explain. My boyfriend told her that they should leave and they did. I was still hysterical when they left. I started drinking and passed out in my bed. 

I haven't answered any of their phone calls or opened their messages. I truly have no words for how I feel. It all feels like a game. Life doesn't feel the same way, and I'm done. I told a friend what happened and she's been with me since then so there's that. I feel relieved that I no longer have to worry about my problems though. 

I'm sorry it's not the update people expected but it's the best I can do :)

Some of you may not have been around to read the comments after I posted this, but some more details on the situation that I didn’t initially say were posted by me when a redditor (who has since deleted her comments for the sake of privacy) related to me and explained how her ex was the same way and seemed to have a video game addiction. Her experience eerily mirrored mine. You can read my responses [here.](https://reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/as5j3z/_/egsxna3/?context=1)

Yesterday after work I had to rush home to deal with some family stuff, so I did not get to sit him down and talk to him besides a five minute phone call and passing him at work.

Today, however, my path was clear and I was determined to speak to him about this. When I woke up and showered, I checked the Xbox app and saw that he was last online 30 minutes ago at 7am. Which means, again, that he did not sleep at all. I didn’t contact him. His day off was today, and he called me at 3pm to say that he just woke up. I could hear Overwatch in the background and he asked how my day was going and immediately before I got to respond very angrily said “why the fuck won’t this guy get off Hanzo? he fucking sucks.” I had a client approaching me and swiftly hung up. 

I called him back after work when I was walking home and I decided to start with small talk before I got to the subject I was leading to. I didn’t even have a chance to start off with the small talk before he asked me why I was slightly out of breath. I said it’s because I am walking through snow up a hill. He said “it’s snowing?” In NYC today it snowed heavily for quite a few hours. His place is built that you can’t enter the hallway to the kitchen and front door without seeing outside. He didn’t even look outside of his window at all today and has spent all day in his bedroom playing video games. 

This snapped me into asking him if he is planning to do anything else with his life besides play video games. He said “of course, just not right now.” He had not showered or eaten at all today. (I asked, and he admitted it.) I asked him if he thought that was healthy and he said with an edge “What? playing video games? of course. Am I fucking smoking meth or something?” I clarified on this and just decided to say it. I said I think he has a problem. The skipping work, not sleeping or eating, and overall the pure amount of hours he dedicates to playing them. He then did what most addicts do, got angry and then spun it back on me. 

He said that I bought him the xbox in the first place (“what the fuck did you expect me to do with it”), and that I’ve been playing video games long before we were a thing. (my xbox is mostly used as a netflix machine and to play overwatch/the dark souls trilogy on weekends.) I said I do not obsess with them or skip meals to play games and that I would have never bought it for him if I knew this it what it would lead to. He got angry and asked if I just called to harass him. I said I called to speak to him and let him know my thoughts over the past few months. He said I was crazy. That “everyone plays video games.” And to whoever said that the streaming was just a decoy and an excuse to play video games all day, you were absolutely right. He feels justified in doing exactly that as long he tells me that there’s a goal to it all. 

I told him that my mind isn’t changed and that I think he has a problem and should speak to someone. He said nothing to this. I then said that I don’t feel we have anything more to really speak about and that I can’t spend my time worrying about him. I feel like I am going to get hate for this, but I won’t budge on it. He is not my child and I can’t force a grown man to eat or go outside. I have done my research and slept on it. **MANY** people PM’d me and commented to tell me their stories of dealing with a loved one with video game addiction or that they were once in his shoes. This is not a battle I want to be in. He is not the person I met last year. He responded to this with a very mellow voice that he knows he’s been inattentive and would like a chance to make it up to me. He said he wanted to go on a date tomorrow. I declined and he started rambling about how perfect I am for him. I thought the same once. He kept going and said I’m being ridiculous and starting telling me the things he could be doing instead of playing video games. Such as “I’m not a drinker, I don’t cheat”, etc. 

I am sad because before we dated, he really was a good friend. I said that I almost home and have to go. He stayed quiet for a while and said okay. The fact that the video game noises didn’t stop during the duration of the entire phone call didn’t go unnoticed by me. (he only lowered the volume, but not enough.) I didn’t bring it up because I don’t think he would get off even if I asked him to. We hung up and that was that. Luckily, I only see him in passing at work and I will now make sure to not see him at all. It’s a huge building, it isn’t hard.

I would also like to note that I got some very pleasant PM’s calling me an absolute bitch for not supporting him in playing video games. That I’m gonna regret everything when he’s a famous streamer. (ok.) Down to saying that I only care about him skipping work and potentially being fired because I’m in it for his money (?????) I am prepared for more of those messages for now abandoning him. 

And I am still going to Japan. 

TLDR: I broke up with him and you guys were right, he has a video game addiction and needs help. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aswnoq/update_my_24f_boyfriend_29m_is_trying_to_be_a/,relationship_advice,18632,1969,0.0

We've been together for four years and everything has been going so well. We recently signed a new lease too. Can't believe it's my sister, can't really put into words how I feel. I just need to vent right now.

She asked if she could stay at our apartment for some time because she had a very big fight with her husband. I asked my boyfriend and he was fine with it so she came over. They have a dead bedroom and it's one of the reasons for their many fights, he has no sex drive and they haven't had sex in over a year. She looked a little bit upset and brought a bottle of tequila with her. 

Around 9 or so she opened the bottle and she joked about drinking away the pain. My boyfriend joined her, and he doesn't usually drink. I didn't have any because I had work tomorrow but he didn't. I went to bed soon after, and they kept talking and I figured it would help them connect more. I woke up at 1 and went to the bathroom. My boyfriend was still not in our bed, and that's when I heard loud moaning from the living room. I made my way to the hallway as quiet as possible, and I saw my sister with no bra on, obviously riding my boyfriend. She didn't care about all the noise she was making. I couldn't see him because of the couch but I didn't want to. I went to bed and cried myself to sleep. I just didn't know what to do.

I was woken up by my boyfriend somewhere during the night. He was not even close to coherent and making absolutely zero sense. He stumbled and fell and went into the bathroom. This morning when I woke up I found him laying next to the toilet with vomit on his shirt. I woke him up and asked him if he was ok. He just said he had a very bad hangover and looked very confused. He says he can't remember a single thing from last night, so I showed him the empty bottle in the living room. He just laughed and said it had been a long time since he blacked out on alcohol.

My sister was already awake and I asked her how she slept and how much they had to drink. She said my boyfriend drank most of the bottle and that they both went to bed around midnight. She definitely acted strange. I just can't believe why they would lie like this. I left for work and my boyfriend called as usual during my lunch break. He said he was feeling better and acted like nothing happened. He could tell from my responses that I was upset and asked if I was alright. I told him I was fine and left it at that.

I need to go home within an hour or so. I told my boyfriend I had to run some errands but I'm just sitting in my car, crying. I feel so hurt and betrayed. I literally can't believe it.

Since learning this, he has since wanted to become a streamer. Now every time he plays a game, he streams it. I stated in my title that he’s “trying” to become a streamer, but he really isn’t trying at all. He’s just streaming what’s on his screen from his xbox with no face cam or even a mic. He said to me that he’s *really* shocked he doesn’t have many viewers. I tried gently explaining to him that streaming/youtube is all about your personality to no avail. He’s also really camera shy and doesn’t even have many pictures of him over the years to the point where his mother gave up on trying to get him into family photos. So I don’t understand how being a streamer would even work for him or how he thinks it’s a good idea. He also sits very quietly muttering an occasional “fuck” as he plays video games. The popular streamers he’s trying to emulate have natural humor and commentary. And he just doesn’t have “it” if you know what I mean. He even mentioned that I should start streaming because I’m pretty okay at some games. I laughed it off and said I have no interest. In a past relationship I have been called negative, so I didn’t wanna just shit all over his parade. For some background, he is in school to be an architect and has a good union job and gets paid pretty well. So it can’t just solely be a money thing. This week I was doing errands and he said he was going to go pick up his laundry and the groceries for me to cook dinner before I get there. When I did get there, he was sitting in his room in boxers streaming for no viewers and the laundry/groceries still hadn’t been picked up even though it had been 6 or so hours. This really pissed me off but I didn’t say anything. We have a trip to Japan coming up in June and he is now talking about buying equipment for his stream. Expensive equipment. My money for the trip has been put away for a month and he still hasn’t started saving for it. I am afraid that he will spend money on equipment and our trip will go to ruin. The other night he said to me happily that he has one dedicated viewer that watches every time he’s on. What he doesn’t know is that twitch counts you as a viewer when you start the stream so the follower he’s talking about is himself. I just really didn’t have the heart to tell him because I know how embarrassing that would be. It’s become a point of annoyance every time I hear the word streamer. Any advice here? Or should I just let this twitch dream fizzle out without my input?

lasvegascuckolding1,2019-02-19 01:41:44+00:00,"My (26M) Girlfriend (24F) of 3.5 years uninvited me from a trip to Last Vegas in January, only to be unfaithful and carry on an affair with a family friend (37M).","  

This has been a whirlwind of events. I am in shock writing about it and need an outlet to express whats happened.

My GF and I have had an amazing relationship and always wanted a future and family together. This all changed and I no longer know the person I once loved. Full disclosure: I have never suspected my girlfriend was capable of something like this. She has had the wool over everyones eyes. 

In 2018, myself, my gf and her mother planned a weekend trip together to Las Vegas for her moms friends 60th birthday. Plane tickets were bought, accommodation arranged, and a whole weekend of events was planned from Jan 11 – 14. What could go wrong. 

Come Christmas time, said friend (60F) from Las Vegas flew up to our hometown (where she is from), with her extended family to celebrate Christmas in Canada. She has a son (37M). Over Christmas eve, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day, we hung out at this families Air BNB house in our hometown and I got to know them very well. I consider myself to be very observant, and I noticed zero interaction between the son (37M) and my girlfriend (24F). After Christmas, the family flew back to Las Vegas and awaited our arrival for the January weekend.

Here is where I should have clued in, which I partially did, just not to the extent that would have helped. About a week before Las Vegas, my girlfriend informed me that the boyfriends of couples who were supposed to fly down to Las Vegas had bailed out on the trip, and slowly the trip was turning into a ‘Girls Trip.’ My girlfriend never outright expressed to me she didn’t want me going, but did her best to ensure me I wouldn’t have fun there. 3 days before we leave, my girlfriend outright tells me I cannot come; Accommodations have been rearranged and I’m no longer invited on the trip. Given that I had paid for this trip, I was visibly upset. I expressed that I didn’t feel as if this was a partnered decision but rather her trying to intentionally exclude me from something I was invited to. Ultimately, she left the decision up to me. I decided it didn’t feel right at this point to go unless I was convinced she wanted me there, which I wasn’t. Friday came and went, she flew with her mom, I stayed home. 

My girlfriend ended up losing her passport down there. (The lie detector test determined that was a lie.) She stayed a few days extra and flew back. She met up with me the following Friday and told me she no longer is happy in our relationship and wants to break things off, hoping that we will get back together in the future. I protested, but understood from our current spat that something wasn’t right and that we should go our separate ways. Maybe one day we would get back together. 

This leads us all to today. For the last month, my ex girlfriend and I have been communicating on and off (phone and texting) but have never seen each other. She has been extremely busy preparing for her teaching practicum (so I thought). She and I would both initiate conversation, and discuss our relationship and talk about working things out in the future. She and I both told each other we had no interest in seeing other people. On valentines day, she even messaged me saying how we should be together and she misses me.

After struggling to move on with my life I decided today was the day I would head over to her parents house (where she lives) and express my feelings and ask if this could be worked out once and for all. By pure coincidence (because nobody else was home at the time) and the kindness of a step-father, the truth was revealed to me.

I called her house and asked her step-dad respectfully if he’d allow me to come to the door and speak with my ex. Him and I got along great and he said I’m always welcome to come and talk but unfortunately, she is not there and neither is her mother. She is in Banff during her ‘busy practicum weekend’. Her step-father sat me down and began with this: “I’m assuming you’re here because you don’t know everything. If you knew everything, I don’t think you’d be here. I have been told by GF, GF mom, and other family members not to tell you anything, but I have a lot of respect for you. My ex-wife of 10 years cheated on me and I know how it feels. Anything you ask me, I will answer completely honestly.”

Confused, I sat down where everything had been explained to me. My girlfriend had begun an affair in Las Vegas with the son (37F) of her moms best friend. Every weekend since, he has been flying my ex-gf down to Las Vegas to meet him and this past weekend took her to Banff with the whole family. Keep in mind, he is divorced, and has 2 kids (8 and 10). I am absolutely disgusted and feel sick about what really happened. I don’t even know how this happened. 

I cannot thank this man enough for telling me the truth which nobody felt the need to pass onto me. I feel betrayed, deceived, heartbroken, and angry. Suffice to say, I am in an absolute state of shock. 

I simply texted her saying “I know everything, never contact me again,” and my phone has been blowing up ever since. Her demanding to know who told me, her denying what has happened, her being angry with me. 

I’m completely lost reddit. I thought I was going to marry this girl one day. How does someone change in the blink of an eye. I learned more about my girlfriend in 30 mins than I did over the course of 3.5 years. 

Where do I go from here? Advice very much welcome.

**TL:DR** – My girlfriend of 3.5 years uninvited me from a trip to Las Vegas only to cheat and carry on an affair with her family friends son. She has been lying to me ever since and has been flying down to Vegas and other cities to meet him and stay with him and his 2 kids.

plsletmebeirish,2019-02-18 21:59:59+00:00,Girlfriend (25F) constantly says that I (28M) am not Irish.,"This might be a little complicated so allow me to break it down.

&amp;#x200B;

I was born in Galway, Ireland to an Irish-born mother, and an American born Arab father. I guess you could say that my father's physical characteristics really showed up on me. I look like I am full born Arab, I have darker skin, blackish hair and I, if I'm being truthful, barely look Irish. 

When I was 13 for various reasons we moved to the United States, where I continued my education. A lot of kids around my age believed that I was not Irish, usually citing things like not having red hair and being white. Although I was used to being lightly teased in Ireland as a child, I was not used to people telling me that I was not Irish. When I was in Ireland nobody questioned it, because believe it or not diversity exists in Ireland. (To some degree lol.) 

Okay when I moved to the United States I kept a lot of my culture, my religion, and my love for Irish folk music. I joined an Irish-American organization in my city, where I have for the past few years played music and shown people traditional Irish instruments. Irish culture/music is very important to me.

Alright okay let's go onto my girlfriend, we've been together 6 months. She is an educated American woman who currently works as an assistant for a magazine. (Not sure if that's important.) When I first met her she asked where my accent was from (I feel my accent is 80% Irish, 20% American.) When I told her I was Irish she met me with absolute disbelief telling me that I am not Irish. When I asked her why she said that she said,""Because you definitely don't look Irish"". Okay that's fine, stung a bit, but I had become accustomed to it by then. This whole conversation occurred many times over the first months or so we were together where she insisted I wasn't Irish anytime it came up. (Often).

One fight we had was after I performed for a small crowd at this Irish-American organization. She explained that my voice was amazing, but was better suited for another kind of music. I asked her what she meant, and pried for an answer. She reluctantly told me that it looked kind of bizarre to see an Arab guy play music for a bunch of old Irish people. I explained to her how hurtful this was and I really wished that she could see why I identify with my culture.

It recently broke into a full scale fight (which is why I'm posting) when she introduced me to her coworker. She originally told me that she would be introducing me to a girl named Orla. This being an Irish name I knew that something was coming. When I met her friend my SO introduced me to a ""real Irish person"". Orla greeted me very pleasantly in Irish, and we had a very polite conversation. This set my lady OFF, and has lead to our biggest fight to date. She actually interrupted and said,""Does he look Irish to you?"". The girl explained to her that Ireland, especially Galway is pretty diverse for Ireland. My lady got annoyed and said,""But is he *Irish?""* to which the girl said yes of course.

SO was noticeable cold to me after that. When we got home I asked her essentially what the problem is and why she denies me the privilege of acknowledging my place of birth. She got pretty gruesome and told me that it looks pathetic when I sing Irish tunes, go to pubs, and talk in Irish. She said that it was and I quote ""Poserish"". I told her that she is going to have to let it go, and think about how hurtful it is to tell an Irishman he's not Irish.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a summary of reasons she claims that I am not Irish:

1. My father wasn't Irish, therefore I cannot be Irish
2. I have lived in the United States longer than I lived in Ireland.
3. I don't look Irish. (This has wavered in the past few months, but came up with the last fight

Reasons why I believe I am Irish:

1. I was fucking born there, to an Irish mother.
2. I was taught to speak Irish.
3. I visit multiple times every year to visit my family, never have any problems about being Irish there.
4. Yes I've lived in the United States longer (13 years in Ireland, 15 years in US), but I've stoutly retained my Irish culture.

&amp;#x200B;

With all that said, she's been an amazing lady and girlfriend, usually is very gentle and calm. I don't understand what makes her so hatefully protest the idea of me being Irish. Also please don't think I am unhappy with living in the United States, I love this country and it is my home. Period. The US has given me so many things, and I am very grateful.

&amp;#x200B;

So I come to ask, what do you think reddit?

Well guys, I did it last week. I started vaccines.

I took them to our county medical office on a day that accepted walk-ins, we waited and they got the first round, about 4 combos each, with another walk-in suggested to me for 3-6 months to catch up the rest.

They cried so hard! The oldest kept crying off and on for an hour afterwards, so I took them to a Chick-fil-A for ice cream and playing to distract them. I took the bandaids off before we returned so my husband didn't notice.

That whole day, before I left and when we returned,  I thought somehow my husband knew, or would figure it out, but here we are about a week later and he's got no idea.

And guess what? They're perfectly fine now, no complications! (As I expected, DUH)

I don't want a prize or a cookie from y'all or anything, after all I remember to feed them and bathe them so vaccines are just another important and required step of parenting.  

I do want to say thank you so much to those that encouraged me to do this even though my husband was not in agreement.  I don't want my marriage to have any lies, but for THIS, it was the right thing to do.

Lastly, and most importantly:

For any parent out there in the same situation with your partner/spouse (many, many of you DM'd me) YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Take care of your kids and get them vaccinated, even if you have to go around your spouse like I did. It's worth it.



Tl;dr:  I vaccinated them last week. Husband has no idea. Walk in vaccines are available at the county health office, no appointment needed. Ice cream followed afterwards.

fuck1000s,2019-02-18 12:44:00+00:00,I (36M) found out that my wife (35F) of 10 years has been cheating on me from the past 2 years.,"I've been married for 10 years. My wife and I have 2 kids. I'm more of a freelance writer so I stay at home while my wife has a regular 9-5 job.
We both use the same laptop (important for later) for non-work purposes. Today, I felt like checking up my FB. When I went on the website, I saw that my wife (let's call her W) 's account was opened. She must have forgotten to log out in a hurry. I promptly went on to log out of her account, but just then a message popped up. I opened it out of curiosity (it was a guy, I couldn't resist). And my whole came crashing down. The message was- ""Hey! Excited for today ;p"". I scrolled up their msgs, and died a bit every time. Nudes, sexts, weekend plans, making plans to avoid me and the kids, everything you don't want your wife doing with another man. And this supposedly started about 6 months after she gave birth to our second child.

Significant_Cupcake,2019-02-18 10:00:50+00:00,[Update] I [31m] found torn-up remnants of a Plan B box in the kitchen garbage. My wife [27f] should have no reason to use emergency contraceptive because I had a vasectomy years ago. I talked to her.,"I would like to preface this post with an apology. I know it has been nearly three weeks since I last posted. To be honest, in no world did I ever imagine people would continue to show so much interest in my situation. I've been online long enough to know that a few weeks here is like an eternity in the real world. Not to make excuses, but since my life just fell into the gutter, rolled into a drainage grate, took a trip through the sewer system, and then got eaten by that random ass giant spider from the original It, I have legitimately not had the time or the heart to update you. For that, I am sorry.

For the people who are legitimately concerned about me, thank you. It is encouraging to know that thousands of people are thinking about me.

For the people who wanted to see my situation go about as bad as possible and play out like a Greek tragedy, I apologize that it is probably not nearly as interesting as you are hoping for. 

Now to start where things left off.

After making my original post, I combed through all of the comments to find reasons as to why she might have torn up a Plan B box and thrown it into the garbage. A lot of them made sense. My greatest hope was that it might have just been old. Maybe it was before we even met. Clinging to that, I hand wrote a flow chart of all of the routes our conversation might take. I'm awful with confrontation and considered every possibility before bringing it up, what I would say in response, and what I would do. I memorized them all.

On the evening after I made my original post, I called her into the living room when she got home from the gym. As I had practiced, I asked her the following question:

&gt;Hey, I'm not accusing you of anything, but could you tell me why there was a torn up Plan B box in the garbage? 

The second the words ""Plan B"" left my mouth, she immediately looked like she had been punched in the stomach. She was completely lost for words. I already knew at that point. I retained eye contact and repeated my question.

&gt;Why was there a torn up Plan B box in the garbage? You know I had a vasectomy. 

She just mouth breathed, looking at me horrified. Then she looked to the floor. Then she started weakly sobbing. 

This was not on the flowchart. I had no idea how to respond. I thought if I let her cry it out a bit she might give me a real answer, but she just kept sobbing. Finally I prompted her with another question:

&gt;Are you crying because you did something you regret?

She shook her head violently. I was so concerned because I thought something horrendous might have happened.

She abruptly shrieked ""I'm crying because my fucking husband doesn't even trust me."" I have literally never seen a person that angry, let alone my wife.

So I prompted her again. 

&gt;Just tell me why it was there. You don't have to hide anything from me.

She yelled at me again. Repeatedly. ""If you don't trust me, this marriage is hopeless."" ""Fuck you for not trusting me.""

This line of questioning repeated itself until she told me to get out of the house. I refused and said that until she was upfront with me about why the box was there, I wasn't budging an inch. She then informed me that either I had to leave or she would leave. Since I doubted she had anywhere to stay (her parents don't live anywhere near us), I agreed to go to let us cool down and have a rational conversation like adults later. I went to my best friend's house, the guy who was best man at my wedding, and we got drunk and talked about everything but her.

The following night, I texted her asking if she was ready to talk. She was not. Instead, she gave me an ultimatum: I had to [1] apologize, [2] promise to never bring it up again, and [3] learn to trust her completely. Only then would she allow me back home. If I couldn't do all three of the above, she was done with me.

I have not returned home and we have now been no contact for over two weeks. I am wearing out my welcome at my best friend's house, who has been nothing short of amazing. I currently have a consultation with a lawyer arranged this afternoon. The lawyer will probably tell me I'm an idiot for leaving the house, and she'll probably be right, but the idea of ever stepping foot in that house again makes me sick to my stomach.

There is legitimately nothing my wife could say to salvage this marriage. I am entirely numb to her, what she's doing, who she's with, or anything else even tangentially related to her. None of my family members know what happened and as far as they're concerned we're still the happy newlyweds. I'm holding off on saying anything until I'm calm and rational and won't do something I'll regret in the future.

**tl;dr** yes, she cheated, yes, the marriage is over, and yes, I feel awful about it. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/arvpxh/update_i_31m_found_tornup_remnants_of_a_plan_b/,relationship_advice,57374,6392,0.0

xanyou,2019-02-17 06:59:06+00:00,Boyfriend (26M) hit me and I (26F) am worried he's dead,"This is all so fucking crazy, I wish I could just rewind and start over.

I've been dating my boyfriend since we were 20 and he was always very charming, handsome, and respectful. Basically the perfect guy. My parents loved him and I love him so so much, my heart physically hurts when I think about what he's doing to himself.

He started doing coke more as a social thing - we moved to a new city because he found a better job and his new work friends did it. The first time he did it, I freaked out and was all like what the fuck are you doing, because I do not like drugs one bit. He thought it was fine because it was ""classy"" since it's expensive and businessmen and celebrities do it. I'm not shitting you, he literally said that to me. I thought he was fucking insane but I obviously couldn't stop him. I tried to deal with it and think, okay it's just for fun and it's not affecting his job or anything and we seem fine.

He kept doing it and it drove me insane. A fun treat turned into a habit and when I tried telling him he needed to get help, he'd tell me he had it under control and that he didn't need to do it, he just liked it and didn't wanna deprive himself of feeling good. Btw, he acted like a complete asshole when he was high. Talking a lot of shit and acting like he was super cool. It was nauseating and embarrassing to see him acting like that - the charming guy I loved was gone and replaced with this disgusting, narcissistic character.

I even told him once that I wanted to do it with him because he liked it so much and I wanted to see the hype. I thought he was going to say no to protect me from it. Nope, he got extremely excited and helped me do it. It was okay, I guess, but not anything I would be willing to prioritize over my life. He saw it as a bonding moment and felt more open to talk to me about it, how he wanted to do it together again and how the sex was so much better.

We have been through so much because of this. He's been in rehab twice but left and he's a grown man, I can't force him to do anything. Our parents don't know. His parents were sending him some money when we first moved to help us get started in a new place. They don't send money anymore but he still doesn't want them to know. He doesn't want me to tell my parents because he doesn't think it's their business or a big deal. I feel so incredibly embarrassed as well. I've always been a good kid, never the one my parents had to worry about and my mom would probably have a heart attack if she found out about this. 

He came back from rehab and he kept using. Then one night he just disappeared. I tried calling his bitch ass friends and his job and no one knew where he was. I found out he was fired weeks before for fighting someone and destroying shit. He called me in the morning and was just being a condescending asshole, making fun of me for being worried about him and laughing. It was the weirdest shit. I didn't see him for days and it was horrible. He wouldn't tell me where he was. 

Then he came back home one night randomly and came into our bed. I was so fucking mad but I was worried about where he was so I let him stay. I was crying and made him promise he would stop or else I was leaving for good. I even got up and packed up a few bags to scare him and it worked, he promised he would never use again if I didn't make him go to rehab. So I agreed that I would take care of him. I took off of work, fed and bathed him like he was a baby. I think he had started using something else too because he just seemed so messed up. He was depressed and angry at me, it was horrible to watch. 

Eventually, he got over it and it felt like we were the closest we'd ever been and we loved each other so much. We talked about everything, things I'd never told him before, and it felt like we were on cloud nine. He was determined to stay clean and I believed him. We were okay for a bit, probably one month. 

My parents were coming to visit and I was really excited about not having to hide anything - we were good and we didn't have to lie about all that stuff anymore. We could just forget about it. Well, he disappeared again the day before they came and he stole $1,200 from me. I can't even describe how it felt waking up and the house being empty. I couldn't even tell myself he went to the store or something. I knew he was gone. Typing this out, my hands are shaking. I hated him so much for doing that to me. My parents came and I had to lie and say he had a last-minute work conference event or whatever shit, I don't know. They knew something was wrong but didn't say anything. I hated lying to my parents but how was I supposed to tell them - oh yeah, you know that amazing guy you've known for years? He's addicted to coke or crack or some shit and he stole my money and lied to me and I've been lying this whole time and he has no job and he's a fucking lying bitch ass. 

When they went home, I went into a depression. I was just thinking about how he came home and we were together and things were so so so good and how everything was actually bullshit. He was so skinny and felt self-conscious about it and didn't want me to see him since I became bigger than him but I didn't give a shit about that, I just wanted him healthy again. When he was going through withdrawal and was sick, I would give him baths every night since he couldn't do it himself. Even when he got better, he didn't want to have sex and I understood. And then one night he asked if I'd take a bath with him. I asked if he was having a bad day and not feeling good but, he gave me this cute smile and just shook his head. I was so excited that I had him back. He really fucking tricked me. Shit. 

He ended up coming home a few days later. He was high as shit and didn't even care. He was just smiling and ignoring me, giving me this look as if he was so much better than me like looking at me and smiling or furrowing his eyebrows and shaking his head and laughing while I yelled at him, as if I were crazy or something. I told him I fucking hated him and he ruined my life but he didn't care. And then I said I was going to tell our parents and that got his attention. He started cursing at me, calling me a bitch and slut and whore, things that didn't even make sense. I told him off for stealing my money and he took it out of his bag, saying he actually still had half and threw it in my face. I tried telling him to get out but he said he wasn't going anywhere since it was actually his house. We bought the house together. Yeah, he put more money into it but he hadn't been fucking working for months and I was paying for everything. Then I did something really stupid. I don't know why I did it. I took my phone and said I was gonna call his parents and tell them that their son was a fucking loser crackhead. I was just trying to scare him - I would never call them like that, in the middle of a fight in front of him. Anyway, he was yelling at me to stop and he pushed me on the wall and we struggled for a bit. He tried grabbing my phone but I had quick reflexes and I'm pretty petite so I was able to just pull away from him. Then he grabbed my hand and put his arm on my chest to hold me down and was calling me a bitch and screaming at me. I was yelling back and tried pushing him off me and pushed on his chest and his shoulder and then he slapped me really hard on my cheek. Like, swinging his arm, left a ringing in my ear, bruising kind of hard. He had never hit me before - he used to never like play fighting because he was scared he'd accidentally hurt me. 

He let me go and I just sat on the floor and cried. He got really fidgety and I could tell he felt bad about it but he still did it. He told me ""c'mon get up, it wasn't that bad"". I told him I hated him. Then he had a panic attack or something, he started breathing really hard. He just mumbled he was sorry, grabbed some money from the floor and left. 

Two weeks later, he called me and was crying and said he was sorry for everything and wanted to come home. I said I never wanted to see him again. He begged and promised me that he would go to rehab but I told him I was over his lies and he promised that he'd get clean for real this time but I kept saying no and that he needed to call his parents. 

Then he asked me if I'd come see him in the hospital if he OD'd and I told him no. He cried harder and said he didn't want to die and he was gonna be good for me. I knew he was lying and probably ran out of money or something. I hate myself and think about this every day but I just hope him I hoped he died and hung up. That was a few days ago and I haven't heard from him and I am so scared that he's dead somewhere or passed out on the street and in need of help. I can't believe I said that to him and feel so horrible - that's not the kind of person I am, I would never wish death upon someone, especially him. I don't want him to die. I was just trying to hurt him. 

This is so long and I'm sorry but I can't tell anyone about this and it's killing me. I think about everything that happened between us, all the little details that he probably never noticed or remembers. I feel depressed and on edge all the time. My mind is always thinking about him, hoping he's okay. I feel like I wasted my life on him and don't know what to do. I've been dealing with this nightmare for so long and I still miss him so much, my heart physically hurts. What did I do to deserve this?

gothchick99,2019-02-16 22:23:59+00:00,I (40F) have lost my best friend (42F) because I can't forgive her husband (41M) for being a sex offender,"Having a bad day and I miss my best friend, let's call her Vix, who I used to talk to about everything.

A few years ago, Vix stopped returning my emails and was reluctant to meet up. I was a bit puzzled and hurt, but thought it was because I had a new baby (she's not really a child person). I didn't bug her, as life was pretty busy, but I made the effort to stay in touch and her emails, when they came, hinted at stress in her marriage. 

I liked her husband. My husband and I went to their wedding, we socialised a lot. He was fun. The only real tensions in their marriage seemed to revolve around their disappointing sex life and his lack of career ambition (she earned twice as much and paid for everything).

Anyway, knowing Vix as I do (she likes a drink and a flirt) I thought perhaps she'd had a fling and they were working through it, or perhaps he had cheated on her. I knew she would tell me if and when she felt ready. No judgement from me.

Nothing could have prepared me for the drunken phone call I received just before Christmas. She told me that six months previously there had been a knock on the door in the early hours. it was the police paedophile unit.

They arrested her husband and seized all their devices. It turned out he had been downloading pictures of underage girls. Apparently if you are under 18, you are classed as underage online, she gave me the impression it was a 'naughty schoolgirls' type site, not small children. She chose to stand by him and he swore it had happened only a few times and that there was nothing else she didn't know about.

Until the day she got home from work to find the police arresting him again and searching their house. It turned out that over a period of a year, he had been secretly filming their shower and had kept recordings of her female friends - and of Vix's 13 year old god daughter showering. He was fined, banned from social media and put on the sex offenders register.

But Vix took him back. She had some counselling and has since always acted as if everything is bright and breezy, saying that he is a good man who made a mistake. She says her other friends have forgiven him and know he is a good person. I am the only judgemental one who can't let it go.

In my mind, a mistake is forgetting your wife's birthday. A bad mistake is getting drunk and having sex with someone else. This is on a whole different level.

My husband was appalled and angry and has point blank refused to ever see her husband again. I have seen her a few times but it's strained and she has asked if I'm 'ready' to see him yet.

I'm not ready. I will never be ready. I never want to set eyes on him and I wish with all my heart that she would leave him.

But I miss her, so badly. I love this woman. She is amazing. We were so close before this crap blew everything apart. Part of me is tempted to say I forgive him just to get her back, but then I look at my daughters and imagine someone doing that to them, and my heart shrivels up. I just can't do it.

onestgentil,2019-02-16 15:13:50+00:00,Boyfriend [36M] has not told his kids that their mother died several years ago. Am I [30F] right to be disturbed?,"I have been with my bf for 5 months now. He is a great guy. A bit reserved at first, but hardworking and responsible. He has 3 kids from a previous marriage: 11F, 8M, and 8F. For the longest time, he never told me what happened to his wife. Said he doesnt like dwelling on the past. I thought she might have passed away because he has sole custody of the kids, but he never said anything. Thought it wasnt my place to ask. 

Then, just a few weeks ago, I was babysitting and asked the oldest girl if her mommy ever came around to visit. She said that her mommy moved away after her younger siblings were born and that she’s so busy that she can never visit them. But then she showed me emails and even letters/postcards which her mom apparently sent her. The email was quite recent, like from the previous day. I thought it was odd for a mother to never visit her kids for so long. 

Finally, last week, I asked my boyfriend why his ex wife never visits them. He then told me emotionally that she was actually dead. She committed suicide because she had postpartum depression when the twins were 1 years old. The eldest girl was only 4 at the time and doesn’t remember much. So he decided to tell her that she moved away for work. Basically he’s behind the hundreds of emails and letters she’s been receiving over the years.

He got really emotional and was about to cry. He says he knows its fucked up but he said he didn’t know how to tell his daughter that her mother died. That he thought the lie would buy him time, but now it’s gone on for so long it’s too late. He says his oldest daughter even shares her stories of their mother with the twins and they all look forward to 
seeing her again one day. 

His former wife’s family were apparently fighting for custody of the kids after her death, saying that he was an unfit father and stuff like that, but ultimately the courts gave him the kids. The kids haven’t seen their grandparents or aunt since before their mother’s death. My BF has cut off all contact with them and they don’t know his current adress or phone number. Likely to prevent them from telling the kids the truth.

This is so many layers for me to unpack. I think its really freaking unfair to not tell his kids that their mother is dead, and has been dead for 7 years now. I mean, no matter what he says to them, he’ll be lying, unless he tells the full truth. He’s defending himself by saying the kids aren’t old enough to know yet. I think thats BS, 11 is definitely old enough to know. 

And doing the thing with the emails and letters? That’s just next level fuckery. I can’t believe he actually thinks it’s a good idea.

What should I do? I love my boyfriend, but this is some serious baggage he’s been carrying. The kids are convinced that their mother will visit them anyday now, and my heart breaks for them because it will never happen. The youngest girl even thinks that *I* may be their mother. She’s asked me that many times now.

I don’t even know how to begin unpacking all this. What can I even do? Or is this beyond my paygrade?

TL;DR: BF admitted that he hasn’t told his kids yet that their mother died 7 years ago, is sending them emails pretending to be her.

My boyfriend and I were getting intimate and doing the deed. Before we started I had to pee, but I figured we wouldn’t be going for very long and I could go after. Well, when we were doing it, I had to pee even worse. He put his fingers in and was doing that for a bit and then I couldn’t hold it anymore. It’s like, it wasn’t even me. I pissed. All over him. And then he nutted. He told me this was the hottest thing we have ever done. He said that he always knew I could be a squirter. He was so excited and even licked some off of his hand. It was piss.

I’m soo fucking embarrassed. Like every time I think about telling him, I get knots in my stomach. He keeps talking about it and I get grossed out because he basically drank my piss.

EconomySwimmer,2018-09-30 21:07:24+00:00,I [22F] found out that my boyfriend [26M] of eight months is secretly a massive creep," 

Because I recently discovered his reddit account and his post history on here is extremely worrying to me. On a post with a gif of a young teen girl doing an acrobatic exercise he commented how she was a ""beautiful, cute nymphet"" and then proceeded to argue with another user about how it was ""perfectly natural to be attracted to girls that age"". On a post in a porn subreddit one user said how the girl ""looked 13"" and he replied something along the lines of ""I know, right? So hot. Wish more adult women had her built."" And more, comments about how he thinks young teen girls are hot.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what the right term is and I don't really care, for me being attracted to girls that age is definitely pedo territory and it makes him a massive creep in my opinion. Now I don't want to stay with him any longer, obviously I'll break up with him, should I just do so without telling him the reason or should I tell him that I'm disgusted that he's such a creep and is trying to justify his sick desires online? Another thing I've wondered about is whether I should let others know. He doesn't work with children or teenagers but for instance he has friends who have younger sisters around that age and maybe he's not the kind of person they'd like to keep around.

Hi guys!

I'm back with the long-awaited update. But first, thank you all who responded on my first post and gave their advice! I definitely wouldn't of asked if it weren't for all the positive comments!

A lot of you suggested that I just shoot him a text and give him an update in terms of my situation and then ask him if we could meet up for coffee (dinner seemed too much like a date) so I could return his sweatshirt and thank him. That's basically exactly what I did. 

I shot him a text and told him that I had filed the police report and that the police will be in contact with me. Then I asked him (in a double text) if I could take him out to coffee to thank him and return his sweatshirt. He actually didn't respond for a good day and I was really starting to feel like I'd totally overstepped but then he did! He first told me that it was great that I filed the report and then he asked me how I was feeling. He also said that I didn't have to thank him and that he was just doing what anyone would've done if they were in that situation, but that a quick coffee sounded good. So we scheduled to have coffee on a Saturday morning. 

Going into our meeting, I was actually super nervous for some reason and ended up being 15 early. So I sat for about 10 minutes, fidgeting with his sweater and waiting for him to show up. To be honest, I wasn't even that sure I knew what he looked like. The entire night is still pretty jumbled and when he was walking me back, I barely paid any attention to him (it was also super dark) since I was just replaying what happened over and over again in my head. I just remembered he was tall and had a nice smile. 

Then, this really tall dude walks in and scans the shop and then sees me and gives me an awkward smile and waves. I didn't know what to say after our initial niceties, so I just blurted out, ""Wow, your eyes are actually blue, I thought they were brown haha."" I wanted to dig a hole and crawl into it after I said that but he laughed and said, ""Yea they can be deceiving in the dark."" Then we ordered coffee (he refused to let me pay and I almost fought him to pay) and sat down. First things first, I gave him back his sweatshirt and he thanked me. We ended up chatting for two hours about mostly random stuff, like our classes, our summer, the Office (which is also my favorite show), politics, music, etc. I also asked him why he decided to call me ""Maddie"" when he was trying to save me and he told me he read an article somewhere that if you pretend to know a stranger who's in trouble, you're most likely to help without escalating the situation or getting you or the other person hurt. 

So yes, he's sweet and caring and devilishly handsome and we really clicked. But he didn't seem that interested in me, not that it was a date. So we then went about five days with no contact until I came across a meme about the Office and decided on a whim to send it to him. It ended up being a good decision since we ended up talking until 1:00 am. Next morning, I was feeling bold again and after much debating, I sent him a text that said, ""Hey, can I please take you out to lunch? Coffee didn't count since you didn't even let me pay for you."" He said yes and this time I managed to successfully pay for our meal. We had a really great time again but as we were leaving the restaurant I realized that he left his phone on the chair so I grabbed it and gave it to him. (This is important later on). 

About two weeks later (he went out of town but we were still sporadically texting), he sends me a text that said, ""Hey, can I take you out to dinner to thank you for grabbing my phone?"" OMG. He's too cute. Anyway, of course I said yes and now we're going out to dinner tomorrow night. 

Ahhh I like him a lot but I have no idea how he feels about me (I can't tell if he likes me ahh). Maybe I'll ask him over dinner tomorrow. :) But so far, that's what's happened. 

TL;DR: I asked him out to coffee! Then I asked him out to lunch! Then he asked me out to dinner!

flounder19601953,2018-09-29 18:10:46+00:00,UPDATE: Friend is mad at me because I wouldn’t buy essential oils from our other friend who works for an MLM (all of us 25/f),"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9ixgnw/friend_is_mad_at_me_because_i_wouldnt_buy/?st=JMNR3SBL&amp;sh=f8b43b16


This isn’t the update I wanted to be writing. A lot of you made correct predictions the other day: Katie is absolutely in Cara’s downline. She just started making Facebook posts about the essential oils she’s selling. I think this is probably the final nail in the coffin of our friendship. Which I’m sure sounds dramatic, but hear me out: 

Katie and I have been friends since high school, but the main thing that held us together these years was being burnouts: neither of us went to college, both of us just got shitty jobs out of high school and did nothing productive. When I was 22, I decided I was sick of making $12 an hour, and I went back to school. After three years of busting my ass, taking credit overloads, and doing evening classes after summer internships, I recently graduated with a CS degree and got a coding job with a top 10 tech company. While I was in school, I had a difficult time making friends (probably because I was older than everyone else), and I clung very hard to my high school friends like Katie.

My friendship with her definitely was strained, though. She seemed to think that me bettering myself meant that I looked down on her. Things started getting really difficult when I started getting high-paying internships. They got worse when I got an extremely well-paying job right out of college and she saw what kind of apartment I was able to afford. (Katie lives in a very small apartment with a roommate). She would talk about how school had “changed” me for the worse, and how I thought I was better than her. Some of it was just her projecting insecurity, but some of it was also probably tactless behavior on my part. 

The truth of the matter is that I DO think Katie is capable of being better, and it frustrates me that she’d prefer to buy into a pyramid scheme than get an education. Her parents still have her college fund, and have told her that she’s welcome to it (it’s something like $100k; way more than she’d need for 2 years at a community college and 2 years at a state school) if she chooses to go back. But I guess she’d rather get rich quick hocking essential oils. 

Anyway...it’s pretty obvious that Cara is Katie’s mentor now. And after the smackdown I laid on Cara about what a bad businesswoman she was, and how essential oils are stupid, I’m guessing Katie is probably done with me. To her, it probably just seems like yet another example of me looking down on her. I appreciated what a lot of you said—about how friendship shouldn’t be predicated on buying things. But I think I also just need to accept that we’ve outgrown each other, and this would’ve happened soon whether she got into essential oils or not. I’m still sad, though.

Tl;dr friend is selling essential oils. I think our friendship is probably over. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9jz6mi/update_friend_is_mad_at_me_because_i_wouldnt_buy/,relationship_advice,1903,117,0.0

flounder19601953,2018-09-26 00:01:05+00:00,Friend is mad at me because I wouldn’t buy essential oils from our other friend who works for an MLM (all of us 25/f),"So up until very recently, I honestly had no idea that essential oils were sold by MLM companies, or that people thought they had healing powers. I’ve been diffusing them for a few years because I like that they’re cleaner and safer than candles &amp; incense. That’s the only reason. 

Last week, I invited 3 old friends from high school over for wine and appetizers—just a typical hangout. My friend “Katie” invited “Cara”. Cara went to high school with us, but I was never close with her so I wasn’t friends with her on Facebook or anything. As soon as Cara saw my diffuser, she said her side job is selling essential oils and basically starting pitching me. It was pretty obvious right away that she works for a MLM, but I honestly didn’t care. The way I saw it, since I used these oils all the time, I’d rather support someone I actually know than give my money to some company on Amazon. So I told her to shoot me a Facebook message later and we could talk about it.

Anyone who’s familiar with MLMs knows what’s coming next. I was prepared to pay a bit of a markup, but the prices were insane. Cara wanted close to $30 for something I could get for $5 on Amazon. So I thanked for her reaching out and told her the oils were way out of my price range. 

Cara tried to tell me about how her oils were “more pure” than mine and how they have healing powers. I told her I just go to the doctor when I’m sick and I don’t need the oils for anything but making the room smell nicer. Then she got a bit nasty, told me I’m poisoning myself with my cheap oils, and said I wasn’t smart enough to see the opportunity she was presenting me with. Basic MLM stuff, and I barely know Cara so I didn’t care. 

The issue is this text I got from Katie yesterday. She said it was really rude of me to “lead Cara on” and make her think I was going to buy something, and that she didn’t think I was the kind of person who’d buy from a “faceless corporation” over supporting a friend who “owns her own business”. She said I didn’t need to start buying all my oils from Cara, but it was “downright disrespectful” of me to not at least try her product and see if it was better. 

I honestly stared at my phone for a straight minute after I read that message. But I finally sent the following reply: 

“I didn’t waste Cara’s time by hearing her sales pitch. I was legitimately interested in her product, until she mentioned it was six times what I normally pay. Any legitimate businessperson would understand how important pricing is to people, and would be smart enough not to back a company that charges that kind of markup. Personally, I think it’s a bit of a stretch to call Cara a business owner. I think an actual business owner would know better than to insult a potential client after they chose not to buy anything. And they certainly wouldn’t turn around and trash that potential client to mutual friends, as Cara clearly did with you.” 

It’s been over a day and Katie still hasn’t texted me back. She’s obviously acting like a jerk, but she really is a good friend and I don’t want this to end our friendship. Should I reach out? What should I say?

Brookelyn0567,2018-09-25 10:55:47+00:00,This is his girlfriend...,"Hey guys just wanted to jump in and give my small bit of say. I am his girlfriend and tonight he met with me to tell me how much of a gold digger I am and gave me the link to this Reddit you all have been talking about me on and said ""That's what everyone thinks of you"". I wish I could describe the pain this has caused me. We only partially discussed finances, and we only see each other about twice a week. We hardly go on any dates, the other night we had top ramen and watched Netflix movies in his room and I was very happy. I make my own money, I pay my own tuition out of pocket, going to have a great career and I consider myself very self sufficient. I am very proud of him for being able to finance (not own) a house. I asked if he would keep it if we were together and married and he said ""yes"". I asked if he would rent it out to offset the expenses of another mortgage we could share 50/50 on together and he became very defensive saying I was trying to make money off his childhood home. I never tried to offend him, and only asked bc I saw a marriage as more of a unison type thing. I already said I would get a prenup with him, so I'm also not sure why he is bringing this up. 

In conclusion, there are always two sides of every story. I am not a monster or a gold digger. We go on very cheap dates  every few weeks ($10-$30) and I've thanked him every time he would offer to pay. I have paid for some. I just wanted to give my say in this. We are no longer together as of tonight. I sincerely appreciate everyone who took the time to give an opinion stating that there may be more to the story than he is willing to share. I hope I have a partner who loves me enough to give me the benefit of the doubt, and talk to me in a more positive light.

Beth asked me if I had any questions, and I basically asked what her next steps would be. She said that she would have asked me to remove the posts so that things could be handled with discretion, however I had already removed both prior to the meeting.  She also said that she would be meeting again with Coworkers 1 and 4. She also said that due to coworker 3's threatening comments, he had been escorted out of the building while we had been speaking. Fired. Apparently he was already on record with them, for another issue relating to his temper, and this was the last straw.

She also asked me why I had not brought coworkers 2, 3, and 4 to her attention before. And I cited the section on harassment from the company handbook, saying that harassment was repeated unwanted comments or actions. And that a single event is not usually considered harassment unless it is extreme. The conversations with those three men had been isolated incidents.

She asked me if I would be more comfortable taking a personal day for the rest of the day, while she speaks to Coworkers 1 and 4. She said she wanted to make it clear that I was not being dismissed or escorted out, I was not getting fired, it was only a precaution so that I would not be around Coworkers 1 and 4, in case either of them wanted to confront me personally. I said I would.

So that's where I'm at right now.

AMillionMoons,2018-09-21 22:49:59+00:00,I think I'm (28f) in an abusive relationship with fiance (31m) of 7 years.,"I'm on my phone, sorry. 
He's done a lot of mean things to me. He has hit me before on more than one occasion but only when I let things escalate to that point. I'm usually pretty good at keeping him happy and calm although I do feel like I'm walking in eggshells most of the time. 
We live together and he likes it when I tie his shoes before he goes to work. If I don't do this, or anything that he wants, he makes me feel bad. He will pout or say mean things until I do what he wants. I usually just do what he wants to avoid the drama. This includes sexual stuff as well. I have to make sure not too much time goes by between me getting him off or he complains saying he needs it to feel normal and content. He forces me to let him touch my breasts and if I resist he says my body is his body and I should be grateful he appreciates it. 
My parents are ready to move me out tomorrow. I've been staying with them since Wednesday night when he randomly started yelling at me in a restaurant, calling me a cunt and telling me to go fuck myself  then kicking me out of our apartment without my phone or anything but the clothes on my back. It's been so long since something like this happened but I think it's only because I cave to everything he wants and anticipate his needs so well. 
This is abuse, right? Even if sometimes your happy and in love? And it doesn't happen all the time? Why do I feel like I don't want to leave him even though he makes me miserable and anxious? 
He keeps messaging me asking me to come back and saying that he will change but I don't think he sees his behaviour  as a problem and he just expects things of me because I've been doing it for so long and don't complain. I feel like he's confused as to why I'm leaving because I've put up with it until this point.

The-SillyAk,2018-09-20 14:11:14+00:00,Why after breaking up with someone does it feels like the relationship never happend?,"My ex left my country to go back at home after 5 months of dating about 3 months ago, we broke up about 6 weeks ago after trying long distance.

I don't view her stories, I don't look at photos of her and we don't talk anywhere near as much as we used to. Obviously for me, it still hurts, but I guess it takes a while for me to get over things.

In relation to my question: I decided to have a look at her fb profile and have a look at her most recent photo... I stared at it in slight agony and thought, fuck this is weird. It's literally like she's a stranger and our relationship never really happend. She came into my life, had an intense rship with me and left as quickly as she entered. At one point we talked all the time, everyday and were in eachothers lives, now she is back home, we've both moved on and it's like she's a stranger again because we are on opposite sides of the world and only talk infrequently about on the surface stuff.

It's kinda sad but it is what it is. I've been struggling emotionally with the breakup, I don't think about her as much, only when I'm not busy and have time to think about it.

crappythoreauaway,2018-09-19 12:57:10+00:00,"My (28M) girlfriend (26F) blatantly flirted with her coworker in front of me, then freaked out when I confronted her about it.","Hi Reddit. So backstory, my gf and I have been together for a little over 2 years now. Everything has been going well overall, but lately I’ve been getting some weird vibes, and last night just kind of made me start re-thinking everything. 

My girlfriend started a new job about 6 months ago and over the last couple months I’ve noticed her talking more and more with a coworker, we’ll call him J. Just texting and stuff after she’d get home at night. She wasn’t hiding it, and I want her to have friends at work, so I didn’t think too much of it at first.

But last night I came out with her to a work function, and met J. Or I should say, I stood around next to her while she talked to J non-stop, giggling and touching his arm and just clearly flirting with him. He wasn’t as obvious about it (probably since I was there) but it was clearly a normal interaction for them. I decided not to say anything at the time, since she was around her colleagues and I didn’t want to cause a scene. 

When my gf and I got home, I was furious. I asked her what the hell she was doing acting like that with another person in front of me, and how disrespectful it was. She immediately freaked out, started crying, saying things like “How can you not trust me after all this time?”. I didn’t know what to say and it was getting late, so I dropped it, and we went to bed. 

I don’t know what to do. Should I look through her phone? Is this a sign that something is going on behind my back? Am I being an idiot? Please help me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9h4wrh/my_28m_girlfriend_26f_blatantly_flirted_with_her/,relationship_advice,1879,660,0.0

heresjohnny94,2018-09-17 18:01:13+00:00,[UPDATE]: I (31M) am sterile. Fiancé (27F) miraculous got pregnant and baby looks nothing like!,"[I am sterile. Wife miraculously got pregnant. Baby looks nothing like me. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/998rf6/i_31m_am_sterile_fianc%C3%A9_27f_miraculously_got/?st=JM6JAKEL&amp;sh=cbeeeb7b)

I don’t even know where to start. Part of the reason I didn’t update right away was because my thoughts have been all over the place as of late. I have been making major adjustments and dealing with a lot. 

My daughter is not actually mine. While it was incredibly hard to get through at first, I think that a small part of me was already mentally prepared for it. I just had a feeling. I hoped it wasn’t true and I convinced myself that I was doing this just to rid my anxiety but I think deep down I knew. 

I took a lot of the advice given and I thought about it for a few days. After deciding how I was going to approach the conversation I asked my fiancé to drop the baby off at her Mother’s house so we could have a night to ourselves. I made dinner and then tried to talk about things that we had been going through recently and how our lives had changed since having the baby. I explained that I had been having bad anxiety and that I believed that it was partially caused by becoming a new parent but also the fact that I was sterile one minute and then told we were having a baby the next. Right away she saw where I was going with that and she did get a bit defensive. She continued to tell me that “miracles happen” and that she couldn’t believe I didn’t trust her. I explained that I saw exactly where she was coming from but asked that she saw it from point of view as well. We argued and she refused to do the test. I told her it was fine and that I would leave it alone. 

I wanted to leave it alone but she kept bringing it up all night even after I had apologized and said that I wouldn’t bring it up again. She kept telling me that she couldn’t believe I would think of her that way and that I should just “be happy that we have a beautiful healthy daughter instead of trying to accuse her of cheating”. That’s when I started to question her. Something just didn’t feel right and I knew I had to do the test regardless. I did the test the next day and waited a few days. By the end of the week I found out that she wasn’t mine.

I cried for about two days straight, I just couldn’t handle it and I had no idea what I was going to do. I tried to spend as little time in the house as I could because I knew she would see something was wrong right away. I struggled with figuring out how I would let her know that I knew. I also contemplated wether or not I should say anything because I knew that this would change things with my daughter. I  finally decided to just tell her. Of course she denied it and said that the test was wrong and that I need to just drop it. I explained that the clinic said there was no way this could be an error. She continued to deny it and I just couldn’t believe that she would still lie to me straight to my face. 

She threatened to leave and take the baby even though she has no where to go seeing as her own mother doesn’t want to get involved. We’ve been pretty much ignoring each other when we’re not dealing with the baby. She said that she will be out in 2 months and I’m glad. My concern right now is wether or not she has the right to take the baby. I love my daughter more than anything but I refuse to stay with this woman. I know the baby is not my blood but if I’m on the birth certificate does that help. I at least want to have shared custody. I bring on over half of the income of provide everything for the baby. There is no way that she could take care of the baby without me. She will not be able to afford it. I know there’s probably no way possible for me to get some custody but is it pointless to fight for shared? I can’t lose my daughter. As much as I hate what my fiancé did, I don’t even hate her. 

I can’t explain how hard it is having to deal with losing someone I love so much but also knowing that they would do something so terrible. It’s hard enough having to end this with her but I don’t think I can handle not seeing my daughter anymore either. Please help with any advice as far as how I can fight for shared custody if that’s even possible given the circumstances. 

Tldr: My daughter is not my blood. I don’t know how to move forward. I don’t want to lost my daughter regardless of the circumstances. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9gmnbr/update_i_31m_am_sterile_fiancé_27f_miraculous_got/,relationship_advice,3321,678,1.0
foxyphilophobic,2018-09-17 08:14:36+00:00,Boyfriend refuses to even TRY to get me off.,"My boyfriend [22M] and I [22F] dated years back during high school, and only had basic penetrative sex and the blowjob for him. Nothing else. I asked him to at least try to finger me, go down on me, or even TOUCH me whatsoever. He absolutely refused and made a comment about how gross he thinks it would be. 

We broke up for a few years, started talking again, and got back together during senior year of college. Same sex life. Tonight, I brought it up to him again. I said to him, “This is how our sex goes: I give you a blowjob or handjob, we go right into penetrative sex, you finish after 30 seconds, I don’t finish at all, and then you’re over it and it’s over.” I have to go home and finish myself off in my room in the dark. 

He literally wouldn’t address anything I said. He changed the subject, and started acting irritated and angry with me for no reason. I said “This isn’t an argument, this should be healthy communication. I’m not interrogating you or forcing you to say or do something, I’m just asking your thoughts about this topic.” He said “I don’t have any thoughts. I’m just tired.” I said “Okay.,,,well, let me know if you do.” He read my message and didn’t reply. 

Am I doing something wrong? I’m the only girlfriend he’s ever had and the only sexual experience he’s had. He refuses to do anything besides the missionary position for 30 seconds and then it’s over, end of story. I’ve been with guys before I even met him, and been with guys during the years we were broken up. I had amazing sexual relationships with them. They were very attentive to me, more than willing to do anything to make it feel good for me, and it was an overall very positive and mutual experience. 

Should I just accept that the current bf won’t do that for me and get over it? He’s the most stubborn person I’ve ever met, and he’s been refusing to try anything for me for years now. I know it’s not going to change. I don’t want to have to go home and masturbate every time after we have sex just so I feel like I can get something out of it. I’ve tried to have the conversation with him multiple times both in person and over text, and he just gets angry and irritated and either insists on changing the topic or leaving. Seriously, I don’t know what else to do. He knows I’ve been with other guys that were happy to get me off, and he doesn’t care. I feel like he’s just using my body to masturbate instead of his hand; oh, and he expect blowjobs from me as well, but I have to brush my teeth right afterwards or else he won’t kiss me. 

TL;DR: boyfriend refuses to get me off, even though I get him off every time and do my very best, always. Talking to him hasn’t helped. What should I do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9gihag/boyfriend_refuses_to_even_try_to_get_me_off/,relationship_advice,1790,901,0.0
strawberrypop22,2018-09-17 05:03:01+00:00,Today i found out my (19M) boyfriend has been cheating on me (18F) with his mother for our entire relationship,"My bf and i have been together for almost a year now. We met at my mall food court job and immediately hit it off. After a month of knowing each other he asked me to be his gf. Of course i said yes. Our relationship has been pretty great up to his point. He takes me on dates, compliments me, and just makes me feel super special. The only weird thing is he would never let me meet his mom.

His parents are divorced and have been for almost his entire life. The divorce was messy and his father ended up getting full custody. They had the typical every other week and 6 weeks out of the summer set up.  I have met his dad and his paternal family but he would be weird when i brought his mom up. He would tell me things like “we have a complicated relationship” or “I’ll tell you about it later on”. 

About 3 months into the relationship i began to realize he would never answer his mother’s calls or texts around me. He would hastily clear it out or step into another room to talk to her (even if it was just texting). I tried to not let it bother me because i wanted to respect his boundaries.

Last week he spent the night with me for the first time. I woke up around 3 a.m. because of a bad dream and i couldn’t go back to sleep. I rolled over to grab my phone in the dark but accidentally picked his up instead. I looked at the messages from his mother. I opened his phone and began to read through them and noticed they were mostly very sexual. There would be nudes exchanged, hardcore sexting, and messages for them to meet up for sex. I read the conversations in disbelief. I tried to pretend like it wasn’t real and i dreamed it. A few days later i confronted his about it. It didn’t take long before he broke down and told me everything. He had been having sex with his mother since he was 13 years old. They usually have intercourse once a week, sometimes more. They’ve been doing this throughout our entire relationship. He never told her that he had a gf because he wanted them to still have their weekly sessions. 

At this point idk what to do. I love him with all of my heart but i am so disgusted with him and his mother. I haven’t talked to him since we talked. After he told me i ran out and drove to a town 2 hours away. I blocked him on every social media and his phone number. I changed the locks to my house. I have also called the week into work so he can’t find me. What should i do? Make it work out or break up with him?

TL;DR: After a year of dating a man, i found out that him and his mother have had sexual relations since he was 13 years old. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9ghhsm/today_i_found_out_my_19m_boyfriend_has_been/,relationship_advice,1151,207,1.0
youmustabeenhigh,2018-09-16 13:20:49+00:00,My boyfriend has No Boundries with ExWife,"First post on Reddit ever, so please bear with me.  
I met my SO 6 months ago on Tinder. We hit it off fabulously.   Spent tons of time together,  our children met, our families met,  declared we loved each other, had great respect for each other, and all in all, felt very safe and secure in the relationship.   Until 2 days ago. 
He has an ex wife who he has admitted still wants him.  They had 3 children together and of course need to co parent these children.  One of their children plays for a competitive sports team, and that team were travelling for a championship game which my SO needed/wanted to attend.  Told me the original plan was he was travelling by himself with his kids and staying at a hotel.  Which ive known about for a month.  No problem.   Woke me up 1 hour before he was to take this trip and advised that there had been a change in plans and now he and ex wife were travelling together this long distance trip and they were staying all together in a hotel room because his ex wife had suggested it to him the day before and he felt it was a good idea.  Then just asked me if i was uncomfortable with that and left to take his daughter to school.  Upon his return,  his other children were there, so unwilling to discuss anything in front of them.  Cue the ex wife into the house, waiting for him, and he turns to me and says with her right beside him- ""We good?"" .... suffice to say, we not good.  At all.  I sent him a text explaining how this made me feel (hurt, confused) and he said it was a shitty text and that i am attacking him and now he won't answer my calls or my texts.  
Wtf did i do wrong? Doesn't this seem like absolutely no boundries set with his ex wife? Am I correct in wanting to just walk away? Any advice would be appreciated.

When she got home we had a convo and I told her I was on the spectrum, and she started to cry apologizing what she said a few weeks back. I told her it was okay, and we hugged.

asdfghjklop123,2018-09-13 21:09:07+00:00,[Update] I (24) found hundreds of pics of my brother (20M) on my boyfriends (24M) laptop. Can anyone please explain to me what’s going on?,"Sorry to disappoint but this isn’t a positive update... i’m still trying to mentally process it all hence the delayed post. 


I grabbed the laptop to take pics of the photo albums. I found waaaay more stuff than I originally stumbled upon. A lot of commenters in the OP said that he probably used me to get closer to my brother. I didn’t quite believe it at first but they were right. While I was taking pics of the photo albums, I found more folders. He began saving these pics 4-5 months before we started dating and my brother didn’t even know him at that time. That realization sent chills down my spine. 

I also went on the internet...the bookmarks, the browsing history....it was all horrific. I’m not gonna elaborate because it’s honestly sickening. It’s clear that he has an obsession w/ my brother...and extremely violent and disturbing fantasies about him. I’m not talking about BDSM or bondage (although some of that was there too..)...this was absolutely messed up, scary stuff. I cannot believe that I was sooooo clueless. About everything. 

I went over to my brother’s place and explained everything, showing him proof (on the actual laptop).  He was shocked/creeped out of course but didn’t believe that my ex was behind this for different reasons (“but he’s not gay”, “he wouldn’t do something like this”, etc). I wanted to go to the police but he completely refused. I explained that this isn’t just a crush from a seemingly straight friend, this is an unhealthy, psychotic obsession. He completely denied that he was in danger &amp; seemed embarrassed more than anything. I told him that X actually started creeping on him months before the relationship begun AND took all these creep shots. Besides, the browsing history and bookmarks were specific to him. It would make ANYONE freak out. When I showed him the pics of his clothes, he was very confused and asked me why X would steal his dirty clothes.....but he still didn’t want to go to the police. 


My plan was actually to confront X in public but my brother just straightaway texted him to come over. (Side note...he arrived super fast. I wonder what he was expecting). When X came I showed him the laptop &amp; asked him to explain. The entire situation was so bizarre. While I was talking he seemed incredibly angry, I’ve never seen such a look on his face before. But then he calmed down and casually confessed to everything. He said that it was just a “habit” he got into and that he’s truly sorry. At that point my brother said that this is probably a prank and that it wasn’t funny etc. I started crying a little and X rolled his eyes and told me to “stop crying”. He was so nonchalant and cold, I didn’t even recognize him anymore. Then he said that he would immediately stop doing this if we kept this to ourselves. I think my brother finally believed him then, because he was absolutely dumbstruck. 


X said that he’d take down the cameras too and that we shouldn’t make a big deal out of it. I asked him where the cameras are and he proceeded to show us (he probably thought he was a good guy for “cooperating” with us and that it would make the situation less creepy). Turns out, there was a camera in the shower as well. It was nauseating. The conversation that followed was extremely uncomfortable and X said some very provocative/inappropriate things. They ended up having a huge argument (about the stolen clothes amongst other topics) and the rest was pretty awful. I eventually went to stay at a friend’s place (I had already packed my stuff anyway). 


Later that night X texted me that I’m a bad person for invading his privacy and that I’m selfish, narcissistic, a bad human being etc. He said that he’s willing to forgive me though. Yeah he really said that. I blocked his number. And on everywhere. A day later he came to me at work and I told him to stay away from me. He did that everyday for one week (at different locations) until I seriously threatened him . He said that he never cared about me anyway and wished me luck for my future relationships.  

A couple of days ago my brother texted me (we haven’t spoken at all since that day) and apologized....but he still refuses to address the elephant in the room. He’s just pretending it never happened. I told him that X is clearly not stable, why would you NOT notify the police? I honestly don’t know what to do. (Is there a way i can report this, just in case?). And oh by the way. It was his 21st bday yesterday and I called him in the morning. He told me that he got a present from an unknown sender....I said that the sender is probably NOT unknown to us. Like this is 100% my psycho ex. I just KNOW it. As I said, this isn’t a positive update. A lot of people seemed to be concerned and that’s the only reason I posted this. I just hope things don’t get worse.

trwwwwsisthelp,2018-09-13 15:58:46+00:00,My(23F) sister(25F) and friends(20s) talked about how I’m not good enough for my boyfriend(25M). They don’t know I heard and I don’t know what to do,"Firstly, my sister and this group of friends are what I would consider my closest friends. I love this girls to death. I literally tried to donate a kidney for one of them. I am 100% heart broken

My bf is an amazing guy, kind, funny, smart as hell and pretty much a model. He’s just gorgeous. And asexual.

This isn’t a problem to me and we worked it out. He’s also very open to it and everyone knows(which I entirely support!).

We were supposed to hang out a week ago but after spending about half an hour his job called him and he had to leave. This didn’t bother me a lot bc I had a killer headache and went home.

My sister and I share an ap. to save money and we have a year long lease so I guess I’m screwed.

Long story short, I closed my door, didn’t light up and got a nap. Next thing I know I wake up to my sister voice. She and those friends were at our house(from what I heard they were going to a club and were drinking a bit/waiting for the others).


I didn’t get up bc I was lazy and would have to put pants. Then they started talking about me. I’m not proud but I was curious.

They were talking aboyt how they couldn’t believe I was dating my bf, how he was too good for me, how I was too ugly to get a guy like him. My sister then started telling how being asexual is obviously a excuse to not have sex with me.

I’m not pretty and while it does makes me insecure I know I have other good characteristics but it was very hard hearing that.

They also made fun of my learning disability(they calle the r-word, which I can’t even fucking write it). That I wasn’t even financially stable, made fun of my job. They said I had to beg to be fucked.

All of my friends laughed and all of them shit talked me. I was crying pretty hard at that point. They left and I didn’t know what to do.

I went to bed and basically made myself scarce this week. I get up earlier, get home later or stay at my bf. I have answered their messages but was somewhat cold.

I know I have to talk with them, even if it’s to just cut off contact but I can’t open my mouth right now. I feel so ashamed and sad.

My bf is also worried but I can’t get what they said from my head. I know it’s not true and my bf *is* asexual but I feel like I’m not worth being with him.

My sister is my best friend. I fucking told her how I feel too ugly and stupid to be with him. I showed her our messages and we spoke about his asexuality. I love her so much it hurts. I can’t stand looking at her knowing she was saying those on my back, and that none of my friends said anything.

Makingnewuser,2018-09-11 15:17:36+00:00,I (24M) think I may have been raped by male friend (25M).,"I was too afraid and ashamed to share this by my regular account, but after seeing so many confessions I thought I had nothing left to lose, people have already made fun of me for thinking something like this could have happened. Even I am not exactly sure it did. I have had panic attacks ever since that day at just the possibility of this being true. I will try to include all the relevant events that took place to the best of my recollection without letting my feelings get the better of me again.

Anyway, here goes. I live in the same apartment with a roommate (25M). I've known him for almost a trimester and I'd consider him a friend. We are straight and with girlfriends, for what it's worth. The last few weeks we've had a rocky relationship but the most we've done is yell at each other for stuff and we always made up afterwards. He hasn't displayed troubling behavior for the most part but at times I've caught him staring oddly and he's made plenty of rape jokes which most of the friend group finds distasteful.

2 weeks ago a mutual friend of ours was celebrating his birthday and we were both invited. I don't remember drinking too much, but I have a memory gap extending to around 12 hours and I have no recollection of what happened during it. When I woke up I felt like I had been sleeping for centuries and every limb of mine was heavy and numb. I had difficulty sitting down, my back was aching and my muscles were sore.

After I managed to get up and look in the mirror I noticed, to my horror, that I had bruises on my abdomen and chest. I asked my roommate about it and told me I was so drunk last night that I had gotten into a fight over something stupid. This would explain most of the symptoms so I believed him.

The reason I say ""most of"" and not all symptoms is because I experienced discomfort when using the toilet and nightmares at night (which I never did in the past). I don't think a bar fight causes these.

Then I found out from the birthday boy himself that said bar fight never happened, or at least he doesn't remember it happening (to be fair he was pretty drunk too). He told me that I got wasted, slept on the chair and my roommate with another friend of ours carried me home.

I asked the other friend who carried me home with my roommate and he told me that they brought me to the apartment, got me on the bed and then he left. I asked him specifically whether they accidentally dropped me and I hit the floor which would explain the bruises but he told me that I never fell nor did they drop me.

A few days ago it dawned on me that we were buying rounds before I got the memory gap. I don't remember whether I specifically had a drink chosen for me or if I took a random one out of a disc but a sleeping substance would explain why I suddenly fell unconscious for so many hours and so suddenly.

I try to think of it more along the lines of a ""what if"" scenario rather than something certain because my life would be absolutely ruined if something like this happened. I don't know if I'd be able to survive it. Still, the nightmares continue and I've been crying during sex with my girlfriend, something I was thankfully able to hide, but this fear is increasingly growing inside of me.

Please don't tell me to call the police or anything like that, I'm not even sure I want to know and even if I do, I certainly wouldn't want the rest of the world to ever find out. I'm comfortable to share it with strangers on the internet, but nothing more than that. I took a week off to return to my family and stay with them until I get my thoughts in order. 

Could my hunch be wrong? I could have had a bar fight and maybe nobody remembers because we were all drunk, and I could have nightmares because I'm trying to self-impose on myself that I was raped. That's possible, right? What would you do in my shoes?

**Tl;dr** I think roommate drugged me, raped me and lied about it, but I can't be sure, I feel terrible and I want to crawl into a corner and never leave it ever again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9eyg9i/i_24m_think_i_may_have_been_raped_by_male_friend/,relationship_advice,1768,299,0.0
obviousthrowawayfart,2018-09-10 14:46:00+00:00,Boyfriend won’t let me fart in front of him,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

My (F25) boyfriend (M31) and I have been together for nearly 3 years. 

By this stage you would expect us to be comfortable regarding all bodily functions and mishaps, however he has a strict ‘no farting’ rule and it makes me extremely uncomfortable to spend long amounts of time with him because I have to hold them in for so so long. 

I have a sensitive stomach and holding so much of that air in is painful. Yes they are loud but they don’t smell! Not one bit! 

I think because he doesn’t have that much gas then he expects me not to either. I also feel the typical ‘girls don’t fart’ stereotype is very relevant here. 

This is the only thing stopping me from moving in with him as in all other regards he is perfect and someone I envision spending the rest of my life with. He is loving, respectful and in all other aspects he blows me away (pun intended)! 

Am I being unreasonable to feel upset and uncomfortable about this? How do I go about discussing with him that it hurts to hold them in?

At first I was hoping it was just people who look like them but I caught them myself. I confronted them and they both tried to deny it but I had the evidence and everything. I broke up with him and moved back with my parents.

I can’t handle all this pain. I don’t know why my sister would ever do this. What do I do about my relationship eith her? Is it still possibly salvageable? Or should I just cut her off and let things go?

ThatsMySweetSpot,2018-09-07 00:41:02+00:00,I (34M) caught my wife (32F) cheating 6 weeks after giving birth to our child. Also sexting during pregnancy.,"Backstory:

My wife and I (Laura) have been together for 11 years, married for 6. Soon after getting married we discovered we had fertility issues. She would not drop eggs without treatments. So we waited and saved money. The treatments were hard on her and required daily injections. After a miscarriage and a failed IVF we were able to get pregnant and our daughter was born in May.

It should also be noted that during the past 2 years Laura has lost a ton of weight. She became a bit obsessed with working out. She started an Instagram page dedicated to get weight loss and fitness. She put her Snapchat code on her Instagram and that is how this all started.

Where it all went wrong:

What I didn’t know is that throughout her whole pregnancy she was using Snapchat to sext other men. She has admitted to 3 men, but I’m almost certain there are more. There were multiple meet ups with one man (Ryan) where they had sex on a picnic table at a local park. This was six weeks after giving birth to my child (C-section). She was on maternity leave.

I came home from a night shift and discovered nudes of her and an unknown male on her iPad in mid July. She denied everything until I showed her the screenshots I sent to my phone. She said she didn’t know him and that he actually lived in Australia. She went on to explain that he contacts her from time to time for sexting and that it meant nothing. I knew her story was bull shit from the start. First off, in the pic of the male there weren’t Australian electrical outlets on the wall. Second, the story made no sense. She agreed to delete her account and no further contact with the guy. I explained any deviation from this would lead to a divorce.

Week 1:

I would of actually felt bad for not taking care of my wife’s needs but we were already having sex daily since she hit the 6 week mark post delivery.

So I started investigating what I could. I had someone I suspected it could be so I used Facebook to find out their address. Then I pulled his house address up on Zillow. It still had pics from the last time it was for sale. The dick pic I found matched the wall color and general layout of the master bathroom in the house. This was a great find but I needed more proof. I needed the Snapchat data.

Snapchat data:

Snapchat allows you to download your own data. It doesn’t include actual pictures. What it does include is dates and time of images sent and received. There is also GPS data which will be important later. I was able to access Laura’s Snapchat account (uses same password for everything) as well as send the data to her email. What I saw made me physically ill. Not only was I blocked but she had been re-downloading the app and reactivating her account everyday for the past week and messaging one username.The data only went back a month but it was constant continuous with one user. We are talking 20+ images sent a day and countless text all day every day. The worse part is I know the man, Ryan, and actually hired him at a previous employer. He is married with 2 kids, one being a 6 month old. He had congratulated Laura and I on the birth of our child then 2 weeks later started requesting nudes from my her.

Week 2, Shit storm:

So of course I sent the dick pic I had saved to his wife (Sarah) asking why this was on my wife’s phone. She confirmed that was her master bathroom as I had suspected and if I looked close you could see their wedding picture on the wall. We both talked calmly, but this was before we knew about the meet ups. It wasn’t until later that day that I got a message from Sarah that said “Ask about meet ups! I know he is fucking lying”. So I ask Laura if there were meet ups. She says no then leaves the room. I stand there thinking of follow up questions then walk into the bedroom to find her packing a bag with clothes. I say WTF and see tears in her eyes. My phone starts buzzing. It’s Sarah and the message read: “THEY FUCKED! At the lake on a picnic table!! No Fuckin Condom!” Laura said she loved me then left, leaving me to cry holding my 2 month old.

Week 3:

Sarah and I got almost zero honesty during this time. It was constant lying from the cheaters until they finally gave up and admitted the truth.

Laura came and went from the house during this time period. She was staying at a family friend’s house. This is when she started using my daughter as a weapon. If I asked too many questions she would threaten to take the baby and leave. She did on multiple occasions.

She said the affair had only been going on for a month and she wasn’t sexting anyone else, just Ryan. Of course she was lying but I had no proof. Looking at the data she was sending the same images to the same 4 guys at the same time late at night. Whoever was available would respond back. Then the sexting would start. All contact with Ryan was much more aggressive than the others. Laura said she wanted to work things out and stay together. I could maybe get past the sexting but not a physical affair. I agreed to couples and individual therapy.

Sarah and I talked throughout the following days. We were both focused on the same thing. We wanted the whole story of how this happened with details. It just kept getting worse. I would ask random questions like: “ Was there anal?” She looked down at the ground and said “yeah, ok there was anal”. Fucking mother of my child people!

Sarah sent me Ryan’s Snapchat data. After plugging in GPS coordinates into Google Earth we knew the exact dates they met. Two of the days were back to back while I was shopping for a new vehicle. Laura dropped me off at the dealership then went and met Ryan at the lake both days. Sarah and I agreed this was a physical as well as emotional affair. We kept getting more and more info.

It was nice to talk to Sarah. Being able to share all your anger, sadness, and self doubt with another person is rare in my life. I’m glad she was there. I told Sarah that I suspected Laura of sexting other men. Sarah offered to catfish them to get info. I gave her their usernames from the Snapchat data.

Week 4:

Sarah contacted one of the other men (Sam) from Snapchat. She pretended to be one of Laura’s friends. She used a second phone to screenshot the conversation so he would not be alerted to the screenshots through the app. All it took was a couple pictures of her from the gym to get this guy to start talking. He said Laura and him had been sexting and exchanging nudes for OVER A YEAR! Again previously Laura had said there was no sexting with anyone else. He was also married and just had a baby boy. He was not local and lived in Australia. Sam then asked to sex chat with Sarah. Sarah ended the conversation at this point.

In couples therapy, Laura admitted to sexting and sending pics to two other guys on Snapchat. She said they found her on instagram and added her snap code there. One was Sam, who we already knew about. The other was a local police officer who is using a fake name on Snapchat. This worried me even more since he was local and they could have met up. I asked and she said no she only met up with Ryan. I asked about the others men I suspected and she said there was nothing going on.

Last week: Sarah called my phone and Laura saw it was her and answered it. Things escalated from there and Sarah said her and Ryan were coming by our house to get the facts straight. The idea scared me but I was also slightly curious to see what would happen. They arrived and the four of us sat down at our kitchen table. Laura started by accusing Sarah and I of having an affair of our own which was laughed off. She was jealous that I was talking to Sarah and not her. After that it was pretty much constant yelling back and forth between the two women. Continuous lies came from Laura along with personal attacks on everyone but her. If you could read between the lines of what she was saying it would read “I did nothing wrong.” I had something planned to say to Ryan but in the moment I just felt overwhelmingly sad watching my wife act like this, knowing that this was not the woman I married. I said next to nothing to him. Sarah made her last point then stormed out. Ryan said he was truly sorry and walked out. Laura looked at me and said “Can you believe she attacked me like that?” I said nothing.

Afterwards Sarah messaged me and said she was extremely disappointed with how I acted at the meeting. She wanted me to verbally attack Ryan, but instead I was silent and left all the work to her. To be honest, I did let her down. I apologized for this, but as of now Sarah and I are no longer talking.

Now: What a mess. So what the fuck do I do? I can’t help but think this isn’t her first physical affair. Who the hell ‘tests the waters” of having an affair 6 weeks after having a baby? Has anyone come across anything like this before with new mothers? Is it mental issues? Could the hormones be doing this? What about the extreme weight loss? Even if there is a medical explanation I don’t think I will ever be able to trust her again. We spent 5 years trying to start our family and she destroyed it in less than 2 months. I just feel so sad for my daughter. I can’t even look at Laura right now. Any advice is welcome.

itsjustathrowaway44,2018-09-05 12:37:02+00:00,Getting divorced because I don't want children," (Using a throwaway as my wife knows my reddit username)

We  got married 8 years ago to a girl I had known since we were kids. We  almost didn't get married because I didn't want children and she did,  but everyone talked me around and said I'll feel different when I'm  older etc... so we went ahead.

Then we  tried, in vain, to have children for 3 years, I dreaded the thought but  did it for her. Doctors here couldn't understand it, nothing wrong with  either of us and lifestyles were also ideal.

2  years ago I went through a major midlife crisis and came out of it  stronger, and more assertive about my own needs (I'm your serial people  pleaser type). At which point I put my foot down and said that I don't  want to have children for many many reasons, she can't come around to  the idea (nor would I want her to against her own will).

Now,  I'm 34, she's 31 and it looks like we're going to have to split over  it. Initially I thought it's a shame because we're so good together but  for this one difference in opinion. But when I thought about it more I  realized it's not about just this one thing, it's rooted in a difference  of who we are in our core and our aspirations more widely - in terms of  bigger picture and what we want our contribution to the world to be.  But it's heart-breaking all the same, leaves me with a knot in my  stomach, but one that's smaller than the knot of being a father.

Should I take him to court or walk away and never talk to him again?","Long story short. 7 years ago we bought an investment property together. We agreed he could live there rent free while he fixed it up and got settled in life. I ended up paying taxes and insurance every year and he’s pretty much destroyed the house. It honestly looks like a crack house. I had an appraisal done last week and the home has lost half its value due to damages and lack of upkeep. I didn’t realize it was that bad and had sent money over the years to make repairs, which he never did and pocketed the money. In addition, I gave him a personal loan of $5000, which he has never paid back.

My brother is an alcoholic and has a job, but it’s barely minimum wage. The house is in my name, so I could start the eviction process, but I’m pretty sure he would be homeless then. I don’t see how I could ever get my money back unless I sold the house, but is it worth the hassle? Should I just accept I made a mistake trusting him and walk away from the relationship?

He denies responsibility, feels like he’s done nothing wrong, says he’s struggling, that he’ll pay me back, do better, etc etc

clober33,2018-09-04 08:15:39+00:00,"I (24F) have been raised by Muslim parents. I now live on my own and have a boyfriend (24M) which is the most unforgivable thing, according to my dad.","I’m sorry if this is formatted incorrectly or gets to be too lengthy. This has been eating away at me for a while and I just really need some advice. 

I come from a Pakistani culture, raised by Muslim parents, but have lived my entire life in the US.  Throughout my childhood and teen years, my biggest fear was being shipped back to Pakistan. I would often get threatened (by my mom mostly) if I broke any rules, talked to any boys, or went against anything my mom told me to do. A few of my distant cousins, who grew up in Canada/US, were sent to Pakistan after their parents found out that they had a boyfriend. They were forced to marry someone who was over twice their age and live there under their husbands rule. So to me, this wasn’t an empty threat. 

I was in all honors and AP classes, got good grades, did everything in my power to be granted more freedom, but my parents wouldn’t budge. I was never even allowed to go to any of my friends’ houses. 

With all of these restrictions, I became rebellious and hid a lot of things from my parents. 

One day when I was a sophomore in high school, my parents were out shopping and I invited a boy over. My parents came back early and I obviously got caught with the boy. (We weren’t doing anything inappropriate. Just sitting on the couch in the living room talking.) I saw my parents pull up in the driveway and made up an excuse that he was here to fix my computer. They didn’t believe me. My dad straight up said to me, “I could kill you right now.” And my mom was already making plans to send me to Pakistan to get married. I’m not sure why they didn’t ultimately send me there but I was under even more restrictions than I had been previously. I was never allowed to go anywhere by myself, stay at home by myself, have a cell phone, go on the computer. Just nothing. 

Then I started college and I was forced to commute from home even though I had the grades and SAT scores to go to a better college somewhere further. I had to fight to get a laptop for school, fight to be allowed to drive to college. If I didn’t get home within thirty minutes from when my last class ended, my mom would be freaking out. I was “allowed” to have a prepaid flip phone with $10/month worth of minutes on it so that my parents could call me. It was so incredibly hard living that way, but I never really let anything stop me from doing everything in my power to fight against all of the restrictions. I still had boyfriends (secretly). Still drank alcohol. And still kept my grades up because I wanted to get into medical school. 

Then, at the end of my freshman year, my mom died very suddenly due to internal bleeding. After she died, my dad softened up on the restrictions and I was allowed to study abroad, get a cell phone, and join some pre-med clubs without having to extensively explain why I had to stay later for meetings. 

Then I got accepted into a medical school that was 5 hours away and my dad was very supportive and happy for me. 

I am now a third year medical student and have lived on my own for three years. I have a very loving and supportive boyfriend of one year (who my dad does not know about), great friends, and am at a much better place in my life than I was when my mom was alive. I call my dad almost every day and we have a good relationship. 

Here’s the current issue: my dad has been searching for possible “suitors” for me for an arranged marriage, and keeps telling me that I have full rights to turn down anyone I don’t like. But the thing is, I love my boyfriend. My dad has no problem with me finding someone to marry on my own, but he told me that he has to be Muslim. My boyfriend is not Muslim, but he has a wonderful family who I am close with, treats me very well, and is just a great guy all around. I know it’s still early in the relationship but I can see myself being married to him. This would absolutely disappoint my dad and possibly ruin our relationship and bring dishonor to the family. 

I was talking to my dad on the phone last night about marriage and relationships and he told me that the worst thing I can do is get a boyfriend. In the past, he has told me that many things are forgivable but having a boyfriend is not. I feel very guilty like I'm doing something wrong by having a boyfriend but I just don’t see myself marrying someone from Pakistan. The guilt has been eating away at me for a long time and I just don’t know what to do. In less than two years, I’m going to be a physician. I like to think that I have a pretty good head on my shoulders. I worked really hard to get to where I am. I even got myself in therapy for a year to deal with the anxiety that comes with being in medical school. They won’t let me back in therapy (for free) this year because they want to see how I do without it for a few months. So, reddit, please help me. What do I do? How do I stop feeling guilty?

Mrfakename1000,2018-09-03 14:27:05+00:00,Partner lied for two years about saving for a house,"My partner(F 33) and I (M 34) have been together for about 7 years total, with a short 6 month break after a couple of years.

A few years ago we started talking about kids and houses.

We both said we started saving roughly 2 years ago and have been talking for about a year about where we would like to live. She had been sending me pictures and adverts of houses, just outside of our local city where the prices are low but we would be  isolated , I had been pushing for somewhere about 20/30% more expensive  that would keep us close to both our parents, I have tried to explain to her that even if she wants to come out of work to raise children that my wage is more than enough to do that, pay the mortgage and have a decent lifestyle. Right now my wage is about 33% above the average for our country, on top of which there are other allowances available to families too, so we would have been fine.

Anyways, we were both saving into our own, seperate, bank accounts and from time to time I would ask her how much was in there and she would tell me $xyz which was always pretty in keeping with the expected total, except for one point last year when she was about 2Gs short and I called her on it, she said she had needed a bit of cash for things and hadn't been saving as regularly as we agreed. She said from now on she would put regular amount into the account at regular intervals.


Ok, sorry this is so long, this year I talked to her about going to see a mortgage broker about 3 months before I actually organised the meeting. This was to make sure we had the maximum deposit for the maximum mortgage we were going to get.
She agreed.
I set up the meeting.
She came.
The broker asked about our savings.
She replied ""Circa $ABC""
Which was the expected amount.
We took the forms home and filled them in together, after a little of her putting it off.
She started sending me more houses to view online.
We actually went to view one together at her suggestion and I went to another that she couldn't make it to.

Now the meat of the story.
The broker keeps asking me for her bank account statements which she hasn't provided.
So I keep asking her for them, and at first she said she ordered them.
Then she said she'd reordered them.
Then she said every time you ring you are left on the phone for an hour.
Then she said she had a fight with the manager and the manager was ""personally posting them"".
She said she couldn't print them herself because it is a special savings account which doesn't have online access. (Partly true, hih interest account you must give like 28 days notice to withdraw money)
Then she said the bank has no branches in our city (stupid me, I never verified this, but also half true they only do these weird walk in offices and there are only like 4 of them in our city)
I give her the benefit of the doubt, but at this stage I've told the story one too many times and it clicks in my head, it's complete bullshit.

So I go home and start checking thru the other document that she did provide, her current account statement is there, and so I take a quick read of it and I can see she is saving about 75% of her wages into 2 different accounts the minute she gets paid and then withdrawing that and then some as the month goes on. Leaving her spending between 25-50% more than she makes in a month.

I finally decided to check out this literal worst bank in the world, called them, got thru in 2 mins flat.
The account she was saving into, luckily for investigative purposes is actually a joint account that I never used. The guy advises me to go to a fake branch and get a statement.

Instead of the 2 years worth of saving she is supposed to have done the account is empty save 200 dollars.

I work 12 hour shifts, sometimes many days in a row, weekends, overtime, you name it to make sure that we can save and still have nice things.
I have avoided spending money on myself so that we could afford to do things together.
I feel like the whole time she has been laughing at me.

The thing is, just as I found out that all this has happened, we also found out that we are having a baby, paternity test is obvious choice here.

So I feel trapped now. 
I feel lied to and betrayed and I am halfway between, walking away and jumping off a roof(just a though, for now)
I feel like this person has repeatedly had chances to come forward and didn't bother and yet keeps talking about getting married and having a family.


I need advice, has anyone ever heard anything mental like this before?
Am I a god damned moron for trusting the girl I've been dating for 7 years?

P.s.
I do definitly want to speak to her parents first, in case the child is mine and she runs off telling lies about how it hot her or something so at least they can back me up.

Help!

TLDR: Girlfriend told me for 2 years she has been saving for a house but after going thru the motions, filling out all the paperwork and viewing houses, her bank account turned out to empty because she has spent it instead of saving.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9clvw5/partner_lied_for_two_years_about_saving_for_a/,relationship_advice,1660,448,1.0
throwaw06061405,2018-09-02 20:47:08+00:00,I [20/m] woke up to my friend [23/m] having opened my pants and groping my penis,"I'm part of a very tightly knit friend group. We've all known eachother since our teens, and there's a lot of banter, but also a lot of maturity and respect - especially considering it's a group of young men.  

Now, one of us, we'll call him Tim, is openly gay. Tim has been out of the closet for as long as we've known him, and along with being one of the oldest in the group, he is also one of the smartest. He's usually very down to earth, and not very flamboyant, so usually his sexuality is never the focus of any attention, and we pay it no mind.  

However, yesterday night I was out 5-6 people of this group of friends for beers - and we had a lot. When the night came to a close at around 5-6 AM, people started taking taxis and walking home. I live the furthest away from the city, so I had quite a long walk in front of me. This is when Tim asked if I wanted to crash at his place, then I could take the bus once I woke up. Without me even asking about it, he assured me ""don't worry, I won't try anything"".  

So we went to his place, had another beer and went to bed in his kingsize bed. I had kept all of my clothes on, as I had basically just passed out once I laid down. I woke up to Tim with his hand in my pants, groping my penis. Not only had he rolled all the way over to spoon me. He had unbuckled my belt, opened the button in my pants, and opened the zipper (so this was not just some shit that happens spontaneously in your sleep). I told him to stop, and he did, and apologized. I went to the bathroom to get some water and left without going back in to his room to say anything.  

Now, I've not told anyone. Not even my roommate who is also a friend of Tim's or my girlfriend. I am ashamed, and I feel disgusted that he would do this. Tim wrote a short text apologizing, but I couldn't get myself to respond to it. It feels beyond like this is beyond an apology.  

Now my dilemma is this. How do I respond to Tim? I don't know what to tell him and I don't know if I can salvage this. I also don't know if I can tell my friends about it, because they're all friends with Tim as well, and I think I'm afraid that this will ruin the otherwise great dynamic of this group of friends. Perhaps I am also afraid of shunning him completely from the group, which I fear might be a consequence if the others found out.  

That turned out a lot longer than expected, but again, this is the first time I talk about it, so it just all had to go out. All help is appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9cfe8a/i_20m_woke_up_to_my_friend_23m_having_opened_my/,relationship_advice,1748,364,0.0
Ihaveanalcoholicwife,2018-09-02 02:17:22+00:00,My wife (26F) cheated on me.,"Sorry this is long as hell, but I'm at a loss.

Back story we are married and have a two year old. She was away for work for a little over six months, entirely across the country. Myself and our toddler came to visit three times during this separation. Now, she started going out to clubs with two guys that were 20, and a few of her girlfriends. She's always liked going out and I've had no reason to ever doubt her before, but soon enough it was every weekend and I'd get a text the next day that she and some of her friends got a hotel as they didn't want to go home at the end of the night. 

Fast forward it just gets sketchier, but she eventually finished and came home. The second day she was home I checked a message popup from one of the guys I knew she was close with, and I saw a text chain of her talking about trying to fuck him and egging him on to go out that night because he had been talking mad game. 

After a lot of screenshots and fighting she finally came clean that they cuddled a lot, and made out a few times when they were too drunk. She maintains that they never had sex. Due to the screenshots I called her roommate at the work location and she said that my wife and the kid had fucked around, while she was in the room even. 

Wife refuses to say it happened. I decided to try and make this work even though I feel that she's still hiding details. 

Now she's currently on a business trip again, only for a month this time, but she's already partying every weekend again with new friends. (it's a different location.) Now every time she's going to go out she starts a fight about something I said and refuses to talk to me all night until she gets home. Tonight she started a fight because I asked her very politely to not get too drunk because it makes me extremely uncomfortable due to what happened just a few months ago. 

Now, I'm basically just ranting because I have nobody to turn to. But my whole point of coming here to you all is I have an anxiety disorder and I can't always tell what is a gut feeling, what's my anxiety, or when there's just plain proof in my face. So please, am I being irrational to be upset by her continual partying and blackout drinking  while I'm a single father? (She doesn't act this way when she's home at all) Do you think she is acting suspiciously, and if so how do I go about talking to her about this without her gaslighting me?

If anyone makes it all the way through this and answers, thank you very much. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9c8q05/my_wife_26f_cheated_on_me/,relationship_advice,1182,296,0.0

I was in a relationship with my girlfriend for 7 years, she was 12 and I was 13 when we first met. Since then we never broke up, and we literally grew up together. Till the last moment we used to love each other a lot.

Ten days ago we were walking on the pavement and we were heading to the gym.  After some point, we see a huge truck heading towards us, most likely the driver lost the control of the truck. My girlfriend was standing right next to me, on the right side. I managed to dodge the truck, but my girlfriend unfortunately didn't.. There is not much to say, and describing the whole incident is not an easy thing for me to do.. Basically her body was ripped apart..It was an instant death.

Since then I have been completely broken. I lost someone who was always by my side, always next to me for 7 years. My first love, and someone I thought I would spend my whole life with. She was so young, and that was really unfair..

I am currently studying Psychology at the University, but since her death I haven't attended any classes. I am home all day, no mood to do anything and I feel I will never get over it.. I can't help myself..My family and friends are next to me but still.. 

I know I need to move on, but it looks so hard for me.. Has any one of you lost their partner like that?

I need some support and some advices on how to handle this.. Thank you everyone. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9bmn5k/my_m20_girlfriend_f19_of_7_years_died_in_a_car/,relationship_advice,1724,136,0.0
Nopethenopet,2018-08-30 12:00:09+00:00,"I(16F) created a huge family fight, how can I fix it?","First time poster and on mobile, sorry guys

Basically, last weekend my family(mom, dad, grandpa, aunts/uncles, cousins) met up with my brother, his wife and her family(first time we met them and only my brothers MIL and FIL).

It was ok until my nrother started whining bc his wife only wanted her own mom on the delivery room. My mom joined being the passive aggressive person she is. Me and my dad(and everyone else) tried to change the subject and talk about something else, which didn’t work.

I got fed up and started defending my SIL(who looked *very* unconfortable) and I will admit I got kinda angry. I mean, I get that it’s a important moment to my brother and he is also feeling nervous/scared but he’s not the one pushing a whole baby through hi nether parts, possibly pooping in public, having a bunch of doctors watching him, in pain and then having to wear adult diapers and whatnot. I’d say that is the person who chooses who goes into the room.

Everyone got kinda silent and my mom said something of the effect that she’s a woman and there isn’t anything she hasn’t seen, which really isn’t the point. She started saying I didn’t know what I was talking about and I would be glad I had her on my side when I had kids.

I will admit fault for what happened after but I was really angry. I basically said that if I had a baby I’d prefer my dad to be with me on the delivery room. I’m closer to him and whatnot.

She 100% freaked out, calling me ungrateful and disgusting. My dad got pretty angry and tried to tell her to chill but she got even agrier and basically said I couldn’t have my father there bc he’s a man.... so that was terrible. My dad was furious and asked her to clarify. I’m not going in detail but she basically said that my dad shoulsn’t be allowed to see my lady parts and that was disgusting and that I was trying to seduce him(excuse me while I throw up gsus christ on a pole , I don’t even want to think about this).

My dad didn’t even said anything, just got up and said to me to get in the car. My brother started fighting with my mom while she cried.

We have spent the week on my grandma house and my dad is very hurt. My mom has sent me some messages asking me to talk with my dad but everytime I tried to open up about this he says this is not about me and I shouldn’t have to get in between them.

I sent a message to my SIL apologizing but she said it wasn’t my fault. I talked with my brother(and I did give him some verbal lashing about the whole delivery room thing and I believe he’s rethinking) and he said that mom is very sad and cries non stop but he agrees with my dad and I shouldn’t get involved. He is also pretty hurt bc he’s going to have a daughter and my mom implied that every man is like that.

I’m very worried about my parents marriage and while I know she was out of line I do have some fault when I started being sassy and agressive. What should I do?

TL;DR: my mom and brother were pressuring my SIL to let mom in the delivery room. I defended her, said I’d prefer to have my dad with me. She freaked out and basically said I was tryingo to seduce my father and that he would fall for it. They aren’t speaking anymore and we’re on my grandma house.

brokenthrowaway331,2018-08-29 20:09:21+00:00,My [36M] wife [34F] has been having an affair with her own brother and I realised our son might not even be mine.,"I dont know how or where to begin. This is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and her brother has always been messing around, they were the type of siblings to take joking a bit too far (sexually). New people who meet with them have always said that they are the type of siblings who you would think are married if it wasnt for them being brother and sister. 

&amp;#x200B;

My brother in law lives very close to us. He is divorced and has 2 daughters who live with his ex-wife. My own wife very often takes over our son to his place, and also very often visits him herself. This is something I never ever had anything against, after all they are brother and sister. It wasnt until recently when my 4 year old son told me mommy and uncle tommy (lets call him that) had been kissing on the lips that I got suspicious. Apparently my wife had gotten angry at our son for no apparent reason for having seen this and she had told him grownups do this as a gesture of love.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, i understand hugging or kissing a sibling on the cheek but in my 36 years on this earth I dont recall kissing my own sister mouth to mouth. That is just...disgusting to me. Tonight I did something which I never done or felt the need to do before, and I checked my wifes phone only to find a load ton of messages between her and her own brother. Most of it is just regular chat, nothing special. But after having scrolled through a ton of messages I find sections of intimate pictures between them, and even messages such as ""horny"", ""want to come over for a quicky"" and similar sentences. I am grossed out by the sheer imagination of my wife having had sex with her own brother, as this cause me to imagine ever having kissed any of my own sisters which is disturbing to say the least.

&amp;#x200B;

Having sit here now thinking about what to do I cant do anything but to think my own son might not even be my own. So many times have I heard how ""he looks like uncle tommy"" and just looking at his face makes me believe this even more.

&amp;#x200B;

I am really at a loss at this point, I have no doubts about what she has done, but I cant imagine also having lost the only thing that meant more to me than my own life, my own blood, my son.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like just jumping off a building or taking my own life if he ends up not being my child.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to divorce her, but I dont know how to go on about finding out whether I am the father or not, I really dont know what to do if I found out my son wasnt mine.

SignificantParsley,2018-08-28 22:22:54+00:00,I [26M] Killed My Girlfriend's [25F] Parents Dog In Self Defense And We're On The Verge Of Breaking Up,"This was locked by the overzealous mods on the other subreddit and I'm told this place is more reasonable.

My girlfriend's parents, who I'll call Jane and John, have a notoriously vicious doberman, who I'll call Satan, they refuse to train. It killed a cat in their neighborhood a few years back and has aggressively gone after visitors and neighbors when it gets off the leash. I've refused to go over to their house since meeting her for this reason, and as a result any visits we've had her parents came to us.

My girlfriend had a falling out with her closest friend recently and it's been a rough few weeks on her. Her parents asked her (and me, they always extend an invite despite me never going) over for dinner and family time to cheer her up. I agreed to go as I figured it might make her happy to actually have me attend, but I told her I would only go if Satan was kept in the basement (finished basement with a door) while I was there. She agreed, and we both spoke to her parents on the phone and they agreed.

We showed up and I had her go in to ensure Satan was in the basement, which it was. Everything was going great, John gave me a little tour and showed me their backyard and some bags of sand he needed moved, and the four of us started to cook dinner together. Jane realized she was missing vegetables and asked if my girlfriend would run to the store with her, so they left. John asked me if I'd help him move the sand since neither of us are great cooks, and led me to the backyard, leaving the sliding door open.

About 5 minutes in I hear John yelling to ""watch out"" from inside the house. Satan comes barreling out the patio door, down the steps and immediately lunges for me. I start trying to back up calmly while telling Satan to fuck off, and he keeps making lunges for me. John (mid 60's with mobility issues) comes out of the house and helpfully decides to start screaming at the dog which only makes things worse. I kick at Satan when he lunges for me, and he grabs my leg. I'm on the ground while John comes over and tries to pull Satan by the collar and I try to push my finger into its eye and hit it in the snout and end up getting bitten badly and held by my left arm. At this point I yell at John to move back and use my pocket knife (again, rural area, not abnormal to carry) to free myself.

John is apologizing profusely, and said Satan was whining in the basement so he went down to comfort him and he slipped out. He offers an ambulance which I decline, so we put polysporin on my arm and leg and we get ready to leave in his car to the hospital. My girlfriend and Jane get home and start panicking and I tell them what happened as I get into John's car. Both of them immediately rush to the backyard, my girlfriend not even asking if I'm ok, to tend to the dog.

John waited with me until I was evaluated and released and Jane came in the meantime to tell us Satan died at the shelter and to apologize. I asked why my girlfriend wasn't there and Jane said I'd have to talk to her myself. When I got home, I asked her where she was. She told me with Satan, and asked me ""how I could kill a dog."" No question about how I am, no comfort for what I had to do, nothing. I tell her I'm sorry, that I tried to back away, tried kicking it but it bit me. She keeps asking ""why"" I had to kill it, why I couldn't have tried other things, then accused me of killing it right away ""because I was always afraid of it."" This eventually made me blow up, tell her that her parents cared more about my well-being than she does and that I wasn't going to let myself get mauled to protect a fucking dog. She left and we haven't spoken since sunday, she's at her parents house and John called to check on me and told me they're talking to her.

So here we are. Neither of us willing to budge. She believes I should have done more to get Satan off me non-lethally and seems to think I killed it because I wanted to. I believe I did my best, had very little time or opportunity to react to a dog that had severely aggressive tendencies for years and while I didn't want to kill it I'd rather it die than leave me disfigured. I've grown up in a small town around free roaming dogs my whole life, I know when they just want to scare you and when they plan to rip you to shreds and this dog had murderous intent. I don't know how to communicate with her or make her see my side, and I feel betrayed and hurt she isn't even attempting to view this from my point of view. I understand she's going through a lot, but I feel like she's taking it out on me. How do we fix this?

TL;DR Girlfriend's parents vicious dog attacked me, I killed it to protect myself. Girlfriend seems completely indifferent to my experience and blames me for my actions, left home and refuses to speak to me. I feel hurt and betrayed. What do we do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9b3fzq/i_26m_killed_my_girlfriends_25f_parents_dog_in/,relationship_advice,2549,907,5.0
flashgreer,2018-08-27 16:25:21+00:00,My[32M] daughters[4F] babysitter[19F] kissed me last night.,"This is a long complicated situation,  so I apologize un advance. 

More than a year ago, my ex passed away in an accident. We had a daughter together, but I had never met her before. We broke up because I didnt want kids, and up until she died, I was nothing but a monthly check, and I was cool with that.

After she passed I got custody of my daughter, and started to try to be a dad. I needed help also, so I hired a babysitter, and later my mom moved here to help me out. In the past few months I found out that my daughter is profoundly gifted, and I've been trying to deal with that.

Now onto the situation at hand.

Over the last couple of months, things between my daughter(Lexi), and her babysitter(Molly), and I have went from a normal boss/employee relationship, to a grey area. I have recently noticed that I started to catch feelings for her.

At the beginning, Molly would babysit, while I worked, or take Lexi to preschool, or pick her up when I wasnt able, like normal. A bit later, i invited her to dinner with us, and it became a normal thing. Molly would eat with Lexi and i, and even would see movies with us sometimes. We all enjoyed it, and it started to feel like a little family.

A bit later, molly went to a movie with just me. She even started coming to D&amp;D with me sometimes, and would sit up and watch Netflix with me after Lexi fell asleep before heading home herself. I never acted on the budding feelings, but I did make a post asking if I should. The answer was almost unanimous that it was a bad decision, so I didnt.

Yesterday, I was off work, so I took Lexi and Molly to Disneyland. It was a great fun day, and all. But a few times things between molly and I felt a bit awkward. At the end of the night, I dropped her off at home, she asked if she could talk to me outside for a minute. 

I said ok. Molly started by apologizing for making things weird, and said that she has been thinking alot about everything. She said that she really loved Lexi, and she was really happy that she met us. She knows that since Lexi is in school full time now, that she knows her time with us would be alot less and she wanted to tell me that she felt really happy, and she hugged me.

I hugged her back, and I knew that I made a mistake. I held on too long, or too tightly, because a second later, out eyes met and she kissed me. The kiss was short and sweet, she also instantly apologized and ran inside.

This morning, she didnt say anything about what happened, and neither did I. I dont know if I should, or how to proceed. 

TL;DR my babysitter kissed me. I liked her before, but I really like her now. But I know that pursuing it is deeply complicated, and mildly problematic.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9aqe30/my32m_daughters4f_babysitter19f_kissed_me_last/,relationship_advice,1139,787,0.0

Katydid_or_didnt,2018-08-25 12:35:39+00:00,"My boyfriend’s ex-wife asked him to dog-sit for a week. She specified: he needs to sleep there, I am not welcome and it’s ‘easiest’ if he spends the night there with her on the evening before she leaves. He agreed.","
I’m 34f and have been dating a great guy for about eight months. He agreed to a request from his ex-wife that I think is WAY over the line for a normal friendship and thinks I’m overreacting in being upset. Here’s the deal: 

I knew that he had been married previously (for 3-4 yrs) and that he and his ex-wife were on good terms and are friendly.  They never had kids but shared a dog that he sees about once per month. 

It’s been like 2 years since their divorce and I genuinely am friends with most of my ex-boyfriends, so I found nothing strange about him being friends with his ex-wife. In fact, I consider it a positive thing: generally that means that nobody involved was bat-shit crazy, which seems like a good sign. 

Anyway, I’ve been with him for around 8 months and I’ve never had any reason not to trust him. I haven’t met her but know he’s told her he’s dating someone. She isn’t dating anyone and she (and her mother) still live in the house she and my boyfriend lived in while married. 

So my boyfriend tells me that she’s going on vacation with her mom and that he is going to go dog-sit. He tells me that she asked him to stay over there (it’s literally 5 minutes away). And, unfortunately, it was specifically stipulated that I am not invited to the house. 

I was trying to understand and talk it through with him but it was pretty irritating. I told him I’m concerned because this does NOT sound like a standard friendship. She seems comfortable asking things of him that are not reasonable to expect of a platonic friend especially when someone is doing you a favor. 

Most importantly: it’s concerning to me that he agreed so willingly to these requests. He seems to not be setting healthy boundaries. I was mad at him for a few days but I know he loves his dog, so I was trying to get over it until last night, when he added the cherry on top: 

In order to avoid traumatizing the dog, his ex has requested that he be present in the house at the moment she and her mother depart on vacation. And since their flight is VERY EARLY it’s easiest if he just stays over there the night before. 
I looked at him and said
 “ha!! Yeah right! That’s obviously over the line. 
Right? ... 
Right?....  
you did say ‘no’, right??” 

Nope. He did not. He didn’t say “no” to the request that he spend the night with his ex-wife in the home they shared as a married couple. 
He thinks it is ridiculous for me to be angry about this and thinks I should trust him. I don’t think I want to be in a relationship with someone who cannot identify when they are crossing a line. 

Any thoughts? Advice?

&amp;#x200B;

Monday last week I talked with a lawyer at work about the situation with the therapist. He looked at me like I was bullshitting him, and asked me if this was a prank. So I asked him if he wants to hear the recording. ""Damn right!"" was his answer. I talked again with him the next day, at the end of it.

He noted a few things I didn't pay attention to. On the recording, the therapist was always saying ""we think"", ""we want"", ""we talked about"", ""we decided"". Not once did she say ""Your Ex here asked me to talk with you"" or ""Your ex wants you to know"", or anything like that. It was always ""we this"", ""we that"".

He also asked me what my endgame is. Do I want to sue? He didn't think I personally have a case, to which I agreed. I never intended to sue anyway, but notify the appropriate institutions and let them deal with the therapist.

A decision was made to write two letters. One addressed to the clinic the therapist works at, and one for APA (we checked, she was accredited). By Wednesday there were a few more people at work aware of the situation, including one of the two case researchers. She dug up information about the therapist, online reviews, as well as the contacts for two of her previous patients. The therapist didn't have the best reviews, there were people upset with her, and we managed to track the two we talked with through social media. They were more than happy to help once we explained the situation, and their stories were not any better than mine.

The letters grew a consistent size, as we included the signed stories from the other two individuals, as well as my own description of how my ex changed once she started the therapy sessions, and a detailed description of how my meeting with the therapist went.

Friday last week I met with the parents. Her parents came to my parent's house, and we had the talk. My ex was there too, and more info was disclosed. That made its way to the report on the therapist as well.

This week, we sent the reports out. There was a reaction from the clinic. They called our office on Thursday morning, most probably to check if it is a prank or a real issue. We talked with their lawyer (or one of their lawyers) over the phone, and, when we confirmed it was legitimate, someone else was heard in the background, on their end, with a ""Well, crap!"" They said they are taking this very seriously. A conclusion from one of the guys at work was that they probably received other complaints before, but this is the first time someone did it so well documented. Their letter also mentioned we are reporting this to APA, that might have turned the heat on as well, hence their quick reaction.

I don't know what the result of this will be, and I consider my issue with it closed. However, having talked with the other two individuals that were ""treated"" by this therapist, I sincerely hope she is at least investigated, because she sounds insane and with an agenda (she ruined their relationships as well). One of the individuals was a woman, for the record.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, my ex and her parents.

&amp;#x200B;

Friday last week my parents called me and asked me to give them a visit after work. When I did, surprise! My ex and her parents were there too. My first reaction, seeing their cars in my parent's driveway, was to flee. This meeting was supposed to be on my terms, but she attempted to take the reigns to it. That was not going to happen, let me tell you.

My ex was waiting for me outside. She looked VERY good. If there was ever a girl you'd like your parents to meet, she was the image of it.

She told me ""they"" are here to talk with me, and see if we can fix this. ""They"" as in her parents. She either never told them what happened, or she gave them a version of a story they were not buying.

She had a journal with her. She told me she started writing in it before she began therapy, and continued writing in it until that Friday morning. That I should read it and it will clear out all this mess. I told her this is not a book club.

I wanted to go inside and get the circus going, but she asked me if I can give her ten minutes. She wants to talk with me for ten minutes before I talk with her parents. And she kept handing me her journal, and started crying. And then my sister showed up, and then my ex's sister showed up. They were already there, and came out to ""check on us"". So I took her journal, went inside, said hello, and lead my ex in the back of the garden, to an as isolated portion of my parent's garden as possible (they have a large garden with a lot of trees and benches).

She quit her job. The stress was too much, and she had a breakdown, it escalated, never got better. She is no longer seeing the therapist. She started seeing the therapist for work related matters, but somehow it turned into matters about our relationship, and it stayed focus on the relationship because it was the only thing the therapist seemed interested in. She never told her parents why she is my ex. She is seeing another therapist now.

I just listened.

She turned the discussion from ""her"" to ""us"". Told me I would be in control. I will be managing the finances. I will receive access to all her devices. I will be able to track everywhere she goes. Any property we will own will be in my name. She will do anything I want to trust her again. Basically things she said in her messages over the last weeks. She enumerated more things than the ones I mention. I don't know how she thinks that would be a healthy life, for either of us.

I asked her is she cheated. She told me she had the opportunity to cheat, but she had never. I believe her. But it also angered me. What does she mean ""she had the opportunity""? If you are in a committed relationship, you don't put yourself in a position where you have this opportunity. You don't want this opportunity. It's like saying ""I had the opportunity to kill someone today"". Why? What were you doing that there was such an opportunity. Why call it opportunity anyway, it makes it sound like something positive.

That pretty much ended our ten minutes, and told her we should go and talk with our parents.

So we did. I asked our sisters to leave us alone, as it was not any of their concern what was to be discussed. My sister huffed and puffed, but a house made of stone survives hurricanes - and she was not one.

Well, I talked, and explained what happened, how the therapy session went, and my resolve. I didn't mention I had a recording, because I never had to. My ex confirmed everything I said, which surprised me. Her father had teary eyes, and that broke my heart. Her mother asked her if this is how she thinks they raised her, and asked for an explanation.

My ex basically told them the same story. Stress at work. Depression. Breaking down. Therapy. Therapist wanting to talk only about our relationship. That the therapist told her our relationship was the root of all her stress. That the therapist convinced her I want an open relationship. That she might lose me if she doesn't level her sexual experience with me. How my reaction woke her up from her slump. She quit her job, is looking for something less stressful. She will do anything I want to get me back. Started crying.

My ex mentioned the journal again, and said if I read it, it will explain everything, and that she was not on board with the therapist's ideas, but she went along with them because the therapist was a person with authority and experience. Our parents looked at me and I told them someone's private journal is not the type of literature I read, unless they are a dead poet.

&amp;#x200B;

Big fucking mistake!

&amp;#x200B;

My intention was to relate that someone's private journals usually becomes literature if they are a famous writer, or leader, and usually they are published post mortem. Also, I was hoping they get the hint that I don't really want to read her journal, because it would be of no consequence. What was done was done. Everyone looked at me as if I wished death on my ex. You could smell the hostility in the air.

So I said ""fine, fine"" and ""promissed"" I will read her journal. You win some, you lose some, and then you use the wrong words and you lose a few more.

My ex is seeing a new therapist. She showed her parents emails confirming her appointments. He's an older dude, with a white beard like Freud. I searched him online, he is married, he attends conferences, he wrote a few books (they are on Amazon, ha!), seems like a solid character.

&amp;#x200B;

""Can you kids work this out?""

&amp;#x200B;

This was the second thing that angered me that day. As if this is child play, and we should just listen to the adults. We are not old enough to be in control of our own feeling, and we should definitely not be the ones to decide what we consider a betrayal you can't recover from. We are just ""kids"" and we should just work it out. So I won back some ground on the ""dead poets society"" remark earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

And this is how the day ended.

&amp;#x200B;

We've known each other for 9 years, and have been a couple for 5 years. Even if there are legitimate reasons behind her behavior, how do you go back to being the same? This wasn't even a reset. My way of thinking about my ex has been fundamentally changed. She became a stranger I know a lot of things about. Sure, I still find her attractive. VERY attractive, they way she looked last Friday was amazing. No denying that. But it was also calculated, I am not going to lie myself here. Hair done the way I like it, dress that I bought for her, the shoes I like the most, a hint of the perfume I gifted her, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The journal... 

...is on my nightstand. I haven't read it, and I probably never will. I did look through it, to see if it indeed is a year old, and it is. The way the pages folded, the ink is clearly older on the first pages, and you can see it progressing through the pages. The pen she used was attached to the journal, and I tested it, looks like the same ink. And the ink level in the pen is consistent with how much I assume the pen has been used for the last year to write the journal. It is not a fake. Everything about it is consistent with a year's worth of wear and tear.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't see what good reading it will make me. A tool to play with one's mind? Well, not rally, I don't think a year ago when she started writing it she intended to use it as manipulation. If what she told me is right, her new therapist suggested the idea to share the journal with myself.

&amp;#x200B;

As for how I am handling people that are too curious about why the wedding is off? ""We had a huge difference of opinion that we could not find a solution to."" More or less.

But if her sister finds out why, and this is more than likely, because her sister is very close to their mother, everyone will find out the real reason why.

&amp;#x200B;

Our parents want us to meet again next week. They told me to read the journal, and maybe that helps. Maybe we can work on it. Start again, fresh, since we have so much history. She will get treatment, she will get better, she still is the same woman I fell in love with, but she is not well right now. They can tell I still love her, or else I would not be so ""theatrical"", their words, not mine.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I will meet them next Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

But, damn! She did look amazing!

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to thank the community for the support and help. It was enough to help me put together a plan of action regarding the therapist. Thank you to those who provided resources and information about what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

sexyhappyunicorn,2018-08-23 15:35:53+00:00,"Mom and Dad (F58, M60) may divorce over birthday gift I (F30) got him","Recently my Dad celebrated his 60th birthday. He’s always wanted a man cave so I had a friend take a prefab shed, fully outfit it and bring it during the party. 

My Dad loved it. My Mom did not. 

She yelled at me (in front of everyone) about how I knew she was going to transform their den into his man cave for Christmas and I did this to upstage her. I had no idea she had this planned because we don’t talk other than family celebrations a few times a year. We spoke 1 time about his party and that was to confirm that I was bringing the champagne. I told her she must have told my sister (who I also rarely talk to). 

She began screaming and crying about how I’ve always been a horrible daughter, how much she regretted having me, how my sister is her favorite , etc. (to be honest at this point I tuned her out because I’d heard it all before). I walk away, she follows me. My Dad stepped in front of her and told her to knock it off. She storms away and pouts.

At this point guests are leaving. My Dad asked if we could go to my house and continue the party. I agree. We began loading the food in my truck. My Mom throws his cake on the floor. We go around her. 

My sister gets in my face about how I ruined the party, I tell her to back off (also a drama queen). Then my Mom storms over to us and yells at me for being mean to my sister. I ignore her and continue packing the food.

My Mom gives my Dad an ultimatum – either stay or leave for good. My Dad packs several suitcases, asks my friend to transport his man cave to my house and tells my Mom he’ll be back for the rest of his things later. My Mom is crying and my sister consoles her. We leave.

We continue the party at my house and have a good time despite everything that happened. 

After the party, I apologize to my Dad. He tells me I have nothing to apologize for, he and my Mom have been having issues for a few years now and this isn’t about me so stay out of it. I tell him he can stay in my guest room for as long as he needs. He happily accepts.

It’s been 3 weeks. My Dad has essentially moved in. I don’t mind. My Dad is cool. Plus I feel guilty since his leaving is my fault.


About a week ago I ask my Dad if he has spoken to my Mom. He answered no and he doubts if he will anytime soon since she leaves him such angry messages. I asked him if he wanted to work it out. He told me he’s not going to discuss it with me since I’m his child not his friend. Fair enough.


Last night I overheard him ask his poker friends for a good divorce attorney in case he leaves her for good. He doesn’t see the point of marriage counseling. That he’s felt better than he’s felt in decades being away from her. 


I feel really guilty. I didn’t mean for any of this to happen. 

What should I do? Should I stay out of it like my Dad told me to? Should I try to intervene at this point? Any and all advice is welcome. Thanks.

heresjohnny94,2018-08-22 00:45:26+00:00,I (31M) am sterile. Fiancé (27F) miraculously got pregnant. Baby looks nothing like me. How do I address this?,"We had been trying to have a baby for a few years. Eventually we found out I was sterile. We accepted it and decided to hold off on trying so hard and said that we would figure out what I do in the future. Although we weren’t trying, we were continuing to have sex obviously. One day she missed her period and we found out he was pregnant. I was so happy and I thought it was amazing. We joked about how as soon as we stopped trying she ends up pregnant. The doctor said that it was a miracle baby. 

The night that the baby was born I couldn’t be happier. I was just happy to finally have a baby and so excited to take her home. After a few days of taking care of her, I couldn’t help but notice that she was extremely pale. For reference, I am black and she is white. I figure she would eventually darken a little and I didn’t want to overthink it. 

Then our friends came over and while the girls were inside we were outback drinking. They all mentioned that they didn’t want to worry me or to cause drama but asked if I ever thought my fiancé would cheat on me. I thought I was very weird and then I knew exactly where they were going with it. I said no and we talked about our concerns with the babies skin tone. However I still tried to brush it off thinking that the baby would get darker after a while. 

Now the baby is 5 months and I can’t help but question if she’s mine everyday. She has very fine hair. No kinks or curls, just bone straight hair. I know she’s a baby but I have been around plenty of babies who still have natural curls. She is also still very pale. The thing that’s been bothering me the most is that everyday she looks more and more Asian in the eyes. I don’t mean to offend anyone at all but her eyes are just very stretched, they look nothing like mine. 

Is it wrong for me to be questioning my fiancé when this would have never crossed my mind before? Am I just being paranoid? How do I go about addressing this? Do I even say anything? My biggest fear is that the baby is somehow mine and she will be extremely hurt that I accused her of sleeping with someone else. I just don’t know what to do. Please help me. 

Tldr; fiancé having our miracle baby after I had been confirmed to be sterile. Baby looks nothing like me. I dont want to look like an ass but I feel I need to address this. What do I do?

just_shhhhhh,2018-08-21 15:07:43+00:00,Came home to my wife in a great mood and my Xbox all muddy and full of holes.,"So, I came home from work last night, thinking I would unwind and play some GTA. To my bewilderment, my xbox was right were it always is, but it was super muddy and full of holes. Big holes. Specifically, what looked like pick axe holes. I picked up the console, showed it to my wife, and calmly asked for an explanation. Her response was two words: ""pest control"". 

I get it. I do. I've been gaming a lot lately. I've asked her several times to go shopping with me at our ""local"" outlet malls for new clothes. I've asked her countless times to get out of the house for dates that I know she likes. I quit trying to seduce her months ago because she gets verbally abusive. I've asked her politely countless times to pitch in with cleaning/cooking (she sits around reading or watching TV whenever she isn't out with her girlfriends). I've asked her hundreds of times to spend less time with her girlfriends and more time with me. I suggested counseling, which only causes fighting. Most recently, I bought box seat opera tickets (her favorite) to surprise her and ended up going by myself. Every time my suggestions end in a fight with her yelling at me to leave her alone as she locks herself in the bedroom until I leave. After getting absolutely nowhere with exhaustive communication attempts,  I decided to buy an xbox to spend some free time with, but apparently that's a no-no too. 

Good thing I didn't get a dog. I hate to think what she would have done to the poor thing. 

Most recently, I've been suspecting her of two-timing; she hasn't come home a couple of times this month and her friends all tell me that she wasn't with them. 

I've got the divorce papers right in front of me. This is not who I married and I do not intend to subject myself to this abuse anymore.

My fiance had an affair with her colleague, which I found out continued well after I confronted her about her infidelity. 

The past month we reconciliated but she refused to cut off the other guy. Tonight they went out for company drinks and she called me late at night to inform me that she spoke with him and told him she wants to fix our relationship. 

The guy accepted that apparently. But now my fiance called me saying she will spend one last night with him and from tomorrow it is over. 

I do not know how to process what she has told me. I've been very vocal that she must cut him off, and not spend time with him. Instead she is all emotional and saying things like ""I want to hug him one last time"".

My gut feeling is that this is not how this works. Like an idiot, I said do as you wish, I will not tell you what to do. I followed up with a text saying I am not OK with this.

throwawaykhw,2018-08-18 13:51:02+00:00,Trigger warning. I don’t know what to do. Initially consensual sex became nightmare.,"I went to a coworkers party tonight and got very drunk. It seemed like a very safe environment. Another coworker and I were flirting hard (after months of sexual tension) and he asked me to come to the bathroom with him where we kinda fooled around but not really because I felt super uncomfortable about it. He asked me what sexual things I like. I felt silly but I told him, which included that I like to be submissive. We talked about other things and left the bathroom.

We get an uber and leave together. I remember that, and I remember when we started to have sex. And then everything got bad.

He asked to have anal with me. I said no. 

He wouldn’t stop asking. And then he had his hands deep in my hair and was pulling super hard, he was slapping me without asking and on my face, choking, and all the while wanted to penetrate me anally. I kept saying no. A few times he tried to pretend to mishear me when he said “where to you want it?” 

As I rejected him, he’d get more forceful. He choked more, and I became truly scared, like he was drunk enough to really hurt me, choke me too long.... He finally put me on him, held me tight, holding my head tight against his, and said “you are going to do this”. When he did it, he pulled my hair super hard, and made me say “yes, sir”. He didn’t use lube.

From that point forward I had no choice. I felt more scared than I ever have and I just did what he wanted and hoped he’d just finish and stop. The bed was covered in my hair, he pulled so much of it out. He didn’t end up orgasming.

He fell asleep abruptly but it took me a little time to be brave enough to make a run for it. I left his place as quietly as I could and got an uber home. The first thing I did was write here.

He’s a super well liked person in our company and I think he’d be believed over me because I’m newer and he didn’t cum so I can do a rape kit and the first part of our sexual interaction was consensual. 

I think this was rape, but I don’t think I can do anything now but get a new job. I never want to see him again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/98bt9t/trigger_warning_i_dont_know_what_to_do_initially/,relationship_advice,3626,818,2.0

We are both generally aware of each others financial situations. I understand that she has a manageable amount of student loan debt and am prepared to take that on. She understands that I am debt free and have some family money that supplements that income.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/92xmc1/update_i_19f_had_a_summer_fling_with_an_older_guy/)

Hi guys!

I'm back again with an (happy) update. First of all, I would like to once again, thank—from the bottom of my heart—everyone who commented kind and supportive messages. You guys are all amazing! 

It's been about three weeks since my last post and a lot of great things have happened since then!

First, If any of you all remember, in my very first post, one of the reasons I decided to contact Nick after meeting him was because he works at a really prestigious research lab at our university. The lab only accepts 1-2 undergrad students a year and the PI is a big deal (he won the Nobel prize). I wanted to have Nick as a connection so if in the future, I felt like applying for a position, he could maybe put a word in for me or help me out with my cover letter. 

Around a week and a half ago, I sent in my application for a position at the lab. I wrote a brilliant cover letter, brushed up my resume, got two recommendations, my transcript, and sent an email over to the professor. I was fully expecting it to be ignored (since that's a common thing with that lab in particular) but to my utmost surprise, the PI actually responded! He thanked me for my application and said that he was impressed by my application and said I was a brilliant writer. He asked me if I would be willing to come to his office for a chat, to which I eagerly agreed to. 

We had the meeting and basically all we talked about was science. He asked me what I thought about some of his current research and I happily gave him my thoughts (and critiques!). I also talked a lot about what I wanted out of my experience at his lab (e.g. what I wanted to research). At the end, he told me that he was astounded by my depth of knowledge in the area and that he hasn't ever had such an advanced discussion with any undergrad. He also said he was very impressed with my intellectual curiosity. Then, HE OFFERED ME THE POSITION. I was so happy I actually had to refrain from squealing. I thanked him about 100 times. I start on Monday. :)

Second, remember the reason why I decided to break things off with Nick? It was because I was starting to develop feelings for someone else that I had been hanging out with. We've been hanging out quite a lot but always just as friends. He's in the same year as me at college and is one of the sweetest and kindest people I know. He's also a little shy and I've recently been kinda getting the feeling that he might be into me but I just brushed it off thinking it was his slightly awkward nature. But two night ago when we were hanging out at my dorm playing chess, he asked me if I wanted to go to this fancy new French place that opened up in the city with him. I was like ""Sure!"" and then I hesitated, decided to swallow up my pride, and asked ""...like as a date?"". His cheeks actually turned red and he mumbled, ""Do you want it to be a date?"" and I giggled and said, ""Yes!!"". He smiled all cute and then I checkmated him.

Lastly, I've been feeling good! I'm feeling as fresh as a breeze and as light as a feather. I'm so excited to start school at the end of September and I can't wait to start my new job (eek!!). I also started birth control (the pill) and so far so good!

One last thing. A lot of girls have reached out to me saying that they are in similar experiences and that my posts gave them encouragement and confidence. Reading those actually made me tear up. Thank you to all who reached out and let me know, you guys are all so so strong and I am so proud of all of you guys. 

That's about it from me (forever maybe!). Once again, thank you all so so much for the kindness, support, and encouragement!

TL;DR: I got the job and the boy! :D

DalekPhilosopher,2018-08-16 14:49:06+00:00,[Update] I [M31] don't like tattoos and my soon to be wife [F30] just got one in the worst possible place,"My previous post can be read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/96qbj9/i_m31_dont_like_tattoos_and_my_soon_to_be_wife/).

I would like to thank those who provided feedback and perspective, and have not straight out called me an asshole.

We will continue with the wedding as planned. We realize we still need to work on our communication. But we are also painfully aware how miserable we both were during this whole ordeal. This has been our first serious ""fight"".

What happened?

Insecurity. She had this idea that I don't think she is dedicated to our relationship. She wanted to prove it somehow. Turns out, the end result wasn't something she was that happy with either. My initial reaction didn't help, and for the next few days things spiraled out of control.

After the post here on reddit, I decided we need to sit down and put our ducks in order. I love her, and she loves me, and there was no reason why we would not be able to untangle this mess.

Why I hate tattoos? All she knew is that I am not a fan of them, but not the reason. When I was younger, a lot younger, I was horribly abused by someone that had many tattoos. I don't associate people that have tattoos with abusers, but I am also not a fan of the tattoo culture because of it.

She didn't know, because I never talked with her about it. I suppose I never wanted her to think I am vulnerable. Or that I was. You can imagine, after these many years, my thoughts on the matter are still mixed.

Anyway, she was horrified to learn about this, started crying.

She will have the tattoo removed. After the original post I have come to the conclusion that her new skin decoration is something I will have to live with, but at the end of the day, she is the one I want, and a mild annoyance will not define our relationship. I told her this, but she will get it removed anyway. I think she is horrified by the revelation :(

We also decided on couple's counseling, to see if it is something that will work for us. If either of us will be uncomfortable, we will not continue with it.

We also decided not to be assholes to one another in petty matters. I will wear shorts again, god dammit! Ha ha, that was a funny conversation. We won't impose restrictions on one another. I will go out with friends and watch football with them again. She can go and meet her girlfriends. We will put a lot of work in ourselves individually, and as a couple.

Turns out, we have a problem with communication. But the prospects are positive.

Her insecurities didn't want me to go out with friends, because some of them are single, and what if they bring women there that tempt me? So she always had to be there. But she doesn't like football, so you can see where this is going.

I am happy with the results of the original post. She is happy I took the initiative and broke the ice. My fears were she had the tattoo done as a ""power play"". But there was no malice. I want a relationship of equals, where a decision can be made as a couple.

We will see where this is going, but the last two days have been amazing.

I was asked this question, so here is the answer: we live together. We own a house 50 - 50. The night of the tattoo reveal, I went to my parents. She went to her parents. Essentially, until two days ago none of us lived home. She said she doesn't want to be there if I am not there.

As a closing note, this could have been a huge mistake for both of us. Communication is key. I urge couples out there to learn from my story, and open up to one another. Had I done that sooner, I would have never been here.

Butterfly-Lovers,2018-08-15 01:36:23+00:00,"Everything is too good to be true, this man (31 M) who came into my (21 F) life is spoiling me very hard. I have some questions.","A few weeks ago, I was on my own at the park and got stopped by a man with a camera who wanted to take my picture. I let him take a few pictures and some he asked to be in the photo with me, I didn’t really give it any thoughts. 

He saw me at the park alone, and after the pictures he wanted to walk with me and I really didn’t mind because he was friendly, I thought why not.  As I didn’t have plans for the rest of that day, he and I went and got some frozen yogurt. He asked if I wanted one of those rides with the horse carriages they do at the park and I never did one of those and thought it would be fun, so I said no because it was expensive. But he insisted so I took him up on the offer and I was blown away because we got a really nice tour and I saw many places I haven’t seen

Later that day he took me to a rooftop bar (which also I’ve never been to) and spent a lot of money on me again and I think he’s the nicest person in the world, never had a guy spend money like that on me before so it was bizarre and surreal

He asked me out the next morning, took me to the zoo, museum, smoothies, a fancy restaurant and another park. Under the bridge he told me he sees a lot in me and I’m too unconfident and he would like to see that change. He got slightly upset that I wouldn’t really kiss him and kept covering my mouth and when he asked why many times I broke down a little bit and showed him my teeth and started choking up from embarrassment, and then he said he would help me pay for them, I told him I already have free government insurance and i could fix it on my own and thanked him again and told him he really doesn’t have to always be so generous 

The next morning he emailed me with directions to an institute that works on teeth and said to go there and get an appointment, and that he will pay for everything and not to worry about the cost. I told him that was too nice but with my condition it’s not what he thinks it’s gonna cost. He said he’s going to pay for every single tooth in my head and told me again not to worry about the price. I am shocked.  

2 weeks go by, and I’m getting email after email of these expensive gift cards to these high end stores and places, I thank him for every one every single time, but I feel guilty because there’s nothing I’ve really done to deserve this treatment, like nearly a thousand and I haven’t even touched any single of them yet or made the appointment. He’s mailed things to my house. I feel so strange. What should I do with all these gifts? I feel so guilty using them 

He tells me he’s planning trips with me overseas and he’s going to move me away to live in a private resort area with him. 

He never gave me his real name when I asked and the ones in his email are , I won’t say here, but they are basically words that describe luxury. He told me 

What do you guys think is going on? The only person I told about this is my sister and I showed her our pics and she said he looks way older than 30, she also suggested what if he was a secret celebrity or something? But she also suggested he might be trying to plot something scary which I also feel guilty of thinking because he’s so nice to me. 

What do you guys think?

TLDR; I don’t know why this nice man is spending so much on me insistingly and I am curious if any of you have any ideas or experience, or maybe advice on how I should go about from here, even better if anyone has any ideas what’s the right thing for me to do.

ambivalent_balloon,2018-08-14 12:45:59+00:00,Help. I [28M] just found out my wife [26F] is cheating on me. I am completely lost.,"Backstory: We’ve been married for over 5 years. We have an awesome relationship. We both love each other. We get along handsomely and we are each other’s best friends. I haven’t told anyone because she has basically become my sole confidant. 


Last month, her behavior changed drastically. Wearing nicer clothing, planning solo outings, coming home and immediately showering, etc. 


When you live with someone for 5 years, you get a sense of who they really are, and she hasn’t been herself so much that I took the plunge and looked in her purse. She purchased a new bottle of lubricant that I have never used before with her. It is a different brand than we usually use (if we use it) and it has only stayed in her purse. 


The thing that really sealed the deal was that I was able to open her phone (she has been taking her phone absolutely everywhere. It’s basically impossible to separate her from it) and see a message she sent to a new “friend” on a popular messaging app that basically read: “I had fun messing around with you the other day. Let’s do it again soon. I want you.”


Am I crazy to think she is cheating on me?


If not, do you think I have enough evidence to confront her? 


I just broke down the other day when she came home. I was able to pass it off as other things stressing me out, but I feel like my life is exploding around me. I don’t know what to do.

marcieabadeeer,2018-08-12 11:28:48+00:00,My [29F] husband [34M] of 6 months can’t leave my bookcase alone!,"I know it’s ridiculous but I just spent a little under $2,000 on a huge built in bookcase for the sitting room in our new house. I love it. It is my pride and joy. It should be noted that this was 100% my purchase, because I am a massive bookworm, and my husband isn’t interested in reading at all. He was cool with me devoting this wall to it, and I’ve been excited about the project for months. I agreed (and paid) for a TV stand to be incorporated for him as per his design. 

It was finally installed on Wednesday and I adore it! There was one small annoyance - my husband was here while the company were installing and he made a minor design change so he could fit a larger TV on the stand. This resulted in me losing one shelf. Heh, oh well. 

He asked for a few shelves to be “his” to display some games and memorabilia, which of course was fine. I arranged books and various other things around this. Later the same day, he decided he didn’t want those shelves. I moved everything around to accommodate that (I know it’s lame but I alphabetise my books). 

This morning he was up before me. I’ve come downstairs and he’s started drilling holes in my bookcase! He’s partially cut this awful wonky square out so he can drag leads for games consoles and the TV through the TV stand. It’s only maybe a couple inches big but it’s not even straight and it’s damaged all the wood and scuffed the wall.  I get the idea of a space for leads to come through, but he was ok with asking the company to change the design so why couldn’t he ask them to do this too if it was so vital? He’s not a carpenter, and it looks dreadful. He’s now saying he can’t finish it with me here ‘moaning’ about it and will do it tomorrow when I’m at work, and insists all he’s going to do is ‘finish’ this awful hole he’s making. 

I’m probably hyper focused but I’m so upset. I’ve been looking forward to this for months and I just feel like he’s ruining it! I can’t stand the thought of him hacking it up.

dkman22,2018-08-11 00:42:57+00:00,"Three weeks ago my wife (32/f) of ten years left me (43/m) out of the blue, found out a week later it was for another man.","**Wife is 32 I am 34, typo in title** 

We've been married for eight years, together for ten. Eight years ago, about five months after our wedding my wife left me for another man, we were separated for five months but never got a divorce, she then came back asking for a 2nd chance and I gave it to her. The last 8 years were immensely better than the previous two. We had a stronger relationship than ever, for 8 years we never fought, never argued and only on the rarest of instances (maybe like 5 times in 8 years) raised our voices to each other. 

She was the perfect little wife, she loved to cook/bake and spoiled me, all my friends were jealous of how much my wife does for me, and I made it perfectly clear to her every single day how much I appreciate all she does for me, how much I love her and we would bask in how much better our relationship seemed than everyone else's. 

I signed up for nursing school 6 months ago, the school is in a city 150 miles away. I'd still be home 3-4 nights a week but I'd be up in school for a big chunk of every week for two years. I didn't make this decision without her, we discussed it a lot and she was super supportive and we were both excited about the kind of pay I'd be earning when I graduate. We could finally get a nice house, finally go on nice vacations every year instead of once every few years. 

We have both put on a lot of weight over the last decade, we both really let ourselves go, food was a real comfort in life for us and she loved to cook and bake treats (shes a professional baker.) We have both tried and failed dozens of times to lose the weight, always falling back into our bad habits after a couple of months. 

4 months ago we started again, it was going really well until I had a surprise medical emergency and needed surgery that had me laid up for a couple months, I was in serve pain all the time but she was wonderful the whole time. I went back to my bad eating habits out of need of comfort but she stayed true to the course (or so I thought) and continued to lose weight. I was so proud of her and while she did have a lot of sagging and loose skin issues I couldn't have cared less. I love this woman with my entire heart and soul, I didn't care if she weighed 120lbs or 400lbs her mind and her heart were all that mattered to me. 

In the back of your mind, when a spouse starts to lose weight and you don't you always get a small tingle of fear of ""what could happen"" but I never let that get to me, after all she had made that mistake 8 years ago and really truly regretted it, so I assumed she learned her lesson and it would never be an issue again. Oh how wrong I was. 

She ended up losing 75lbs (needed to lose 90 to get to her goal weight) and was looking so good. I guess that's when the attention from male customers at work started to flow in. 

I had one more surgery planned for July 21st, it was just to finish up the first one, the recovery and pain was supposed to be nothing like before (and it wasn't I feel great now concerning the surgery area) 

We went on a overnight road trip on June 29th and it was fantastic, we made some of the best love we had made in months after that trip. Everything seemed perfect.

July 4th was the start of the weirdness tho. I noticed all of a sudden she started getting distant, wouldn't reply to text nearly as often as she had before, didn't kiss me hard like she would before, would just kind of drape her arms on me in bed or when we hug instead of the tight squeezes I am accustomed to. 

I asked if everything was ok, mentioned the changes I have noticed and she assured me things were fine, that work had just been really stressful lately and it was getting to her (which is true, her job has been nuts lately) and that she would try to get back into our old groove. 

Nothing changed, if anything the text started coming less frequently, the kisses left often, she would sleep on the other side of the bed instead of snuggled up next to me like she always did. Something was definitely wrong. 

I decided I was going to be the best husband I could be, I started doing all the choirs so she had none, I did all the cooking or got take out so she had less stress when she got home from work, I went out and picked a huge set of wild flowers, the same ones I picked for her on our honeymoon. I wrote page long love letters that I wrote from the heart (no fake romantic bs.)

All of this fell on deaf ears, I had snuck out after she fell asleep to do the flower/note thing. I assumed when she got up for work she would come back in the bedroom and wake me up. She didn't... she didn't even text me about them. Finally I sent her a text asking how work was going, assuming she would then tell me about how much she liked the flowers and note. Nothing. I finally asked her if she saw them/read the note and she said ""yeah that was sweet of you."" I knew something was wrong now but you really want to live in denial when this kind of thing is happening. The next night I asked for her cell phone just to transfer some photos to it and I could see her deleting a bunch of text before she handed it to me (i wouldn't have even checked her text) she also started spending way more time on her phone than she ever had before. Alarm bells were ringing like crazy. 

My birthday came up and she made me my favorite meal but we were both too tired from work and such for sex that night. The next day I tried to get something going in the bed and for the first time in our relationship she couldn't get in the mood after I had started all the old reliable go to's. She was even closing her legs while I was trying to get her going, something she had never done. She apologized and said shes just stressed from work and we both went to sleep.

5 days later I told her I was going to go see a friend but really I just went to the near by beach to think about what I should do. I decided there that if she wants out of our marriage I'll let her out. I came home and she was just getting out of the shower. I finally confessed all the fears I'd been feeling right there in the bathroom, and with tears streaming down my face I told her if she wants out of our marriage I'll let her go because I love her too much to keep her some place she won't be happy. She was crying too and told me no, she wanted to stay and felt bad that her actions were making me feel this way and fearing so much for our marriage. 

Things were kind of normal the next day but you could tell something was still off. That night she slept with a blanket dam between us.

The next morning I set her some lovey dovey text and she never replied, I checked facebook messenger a few times and she was constantly being active on there, which meant she was ignoring my text. I called her at work to see how her day is going and all that and then asked why it felt like she was ignoring me, she said she was just busy. My surgery was the next day and we were supposed to leave that evening for a nice date night and a surprise I had planned for her along the way. I assumed things would get better after that and just let it go. 

About an hour later I get a huge text about how she's sorry but she just wants out of our marriage, she said she's been unhappy for a while and just wants out, after some back and forth that changed to she ""just needs time to think"" I freaked out about the whole situation and went to my brothers house, where I would be staying for school and where we had planned to be that night anyways, seeing as my surgery was in the same town. I let her know I would be there and that if she wanted to talk or see me, even at 3am I would drive right down, I just didn't want to be alone so I went to stay with family and I had to be up there to get surgery anyway. I asked her several times to come up because I wanted her face to be the first thing I see when I wake up from surgery but she never replied. She wouldn't answer phone calls, started ghosting me. The surgery came and went and she never even asked me how it went. I tried talking to her several times but she wouldn't reply to any text and when she would talk to me on the phone (only when I called her at work) she would just tell me she's sorry and needs time to think.

I got a text from her mom asking me some general questions and that seemed strange to me, I don't think she'd talk to me about this stuff if she knew what we were going through. I assumed my wife had been staying at her house since she didn't want to stay at our home. I asked my wife where she was staying because I assumed it was her parents and she told me she was staying with her friend Faith. 

I ended up using find my iPhone the next day to see where she was. She was at some house I'd never seen before, miles down the road from where she said she was staying. I called her out on this over text and she again assured me she was at Faiths and the GPS must be wonky because of the bad cell coverage there. 

The next day I turned on the app when I knew she was getting off work and watched her drive straight to this strange house again. I called her when she pulled into the driveway but she of course didn't answer. I then sent her a screenshot of her location and told her if she wasn't honest with me right now I was going to drive over there and pound on the front door. 

The truth finally came out. She has been talking to another guy for a month or so and she lives with him now. They're head over heals in love and she leaving me for him. He's only here temporarily for work so when he goes back to the other side of the country shes wants to go with him, she turned down a huge promotion at work shes been working her ass off for 2 years to get, turned it down two days before it was supposed to go through. She's going to leave her family, friends, career, everything for this new guy. She erased her phone and with it the last ten years of memories we have built together (photos, videos, etc) Then she confessed that the reason she lost all this weight is because she's been abusing pain pills (but stopped cold turkey a couple weeks ago) and not eating but one small meal a day at dinner time with me (I thought she had lost weight from healthy choices) 

I've been a wreck since then, she won't talk to me at all about anything. I know I just need to walk away but I am still very much in love with her, just extremely hurt. I offered everything and anything to try and save our marriage (even forgetting about school) but it all fell on deaf ears.  

It's been 3 weeks now and it only seems to hurt more each day. I feel like there are two people living inside my head, the one that says ""fuck her man, you can never trust her again, give up and move on"" and the one that says ""I love this woman more than anything, I've never loved someone this much and never could again, I need her back.""

All my friends and family tell me I just need to block those thoughts out and focus on school (which starts Monday) but I care about her so much and I feel like she's just having a huge mental breakdown. I also don't know this guy at all and don't know if he's abusive or a manipulator or planning to use her and leave her, I fear for her safety but there is nothing I can do. 

My friends tell me ""She's going to come begging back in 6 months, dont take her back."" but honestly I feel like she won't, even if i couldn't take her back I wish she would give me that call just so I could feel less worthless, like the last ten years didn't mean nothing to her. But she's head over heals for this new guy and pretending I dont exist and the last ten years never happened. 

I've been dealing with some really dark thoughts (about myself) haven't been eating (losing a lot of weight which is nice I guess lol) and I'm lucky if I get a couple hours of sleep every night. 

I'm a wreck, I'm in a deep depression, I don't know what to do, how to make these feelings go away. Honestly I'm not even sure why I am typing all this out, I guess I'm just desperate for any kind of advice.

LilWetNap,2018-08-10 03:41:17+00:00,Update: my(23/m) girlfriend(24/f)got on a rapper's tour bus and tried to hide it from me,"1st post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/95wgtw/my_23m_girlfriend24f_got_on_a_rappers_tour_bus/?st=JKNEVJO8&amp;sh=bba3bac4

So today's been a very long and eventful day. As I stated in a comment on my original post earlier, I'm not going to name the rapper because I don't think he did anything wrong and I don't want to put his name out there and possibly risk sending any negativity his way. I've had about 70 people ask me if it was G-Eazy and the answer is no....c'mon I said the guy is one of my favorite rappers, who in their right mind claims G-Eazy as their favorite rapper(joking..kinda).

Anyways, she blew my phone up all morning and afternoon and I didn't respond to any of her texts or calls basically all day. Eventually I decided to read through the texts she sent me. She confessed about not telling me about the back stage passes and then going on the tour bus. I guess she put 2 and 2 together and realized that I knew anyways. I sent her a few long texts explaining how what she did made me feel and how I was crushed that she could do something like that to me after 3+ years of dating.

I asked her if she could meet me at a cafe near my apartment so we could talk. I wanted to talk in person and I wanted it to be somewhere in public so I would be cautious to watch my tone and so we could discuss things in the most civil manner possible considering the situation. She agreed and we sat down an talked for about 2hrs. She told me every detail about what had happened last night.

I'll get straight to the point because I know that a lot of you are wondering. Yes she did admit to messing around with her friends and giving him head, no sex, her friends had sex with him but she just gave him head. In my books it's the exact same thing, I might even consider having oral sex with someone else to be worse than actually having sex. She told me she was absolutely wasted and would have never done something like that had she been sober...and I believe her. Not because it's something she wouldn't want to do more like it's something she wouldn't have the audacity to do without being drunk first. She cried pretty much the whole time and went to the bathroom atleast 10x to dry her face off. She suggested that I think about breaking up with her because she loves me and can't picture her life without me....blah blah blah.

After she got done saying everything she needed to say I told her that "" I don't look at you any differently as a PERSON, everyone makes mistakes. Maybe it was a mistake on your part, maybe it wasn't. I can't tell you which it is because you're the only one that knows the answer to that, what I do know is that I look at you differently as a PARTNER now based on your actions, I thought that we could have done well together as a team but now those days are over and after tonight I want nothing to do with you, you've betrayed my trust and made me look like an idiot, I'm not going to say that you wasted 3 years of my life, because you didn't, I enjoyed the time we spent together, I learned a lot about myself throughout the process and I think I'll be a better partner to a woman who appreciates me one day because of experiences, I wish you nothing but the best, have a great life"".

Lol the only problem with that is that we have close mutual friends, but yeah. It's officially over, I broke things off respectfully in my opinion. She started blowing my phone up again about an hour after leaving the cafe, but unblocked her # and also blocked her from all social media. Thanks everyone for your advice I really do appreciate all of you, even the trolls, I'm grateful for you all!

LilWetNap,2018-08-09 13:33:31+00:00,My (23/m) girlfriend???(24/f) got on a rapper's tour bus last night after his show.,"I'll try to make this as short as possible. So last night one of our favorite rappers came to town. I went to the show with 2 of my best friends and my girlfriend went separately with some of her friends(a group of 6). Halfway through the show both of my friends got pretty sick and I decided to drive them back to my place since I was the only one who hadn't been drinking. Before leaving I told my girlfriend I would come back and pick her and her friends up after the show had ended but she insisted that one of the girl's sisters was going to pick them up and take them home. Cool, fine by me. I asked her if she could call or text me whenever she got to the girl's house so I would know she got in safely. She agreed. Fast forward to 30 mins after I got back to my apartment, one of the girls posted a picture of a group of back stage passes to her Snapchat story. My girlfriend never said anything to me about them having backstage passes. I text her and asked if she was going backstage, because I thought it was pretty cool that she was going to get to meet our favorite rapper. I get no response. I follow this girl's story, she's posting pictures and videos of the entire concert until it ends and then eventually she posts some photos backstage with the group of girls, an hour goes by and I still haven't heard a thing from my girlfriend, which at the time wasn't that big of a deal because I just figured she was enjoying herself with her friends. Then a photo of a tour bus gets posted and it all goes downhill from there. About 35 mins goes by and the first video on the tour bus is my girlfriend and 3 of the other girls making out with each other and somebody from the rapper's crew pouring alcohol on them. The next video is of them twerking and the same dude grinding on them. The next video was of the rapper smoking weed and it got cut halfway through, I guessing because he made them all put their phones away and all of the snaps were deleted before the end of the night.I took some screenshots though. I've been with this girl for three years and never thought she was capable of doing something like this to me. It's 930 am and I haven't spoken to her since  last night. I don't know what all happened on that tour bus but I do know that I saw enough to make me want to end things and move on. How do I go about this? The worst part about this whole situation is that I can't even listen to my favorite rapper anymore without thinking about getting my heart broken haha.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/95wgtw/my_23m_girlfriend24f_got_on_a_rappers_tour_bus/,relationship_advice,4985,1083,0.0
justaperson999999,2018-08-09 07:39:42+00:00,Update: Today I caught my wife of nearly 4 years cheating,"Hey everyone, an update to a post a made a few months ago, link to original post is here https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8kwftq

I had so many supportive messages from you guys, so I'm sorry I didn't respond to all of them. I had some requests to post an update, and I felt the time is right now.

After all this happened I was struggling. Depression started, and steadily got worse and worse. My ex recognised my weakness and tried to lure me back to her. This nearly worked, and I stupidly ended up sleeping with her a while back. That was a HUGE mistake which I regretted almost immediately. I was weak, and knowing that made the depression spiral even more. 

I went to the doctors, who diagnosed me with low mood depression. I am now on anti depressants to help keep my mind stable, which has helped massively! I managed to get my head straight, and have started divorce proceedings. 

I have no doubt my ex will try and make this difficult. She is already seeking spousal maintenance from me (not sure if that's a thing in the US, bet here in the UK it is). She has been trying to get me to agree to make payments without a court order. I am refusing this based on the advice of my lawyer, and I am insisting this is worked out with a court order to give myself some protection. 

On the whole, life is good now. I'm still living with parents, but looking for my own place to move into. For the first time in a very long time, i am feeling happy again! Life seems like it is moving in the right direction, and everything is falling into place. Another positive note is I have now met someone else, and it feels exactly how a relationship should be. She is kind, caring, loving and supportive. She has a good career and we share the same goals in life. It was unexpected, it just sort of happened. But it feels so right. 

Thank you to all the kind messages I got on the first post. They honestly helped me through one of the darkest periods of my life. I know it's not all over yet, and there will be more stress to come. But I can deal with it, especially with the amazing woman I now have by my side!

Anyway, this Friday, she goes out as usual, I wake up and shes not here (6.30 am now) so I text her and ring herto see where she is as she has not sent a single message to me all night and not indicated in anyway that she would be staying out, so naturally I am worried sick, roll forward to 8AM; get a text saying 'sorry babe I stayed xxx house last night' now I know this person and I wasn't to bothered just slightly pissed off that she never thought to say anything before.

Roll forward to Saturday night, I am on her ipad (we share it) and suddenly she these strange messages come through from her best friend saying 'where did you go last night', 'I'm so upset that you just left me', now I was confused as to why she would have said this as I assumed she had gone to her other friends with her.

so (yes I know this was wrong) curiosity got the better of me, I opened up messenger to see what was going on, to which she said to her friend she stayed over some lads house.

Now obviously, I am super pissed at reading this and all sorts of thoughts going through my head and I confronted my wife about it we argued and it was mostly her saying how she regrets doing it and how she was so drunk she didn't know what she was doing that and that nothing happened.

I slept on the sofa that night as I was so angry and upset I didn't even want to see her, yesterday I couldn't stop thinking about it, I confronted her again and basically said I need the truth, she comes back saying she swears on our kids lives nothing happened.

But, I still can't stop thinking about it, what are the chances of someone going back to someone elses house after going out drunk and just falling asleep? It just doesnt seem to add up and I don't know what to do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/959yc0/my_m27_wife_f24_didnt_come_home_on_friday_night/,relationship_advice,1216,440,0.0

Thought we hit it off so I asked her out on a date and we seemed to have a lot in common. We’ve since been out to eat 2 more times. After our third date we chatted for over an hour, held hands and kissed. We agreed to take it slow as we’re both just out of long term relationships. 

Last night after our soccer game, we hung out with the same mutual friends. At one point she misplaced her phone so I offered to call to help her find it. I ended up finding the phone first and felt the wind knocked out of me when I saw my contact as Free Meal. In my blind embarrassment/rage, I shoved the phone in her face and said “Nice one.” She was flushed and just said oh shit... not an apology right away. One of our mutual friends was trying to stifle laughter, while the other just said that’s fucked up. 

I told everyone good night, turned my phone off and went home. After an hour I turned my phone on and was greeted by a long message where she apologized profusely and said her sister changed my contact in her phone and it was meant only as a joke. I blocked her and haven’t replied yet. 

I am still angry/embarrassed and confused. Don’t know if I should believe her or not. I thought we were on the verge of exclusivity, only to find out that she’s just using me for free dinners.

MikeJohnson6284,2018-08-01 20:49:38+00:00,My wife is a totally different person now.,"I have been married over 10 years and everything was wonderful until earlier this year.  My wife is kinda going through a mid life crisis in my opinion and she keeps saying to herself that she is 25 years old but she just turned 40.  I wanted her to chase her goals earlier this year but she is constantly on her phone trying to go get as many ""likes"" as possible on her photos. She started putting on makeup and she takes selfies every 10 mins.  She now wants an open relationship and It's difficult for me to handle. I honestly have been faithful to her our entire marriage and I always loved her...always will, I don't go out drinking with the buddies or anything like that. I just work, come home, and spend time with her...I'm exhausted.  I saw the signs:

\#1. I was able to look at her phone whenever I wanted now she guards it like a hawk.

\#2. She asks about an open relationship because I'm not giving her enough sex.

\#3. She told me one time that she is going to live longer than me.

\#4. She wants me to work out more, which wasn't a problem before.

\#5. We have problems communicating which wasn't a problem before. We do yell once in a while, (Not often).

\#6. We use to fight once a month  but now our fights are more frequent, We don't do the physical fighting stuff.

\#7. I've cried more this year then I ever have in my life because I really care about her.

\#8. Guys call the house asking for her this year, which never happened before.

\#9. She doesn't help me with any of the chores around the house, I have to do them on my own.

\#10. She feels like I'm her room mate but I do a lot for her and when I tell her she gets mad.

I know there are two sides to every story and I wish she could say hers so you can get the full picture.

I think our marriage is now dying and I would like to start repairing it or prepare for the inevitable. I'm really hurt right now  and I would like some advice if you can pls.

Thank you!

confusedgirl878,2018-07-29 20:09:41+00:00,UPDATE: I (19F) had a summer fling with an older guy (26M). I took a pregnancy test today and it came out positive,"Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/901lyn/i_19f_had_a_summer_fling_with_an_older_guy_26m_i/

First of all, thank you all so so much for the overwhelming support. I never imagined that I would get this amount of positive support and advice for my situation. When I posted, I was in a pretty bad place (I think I typed the post out on my bathroom floor where I had been crying). Thank you all for the reassurance and comfort. Also, thank you so much to all the girls that shared their personal experiences. I read every single comment (good and bad) and tried to respond to all of them. I appreciate all of you guys so much and it honeslty helped me cope a lot. 

Special thank you to u/Janaya59, your comment was the turning point for me. I got myself up from the bathroom floor, took a shower, opened a bucket of ice cream and calmed down for the rest of the night. 

About two days after I posted, I told one of my best friends about my positive pregancy test. He was completely supportive and reassured me that all was going to be okay. He drove me to my doctor's appointment and sat in the doc's office while I peed in a cup and got my blood drawn. I was positive for hCG so the pregnancy was real. I was about five weeks. He held me as I cried and on the way back, bought take-out for the both of us. 

That day, I called a local clinic, scheduled my appointment for Wednesday. I was early enough to take Mifeprex (the pill). On Tuesday, my best friend (the one that I mentioned in my original post) finally came back from Africa and I told her immediately. She hugged me close and I cried some more (the waterworks were very common during that whole week) and she cried for me as well. 

On the day of my appointment, both of my best friends came with me. I took Mifeprex at the clinic and got the misoprostol to take at home. Right after I took the Mifeprex, I felt complete and utter relief. It felt better than the day I finished all of my college applications. All of my stress instantly dissipated. I knew I was going to be okay and that I had my life back on track. My friends drove me back and we all hung out at my dorm and ate ice cream. I'm so lucky to have friends like them in my life and I'm so thankful for them.

So yes, I had the abortion and I feel completely relieved.

One thing that I did do that I said I probably wasn't was that I told ""Nick"". I was completely set on not telling him since we were never in a relationship (we had a summer fling) and we hadn't seen each other in like a month. But I hate keeping secrets, especially when it comes to myself, and I thought that if I do end up getting a position at the lab, I would see him everyday. It would be very difficult for me to see him and know that I kept this from him when he played somewhat of a role in it too. He's also someone that never gave me any red flags and I was also 99% sure that he was going to be in support of an abortion. So I texted him the day after I made my appointment asking him to meet up for coffee. I told him, managed not to break out in tears, and then told him I already schdued the abortion. He was completely shocked, thanked me for telling him then got up and hugged me. He said he absolutely supported my decision and thanked me for choosing it. He then got up and hugged me. He offered to come with me and pay for the pill and I told him no and no but thanked him for his offer and support. He told me to call him if anything came up or if I needed anything. I nodded, and then asked him if he could not say anything about all of this and he wholeheartedly said absolutely. And that was that. 

I could tell he was relieved and I expected it since he's a talented and successful med student who doesn't even have time to take care of himself, nonetheless a pregnant girl and a baby. 

In all, I made the right choice and had an amazing support system. Thank you especially to Reddit since you guys gave me unconditional support while I was at my lowest. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. 

TL;DR: Got the abortion and told Nick about it. I feel like a complete planet has been lifted off of my shoulders. Life's good and back on track.

starbrightstarlite,2018-07-28 02:51:05+00:00,Would any of this make you suspect your boyfriend was a pedophile?,"I am ending my relationship with (m 46)because all of this just piled up on me. One of these things alone? I could have brushed it off. But all of them combined, I don’t feel safe having him around my two little girls, 6 and 8. I just need to share this out loud and see if anyone else sees what I finally had to see. 

—first few months of dating, he was arrested due to his 16 year old daughter revealing in therapy that she was afraid of him, afraid he may do something to her. Memories of him being naked around her in childhood. He was never charged as she later took back everything she said and denied it. He claimed she was crazy and her mother was crazy too, didn’t know fantasy from reality. 

—he really enjoyed daddy/daughter role playing in bed and liked me to be shaved. Alone, not a thing but with the aforementioned it was a little weird. 

— a year later, I checked his Flickr account to find that he had favorited hundreds upon hundreds of images of children at nudist colonies, very young models. He claimed his account had been hacked. 

—two months after, I checked his Flickr again...and the images were back. Hacked again, he said.

It just made me remember a comment he made once about how my eight year old daughter “looked like his high school girlfriend” in a leather jacket with poofy hair. All things combined, it made me uncomfortable. It also made me particularly uncomfortable that he sought to bond most specifically with my 6 year old little girl, who is very quiet and shy, a lot more than my loud, mouthy 8 year old. He was never alone with them, but... by the time the second Flikr “hack” occurred, I knew I could never let him around my kids again. Before then I had been watchful because I thought, maybe it’s coincidence but... after that, it appeared to be reality. 

I finally had to mention my concerns to him, all these things combined.  He exploded, did not remotely understand how any of it could have made me concerned. I, too, was crazy, like his ex wife and daughter. Why didn’t I believe what he said instead of misunderstanding what I saw? That was the weirdest part of all. I feel like a normal person would have been humiliated, ashamed, falling over themselves to ensure me that it wasn’t what it looked like. This guy was arrogant with this “So what?” Attitude. About the accusation: “So what? My daughter is crazy and doesn’t know fact from fiction. My ex wife is crazy too because her ex husband was a pedo.” About the role play: “So what? You like bdsm too.” About the Flikr hack: “So what? It was a hack. It wasn’t that bad. It wasn’t like it was porn. You can’t prove those models are under age.” And about the second hack: “So what? Hacks happen all the time. Why are you stalking my page, anyway? What is your problem? Why don’t you trust me?” There was never any apology or embarrassment or shame. Just defiance. 

This guy is now out of my life. Does anyone else see red flags? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/92iudw/would_any_of_this_make_you_suspect_your_boyfriend/,relationship_advice,1296,345,0.0

**Alex, since you asked me for help this is did advice I have for you:

1. Insist on a paternity test. This isn't to disparage you, the mother or your choices, but it's a smart thing to do.

2. Get ready to be a good dad. Whatever your relationship is with the mother, dedicate your life to being a positive role model to the innocent baby you've involved with your choices.

3. Get your medical insurance straightened out now. During my OB rotations at UMC I saw more stress and heartbreak than I thought was possible simply because couples didn't know what was and wasn't covered.

4. Start saving now for day care, school, college, etc... Your dad can recommend someone.

5. Don't contact me again. This was a pretty classless request but since you know I love babies and kids I couldn't help myself because I truly hope you understand how serious this is and you grow and rise to your choices. Kacie **


I took out all the stuff about him hurting me and crying everyday because while it's true, if gives him too much power and insight into my emotions. That was by far the most common insight on my last post (besides just ""fuck off""). I'm a nurse and I think the same thing that attracted me to my job is the same thing in my personality that can't just do nothing...so I'll give him practical advice (which I hope he is smart enough to know already) so I feel I've done ""my"" part and can be guilt free but also didn't give him a pound of my flesh to feed his ego. 


Happy for any more insight I'll send this in an hour or so...he called again last night but I didn't answer.

ohcarolyna,2018-07-26 03:39:49+00:00,My fiancé ended our relationship today because I liked my sons Facebook post (of him and his dad fishing). He said it was disrespectful to him and gave me an ultimatum to never like anything he posts that includes his father or it was over. I did not agree to that and he ended it. Am I wrong?,"I am divorced, and my children are adults, out of school. He is divorced and his children are 6 (twins) and his son from his first marriage just graduated high school. 

I’ve never met either ex but the story is the same, they are crazy and lazy. 

He doesn’t have a relationship with his son and sees his twins once a month. 

He is eight years older than me. 

My relationship with my kids father is not the same. 
We coparent and have healthy boundaries. We do not fight. 

My fiancé has given me ultimatums in the past about my kids and then recanted them. It feels almost like he’s jealous of them in a way.   He has the same issues with my sisters. 

He has asked me to make a lot of changes. I’ve moved farther from my kids for him, I have a successful career that he has once convinced me to give up, but I had to start working again after three months away from what I enjoy. I’ve made every change he has asked except cut off my kids. They don’t ask me for money ever. They go to college. They are good kids. Not in trouble. We literally are together maybe once every month or two. 

As I said, I was off for three months and got an offer for a VP job back in Texas where I am from, we talked it over and I took it because his company is going through a sale process and we got a home here because he wants to move here when it’s finished and closed in August. He currently comes down from NY every weekend.  He obviously cancelled plans for this weekend. 

My fiancé has done a lot of things for me. He has given me nice gifts and helped me through things but, something in my gut tonight said this is not right. So I refused to agree to the ultimatum.  I have never had to depend on him financially but he wants me too. It feels like he doesn’t want me to have any kind of relationship outside of ours. 

Am I wrong in my decision to stand firm. His ultimatum felt irrational and controlling. 

I know he will call tomorrow.  I just need a perspective on how someone else would handle this.

_RRThrowaway_,2018-07-21 23:17:52+00:00,"My (19F) friend (18M) shared some very disturbing sexual fantasies with me, and I really can't stop thinking about it","The other day I was out for the night with my friend group.

One of my best friends in the group is a guy (most are girls). He and I are pretty close and have been since early in high school.

We were kind of separated from everyone else and drinking alone. The topic of sex and relationships came up. I started teasing him about never having had a steady girlfriend, which led to the subject of sexual fantasies and preferences coming up, and he admitted he had some 'weird ones'.

I asked him what he was talking about, because I was curious. He didn't want to say, so I tried to loosen him up by describing some of my fantasies, which was mostly (in his view) fairly 'vanilla' stuff like role play and stuff. Finally, once he'd gotten fairly drunk, he said he had 'really violent' kinks. I said that wasn't that unusual. He said he didn't mean 'like BDSM stuff'.

Finally, he told me he fantasizes about 'grabbing a girl and driving her out in the middle of nowhere and just slashing her fucking throat or bashing her skull in.' Most of these fantasies didn't even involve sex or even violent sex, it was the killing itself that was a sexual act to him. It was like a filter had come off now and he starts telling me all about it. He said he really got off on the image of a girl begging for her life. He also said the only kind of porn that could even get him off was (simulated, not real) death/murder porn.

The whole thing and the detail he went into really shook me up. I get that fantasies are harmless as long as they don't cross the line into reality, but I honestly wasn't expecting anything like this. I'm a girl and most of our friends are actually girls, which makes it a little scarier for me.

I feel bad for making this post because I feel like I'm betraying his trust, and I'm the one who pushed him to tell me, but I honestly couldn't stop thinking about this and it's really bothering me.

He's a really sweet, soft-spoken guy in general, but on the rare occasions he gets angry, it's really scary. He gets *really* angry, and seeing it in his face is almost like seeing a mask come off. It reminds me a little of what they used to say about Ted Bundy.

I don't think he's in imminent danger of hurting anyone, and I don't think he really would, but I'm wondering if I should suggest he look into therapy or at least talk to someone?

Am I overreacting? Are these kinds of fantasies relatively common amongst guys? I really don't know, but this is driving me crazy!

TL;DR friend of mine told me his sexual fantasizes involve torturing and killing girls and he can't even get off without it. I'm really shaken up now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/90tfov/my_19f_friend_18m_shared_some_very_disturbing/,relationship_advice,1576,504,1.0

I’m a very easy going man but this is the last straw for me. I’m considering a divorce. I need help, don’t know how to handle this situation.(Sorry long post)","
Let me start saying this is probably the second time in 12 years that I’ve yelled at my wife, I feel terrible about it but I lost my shit. That comes to show how badly we argued.

This all started yesterday. We were cleaning out my late grandfather’s house, he died recently and I’m putting his house up for sale, selling what I can from his belongings and donating the rest. I live in a different country than where his house his and can’t ship everything to my country, so I’m only keeping a few things that I really wanted.  While going through the house I found some cool things, among them a couple of old axes (you can see in my history a post from yesterday about them). This is where the problem began. I wanted to take them home and hang them on the wall, but my wife insisted they were rotten and rusty so I had to throw them in the trash. 

Now I’m not too handsy and don’t know my way around tools, so I took to reddit to ask if they were indeed rotten and had to be thrown, or if they could be restored or cleaned. After the majority of people suggested I left them as they were, leave the patina as it is and hang them on the wall, I decided to do so, to just hang them as they are instead of restoring them. 

All this time my wife was giving me shit saying the axes looked ugly, she doesn’t want that crap at home, it sends off violent vibs, looks dirty, it’d be like having my grandfather present in out house 20/7 –dah that’s part of the point- etc.  I’m generally an easy going guy, I just want to make her happy and don’t like arguing over little things, so I let her win most battles. She’s decorated the whole house to her liking, picked the furniture, all the works.

But this is the one time I put my foot down and expressed my desire of having my grandfather’s axes hang on the wall in a cross shape. She knows what my grandfather meant to me, he raised me single handedly since age 4. My mother left my father for another guy when I was 3, she took off and never saw her again. My father (his son) was an alcoholic and wasn’t prepared nor wanted to raise a kid on his own. My grandfather had lost his wife and didn’t have more children or relatives alive. He told me how one day he went to check how my dad was doing, and found me alone in the living room watching TV, he grabbed me and put me in his car, then we went around looking for my dad just to find him in a local bar getting wasted. He told me how that day he gave my dad an ultimatum, to either get cleaned and start acting as a parent, or he’d fight to get custody over me and raise me on his own. 

To my grandpa’s surprise, my father blamed me for being the reason my mother decided to leave us, and said he’d be doing him a favor if he got me off his hands. That very same night my grandpa drove back to my dad’s house, collected all my stuff and moved me with him to his house in a different county. 

Both of us tried to make contact with my father time and again over the years, but he never showed any interest in either of us and refused to meet me. He started doing hard drugs and by the time I was 15 he had died of an overdose. I only knew my parents from pictures. 

All I’ve ever known was my grandpa, and all love I’ve ever gotten came from him. He bought me clothes, he cooked for me, took me to the park played with me, taught me how to ride a bike, he walked me to school every single day, taught me how to shave, taught me to play guitar, took me to church every single Sunday, he gave me an education, paid for my college. He gave me the happy childhood I wouldn’t have otherwise had. 
He taught me the importance of having principles, of having discipline, of being gentle and understanding of others, not to judge. He made sure I was on the right path always. Kept me away from drugs and bad companies.

Every single day of my life I’ve been grateful for this man, who had a heart bigger than most men I’ve known, who took me under his wing and raised me, who gave me a home, a family and most important, he gave me love. He was my hero.

My wife knows my story very well, and knows how much I love, respect and owe my grandpa. Of all people, she’s the one who shouldn’t have this much trouble understanding what those axes mean to me, even if they are just fucking old rusty axes. They look awesome and when I found them, I felt it was a symbol of my grandpa’s strength and will power. It felt a bit as though he’d left a present for me to find after he passed. 
I don’t ask my wife for nothing, she has leeway to do as she pleases with the house, all I wanted was to hang my grandpa’s axes on the wall. 

After posting about it yesterday on reddit and showing her the many replies telling me to keep and hang the axes, praising how cool and special they look, she said she’d changed her mind and was now ok with me hanging them.  

So today I woke up, went about my day and when I went to the garage to get a hold of the axes, they weren’t there. They were nowhere to be found. I went back inside the house to find my wife and kids and ask them if they’d move them around or something. When my wife said, you have to sit down to hear this, my stomach sank. 

She confessed to having thrown away the axes this morning when the bin-man passed by, so that I couldn’t retrieve them and bring them back into the house. Then she topped it saying ‘We both know you have no taste, you’ll thank me later’. I feel nothing but hatred, anger and resentment right now.  This is not about having taste, is about not respecting my decision, about her not being capable of budging. She decorated the whole house, I don’t understand why it’s even a problem that I want to hang two axes on the wall, she has decorated the whole house with stuff she likes –even when I don’t-, and she knows this belonged to my grandpa and is special to me.

So we got into a screaming match, she says I’m being insensitive to her needs and that I know she has OCD –which I’m sure just because you like having your house tidy and the pictures on the wall straight doesn’t make you OCD- and argued how the axes broke the house’s harmony and flow and would throw her off  having the house visuals altered. And besides that, the axes were dangerous, send a negative message about us as a family, makes us look like ‘wannabe badass hillbillies’ and ‘junk belongs in the trash’. Nothing but vitriol and vicious attacks coming off her mouth.

WTF?  Who’s  this person and where is my wife? This shit is getting out of hand. I can tolerate her doing what she wants with the house, organizing and decorating how she likes, I’m not fuzzy, whatever makes her happy. I don’t ask her to work, I support her, give her whatever she needs. I hate, but tolerate that she sometimes gets rid of my clothes she doesn’t like or deems ‘unwearable’ without asking. That she has a history of accidentally throwing away or ‘breaking’ presents my friends have bought me.  There are little things that piss me off but when I tried talking about it with her, she always makes up an excuse to justify her point of view and makes a drama just to avoid us discussing the problem. She just likes to get her way at any cost. 

I’ve put up with this long enough, and as silly as it may seem, this is almost a point of no return for me. She went over my head and got rid of something precious that belonged to my hero and favorite person in the world. I know she never liked my grandfather because he always was –and is and will be- a big part of my life and she always complained that she needed to be my number one person to feel safe. But fucking hell I married her didn’t? I didn’t marry my grandfather. It’ not a fucking competition, I can love two people in different ways, she didn’t have to dislike him or feel threatened just because he was so important for me. My wife is also important. I never understood that jealousy. I would understand if I had a female friend and she was jealous over it, but being jealous of my grandfather?? Ffs I can’t even masturbate to porn because she gets mad and considers it ‘cheating on me and your family’ and made promise to only think of her if I need to masturbate! I can’t breathe, I feel suffocated. This is nonsense. I’ve tried everything to please her and nothing is enough. And everything I do for her she takes for granted. And what for? So when I ask for one small thing like hanging two axes on the wall she turns around and does this?


I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I can move on. All I know is if I go back home we’re gonna wind up arguing and making things worse, and I may say something I regret. I’ve been feeling this for a long time, that I love my wife, she’s the mother of my children, I’m so grateful to her for giving me these beautiful kids, but I’m slowly realizing we are not compatible and she’s not the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. 

So I packed a bag with some clothes, got in the car and drove to a hotel. My phone is off because I can predict she’s calling me like crazy. Whenever I need space or time alone she calls me relentlessly, so now I just turn off my phone. I’m afraid of going back home because I know she’s gonna play the victim role as usual and turn the tables on me, and I guarantee she’s gonna make this about her, because she does it every single time.  Tell me I’m out of order for reacting this way over a couple of axes, how she is all day at home raising our kids, although I’ve offered to hire a nanny and she’s free to work, how she sacrificed her body to give me offspring, I’m very grateful she did and I appreciate all she’s done, but those are not excuses to run a dictatorship t home.

Am I overreacting? Or have my eyes finally been opened? I don’t really have anybody to talk about this, because none of my friends really like my wife –my wife doesn’t like a signle one of my friends and coworkers either-, they get along because she’s my wife, but none of them like her so they won’t be objective about this argument.  Part of me fears I’m being petty and arguing over a couple of axes, but another part of me is very angry because she threw away something very special from my grandfather, I feel like this is how she wins the war against him, her having the last word, and her symbolically getting rid of him and every trace of him in our lives and house.  

I never make a decision without giving myself at least a few days and see how I feel about things then. But this wanting a divorce is something that’s been in my mind for a while. I think is dishonest to be with her if I’m not in love. I love her, but I’m not in love. I don’t like the person she’s becoming, we have grown apart. And this thing she’s done, this has forever changed the way I look at her. I don’t say this from a place of anger. I just feel I don’t want her near me and this is a confirmation to a feeling I’ve had for a long time.  At some point very soon I’ll have to turn on my phone and talk to my children, who are spending the day with friends. I don’t know what to do or how to deal with this.

throwawaydryer,2018-07-13 13:46:17+00:00,[33m] I saw suspicious texts between my wife [33f] of 5 years and her ex-boyfriend. I don't know what to do.,"The other day I saw a suspicious text message pop up on my wife's phone. It was from her ex-boyfriend and very flirtatious. Naturally, I felt that I had the right to look at the conversation between them.

Just a bit of history here- I knew him when he was in high school. Him and her were together for about 4 years and were each other's firsts. She broke up with him and began dating me probably 6 months later. I was young and naive and knew they would still hang out from time to time. I eventually got very upset about it and told her I didn't want her seeing him anymore. Years later I found out that they in fact had still hung out, but I am not sure to what extent, as he had a girlfriend who he is now married to.

There was a conversation between the two of them when I was out of town. She basically told him that I was out of town and that she could ""see him."" Reading further, the ex had expressed that ""this would be easy if I still lived at home"" and the conversation basically ended with him saying ""this weekend could have been more exciting"" to which she replied, ""I know"" to which he replied, ""it's just trickier now.""

At one point in the conversation he mentions how he found a pic of her that she sent him years ago. She then mentioned that she had some pics on her old cell phone (which were never sent to me) which she had long after we had started dating.

It did not appear as though anything happened, however further in the backlog I found him flirting heavily with her. She didn't flirt back so much, but she didn't stop him either. When he sent her something about missing her body, she mentioned something about naked laundry and then said she's ""taking this conversation to messenger"", as in Facebook Messenger.


I don't know what to do. Her computer is sitting right here with her Facebook password saved. I could login and snoop, but I haven't. I'm not even sure if her phone would alert her to me logging in on her laptop (does Facebook do that?). On one hand, if I look I could probably find out for sure what is really going on. She must know that it's easier to hide those messages (she does not have notifications for Messenger turned on on her phone). But if I did find something, then I have to tell her how I know, obviously. And snooping just doesn't seem like the right thing to do.

I am so lost here. I feel like I've had tunnel vision for days. What do I do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8yk3mp/33m_i_saw_suspicious_texts_between_my_wife_33f_of/,relationship_advice,1182,308,0.0
Lazy_Recommendation,2018-07-11 18:27:09+00:00,Busted My Wife Cheating,"I'm at a complete loss. I don't know what to do. 

There were signs, and I overlooked them. I was blinded by love and never imagined this would happen to me. Not with her, my wife and best friend of nearly 20 years. 

I work out of town and wasn't supposed to be back until tonight. We were supposed to leave for a two week road trip tomorrow. Things were slow at work so I came home yesterday afternoon. This trip was to give us a little alone time since we've been so busy with family and friends this summer. 

When I got home there was a truck in my driveway that I didn't recognize. My neighbor just recently asked me how I liked the new truck, but I thought he was mistaken and didn't think much of it. 

As soon as I could see the truck, I got a terrible gut feeling. I love my wife and trusted her completely, but that feeling was there and strong. I snuck around the side of the house to our bedroom window. It was open and I could hear them as I got close. I looked in the window and my worst fear was confirmed. They were right there, completely naked, on my bed. 

I walked away. I have been fighting the urge to do something that I know I will regret. I'm struggling to care what happens to me at this point. 

I went to my families cabin for the night and drank everything there. Today I was on my way home to confront her and decided against it. I'm not ready. All I can feel is anger. All I can think about is violence. I'm not in a good place right now. Not good enough to see her. 

I'm back at the cabin right now. I have a 60oz of rum, and have been staring at it for an hour. I want to get drunk and forget this, but I don't want to get drunk and make bad decisions. I know this is a critical moment in my life and my actions in the coming days will dictate the rest of my life. That's why I'm here. I need help. I'm not ready to speak to family or friends, so I am reaching out to strangers.

Mjike12,2018-07-09 23:45:58+00:00,"2nd and last update, I'm ready to try and put this behind me. I'm the guy that found out my wife did some very racy, almost softcore porn photoshoots and hid it from me for six weeks. Thank you very much for keeping me sane over the past 5 days.","First of all let me say that I really, really appreciate  everyone helping me out. I honestly don't know what I would have done had I not had a place to vent, argue the facts and bounce things off of. When the ""other"" sub removed my post and banned me for just asking why, I really thought I was going to lose my mind because my thoughts were racing a million miles a minute. A very, very sincere thank you. 

So if you recall from one of my updates, Nicky (wife) agreed that we would sit down with Gina (photographer) today and get her full side of the story. I spoke with her yesterday but that was only long enough for her to open the building, get her computer booted up and then get on the road for her shoot. 


I told my wife that I would like to talk to Gina alone at first and she said she had no problems with that. So Gina was very affable and friendly when we sat down at her desk. I asked her if she understood why I was having such a hard time with this. Gina basically said that she did and she was very, very sorry for the way things shook out. I asked her whats her version of ""shook out."" It more or less matched Nicki's version in that she had mentioned Nic shooting with the guy about a week prior to the boudoir shoot, Nic had said absolutely not. When the shoot day came they had an absolutely great time, Nicki suggested they do full nudes in what would be a Christmas present for me and Gina said Nicki was even more relaxed naked so she reintroduced the idea of shooting with her friend Craig (HotAbs McCool) Nicki said what the hell, lets do it. HotAbs McCool was in class, they drank wine while waiting for him and all were good and buzzed by the time he showed up. He brought his girlfriend who Gina has shot for some sort of collegiate volleyball all star thing and everyone was fast friends. Gina had the idea of making it like a visual romance novel where the hot business woman would succumb to HotAbs McCool's advances (mission accomplished). She said Nicki went from having a great time to being super nervous and Gina said she had to really press to get her to open up (pun intended? probably not...but I noticed the phrasing). But Nicki did very well so that's that. I asked her to promise me that there's no other pics, Gina said absolutely not that you can even look in the meta data if needed to see that everything is in a nice complete sequence that lasted about an hour. 

I asked Gina why Nicki, that if this guys girlfriend already knew how to do this, why not just use her (remember, GF did the same poses as Nic did while Nic was taking a break). Gina said she just loved shooting with Nicki and as a photographer, a series of sexy shots where the couple is ""mis-matched"" is much more interesting than just two good looking college kids. 


So that all seemed on the up and up (I mean it wasn't new news, I had heard that all before). Gina promised me that she wasn't going to do anything with the pictures and that it really was just a fun session with friends. I don't know what I was thinking but I asked if I could have a hard drive of all the pictures and Gina said that usually she would never do that, but because we had been friends for so long and the situation was so unique that I could. I have no idea why I asked for them, maybe I can embarrass Nicki with them some day as a prank as in ""hey remember that time you almost fucked that college kid? Here's a pic LOL...right?"" Just kidding I guess. 

Nicki came into the office crying apologizing to both of us, saying that it was her fault and she felt terrible about the whole thing. Gina was pretty contrite as well saying that she probably used her friendship with Nicki to push the moment way more than was professionally acceptable. I was able to half heartedly accept Gina's apology, but I'm just not sure I'm to understanding it yet. 


So we left, Nicki again begged me not to make any rash decisions about our future. I told her that I'd already said if everything up to this point was the truth, than I'm not leaving but I can't make any promises as to what ""normal"" will be for us now. She said that was ok and recommended that we seek a marriage counselor, I told her that would be great and I'd make every session. 

She has been a pretty big emotional wreck since she got home on Saturday and I don't think she's slept at all (I haven't). She's been trying very hard to be physical with me with things like holding my hand, hugging me, sitting next to me on the couch and that sort of thing...I've been trying to reciprocate but having a very hard time with it. I know she's hurting and I should be the one to comfort her and I'm doing the best I can. 

Here's the thing which a lot of you may disagree with (and that's fine), I feel that if i'm going to stay in this marriage than I need to stay in the marriage 100%. I'm not going to be her warden, I'm not going to ask her to prove where she is or who she's hanging out with and I'm not going to look through her phone. I felt gross doing it yesterday (though it was helpful) and I couldn't bring myself to do it again. I feel that if we're married, then we're married. This isn't something to be brought up in an argument, a ""what about that time you..."" type thing or an excuse or me to go out and creep on hot Instagram girls. If I'm staying, I'm staying 100%. I can't say with certainty that I can force myself to stick to this because Nicki can be a nag from hell and the temptation to pull up a photo her ass and HotAbs McCool's 9 inch dick only separated by fabric may be too much to resist.  (yeah, still got a little spite in me).

But that last crack aside, she's been through a lot and the mother of my adorable little kid deserves love and compassion, even if ""a lot' has been of her own making. So I'm going to go see a movie tonight without her, be mad, call her all sorts of names in my head, scream, punch my steering wheel, throw rocks into the river, have some scotch, get in a bar fight...whatever. Then tomorrow I'm getting up and I'm going to be the husband I was before she left last Sunday. 

I'm also going to hit facebook, gym up and delete a lawyer (wasn't my line but whoever said it on one of the posts really made me laugh). But seriously, in addition to Nicki messing up, this little episode has shown me that I've become a squishy 50 year old despite the fact that I'm 30. A huge reason Nicki and Gina didn't even think to ask me to participate in that shoot is that I don't even resemble a guy who could be with my wife anymore. She's very attractive and while I've got a decent base to work with, I'm not anymore. She looks better than she did in the wedding pictures Gina took for us, I look far worse. So if I'm going to be in this marriage 100%, I need to also be 100% myself or the person I was when I was a practicing purple belt in BJJ or a walk on to my college baseball team. That's been the hardest (but probably the most productive) part of this whole situation is to have to look myself in the mirror and admit...your wife did a softcore porn shoot and while she still loves you, you've let yourself go so bad that she didn't even think to include you. 


So I've already signed back up for BJJ tomorrow and I'm going to talk to my professor about being an instructor again, I'm going to join Nicki in her paleo craziness and maybe even her funky ass MovNat class. Hopefully use this episode to make myself a better person. 


Thank you so much for sticking with me...and a serious thank you again.

throwawayhusband332,2018-07-08 11:55:36+00:00,"UPDATE 2: I [31M] found out my fiance cheated during her [30F] bachelorette party, planning on leaving","I am making this as I feel I owe it to all of you. The amount of PM's and responses have been incredible. Many of the decisions i have taken has come from people who supported me on reddit. Both the negative and positive comments have helped me and I would like to thank all of you for taking the time to write me and support me.

Yesterday I was having my phone spammed by many family members from her side, and friends. The only person I responsed to was the sister with part of the conversation where she and the sister talks about it all. I didnt include anything in the response except an image the conversation, and the sister went pretty much silent after that (until later).

During the day i contact the co-owner of my business and let him know the full story, he told me to take as much time as I need and even adviced me to head off to a vacation (this guy is a childhood friend of mine, i dont trust anyone as much as him). My plans have changed a bit, I am still staying at this hotel for another few days and then perhaps moving on to the friend I was supposed to go to. I called him up and let him know I want to head off somewhere, perhaps a trip to somewhere nice, another country or something, its all still not yet 100% decided, but I know i will be leaving for somewhere. He said he would be up for joining me if it could be during the upcoming weeks since he is still on holiday from his work. We will see how that turns out...

Later in the day I responded to my wife, the calls kept coming in less frequently since I sent that message to her sister... i had this gut feeling she was going to come with an excuse of some sort.
I picked up the phone and first thing i hear is a ""torn up voice"" if u can say that in english. I could hear she had been crying all day and was in a messed up state. She kept begging me to come back, that there is an explanation to everything and that she loves me. She I have misunderstood the entire situation... I could hear the sister and someone else in the background (dont know who the other person was, maybe her friend?). Anyway I told her to explain it to me right then and there. She said because I only seen a small part of the conversation its all been misunderstood, that I should come back home, that she loves me and that i have taken a rational decision to leave without a real reason. During the entire conversation i was just giving really short, empty answers in a cold way like ""yea, ok, what, explain it to me""...
After she told me its all a misunderstanding I told her to call me back in 10 minutes, and to check messenger.
After I hungup, i sent her the entire conversation log, with a ton of screenshots (not all of them, but most of the important ones). It didnt take 2 minutes for her to call back, crying hysterically saying sorry for everything, saying she wants to die rather than to lose me. She said she was ""forced"" by her friends and sister to have fun one last time, that she needed to let all the energy out before stepping into a marriage for life. I was just quiet during most of it. The more I didnt talk and just said ""ok"" the more she was crying.

She started telling me I can fuck other women if I want to get back at her, or that she will tell everyone about what she did so i can take her back, that she will do anything it takes for me to come back and that this was a mistake of her life and that she hates her sister and friends for this...
I told her fucking other woman was not something I needed, because the moment i met her and started loving her, she was the only woman i needed, i didnt need to meet or sleep with someone to know the best thing of my life was waiting at home. 
The sister was telling her stuff in the background but I couldnt hear, i dont know what the sister was telling her or if she was getting angry at her or something.

She kept begging me and begging me, and i just told her, if she comes clean to her parents and family i will think about it. After she started saying something but I just hung up. 

For like half an hour my phone goes silent without much response, and her father calls me up and apologizes for everything, he and his wife know what happened now, and he is so sorry for all of this. He told me he understands how i feel and that he didnt raise his daughter to do this, he said he understand if i dont want to see her again but that I always will be welcome to him and that I am a good guy. His wife basically then takes/steals the phone from him and tells me she did a mistake and she regrets it and it will never happen again and that we can move forward from this. She tells me her daughter has never been this destroyed before. I politely tell her I appreciate her opinion and then say i have to go and goodbye.

My ex-fiance calls me back and beggs me again saying she told her parents and also sent a text message to her friends (our mutual friends) about what had happened. She then keeps crying asking me when i will come back to speak with her, and say we can even go to counselling and that she will pay for everything.
She kept apologizing and apoliogizing on the phone and I didnt say much.

After some time I just told her not to cry, that she shouldnt be apologizing because single women (like herself) are allowed to do these things and i hope she finds mr right. She starts crying even harder and her sister takes the phone and say sorry and tells me everything can be fixed and that I said I would take her back now that she told everyone what she did. I told the sister I only said I think about it, and now that I have I realised i dodged a bullet and wish her and her sister the best. She then tells me her sister is turning suicidal from all of this and that this is going to lead into a depression that can take her life. 
The only thing I said after she told me that was ""its a good thing you are close to her so you can make sure she doesnt kill herself then, maybe take her to a doctor or soemthing"". After this I just hung up.

My phone has been blowing up with messages from mutual friends, her and her sister saying sorry and basically begging me to come back. I dont plan on responding. I honestly feel ALOT better right now, like I can move on. I will be going for vacation this upcoming week i think. If someting more happens I will update this post.

Maybe I will update in a month or couple of weeks, i dont know.
Once again big thanks to all of you who supported me here on reddit and gave me so much support.

I dont know when I feel okay to start dating/meeting women again but we will see. Once again thanks to you all and sorry for alot of wrong writings, I am not a native english so hope you can read without issues.

The whole time, NO ONE knew. No one in my family had any idea. My mom had a suspicion but I always refused to admit it to her out of embarrassment.

Today, the same uncle who sexually abused me( let’s call him X) accused another uncle  (Y) of  being aggressive with X’s 10 yr old son. Now multiple people who all saw the incident say it was very playful and in no way violent/abusive. But X insists that it was and wants to take this to court and press charges on Y. This argument really blew up. And my mom decided it was time to confront X on his behaviors with me to end his hypocrisy and let him know that he needed to stop bullying members of the family. 

After she said it, I burst into tears. My whole family heard it. Now everyone knows. All my aunts and uncles. My younger cousins, my siblings. I can tell some of them are heartbroken for me. Others I think are in shock. By my aunt (X’s wife) doesn’t believe it even though he used to abuse her as well. I think she is the only member of the family who thinks I’m lying. I feel so embarrassed and I haven’t stopped crying because I’ve had to relive the memories all day. I had buried them for over two years. I am typing this at work and I don’t even want to go home because I am feeling so embarrassed. I don’t know why I feel like ashamed. I have nothing to be ashamed about but I still feel it. I feel dirty and exposed and I don’t think my life will ever be the same anymore. But the worst is that there’s someone who doesn’t believe it ever happened

TL;DR my uncle sexually abused me as a child. I kept it a secret and never told anyone. My mom had her suspicions. Today my family had a falling out and my mom brought up her suspicion to the whole family. I finally confirmed and most believe me but my aunt thinks I’m lying. Everyone knows now. I feel ashamed and dirty and I feel like i never want to see any of them again.

throwawayhusband332,2018-07-06 22:17:42+00:00,"UPDATE: I [31M] found out my fiance cheated during her [30F] bachelorette party, planning on leaving","I will be posting the update here instead since I am still receiving PMs to update what happened. I am not allowed to post in relationships (mods told me I am not allowed to post an update thread there) so I got the advice from someone to post the update here instead. This is the post I posted about 2 hours ago on relationship. Will try my best to update it as time goes.

Here is my previous post for the people who did not read:

[CLICK HERE to see my previous post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8wg3qy/i_31m_found_out_my_fiance_cheated_during_her_30f/)

I will try to be as detailed as possible. I have had quite a few PM's regarding what happened and I got such a big amount of responses (both positive and negative) which i never imagined would have happened. I want to let you all know that the support I have received has been incredible (both in PM and on the post itself) which has helped me in taking my decision.

I am also sorry for not being able to respond to all the PM's, theres just too many to respond to but I would like to throw out much love for all of you who took the time.

I would also like to give a big thanks on my post to everyone who replied, I tried to respond but I noticed the thread was closed (i still dont know why mods close it) but I still want to give a big thanks to the people who took the time to give me advice. Much love to you all.

I basically left in the morning to take a smoke, my head was still messed up but reading all the comments on reddit helped me. I cant remember who, but there was one guy who said the positive thing about all of this is that I found out BEFORE i got married, with no children or attachments. I still dont think she cheated other than this night, nothing i found indicated anything else, I guess she wanted this to be her ""last night"" before settling down or soemthing, I honestly dont know and dont care.

When I was outside taking a smoke, about 15-20 minutes or something after I left reddit, she had woken up. She noticed the drinks out and asked me what I had been up to, basically came to give me a kiss and a hug. I followed through with it but honestly felt empty doing it, I didnt want to give her any hint of what I knew. She asked my why I had been drinking and why I didnt come to sleep last night and I told her I was just having some nightmares but everything was fine. I felt detached, like I was watching myself in third person through a tv or something.

She asked me if any stress was related to the marriage and the plans, i just told her something along the lines of ""you know i love you, there is no stress i have for the marriage, how can you be stressed about the best thing in your life"". She got herself done and left for work.

I basically started packing my most important things, my desktop, computer, most clothes and some other things. I planned on leaving things like furniture, TV and other things I really dont care about more than getting the fuck out. I just took the stuff most important to me so that I dont have to return here again. I dont care if she gets the rest. All in all my stuff added up to about 3 or 4 suitcases i would say (desktop not included in this).

I called and cancelled the venue we were supposed to be having the wedding at, apparently they take 15 &amp;#37; of the money for cancelling so early on because we were having such a big event, i told them its fine and I really dont care at this point.

I also saved screenshots of everything and have taken them with me.

Around 1 pm I called a taxi and went to stay at a hotel around 100 km far from my city. I didnt leave any note or pictures at home, I just left. I am planning on leaving to stay with a really really close friend who lives in a town about 300 km away, but i just needed the alone time in the hotel for some time to think everything through and process whats happened.

Around 3:30 pm my phone starts getting spammed with calls from my ex-fiance. around 3:50 I start getting calls and messages from her sister, her friends, her parents, my parents and a few of our mutual friends.

The only person I called back was my dad and mom. I have a huge trust for my parents, I basically spilled the beans and told them a nicer story about what happened, asked my dad to not say anything and also asked my mother not to say anything. I told them its ended, and that I wont be getting married no more. I also told them not to tell anything to anyone about what I told them, I trust them alot so I am sure they wont say anything. I didnt tell them exactly what happened, just that I found out she wasnt being loyal to me, i didnt think giving details would help in anyway.

Around 5 pm my dad calls mee back and is telling me my ex-fiance is completely hysterical and has basically broken down completely not understanding what is going on. I just told my dad not to intervene and that I need some alone time now.

I basically just shut my phone down and have been staying silent ever since, like a ghost. Been sleeping for a little, went to the pool here at the hotel and have just been taking it easy.

I dont know if I should respond to them now or wait some more? Her sister knew about what happened at the bachelorette party ( i have the texts to prove it, she even laughed about it and told her not to feel guilty, because its her bachelorette and that women should go all in on this night). I am seriously considering replying with to the sister, with just an image of the conversation where she is telling her this.

Once again, thank you to everyone who replied. I will update this post 1 or 2 more times and then perhaps go silent for a while, I know you are only aloud to do 1 update on relationships section. I hope this post wont get closed (still dont know why the last one did).

Time here is 10 pm soon.

TL;DR Found out my fiance cheated and I left without saying anything. Not 100&amp;#37; sure what to say or to at this point...",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8wo8xw/update_i_31m_found_out_my_fiance_cheated_during/,relationship_advice,9336,1727,2.0
goodmorningjay,2018-07-05 11:33:07+00:00,UPDATE: My (19F) family isnt coming to my graduation and I feel like I shouldnt either,"Hi Reddit!!!

You guys were very curious I bet...I ended up going!!!!   
I want to give some backstory.

That day everything just seemed to be going wrong. My phone was broken, my friend ended up falling sick and not being able to attend and I was very very tired.   
When my brother started yelling at me and my mom didn't defend me that was the final straw.  
When I wrote my Reddit post I was very sad and didn't expect at all for it to blow up the way it did!!!  
I ended up talking to my mom and explaining to her that it really hurt me that she didn't at all seem enthusiastic. My mom is from another culture and I guess she didn't quite grasp the concept that was graduation. She ended up apologizing and begging me to go after all. She told me my brother apologized as well(?) even though he didn't really say sorry to me personally. They told me it was my graduation and I was free to wear whatever I wanted but since they didn't genuinely seem happy about that particular dress and I wanted to upkeep the peace I went for a traditional dress. I got a lot of compliments on it!!!

I was late...really late! But I went and I picked up my diploma just in time. I shook my teachers' hands and they told me how proud they were of me. I saw my friends as well and we had a really fun time! 

Thanks again Reddit!! You made me incredibly happy. Your support was so overwhelming, I was in tears reading all of your comments. Thank you for caring about me, a stranger on the internet, enough to tell me you're proud of me! Thanks for being interested in whether I really did end up going or not. Thanks for supporting my decision to just stay at home. Thanks for sharing your experiences! THANK YOU!!!!

I made a video for you guys if you wanna see!!! My English isn't that good(I'm not from the US!) and my hair is wet from the shower, but it's the message that counts!!!!

PointlessAcorn,2018-07-03 15:44:42+00:00,My (26F) neighbour (60sF) reported me to my landlord and local authorities for animal cruelty because she thought my dog was left alone in my house for the weekend while I was abroad. I can’t persuade her she’s wrong even with proof.,"I’ve proven to her via time-stamped texts and picture messages from my dog-sitting friend(s) that the dog was well taken care of but she just keeps saying she never saw my friend. I asked him whether he spoke to her and he says he was avoiding her because she’s very nosy and overbearing and my friend is quite reserved. My first friend stayed from when I left on Friday night until Sunday noon and then I had another friend come over Sunday afternoon until I got home on Sunday evening. The second friend even spoke to my neighbour when she let the dog into the garden and assured her when she asked that the dog had been looked after all weekend and he was absolutely fine.

I found out from my landlord yesterday morning that she had reported it. Luckily my landlord didn’t believe her and just wanted to give me a heads up about being reported to the authorities. My landlord even apologised for the situation as this neighbour has caused problems for tenants before. 

I brought this up with the neighbour last night and asked her how she could report the dog being on his own when she had seen the lights on, the windows open, seen my friend on Sunday and never even knocked on the door to see if anyone was home. She said she never saw anyone. When I showed her proof that my friend was there she kept insisting she didn’t see him. She went on to say that I shouldn’t have a dog if I don’t walk him. I walk him early in the morning when I get up, every afternoon when I take my lunch at work and every night between 9-11. I told her as much and she claims she doesn’t see it. I tried to politely explain that just because she doesn’t see something happen, it doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. She won’t accept that. If she didn’t see it, it didn’t happen. 

I am really confused. So far I’ve tried to make nice with this neighbour even though she’s quite intrusive and opinionated. Reporting me is a step too far. Should I just ignore her for the next year that I’m living there? Should I try to preemptively defend myself to the authorities? What can I do when she’s making such serious allegations in the face of opposing evidence?

kawigreen6,2018-07-02 15:25:30+00:00,I broke up with my Boyfriend because he called me a cunt. Was I wrong?,"I've had it with how my boyfriend treats me. He gets mad at me for the smallest things and then accuses me of treating him like a child. For example. He offered to cut my back yard. I told him that the mosquitoes were pretty bad right now and that he didnt have to do that. But he insisted. I went out there with him, picked up any trash, moved any plants so that he could weed eat around them. I offered him water, but he said no thank you. The mower ran out of gas so he tried to put more in it but it just kept spraying every where. (hes not an outside person btw, hes an inside office guy type) So I said, ""Here, let me show you"" and he just looked at me with an annoyed expression. Then he said that the weed eater needed string, so I said ""Babe, look, all you have to do is pull it, and you have more string"", and that's when he started saying that I treat him like a child. And that hes getting all bit up by these mosquitoes and that I didn't offer him a benedryl. Are you kidding? I told him that he was getting mad at me for no reason. Then he proceeded to tell me what a Cunt I am, and that hes starting to really hate me. And so I would defend my self and he said, when are you going to learn to just shut the fuck up, i dont even care about you any more. So, I calmly looked at him and said, ""I want to break up."" Because this scenario has happened on more than one occasion and I'm just tired of making excuses for him. So, again, he proceeds to call me every name in the book while I just sit there and agree with him, which makes him more upset. And then hes silent for about 10 minutes and asks me ""How can I fix this? I didn't mean it"". I said ""You cant fix this. And you did mean it. Because you say it every time you get mad at me. And you always apologize after you've calmed down. But its not going to work on me today."" I was trying really hard to not give up on this person, but hes given me no choice. You dont tell the people that you love things like that.

Notsadenough,2018-06-30 14:33:51+00:00,Bf[28]arguing with me[27]as I wait for my abortion,"At planned parenthood for an abortion pill and my boyfriend gets upset I won’t let him pay with a card and have me pay him back half, and raises his voice and everyone is looking at us and I ask him to please not bc he’s embarrassing me and he says loudly “I’m not embarrassing you why are you so on edge?”. 

The reason he wants to pay is to use a medical expenses account from his previous job, so it’s free money to him but he’d use it then still charge me (at the gf discount of 50%) so basically he gets a net gain instead of me paying pp direct. It’s the principle about this which offends me, which is why I rather just pay 100% myself. I don’t appreciate being embarrassed in a fricking pp. When he is upset he makes exaggerated gestures and his voice gets louder and it’s like Jesus can this wait until I have taken the abortion pill?!

Okay here's what happened. Mom made a huge dinner Wednesday night and said she wished she had more people to enjoy it. I took the opportunity to get this over with. I called up my boyfriend and told him to come over. Boyfriend showed up, we sat at the table to eat. Here's the conversation that followed. 

Dad: ""Well look who decided to finally show.""

Me: ""Dad, I'm tired of this.""

Dad: ""Tired of what, I'm just kidding, gosh!""

Boyfriend cut in and shut it all down. It was amazing. I thought I was going to do most of the talking but here boyfriend does this wonderful thing. My parents faces were a mix of shock and sadness. 

Boyfriend: ""No it's not joking. It's not just kidding around. It hurts when you single me out. It hurts when you both laugh at me. Why? What could I have possibly done to deserve this? I've treated you all, including your daughter, with respect and this is the thanks I get. I've been staying away because I always get talked down to. Yes I'm a landscaper, yes I have anxiety, yes I'm human and I don't need you both to act like I'm not.""

user8463829483,2018-06-26 04:06:05+00:00,I heard my mom telling my stepdad I ruined her life/youth and that she was tired of having to be my mother. I am having a hard time talking with her at all,"I [16M] am having a hard time talking let alone look my mom [37F] in the eyes. I don’t live with my dad, he is in prison and we live with my stepdad [38M] and my half sister [14F]. When we lived with my dad I was going through hell with family problems with abuse and stuff like that. I feel like the only person that actually cared about me was my grandma, I was her favorite grandson and she treated me like a child. A thig to know is my stepdad really hates me, my father also left me for dead and said he didn’t love me. Through all this I started being depressed and my mom took me to the doctors and they took a test on me and it turns out I have am severely clinically depressed.

My mom and stepdad were arguing about something in the middle of the night, I went to go use the bathroom and they were talking really loud, I heard my mom bring up when I was born, she told my step dad I ruined her youth and that she tried to get an abortion or something and it didn’t work. She also told him she didn’t love me and I wasn’t a good enough kid and that she was tired of having to be a mother for me. She also told my step dad that I was “baggage” which she wish she didn’t have and that she regreted having me with my father. I probably shouldn’t have heard that. I snuck back to my room and I had a really difficult time falling asleep or doing anything. Lately I have been distant with my mom, I can’t really eat or sleep and I can’t get my mind off of what I heard. I am basically ruining our relationship. Any advice on what I should do? I am left feeling really guilty

happy_clam_pants,2018-06-25 13:04:54+00:00,Just discovered my husband has been cat fishing women for nearly half of our 8-year relationship,"I am 26, he is 28. We got married last year and have been together almost 8. This morning I woke up to his phone jabbing into my side in bed. Saw he had a tinder notification, so obviously I snooped. 

I found a three year history of him messaging over 50 girls under a false name and location, but with his picture. It seemed like it was a joking thing (his initial message to them was always a goofy/weird joke), but many of the conversations turned sexual (what do you want to do to me/here's what I would do to you). In nearly all convos, he made ""plans"" to meet up with the girls, and obviously ""things came up"" and he couldn't meet. There were several girls that he coaxed into sending nudes - but I found no record of him reciprocating. However, I don't doubt that he did. 

I kept snooping and found that he gave them his google voice number to chat with them via that, and the number of girls he's currently conversing with is staggering. Looking at dates and times, he's doing it all day. He got in a lengthy sexual conversation with one THE NIGHT BEFORE OUR WEDDING. He was messaging them while on our honeymoon. 

I feel so betrayed and nauseous. I've been trying to get him to get off his phone/computer and hang out with me, help me cook dinner, etc. He does, but he's always distracted by the phone. I want to scream at him - that if maybe he put the time he spends getting to know these women, into helping and getting to know ME, we wouldn't have the struggles that we do. 

We are currently on our anniversary vacation in the Caribbean. He's still in bed with no knowledge I've found out. I excused myself to the beach to breathe and think. I'm about to feed his phone to the sharks. 

Why would he do this? Am I crazy? Has anyone else gone through something similar? I am just so lost, and now completely alone in a country without cell service.

catthrowaway1235,2018-06-24 21:42:19+00:00,UPDATE ‘I won’t move in with my boyfriend because of my cat’,"First off, let me say I’m still shaking so if this is a rambled mess I am sorry. All your kind words from yesterday made me cry, thank you all so much. I thought I would give some back story to how my BF and I met. It was through a support group, as I mentioned. Growing up, (until age 7) I had a very abusive dad. When I was 7 he tried to kill my mother and I, luckily the cops intervened and they took him away. My mom charged him and he got put away. When the trial was done, we moved, and my mom gave me Moomoo (don’t judge the name, I was 8), from a local shelter. I didn’t fit in at the new school, And moomoo was the best thing in my life. Back to the support group.

I shared my story, and my BF confronted me after saying he also had abusive parents growing up, and we bonded over our similar situations. I didn’t realize how much control he had over me until recently. He convinced me to stop seeing my therapist, we also stopped going to group. He used to tell me what to wear, how to style my hair (it’s very curly, and recently I’ve been straightening it because he would always say it looked better). 

A few hours ago, I invited him over for lunch and to talk. Luckily, moomoo was in my room sleeping. I told him what you guys said, saying that if it was his dog he would be upset. He blew up. He told me that wasn’t the point. The point was I wasn’t committed to him, or didn’t care about us. He started throwing things (a glass, some books I had lying about, and some picture frames). It was terrifying. I had never seen him this angry before, and I just reverted back to what I used to do as a kid. Curl up, cover yourself as much as you can, stay quiet. Bless my roommate, who came home during this fit. She had brought the security guard because as she was walking in she heard the shouting/items breaking. My BF was escorted out, as he left I just screamed “don’t come back.” I hope it sticks.

I’ve blocked his number, and my landlady has been notified not to let him in, as have the guards. Next step is neighbours. I don’t really know what to do from here. I emailed my therapist, hopefully she will let me come back. My mom is on the way over right now, and my roommate is with me too. I’m so terrified. I didn’t realize how much control he had over me. I thought all his early behaviours was just because he had clingy issues from his own upbringing. 

I’m going to have a bath, relax, let my hair go curly again, and cuddle my baby. I’m really glad Moomoo was in my room.  Thank you all for the help. I didn’t think any of this was wrong until you guys brought it up. I still love him, and feel bad for him. He had a shit upbringing too, and I’m sure he’s messed up from it, but I’m going to try to move on. After my cat dies, I’m going to move out from this place, to somewhere he doesn’t know about. Thank you all again.

catthrowaway1235,2018-06-23 20:05:51+00:00,(Cross post) I’m not moving in with my boyfriend because of my cat,"Throwaway, and I’m on mobile, sorry for format.
I’ve been dating my (24F) boyfriend (26M) for a bit over a year now, and he really wants me to move in with him. The problem? My cat. My cat is 16, and dying. The vet says it would be unwise to hope for anything past six months. I’ve had this cat since I was a child, he was there for me through everything. There are a few reasons I don’t want to move: 1) moving is really stressful for cats, and I don’t want to cause any unneeded stress for my old boy. 2) my boyfriend has a fairly energetic Rottweiler, my cat has never been good with dogs (almost killed when he was two years old, we had to amputate his leg it was so badly crushed/injured). 
I understand my boyfriend wants me to be close to him, I want that too, but is it really so much to ask for a few months for my cat to pass away? It hurts me so much that he keeps calling me unfair and not committed in this relationship, I am. But my longest friend is dying, and I want him to be comfortable. He doesn’t seem to grasp how important my cat is to me. He has never liked cats, and even made the joke “when he’s gone I will finally be your number one man.”  I don’t know how to handle this at all.

jasonincode,2018-06-22 00:33:19+00:00,An Update from JasonInHell,"**tl;dr** - I am doing better and I continue to get better everyday

The first thing you may notice is this is being posted from a different account, I deleted the /u/jasoninhell account in a knee jerk reaction to seeing my reddit posts in the news.

I guess the first question to answer is how am I doing, and to that I would say I am doing well. I have bad days but I would think that is to be expected. It is just important that I, or anyone going through something, continue to use the support of friends and family as well as good coping skills to not let myself be completely defeated on those bad days. I won't lie, I struggled to get back to where I am. For some time I refused to sleep because of combination of fear of what I would wake up to and nightmares about that night. For a time I used alcohol to sleep but my family loved me enough to take it from me before it became a damaging and permanent habit. I was hospitalized because I did have thoughts of ending my life because I missed my children so much. From that I learned that you should never be ashamed of your mental health and not seeking treatment will only make it worse, not better. We have all heard it but if you or a loved one is struggling seek immediate assistance, your life is too important to throw away in a moment of weakness. By putting off treatment I only caused everything else in my life to suffer. I lost my job and became reclusive to the house. But don't worry I have been back to work since December and I have nearly regained my former position and salary, so I am good and require no assistance.

The second question would be how do I feel about the sentencing. That is something that is harder to answer, because no matter what the sentence nothing will bring back my beloved children. Do I think she should have gotten the death penalty (which Indiana has), no I do not. She wanted to die and after 9 years of giving her what she wanted when she wanted it I was not going to give her another thing. Do I think the life sentence will have any appreciable effect on her? I don't know, one thing she always stressed for the entire time that I knew her was that she lived her life without any regrets. Even after I caught her cheating on me she continued to say she had no regrets.

As for the ex-in-laws, they continue to be a problem to this day. Shortly after everything happened they changed the locks on the home I was renting from them with my property still inside. After trying to civilly negotiate the return of the property it was required that I involve law enforcement. That is an ongoing legal battle. A member of the family accused me of stealing property I had purchased from them prior to the death of the children and threatened to take action against me unless I paid double what I had already paid them. I alerted the authorities and as far as I know that is resolved. They continue to make visiting my children's grave difficult, during the one year anniversary they sat in their truck and just watched me the whole time I was visiting the grave. Because of that I don't visit the grave as often as I would like to.

If I can impart on you something I have learned through all of this it is that you should always take the time to be with the ones you love.

Instead of telling her son off, his mother refused to clean or pay it, didn't apologise and blamed me for undermining her son's art and killing his creativity. What should I do?","A friend of mine came over to my house for coffee with her 14 years old son and he decided to take a permanent marker and paint circles all over my chair -white leather-.

The chair is in my office, my office is upstairs, I clearly told him that the upstairs area is off limits and if he needs to use the toilet to use the bathroom downstairs. So he must have beensnooping around, because the only place in my house where there are markers is in my office, inside a wooden box in one of my desk drawers.

So he not only went through all the rooms until he found my office, but he also opened my drawers and boxes until he found the markers.

AnywaysMmy friend was just like No biggie just wipe it down with baby wipes and it will come off. Well I did, and nothing. Then I tried alcoho,l and nothing. My office chair looks like a fucking dalmatian.

I sent her a video of me wiping the chair with baby wipes and alcohol because she didn't believe the stains were impossible to remove. Then after sending proof via the videos I politely asked her to pay for a new chair, even sent her a link to the shop where I bought it so she could see the price for herself.

She texted right back saying I couldn't expect her to afford to buy that chair for me and that it wasn't going to happen. Then she went off about how people like me don't appreciate young people's talent and how we are cutting off their wings and how I'm a rock to her son's balloon?? She kinda spinned it around to say I should be thankful her son chose my chair to apply his talent and create art, and instead of being appreciative, I choose to be bitter about it and pick a fight.

So we wound up actually proper arguing, well good riddance. She didn't even disciplined him or scolded him for painting a fucking leather chair in someone's house! The nerve! I'd be mortified if my child behaved that way in someone else's house. And this is not even a little kid we're talkign about, it's a fricking 14 years old.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8rl45p/friends_14_yo_son_decided_to_paint_black_circles/,relationship_advice,3038,569,0.0
creeperthrowaway88,2018-06-15 15:21:11+00:00,My girlfriend is inviting herself to help me with a job and take half of my pay. She got upset that I told her I didn't need her help.,"My girlfriend had told me that she was going to hang out with her friend tomorrow morning, so I figured I would occupy my time somehow. An opportunity arrived at work to make a simple 1 hour long delivery for a good chunk of change. I figured that it was easy money and also a good way to wait for my girlfriend to get home.

Turns out that my girlfriend's plans for the morning weren't official and that when I told her about the job, she decided that she wanted to be apart of it, even though it is a very simple job that would NEVER need two people to accomplish. She said that she should tag along and we should make a day date trip out of it. I agreed because yes that would be fun, spend the day on the town together somewhere. So because my family is limited on cars right now, we would need to take her car instead so we can have it the whole day. She said that because we were taking her car I would need to give her half of the pay. I thought it was a little harsh but I agreed that it was fair because it was her car.

I found out that I would be able to take my own car and keep it out for the day, and the fact that its a much nicer and comfortable car for long distances, I told her we would no longer need her car.

Cue her getting pissed at me saying that ""I"" am being greedy for trying to screw her out of the money. Like I'm the bad guy for wanting to take my own car and not put 200 miles on her older car for no reason. I told her she can come with me but she still wants half the money for just ""being there"". Like it's only 2 boxes, I'm more than capable of doing it on my own with a hand tied behind my back.

I didnt mean to.  Never been to this part of Reddit. Anyways. I am just in a damn tail spin and a lot of people's advice believe it or not is making me feel better for feeling what I am feeling. I am furious.  I want to cuss her out, take my kids and run away.  Everything I have ever learned or been told though says I have to support her. So I am like destroyed in the head. My wife got back an hour ago.  I checked and the starbucks she says she met them at would have still been open.  She says she met them and just talked to them.  She found out their names...which brought up some other issues I dont want to get into. They seemed to say over and over again that they thought she was into it.  They say she gave one her number and went to the car.  She told me that they at least claim it was her idea to stop in a parks parking lot and start things and that they drove her back.  She says talking to them helped her remember most of it, but she is adamant that she was blacked out during most of it and never remembers anything past talking to one of the guys at the bar for a little bit, bits in pieces in the back of the car, and being let out by her car in the parking lot.

She said to me and I swear I almost lost it.  i have never hit her or touched her out of anger, but she said and I quote ""they seem like nice young guys who made a mistake.""  I asked her if she touched them or they touched her and she said she hugged them.  Like I want to be supportive, but Jesus Christ.  She also said she might see them again as she felt talking with them helped her a lot.  

I told her I wouldnt allow that.  She then lost it.  Said she was a victim.  Said she was raped and this helps her more than my anger does.  She literally said, ""They are nicer to me than you are and that when she told them she didnt remember it they seemed shocked and tried to console her.""  They seemed to think they were meeting for round two and told her they had taken pictures, but would delete them.  They both told her too that there was no protection used.

I was out of town for business and she went out with some girls from work to a bar after work to blow of steam she said.  I was a bit upset because she never called or told me she was going out, but I  also dont want to be a controlling asshole.  I was also upset because we have two children and they were both left with a baby sitter so she had ample time to tell me.  Well she apparently got drunk, although she thinks something was put in her drink and two guys brought her to a car in a parking lot and took turns while she was blacked out in the back seat of the car.  She doesnt remember much of it at all, but says it lasted a long time.  I could tell by what the baby sitter charged she got home around 5 am.  She says they left her in the parking lot and drove off. She already got tested and is going to get tested again today.  She told me right when I got back from the business trip.  She was a mess.  Crying.  It hurt to see her that way.  She had some marks on her body and could barely get the words out.

I obviously want to kill these two guys.  I am trying to be supportive of my wife and be there for her.  I love her and she is the mother of my children.

My (now ex) girlfriend and I had been together for about two years. Yesterday, I sent her my usual good morning Snapchat, but she stopped responding. After a day of trying to get a hold of her, I figured she must’ve been upset about something. I went to her front door with a bouquet of flowers, ready to apologize for anything I could have done. She never opened the door, and I ended up leaving the flowers on her porch.

She only sent me one text that night, saying “I need space”. I was absolutely dumbfounded, because to my recollection, I couldn’t have done anything that could have upset her, besides hanging out with my friends for a night instead of her, which I constantly asked if it was okay, which she said was absolutely fine.

Today she just sent me a snap saying that she has lost interest because “I’ve changed”. And that was it. We were done. Two years down the drain in less than 48 hours. She never mentioned anything to me, I didn’t even know we were having any kind of problems.

I’m absolutely destroyed. She blocked my phone and all of my social media. We were so close, and she would go on and on about how much she loved me. She ate dinner with my family and I at least once every week. I feel so alone and deserted.

1. He asked me a few months ago if he can have sex with other women. He said that it’s good to ask instead of assume that I won’t be ok with it and because I got upset, he now knows that I won’t be ok with it.
2. I found a text exchange between him and this girl from the gym a few weeks ago. Yes, it was an innocent, non-sexual text but I’ve never even heard of this girl before. He then says that he has known her since high school and that there’s nothing wrong with the text. Plus, they just always see each other at the gym because they both have “the same passion for fitness and health.”
3. He has been very nice to his ex-wife recently. She is the mother of his first child. They’ve been in court for several things and to change the parenting schedule because she accused him of showing porn to their 12 year old son. After several appearances with a magistrate, the son just confessed to his mother that it was him who looked up the porn sites and not his father. The ex now wants to settle a couple of things (she owes him money) outside the court and drop the charges against him related to the porn. 

We now have a beautiful 3 year old daughter and I would hate for her to grow up in a broken home. My husband swears that this trip was just for an adventure and not to have sex with many women. I am in so much anger and pain right now. What would you do if you were in my shoes? Should I just be ok with him going on this “adventure trip” so he is happy and we can keep working on our marriage? Should I just file for divorce if he does go without my consent?

BF and I was on a party last night and it was a super funny night, or atleast until we got home.

I was pretty drunk when we got home and we had just had a fight over some stupid shit I can't even rember, but he decided to go sleep on the couch after the argument.

I fell asleep in our bed and felt like my head would explode from all the alcohol. Next thing I remember was him on top of me trying to get my underwear off. I was so tired and drunk I didn't even know what to do. 
After that I don't know what he did but I ""woke up"" again and then he was already inside me in full action. Blacked out again and finally woke up when he tried to get my underwear back on.

I've been raped before and he knows that and has always been supporting during those conversations. 

So I straight out asked him if he had raped me.
He looked so scared and said that I didn't say no to it, and that he had asked but I just mumbled something back.

Previous Update:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8poj55/update_should_i_be_concerned_about_my_daughters/?st=JI7P1S9T&amp;sh=ed83f0a1

As of yesterday I felt like I was handling this situation the best way I possibly could. As of today I feel like a failure of a mother.

I got up really early this morning around 3 AM to give my daughter’s father a call. He’s over in Europe at the moment so I figured that time would be best for him, but I mostly just wanted to get ahold of him before my daughter woke up so that she wouldn’t overhear any of the conversation and think that I was going behind her back. I decided to do a quick check before I called him and peaked into her bedroom to make sure she was still asleep. Maybe I’m naïve for being shocked and completely caught off guard by this, but not only did I discover that my daughter wasn’t asleep, she was gone. I have never known her to be the type to sneak out (though I guess it’s called “sneaking out” for a reason) and even when she’s gone out late with friends in the past she’s always let me know beforehand.

Of course I freaked out and tried desperately to get ahold of her. I sent her dozens of messages and tried calling her but it kept going straight to voicemail. After about 10 minutes I gave up on reaching her and was trying to figure out who to call that might know where she was when I heard the front door being unlocked. I went and stood out in the hallway and when she walked in and saw me she had a look of pure panic on her face. I never have been very strict with my daughter in the past, but in that moment I very sternly told her “I need an explanation. Now.”

She instantly burst into tears. I asked her where she had been and I asked if she was with Mr. Smith but all she kept telling me was “I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” I finally just told her “I have been nothing but loving and understanding with you. I know you’re an adult now, but you still live under my roof. The least you owe me is the god damn truth.” I asked her once again where she had been and she said, still crying, “out for a drive.” I asked if she was alone and she shook her head no. I asked if she was with her teacher and she hesitantly shook her head yes.

It took me a moment to sit and process that all of the things I was afraid of happening had likely been going on behind my back this whole time, and that my daughter had clearly lied straight to my face when I spoke with her yesterday. Eventually I said to her “So I take it you weren’t being honest with me when you told me you saw him as just a friend.”

To that remark she went from softly crying to sobbing. All she had to say was that she was sorry but she “loves” him.

I can’t remember the last time I felt this angered or betrayed or disgusted. And not because of my daughter. Because of her teacher. This man has clearly been grooming and manipulating my daughter and I was stupid enough to not do something about it sooner and gave my daughter and her teacher the benefit of the doubt even with all of the obvious warning signs. Now it’s probably too late for me to do anything.

We talked for a while and I tried my best to as calmly as possible explain my concerns about their relationship to her. I tried to tell her that it wasn’t healthy and that being in a relationship with someone who once had a position of power over her is a recipe for disaster. I told her that it’s easy for a man of his age and with his experience to take advantage of a younger girl. I also explained that a man who sneaks around with her when he has a wife and a family of his own is a man who does not truly respect her or care about her well being. To everything I said though she just responded with something along the lines of “he’s not like that, it’s different with us.”

I was able to get her to talk a lot more about what’s really been going on between them, but I don’t feel it necessary or appropriate to share all of those details here. If you feel I’ve left out any significant details you are more than welcome to ask me to clarify something, but otherwise I’d prefer not to disclose more than what I have to as it is obviously an uncomfortable and sensitive topic. I do feel I should mention that she claimed the “romantic” aspect of their relationship only just recently began and that they were not romantically involved while she was his student. Of course, I’ve recently discovered that my daughter is more than capable of lying to me and covering these things up, so I am aware that this may be untrue and I will try to do some further digging into that matter.

At this point, as much as it kills me to admit it, I don’t think there’s anything I can do to stop this. I have spoken with my ex husband but he is at a bit of a loss too as to what to do about all this. He wants to confront Mr. Smith, but we are still trying to work out if that’s the best idea and if it will really do any good in this situation. I will be reading up on the laws in my state and the policies of the school district, but besides potentially getting Mr. Smith fired I’m not sure that there’s anything else that can be done legally speaking. I want to keep him as far away from my daughter as possible but I feel completely powerless in that, which crushes me. Trying to forbid her from seeing him seems like it would be pointless considering she is a legal adult. She is still dependent on her father and I and we could technically hold that against her to get her to stop seeing him, but that would no doubt permanently damage our relationship with her. Informing Mr. Smith’s wife is also a possibility we’ve considered and would likely cause him to lose contact with my daughter, but that would of course cause my daughter to resent her father and I as well. Right now, I’m honestly so worried about her safety and her mental health that we may just end up having to do something that will result in her resenting us in order to protect her (and protect other female students in Mr. Smith’s care). Trust me when I say, her father and I are considering every possible option.

Thank you to those of you taking the time to read all of this and thank you for continually offering your support and advice. Any suggestions you have of a solution (or legal advice) that I may not have thought of are absolutely welcome and greatly appreciated. However, any “I told you so’s” or any criticism of my parenting is unwelcome and unnecessary. Believe me, you can’t possibly be any harder on me than I am already being on myself at the moment.

TL;DR:  It turns out my daughter is in fact having an affair with her former teacher. Because the romantic part of their relationship supposedly began after she graduated, her father and I are afraid that there’s nothing that can be done to put an end to their relationship. We are considering all possibilities, even those that may cause our daughter to resent us. Any helpful advice you could offer would be greatly appreciated at this time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8puly0/another_update_should_i_be_concerned_about_my/,relationship_advice,2194,451,0.0

Update:

I had a talk with my daughter today and asked her some casual questions about her former teacher (in a way/tone that a curious friend would ask, not an overbearing mother). Thankfully I was able to get her to open up more about her relationship with Mr. Smith.

I saw her grinning to herself while messaging someone on her phone again so I took that as an opportunity to casually bring up her teacher. I said something along the lines of “Oh, are you chatting with Mr Smith again?” To which she replied “No, just my friend ‘Shannon’. What made you think that?” I told her that I noticed she usually smiles like that when she talks to Mr Smith, which made her embarrassedly say, “oh... yeah. I like talking to him.”

I then said to her, “Speaking of Mr Smith... how is he doing? I know you hung out with him for a while the other day. You must have had a pretty nice talk then!” She instantly lit up when I brought this up and she finally started to give me details. She said that she always loves seeing him because he’s one of the only people she can talk to for hours on end like that and not get bored. She told me that they met up at a coffee shop and just spent the whole day there chatting and catching up. To this I asked her “You don’t feel weird hanging out with an old teacher of yours outside of school?” She said it didn’t seem weird to her at all even though she knows other people might find it a little strange. She also added, “Maybe if I came across another student and teacher hanging out together like that I might question it, but I’ve always seen my relationship with Mr Smith as being a little different.” I asked her how she views their relationship and she said she looks at him as being more of a friend than a teacher.

I decided to push things a little further at this point and asked her “have you ever seen him as being more than a friend?” She paused for a while and I could see her gears turning. She finally said “I’m not sure honestly.” She explained that she has a feeling of love for him that she hasn’t felt before, but she doesn’t think it’s a romantic love. She said he just means a lot to her and she can’t imagine not having him in her life. She admitted that sometimes she feels like she has a bit of a crush on him but that at the same time she could never really see herself kissing him or being in a relationship with him. She said her best way of describing it is that he has set the standard for what she wants in a future partner but that she doesn’t actually want him in that way.

The one last bit of information I was hoping to find out from her was if in her opinion Mr. Smith had ever shown romantic interest in her, so I asked “Do you think he has any feelings for you? I mean you’ve spent a lot of time together and he definitely sees you differently than he sees his other students. He even gave you that perfume as a gift, which seems somewhat flirtatious to me.” She told me that she’s never felt like he’s shown interest in her in that way. She said that they tease each other a lot which might come off as being flirtatious but that it’s all innocent. She also added that he’s happily married and has a family. I brought up how she used to say that he would complain to her about his wife but my daughter said his marriage was just going through a rough patch at the same time that my daughter was struggling with depression, so they confided in each other and bonded over that, but things have improved a lot since then. She also explained that his wife is aware of his friendship with my daughter, and that his wife is actually the one who suggested he give my daughter the perfume. Apparently someone had bought it for her but she didn’t like the scent, so she asked her husband if he wanted to see if my daughter liked it and wanted to have it so it wouldn’t go to waste.

Throughout my conversation with my daughter I never once felt like she was trying to deceive me or hide something from me. As far as I know, she’s always been very honest with me and she’s never given me any reason to question her trustworthiness. While I’m still not certain that her unusually close friendship with her teacher is the best thing for her, she is an adult and I feel I should let her make her own decisions and her own mistakes and let her learn from them on her own, so I don’t plan to intervene unless at any point I start to feel like she is unknowingly putting her physical or mental health at risk. If any more concerns do arise, I will be sure to talk it out with her first and I will not take any action on it behind her back. I made sure to reassure my daughter that I am always here for her if she wants or needs to talk about anything like this in the future.

Some of you may feel that I am a bad parent for not trying to dig deeper or for not trying to intervene in any way, but I truly feel that I’ve done all that I need to at this point, and I’m very happy that I made the decision to handle this in the way I did. Feel free to ask me more questions if you like, but any more advice isn’t really necessary at this point. Thank you once more for all of the suggestions that you gave me in my last post. I feel so relieved to finally have this matter resolved.



TL;DR: I had a long discussion with my daughter about her relationship with her teacher and she opened up about it and answered all of the questions I had. She doesn’t seem to be involved in anything more than a close platonic friendship with him, and I have no valid reason to believe that he is grooming her or taking advantage of her in any way. I don’t plan to intervene in their relationship and I let my daughter know that I’m always here for her to talk to about this or anything else in the future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8poj55/update_should_i_be_concerned_about_my_daughters/,relationship_advice,1688,272,0.0
devinetv,2018-06-03 22:27:59+00:00,Husband laughs as he reveals my 27 year old secret to my mom over lunch,"When I was a teenager I took the blame for damage that I did not cause. (Thank goodness no one was hurt.) I took the blame - and the person who really did it was completely off the hook. I knew that I would suffer far fewer consequences. My family paid for the damages, which were not  inconsequential, and i have taken the blame for being an irresponsible teenager for 27 years. This secret (that I was not the person who was responsible for the damage) has been kept from my parents by many individuals, including my siblings, who knew the story since the time happened. 

Today at lunch, my elderly mother brought up the incident for the first time in front of my husband of 5 years. He told her that I was not the one who did it. She was very confused.

My mom was like - is this true? She said it was a lot to think about. 

I feel extremely betrayed. I can’t even talk to him right now. He thinks its stupid that I care bc it happened 27 yrs ago.

My (24F) boyfriend (26M) has finally started to accept his body, and realise that I’m not going anywhere. He’s still a little shy about it, but he stayed over my house last night (he met my parents so it’s cool to have him over now) and I was able to make the whole night about him and left the lights on. I don’t think words can explain how happy that made me to make him feel comfortable enough around me, afterwards we were able to lie together and had a really deep conversation about what we want from life and about our future together. I honestly can’t wait for it all now and I’m really excited to start my life with him!

I[15F] need advice about my brother [17M] and our cousin [18F] are having sex. It’s pretty damn obvious she’s into him and everybody knows she has a thing for him she literally throws herself at him. She will always touch him, cuddle him, and (I’m a girl so I know this stuff) she rubs her chest on him whenever he walks by or hugs her. Then she always says “he’s mine, only mine”. She’s weird, my brother is nasty for going through with it

So our families don’t live very close but we visit each other very often and the visits last multiple days to weeks at a time. The last time we went, they’re house is kinda weird . It’s basically my brother and I and our 3 female cousins. They have 3 rooms and an rv. When we visit, my parents sleep in the rv, her parents sleep in their room, and all of us kids slee in 2 rooms. These 2 rooms are attached but have no door. She (obviously) said she and my brother would sleep alone in one room and us 3 other girls will sleep in the other one on the bunk beds.

I couldn’t sleep that night so I was bored and basically just looking around. I saw AND heard my brother and our cousin banging. Literally as soon as I looked over they were GOING AT IT. I was pretty disturbed so I tried making noise to like get them to shut the fuck up and chill but that didn’t work sinve they were too into it so I put earbuds in and listened to music. Next morning was awkward asf. At breakfast, they kept on smiling at each other and it was kinda obvious they were up to something. I was the only one who heard that shit.

Wondering what it was I opened it and found that it belongs to my girlfriend (F20) who I have been dating and living with for almost 2 years now.

There’s multiple ones, all written one day last week when I was out of town for a cousin’s graduation party. My girlfriend wrote about 10 notes, all to different people explaining her feelings for them and telling them not to forget her when she dies. 

What do I do? I feel like this must be some sick joke. My girlfriend has had issues with depression before and I have always been able to help her out of each episode. She’s gotten so much stronger lately and I thought she was doing much better. Finding these has hit me like a ton of bricks and I don’t know how to approach her about it because I’m not sure how she’ll react knowing I found and read them.

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/50axee/im_37f_unexpectedly_pregnant_my_husband_35m_wants/


I wanted to give you kind people an update that is well overdue. First though, I'd like to take a moment to thank you (most of you) for your support and kind words. For the most part the community came through with useful advice. I really needed help and felt extremely lonely during my original post. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. 


An now onto the update. I'm 39 now and my husband is 37. I was able to see a therapist a day or two after my original post and had a good cry while hashing out the whole story. I told the therapist about the advice I got here (she hadn't heard of reddit) and she agreed as well. I went through with the pregnancy. My husband had the option (obviously) to stay or leave. He decided to stay. 


Not only did he decide to stay, but he's the happiest he's ever been in his life. Reminder: we were a childless couple and did not plan on ever having kids. Our daughter has brought so much love into our hearts that we are both amazed. I see the world in a different way now that I have her. He loves our daughter with every bit of himself. Amazingly my love has grown for this man. He has told me that she has opened up parts of his heart that he never knew was there. I understand what he means. The happiness that I feel is beyond words. Both my husband and I are so thankful that we had our daughter. We talk about it every month or so and can't believe how much we would have missed out if we didn't have her. To top it all off, we have decided to have another baby! 


So thank you, reddit. Your support helped me through a difficult time. I hope that those of you that took the time to comment on the original post see this update.

My (24F) boyfriend (26M) is amazing, he’s probably the best guy I’ve ever been with, and even though it hasn’t been very long we have both agreed that it feels like we’ve known each other forever, and we can both honestly see a future together. We have the same values in relationships (and life) and we both want the same things for our future, I don’t think I love him yet (it hasn’t been long enough) but I can see myself loving him, and being with him for a long time. The only problem is that he’s really shy about his dick, he’s a very tall guy (just over 6ft), but his dick isn’t so much, I actually have problems with my cervix and ovaries that are very long and complicated, but a smaller dick is more ideal for me. The sex is still incredible, but when we have sex he has to have all the lights off, and he doesn’t really like me touching him below the waist. So far we’ve only had sex twice, and yes the first time I saw it I was a little suprised but I didn’t say anything, and then when I thought about it afterwards I realised that it really doesn’t bother me, it’s different but it isn’t a bad thing. I really want to sit down with him and talk to him about it, but I don’t know how, he’s so embarrassed by it. I feel like he’s probably had girls dump him for it before too, as the day after we first had sex we made plans to meet up and he said ‘don’t worry if you can’t make it’, but these were solid plans that we made because we would both be free on that at that time. I’ve tried to tell him that I think he’s perfect, and I love his body, but he’s still so shy about it, I don’t want to leave something that could be the best relationship ever (and possibly ‘the one’) over something that I find so silly and trivial.

justaperson999999,2018-05-20 23:22:46+00:00,Today I caught my wife of nearly 4 years cheating on me.,"Apologies, this is a long one. TL;DR at the end. Also sorry for formatting, on mobile. 

Bit of background. My wife was going on a night out with one of her girl friends. Her friend picked her up and they went into town. Wife forgot her key, i needed to keep the back door unlocked. 

It gets to 1 am, i send her a text saying dont be too late due to the door being open. No response. 2.30am still not home. At this point I start calling but there is no answer. Fast forward to 8am, 70ish calls later and still no sign of her. I was very worried at this point. 

Backtrack a little, to around 1am when I notice on her laptop (which she left on, but on the lockscreen) a notification of a Facebook message, from a random guy telling her what bar she was in but then no further messages.

So then this morning she finally texts me to say she is at her friends. I then check the laptop again and see an exchange of messages between her and said friend (I can't see what wife is saying, just friends responses).

The friend was asking if she was home yet, and when she would go home. She then asked wife ""What is your story? I will make sure I stick to it"". They then plan the story about why she had to take a taxi home, and friend was saying ""don't worry for all he knows you Are here asleep in my spare room"". After a few further messages the best message of the lot was sent.

""So, how big was his dick then?"" I photographed all the messages. 

Later when wife returns home at first I play it cool like i dont know what went on. She is walking around the house acting perfect, like nothing was wrong. Eventually I confront her, and show the messages. At first she swore blind she was at the friends house, and that I could call her to check that (of course I could, they had already got their stories straight). When I showed her the last message she eventually admitted she was at this guy's house, slept in his bed but nothing happened. I calmly left the house with her yelling at me to leave.

12 hours later, i am now not speaking with her or responding to messages. She started saying she did nothing wrong and that I was the one throwing it all away. Apparently me leaving was proof I never loved her. 

Now we are at the borderline emotional blackmail stage. Claiming she is heartbroken along with her son (Not mine,  he is from a previous relationship). I feel she is trying to make me feel bad about leaving, like I should go running back to her. She broke my trust, and for me that's the end. She still swears nothing happened between them, i dont have solid evidence they did sleep together, but i feel the evidence strongly points towards that. She wants to talk like adults and sort things out. In all honesty I don't even think this is the first time she has done this now I know she is capable of it. 

How do i get past this? Currently I have zero intention of going back to her. I dont know what to do with myself. Any advice on how to handle this?

TL;DR I am 99% certain she cheated. How to I move forward and handle this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8kwftq/today_i_caught_my_wife_of_nearly_4_years_cheating/,relationship_advice,2174,540,0.0
P_Ell_Travers,2018-05-19 00:21:48+00:00,My (26F) student teacher (24M) went to dinner with my (high school) students and bad mouthed me. I’m not sure how to salvage my relationship with my students.,"This isn’t the typical relationship advice post, but I’m hoping you guys can help me figure out where to go from here. I am a high school choir teacher who recently hosted a student teacher. Long story short, this guy was a disaster. He showed a lot of potential in terms of presentation. Funny guy, kids took to him quickly, good overall pacing, etc.

But he missed a ton of days (more sick days than I get in a year) for reasons that were sketchy at best, refused to take any constructive feedback, always taught off the cuff without any preparation, and generally was very unprofessional and immature. For example, he missed 3 days due to a back injury (I found out later that he was doing manual labor during this time that he was “unable to teach”), and he told one of my classes a FULLY DETAILED story about how his ex had cheated on him with his best friend. It definitely seemed like he viewed himself as one of the students rather than a teacher.

Any attempts I made to conference with him were met with arguing. Basically anything I asked him to do (prepare to teach a song, make copies, plan a lesson, etc.) was met with statements like “Whatever, I already do everything anyways.” I was incredibly frustrated with him but I worked hard to hide this from the students. In the last two weeks he told me he was going to be a realtor anyways so I just gave him a C and sent him on his way. 

Today, I found out that he met with some of my students for dinner. During this dinner, he told them that I “hate my job” and I tried to fail him because I’m “jealous” of him. He told them that I talk negatively about them behind their backs and that I didn’t understand his “style of teaching”. 

Three girls in my program brought this to me because they wanted to hear “my side” of things. I’m fuming. All my students really bonded with him, but my boys especially loved him, and he used this bond to try to drive a wedge between me and my students. This may be hard to explain, but as a choir director, my kids and my job mean EVERYTHING to me. I work 70+ hours a week prepping music, organizing field trips and fundraisers, running after school rehearsals, etc. I spend four years with them before they graduate and I help them through family troubles, boyfriends, anxiety, you name it! Now I feel that they are going to question me and my motives because this petulant child decided to knock me down a peg. 

I don’t know which students specifically were there when he went on his anti-me rant, but I got the impression it was quite a few. Should I address this with all my students? Just a few from the group? Let it go? I want to address this with him too, but I don’t know how to do it without dropping down to his level and being an unprofessional jerk. I want to set a good example for my kids but I really don’t know how. 

Any advice is appreciated. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8khq86/my_26f_student_teacher_24m_went_to_dinner_with_my/,relationship_advice,1281,121,0.0

Doodbones,2018-05-14 15:17:16+00:00,My two cents and deep concern about this sub.,"Hey all. Me (M28) and my girlfriend (F23) have been long time lurkers on this sub. We have a happy and fulfilling relationship with trust, love, and passion. We have been through our ups and downs, but our relationship is incredible. 

We were reading a post today about a woman who said she found suspicious messages when going through her husbands Facebook. Also in her story she said that their two toddlers were taking up most of the free time and their marriage was hitting a rough spot, like many people struggle with the same situation.

Fast forward to the comments. This is where my concern starts. MISERY LOVES COMPANY. PERIOD. The amount of cutting, negative, ""DIVORCE HIM AND MOVE ON, GOHRL HE LYIN"" comments were unbelievable, and the same goes for almost every top post on this sub...

All I'm saying is be careful, y'all. Especially the younger people who come here for advice. Relationships take work, relationships are hard sometimes, and relationships take compromise. I hope that these folks understand that they're probably taking that cutting ""advice"" from middle aged, three time divorced cat ladies with strange colored hair, or dudes who are manipulative and have never had a successful relationships. Who's got time for that?

Mods, remove this post if I'm breaking any rules. But maybe its a good idea to put some sort of flair on username so people can be a bit more selective about where said advice is coming from. For example ""marriage counseling works"" or ""three times divorced cat lady""

kornered1,2018-05-12 12:58:27+00:00,"It happened. I finally lost the attraction I held for my girlfriend that was once my fiancé, twice. I’ll explain.","But first, some history;

I’m 38m and girlfriend is 31f. We met around 5 years ago. We have a three year old daughter together. Our relationship had it’s rocky moments, but for the most part we worked through it. I figured we could power through ANYTHING, as long as we love each other. Anyways, right after I found out she was pregnant, almost 4 years ago, is when I proposed to her. At that time, our relationship was fairly strong. 

Last year is when things started to de-rail. I can’t pinpoint exactly when it was going south, but it started probably mid year, maybe around June. Coincidentally this is around the time when she graduated from college and obtained a teaching position. Throughout college I was the primary income bringer. For around 3 years I supported our family financially while she finished her bachelors program. 

I remember it perfectly. She just graduated. I traded in her vehicle I once paid cash for ($10,000 that I had in savings) that she used during school, for a 2017 Santa Fe. An SUV she has been dreaming of getting but couldn’t afford just yet. I surprised her with it and she was so happy, in tears. Later that month we went on our second ever family vacation in the newly bought SUV. I would like to say we had a great time, but I’d be lying. It was a very rough and stressful trip, being as we had our toddler with us. 

After that trip was probably the time we started to really have problems. She once came up to me saying she wasn’t happy. That she wanted to start spending more time away from home, with her best friends. I was supportive of this. After all, I loved my future wife and wanted to do anything I could to keep her happy. 

Her heavy drinking and going out to clubs started in early July. I remember that night. She went out on a girls night out with her cohorts from her college program. A kind of reunion if you will. It started to feel like something was off. She normally has her iPad sitting at home and was never one to hide it. After she stopped returning text messages that night, I decided to check her iPad to see if either my messages or hers wasn’t going through (that’s the beauty of iPads and iPhones, you can send/receive iMessages on either devices). And that’s when I noticed she had turned iMessage off of her iPad. I thought this was very suspicious. I decided to call her, but she wouldn’t answer. She finally came home at around 3 am. The next day is when I found out she actually went to meet up with an old crush of hers. They went bar hopping and made out. 

After this event, she wanted to open the relationship. Of course she no longer wanted to be engaged and stopped wearing her engagement ring. I of course was devastated by everything. In hopes of one day getting her back, I gave her all the space she could ask for. We lived together in a basically roommates situation until she came to me wanting to work on our relationship. This was in November of last year. 

She then cut ties with the guy she was seeing on/off during this period. I too was somewhat seeing a girl that had approached me and gave me her phone number. Her and I dated a bit but we never went as far as sex. She was basically a female I hung out with, and she was good company. She wanted a relationship with me, but being in the screwed up situation I was currently in, I just wanted someone to take my mind off of the shitstorm my current relationship was in. 

At the time my ex-fiancé and I decided to work on our relationship, we were both in full disclosure about the other person in our lives. I stopped talking to the other girl and my now ex-fiancé stopped talking to the guy she broke up with me to be with. I’m assuming the guy she was seeing didn’t want to be in a relationship with her and decided to end things, thus is the reason my ex-fiancé wanted us to work on our relationship. 

When she first approached me about getting back together, I was so happy. I was willing to forgive her for cheating and betraying me, for splitting up our family. I laid out what it will take to get our relationship back on track. The trust needs to be earned back. I no longer trusted her and she has a ton of work to do. She agreed full heartedly. 

Things were on track for repairing. At the end of December she told me she wants to marry me and wants to start wearing the engagement ring again. Our relationship was getting stronger and stronger. At this point, she was in her first year of teaching, and we had just started talking about wedding venues. I was genuinely happy and I believed she was too. Also, we both had started seeing a therapist. I was seeing one to better understand what had happened in our relationship and how to accept her trust again. The therapy was working! She was seeing a therapist for her depression and anxiety. It was working for her as well. 

Fast forward a few months to mid-March. We are both no longer seeing therapists. We are back to being engaged. I start noticing those little things she was doing last year. You know, those little red flag things that indicate something is up with her again. She begins to be distant and wanting to go out with friends. Not just hanging out at their places, but going out to clubs and such. In other words, I’m seeing the signs of the beginnings of what happened last year. 

About the two weeks later she once again tells me she’s unhappy. She doesn’t know why. Eventually she calls off the engagement again, but tells me she still wants to be in the relationship. And no, the other guy hasn’t re-entered her life she says. 

About two weeks ago she tells me she wants to resume our engagement. She tells me she wants to get married, or at the very least, have a “commitment ceremony “. I kind of go along with it, but, I feel like I’ve been through absolute hell this past 12 months. The feeling of instability is inescapable. I feel I no longer want to be with this person anymore. I struggled, for months, trying to wrap my brain around what I did wrong. Trying to figure out what is wrong with me, to drive her away both times. But it dawned on me in the past month or two; I’m not the problem! It’s not me!! I’ve done NOTHING but pour every ounce of effort into our relationship, each time it was starting to derail. I put so much effort into trying to keep her happy all these years. I’ve sacrificed EVERYTHING for her. All I get in return is some flaky person that wants to occasionally be my girlfriend. WTF?! I asked myself. I realized that I need to get out. Soon. So here I am. I just filed bankruptcy last week. I accumulate mass debts in all those years I supported her financially while she pursued her dream job and obtaining her associates and later, her bachelors degree. I filed bankruptcy. Yep. Going to give myself the freedom I deserve. It’s the first step to leaving this abusive relationship. 

There were steps to take though. First, I had to file bankruptcy. Done. I had to figure out how, exactly, I can stop being attracted to her. You see, she has zero sex drive and always shoots me down for sex. It’s been like this since our daughter was born, three years ago. Her drinking has helped me lose my attraction to her. It’s hard to be attracted to someone that drinks heavily several times a week. Then, I need to start a savings account to hold me over for when we do separate. I’ve begun to do this, but because of my recent bankruptcy, I’ve got to be careful here. There’s also a matter of credit. My credit is done for. 

So here I am. I’m sad that things turned out the way they have. I still love my girlfriend, but I’ve got to end this malicious cycle of our relationship. I’m tired of feeling the anxiety of it all. The more I dump into the secret savings account and start the rebuilding of my credit, the more control I take back on my life! 

It’s a slow battle. I’ll get there.

I know I should have either left or given her the ultimatum that ""you wait until I'm ready or find someone who WILL give you kids right now"". I fucked up and I admit it, but I don't regret having him.

For the first few months I took off work... I held the baby, soothed the baby, changed the baby, fed the baby in the middle of the night. See, she was adamant about breastfeeding, and I agreed with it... I thought formula was insane and beyond expensive. I just didn't realize that when she said that feeding the baby was going to be her utmost care and responsibility that it was going to be her only responsibility.

 I went back to work when my leave was up. I didn't want to lose that job. She couldn't handle him on her own. I ended up calling out a few times or leaving work early to fix simple things like soothing the baby to sleep (i worked overnight so that I could be home all day and they would be asleep when I went)... I lost that job because she kept demanding I leave to come help her... I spent the next 3 months taking care of the baby.. everything except feeding him when she was awake. She only fed him when she was awake. We got evicted.

Fast forward a few weeks... We're living with roommates. I get a job. A better job than before. Shit's going well for a few months because she's got money to spend and my hours are reasonable. We don't have a car, so I walk 2 miles to work every day, and 2 miles home every evening. I still take the kid into my arms as soon as I hit the door, and I give her at least 2 hours to relax before I get to cool off from work. Things seem to be going fine.

Time passes. She's not fine. She demands I leave work early to come help her with the kid nearly daily. I put my foot down. ""Do what you have to do because that's what I'm doing."" She's mad as hell, and we argue constantly from then on. I end up hurting myself at work... I'm home for 2 weeks recovering. She's got me doing the full time dad thing again. I go back to work. She's becoming more stressed out dealing with the kid. She starts waking me up an hour or 3 each night to fight and to take the baby into another room because ""breastfeeding takes so much out of me"". The kid is over a year old now, so I say, ""you can stop breastfeeding him if it's that stressful.""... ""you don't understand. It's the only thing I'm good at"" (you mean it's the only thing you're willing to do.. but I don't say that) I eventually have a nervous breakdown and lose that job too.

Her father gives us a car because he thinks that my pedestrian commute is what is keeping me out of work despite me being a pedestrian my entire life, and never having lost a job due to attendance until now... So I get back to work... this time well out of walking distance because I've got a ride to work now... I spend all of a month there before I cant go because she can't take me. She needs me at home to help.

FINE. I'll be a stay-at-home-dad. You work. She finds a job and get's to it. The kid is almost 2 at this point. Can only say ""dada"". I start focusing on his talking. He's learning new words daily. He's walking by himself too. He's also getting a lot harder to take care of. The wife doesn't understand that though. She thinks he's got the same requirements despite eating solids, drinking from cups, and needing more space to be active. She thinks he's just as easy as he was when he was 6 months. So now when she gets home from a 4 hour shift serving food, I don't get a break... she goes and plays videogames. I haven't had more than half an hour to myself any given day since he was born, working 50-60 hour weeks in warehouses and walking 4 hours a day to get there and back... Suddenly she's overworked... somehow.... and requires several hours to unwind from a 4 hour workday.

Fast forward to recently:

She's so ""overworked"" that she quit her job. Now I'm stay-at-home-dad to the kid AND HER. My mom is paying our rent as we wait to move into a house she owns. I'm expected to find a job when we get there, but I don't know how I'm going to work and do all this shit. She plays games all day, and breastfeeds a toddler a couple of times a day and complains about it constantly. He can eat solids, and I cook for him constantly and give him snacks. Every time he wants her attention, he tries to pull her off her videogames and crawl into her lap. She groans and gets angry with me, ""why aren't you trying to entertain him?! Take him outside!"" I do... We're fighting constantly, and she defaults to self hating statements like, ""I'm a terrible parent and a terrible wife. I'm going to kill myself!"" or ""I should just leave, you two would be better off without me"" I'm so maddened by that ""better off"" comment but I try not to take the bait. Try to talk her down... She finally admits to me about two days ago ""Having him was a mistake, and I forced you into it."" I really didn't want to say I told her so, so I didn't....

What the fuck do I do? The kid needs his mother. There's a lot more to it. She CLAIMS to have PMDD, Post Partum Depression, Bipolar Disorder... she's only been diagnosed with Bipolar, and I've still never seen any papers on that.

TL;DR

31 year old dad is at the end of his rope. Wife admits kid was a mistake after pressuring me into getting her pregnant.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8ijb8y/my_wife_pressured_me_into_becoming_a_father/,relationship_advice,1545,287,0.0
Helpful_Confusion,2018-05-08 14:03:26+00:00,[34F] marrying [37F] sister-in-law,"So to start I realize my situation is just insane and not normal. Never in a million years would I have imagined ending up in this situation.


Ok backstory- I knew I was a lesbian from the moment I was old enough to have a crush lol I am lucky enough that my family were not horrid monsters or disowned me or anything but they were not accepting and saw it as a phase. I rebelled a lot growing up and the moment I could I left home and moved across the country. I still stayed in contact with my family, phone calls and holidays. My family paid for my school. I don't want it to sound awful they were just like annoying. We never saw eye to eye. My older brother was the only person in my family I was ever close to. He always supported me and was like my best friend.

Skip ahead a bit... my brother was my family's perfect son. He joined the military, met a girl, got married, moved back to our home town and had 3 kids. Every Sunday they all went to church together then had a big family dinner and lived the perfect postcard life.

And then my brother was killed in a car accident. No drunk driver or anything, just someone losing control on some ice. 

At that time my life was hell. I had been struggling with depression and had a huge very public failure in my career that I would not be recovering from. I had no money, no where to go and on top of it losing my brother and only real family I felt I had was the worst.

My sister in law and I had been fairly close before all of this. We would talk on the phone often and hang out during visits. I adored her. After this happened she suggested I move in with her and the kids and help her out with the kids and the house while she stepped up more in their business. 

My family HATED this. They wanted her to sell her home and the business and move her and the kids in with them?! But after a few months things calmed down a bit. My sister in law kept a very close relationship with my family, she felt it was important for the kids as well. I was there &amp; mostly nagged and asked when I was getting a boyfriend because my mom is seriously a sterotype lol

****

Well this relationship didn't just spark out of bonding over losing my brother or anything, it was very slow. We were like best friends and kindof did act like a little family together. She had told me she was bi and had dated girls in college. Nearly 3 years after we began a romantic relationship. At first we kept it completely secret, then once we knew it was serious we shared it with the kids who were very accepting, then our friends. But we kept it from our family. 

We have been together 7 years now!! I proposed and she said yes! 

******

The problem? 

Obviously, if you have been following along...my family did not take the news well.


They have now threatened to disown me if we go along with this and worse have threatened to try and take the kids because we have an unsafe ""incestuous"" environment... ? Her and I are not related by blood, I know it is strange but we are just two people who fell in love. We are not allowing them to see the kids now because they said awful things about us and tried to get them to say awful things.

They are also trying to go after my brother's estate and the house saying they someone have rights to it.

They have been trying to sabotage our wedding. After we sent out the RSVPS and got them back we had probably 90% of the family cancel because she talked them out of coming. We have already spent money.  

We wanted a beautiful big wedding and its ruined and I know that its just things and doesn't matter but it still hurts. I wanted that dream wedding and its gone. 

And my fiance is heart broken. She felt like they were her family and they just betrayed all of that. She wants to try and talk to them and make them see the light. But honestly idk how or if it is even possible. 



******

TLDR: my brother died leaving a wife &amp; three kids. I moved in to help. Fell in love with my sister in law. We have been in a relationship for 7 years and want to get married. Our family is acting like are blood sisters and are refusing to take part

winter_bone,2018-05-07 19:14:33+00:00,My girlfriend hates men more and more with each passing day and it's making me feel uncomfortable.,"We've been together almost two years. She's always been a feminist and I've always supported feminism, but her views have grown more aggressive and extreme in recent months.

She's been saying that she hates men, and that all men are creepy, and that straight people are boring - she's pansexual, I'm straight. She recently said that it's proof attraction and sexuality isn't a choice, because there's no way she would actively choose to be attracted to cis men.

Instead of making me feel special, it all just makes me feel sad. I've never been with someone who hates whole groups of people like that, besides very obvious and logical ones like white supremacists and rapists. It bothers me. I'd be the last person to try to defend the entire male gender - I'm not interested in taking sides in any kind of gender war. It's just the negativity and the bashing and the insults that are starting to get to me. Maybe it's illogical and weird in this day and age to be a straight man who feels a little hurt when their partner jokes that straight men are a blight upon society, but if that's the case, then I guess I'm just illogical.

Is there any way I can talk to my girlfriend about toning down the hateful language without making it sound as though I'm against feminism and defending misogynistic men?

ZipTyde97,2018-05-06 07:02:40+00:00,"My (21m) girlfriend (20f) and I are each others first and only love. She met a “friend” (25m) that showed her there’s more to life than me, then she left me.","She has never given me any reason not to trust her. We’ve been together for 4 years and we’ve been devoted to each other always. She asked me if it was alright to see a friend for lunch, I said sure, which then turned into an 8 hour thing. That night she stayed up all night talking to him on the phone right next to me. The next day she told me she was confused about her life, if she should chase after the future with me (marriage, kids, growing old together) we both dreamed about. Or go after the unknown, where anything could happen. 
She told me it’s not a decision of me or him, but a decision on if she should hold onto her past, or be open to whatever future.

I’m not coping well with all of this. She’s told me multiple times she hasn’t made a decision, but She still wants me in her life as just a friend. I told her if she’s not making a decision she can’t have it both ways, so I walked away, she wants me back, but still as just a friend. They talk and see each other every single day now.

She doesn’t really have any other close friends she can talk to about this, and when she talks to her own family all they care about is that this guy is the same race (I’m white, they’re both Asian), he has money, and he’s a few years older.

I don’t know what to do, or if this is even worth fighting for anymore. I’ve been with 2 others before her (both for a year), but she’s the only one I’ve truly had a connection with.

However, the days leading up to get birthday she wad adamant about not going anywhere. I kept saying that I wanted to take her out and she kept saying it was a waste of money. I wanted to take her out to a play or a nice restaurant.

On the day of het birthday I asked her to wait for me after work so I can take her somewhere but she said no and not to worry about it. I wanted to do SOMETHING so I went to her favorite restaurant and got her favorite meal for dinner and I bought her a Kindle as an early birthday present. We had a nice night but eventually she basically said while she appreciated everything I did, she wished I did something more meaningful. I felt pretty bad and seeing my hurt upset her and she went to bed really early last night. 

This morning she told me I should have known better and that she would have went out if I set something up. I was upset and called her childish for not being straightforward expecting me to be a mind reader. Maybe I was wrong for saying those things but I was upset. Now I feel bad. She looked sad and isn't talking to me.

makeshift01,2018-04-25 12:50:56+00:00,Wife found sex toy and now she treats me badly. Stopped saying “I love you” and is distant.,"Ok so, yesterday my wife found my Fleshlight. I wasn’t trying to hide it either, but because we have children, I needed to put it somewhere that’s not easily accessible. (We both have sex toys, so I just want to throw that out there. “). Anyways, she found my new fleshlight and basically got pissed at me for getting another (this is my second one I bought in the last couple years). I bought it because she no longer has a sex drive and is constantly turning me down for sex. It really wears on you to be turned down for sex ALL. THE. TIME. We’re not in a sexless relationship, but we are gradually heading in that direction. We will have sex around 3 times a month, on a good month. And before everyone says I need to start doing more around the house and more responsibilities with our children, I do. I basically take care of 80%-90% of the household chores and more than half with the kids. My wife and I also work full time jobs and I’m just as tired as she is at the end of the day. I’m probably a bit more tired than her because I do all the cooking/cleaning and walking the dogs while she gets to relax at the end of each day. One major contributor to her dead libido is her drinking. She passes out drunk 5 nights a week. This is starting to become an issue and she knows it. 

So basically, here I am, wondering if I am in the wrong. I knew I should have told her I bought a new sex toy, but, honestly, I didn’t want her to give me crap for it. She acknowledges she has been declining sex in our relationship for the last couple years, but does absolutely nothing to fix the issue. She refuses to see a doctor. She refuses to cut back on her alcohol intake. Anyways, thanks for reading. I just felt I needed to vent here.

BillNyes-InnerThigh,2018-04-24 13:51:58+00:00,[Update 3] My wife named our son after her first love and I had no idea.,"So I want to start out by saying think you for all the support. Most of you guys have been great with the exception of a few trolls calling me a cuck. 

So I came home the next day after staying the night else where. She didn't really say much to me other then hey and went back to messing around on her laptop. I went up stairs and put my things in the guest room and layed down to take a nap because I didn't get much sleep the night before. She came in and asked what I was doing and I told her that until she's ready to sit down and have a adult conversation about the name that I would be sleeping in here. She rolled her eyes and said that she thought I had got over and asked why I even bothered to come home if I was going to act like this. I told her because it is my home and I'm not going to miss out on time with my son just because you don't have the ability to tell right from wrong or atleast admit it. She stormed off and that was that for that day. 

The next day she I came home from work and she was on the couch waiting for me.  She asked what it was going to take for us to get back to normal. I told her that we would need to see a marriage counciler first off and consider changing our son's name to his middle name. The look of rage on her face when I said that last part was something I don't think I've ever seen before. I hate to say it but it mad me a little happy to see it. She told me to go fuck myself and that was never going to happen and stormed off. We didn't talk the rest of that day.

The next day rolled around and my wife hadn't gotten home from work. Someone started knocking on the door and it was her parents. They said we need to talk so I invited them in we sat down. They said they know what she did was wrong and they always knew and so did her whole family and all her friends. They apologized to me for keeping it a secret and said that they agree with counseling and they would be happy to pay for it but changing his name is going to far. I told them thank you and that I haven't made that decision with out a lot of consideration. I told them that you really don't know what you would do till you're in this situation. After a little more talking they left and asked me not to tell my wife they stopped by. I agreed. Shortly after they left I called around and found a counciler and made appointment that worked with both our work schedules. 

When my wife came her I told her about the appointment and she just walked off not saying a word. Our appointment is Thursday and I'm still sleeping in the guest room. That's what's been going on so far.

I posted this a few days ago on another sub for advice, I didn't really get a solid answer, I was also hoping someone of middle eastern descent had any insight.


I met Jasmine at orientation at the beginning of our 1st semester here at school. Even though she wore a headscarf(hijab) she is the most beautiful girl i had ever seen. Also, Jasmine had an amazing body.

At 1st I never planned on trying anything with her, as I know that middle eastern girls don't really date guys like me. And my roommate quickly reminded me of that fact when I told him about her. Turns out we had a class together.

We started to talk a bit in class, and I found out her name, and she wants to be a doctor(I want to be a cartoonist), and she moved to America when she was 3 years old. We ended up talking a lot, and she gave me her number. We would spend hours talking on the phone sometimes. Jasmine would lament to me about how traditional her parents were. I wanted to date her, but she said that her parents would never approve, I was haram(bad?), there plan for her was for her to marry a doctor, also from Iran. 

We kept on this was for a few weeks, until one night I told Jasmine that I was in love with her. I never felt that way about anyone, and knowing that we could never be together was just too painful, and I had to stop. She said that she was in love with me also. She didn't want to lose me. Jasmine said that we could be together, we just had to keep it a secret. She couldn't tell her friends, her family, anyone. 

So for the last 4 months, Jasmine and I have been dating in secret. Her friends figured out that she has a secret boyfriend, but they don't know who it is. My roommate knows though, because a couple of times, Jasmine has slept over, while pretending to be at a friend's house.

This morning Jasmine texted me, hysterical. She said that she is pregnant. She took 4 different pregnancy tests and they all say the same thing. She thought that she was gaining a little bit of weight, but her little sister joked that she looked pregnant, so that made her paranoid and she took the tests.

We talked this morning, and Jasmine is really freaking out. She thinks that her life is over. She says that her parents will send her away and I will never see her again. She is really afraid of what will happen. 

We have been sleeping together for a couple of months now, but we always use protection. There was only one time, where I didn't have a condom. I had to use the one that has been in my wallet since age 15. It's an old magnum condom. Golden wrapper, when I took it out it was gone dry, the lubrication had dried out years ago probably. I thought that it was still ok, even though it was dry and a bit over large. I guess I was wrong.

I am not sure what to do about Jasmine and the baby. Her parents sound scary. Like they could harm her and the baby. The last thing I want to happen is that. I don't know if I should be the person to bring up abortion because she hasn't said it. There is also my family, we told my mom the other day. Needless to say, she was not happy. I got the lecture about responsibility and being a man.

 My mom says that we should keep the baby, and that if her parents are a problem Jasmine and I should move home to South Carolina, and she will take care of everything. She was 16 when she got pregnant with my older brother, and my dad ditched her before I was born. I am the 1st person in my entire family to go to college.

Help me Reddit, what do I do? What can I do to help Jasmine. What advice can I give Her?

**TL;DR** My secret girlfriend got pregnant. She is Muslim, and I am black. I am also poorish. And she is studying to be a doctor.

Sorry if this is jumbled. I’m still a little shook. 

So as those of you who read my original post know, “Sarah” was supposed to mean my girlfriend for lunch on Thursday and my girlfriend was gonna bring up what we saw at dinner and ask her if everything was okay. 

Well as I’m getting ready for work this morning, Sarah calls my girlfriend crying and says that my brother found a text she has sent my girlfriend about whether they are still on for lunch on Thursday. Well my brother freaked out and started yelling that she was going behind is back and was she even really going to meet my girlfriend or was she cheating on him. He then hit her. Hard. She left and got in the car before he could stop her. 

She asked if she could come to my place and I of course said yes. 

When she got here she was hysterical and had an obvious mark on her face. My brother pulled up in a taxi not long after. 

He came up to the house and I told him to get the fuck out of my house before I called the cops. He told me to fuck off and mind my own business and tried to grab Sarah. I got in his way before he could drag her out and he punched me. 

We started to fight and he managed to get me on the ground and started punching me. My girlfriend called the cops and they had to pull my brother off of me. He was arrested and paramedics treated me there. 

With the testimony of all three of us and he marks on me and Sarah, he is being charged with assault. 

His arraignment is next month. 

I’m devastated. He has turned into our dad, an abusive pos. I wish I had done more earlier. 

Even if he doesn’t go to prison, we’ll never be close again and not to mention Sarah and her trauma and any future partners my brother may have. 

I just wanted to update you all as this is the first moment today I’ve had to process this and I just needed to tell someone. 

I guess we’ll see what happens next depending on what happens to my brother.

fleets2705,2018-04-08 20:31:21+00:00,[29/F] Found my boyfriend [30/M] of almost 7 years on tinder last night...what do I do?,"I'll try to be as concise as possible...

We've been together almost 7 years (we're 30). Boyfriend has been going through a rough time...newly diagnosed anxiety, etc. This has led him to not be as on top of things as he usually is, i.e. bills, so I'm picking up the slack.

He travels for work almost every weekend. Last night, I logged onto his bank because I'm paying bills. I see charges from ""tinder"". He's in Vegas for work. We live in LA.

I make a tinder with a picture of a cute brunette that isn't me. Not shitting you, it takes me 3 swipes before I see his picture. We match within minutes. He chats me, and I keep the conversation going. We talked for about an hour, he did ask ""Jessica"" if she wanted to meet up on the strip with a friend of his and himself. ""Jessica"" didn't want to...boyfriend ends up going home. Oh, he also calls me (actual me) during the middle of this.

I know he went back to his work condo with his co-worker. I know he didn't physically cheat on me last night. I kept the ""Jessica"" convo going with him because I thought if I kept chatting, I could stop him from talking to other matches and in some weird way have some control in a situation that I felt so helpless in. And as I'm reflecting today, it hurts even more to see how he was flirty and fun with ""Jessica"", and at home, he's not. I don't know if he's bored. I don't know if this is his first time using the app (my gut says yes).

My gut also tells me he's going to say he made the account because he was trying to help his shy co-worker meet girls.

Can anyone relate to this or help me figure out how to approach this super fun conversation we're going to have later tonight without going bat shit crazy? NOTE: As of this posting, he has no clue that I know about any of this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8assg9/29f_found_my_boyfriend_30m_of_almost_7_years_on/,relationship_advice,1494,419,0.0
daviddm23,2018-04-03 18:17:53+00:00,I [33/M] cancelled my wedding and ended up breaking up with [31/F] fiancee because of her parents,"Hi All,

Where to start....wow.  I've been with my fiancee for 4 years, and we've been living together for the last 2 years in a house that we bought together.  We were suppose to get married this July but we had a situation where her parents just turned on me.

It all started when my fiancee and her mom went to take a look at her wedding dress, as they were in the car, her mom would constantly asking her how much we were paying for makeup artist/dress/photographer/restaurant/and our spending budget for the wedding.  My fiancee gave her all the details, her mom did not take it well that we're spending about $22k on our wedding.  Note the fact that we did not ask them for any sort of financial support or giving us any sort of big gifts for our wedding.  That night her mom talk to her dad about how unhappy she was after finding out about our wedding budget, he ask my fiancee to call me over to talk about our finances.  When i receive my fiancee telephone call, I was not happy to know that her in-law wanted to butt into our business but I am respectful of them as my future in-laws so I agree to meet.

When arrive at her parents, just getting off of work, they were telling me how I'm being so wasteful using $$$ on good photographer and why we had to invited so many guess (about 190), and that we should consider invited just family and that's it.  Then he went on about why my fiancee is paying 60% of the budget and that typically it should be split.  I politely/calmly listened, even though, I was steaming inside to think that her parents have the nerve to say all of that.  So, after they were done talking, I responded.  ""First and far most, I know that you are concern for your daughter and my financial well being and you have our best interest in mind but this is a budget that we've work/talk/discuss/and agree upon between me and your daughter.  We are not asking you for any financial backing or gifts, we just wanted you to attend the wedding carefree, and be part of our special day.  Again, please understand that this is our wedding and this is what she wanted and if she not please with what we've agree on then we can make changes but this is still between me and her.  While we value your opinion, this our decision and we'll discuss this as a couple and you should not get involved.  As for why she's paying 60% of the budget is because I'm paying the mortgage to our house and have been handling all the maintenance cost to bring our house to living condition, so I won't have the ability to cover anymore than that, while her role in our relationship is to buy food and pay for water/electric bill.  So, she should be able to save more then I can.  Also, we're living together already and already have shared everything (except of joint bank account), any gifts whether it's cash or items from our wedding belong to the both of us, so it doesn't really matter who pays more or less.  We both discuss and have agreed, so now that your trying to jump in and control our finances is not right.  And I am not please that you are second guessing our decision as if this is your wedding.""  Please note, I responded in low toned and calm voice.


Her parents started to bash my family and how I have to somewhat support my dad who is 86 years old and that spending all of this money is irresponsible.  I let her parents finish, then told them that they cannot bring my family into this because it is not right as we are not asking any/or either side of our families for financial support.  We bought our house and been living independently for the last 2 years and feel like they are so perssessive of my fiancee and her financial that they are going crazy.  While all of this is happening, my fiancee is just sitting there and not saying anything, which made me kind of sad/disappointed because I would expect her to defend our decision or at least speak up on our/or my behalf because her parents had no right. Also, her parents does not want her to have a join bank account with me and that they feel she should have control of her own $$$.  After that I just stop talking and told them that if they feel like they are not happy about the budget, me and her will go over it and if she is unhappy with some of the stuff that we chose, we can make changes, if needed.  And her mom and dad were taking turn making these demands, it was no longer ""suggesting"" or ""we should do this"", it was more like I want less people and I want you to put out more.   

We went home and we went over the budget again, she made some changes and we agreed on it.  Then she turn to me and said, ""do you understand what my parents were trying to get through to you."" I said, ""no, not really, and it's not right for them to be butting in our business, we're adults, we should be able to make our own decision.""  I then told her that ""hey, if the future if we have any sort of major issues, decisions, and anything related to finances that we should discuss them privately in our household and not let her parents intervene.""  She looked at me in disgust and said that she don't care what I want and that she will tell and discuss anything with her parents that she pleases.  I told her to she shouldn't do that because we are a separated family and we should be making and owning our decisions and not letting anyone dictate or questioned it, it should be between us only.  She disagreed, then I just lost it, and I told her that if this is how it is going forward, I cannot build any sort of family with her since she's okay with her parents running her life.  I'm not telling her not to shared/talk to her parents but there are some things you as a couple want to discuss and keep private.  Also, if a sensitive topic is shared then the communication should be between her and her parents, if they want to give inputs, then she can come home and we can talk about.  But for her parents to flat out and jump in as if it's their business, I just don't feel it's right.  So, I called off the wedding the next day, and ended our relationship 2 days after that.  Of course, she begged and cried for me to reconsider but it's something I cannot live by.  


I am sadden by this event and how our relationship ended but I can't imagine being suffocated by her parents, questioning ours decisions and running our lives.  Also, I put so much into this relationship, trying to set a good foundation to build family but this just wasn't gonna work with the way things are.  Please know that I'm a good guy and was raised with good values I gotten from my parents, I don't have any sort of addiction/gambling/alcohol/or any issues.  I was raised to know what a man role is in a family and I live by it.  I also feel hurt because if your the man of your household, you need your wife support whether right or wrong, she should always support him regardless and I do the same for her but in this situation, I felt alone as if I was the only one fighting for us and our family that we're trying to build (hope you know what I mean when I say this).


Just came on here for some moral support, your inputs are greatly appreciated.

Update:  Also, since the breakup, we've sat down multiple times the past week and went over what had happened, she thinks this is not anything big to end our relationship over and think that I was actually being rude to her parents. My response ""speechless"", I didn't say anything else after that and just listened most of the time when we had a conversation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/89grqj/i_33m_cancelled_my_wedding_and_ended_up_breaking/,relationship_advice,1211,336,2.0
feelin_leftout,2018-03-31 14:56:16+00:00,My friends didn't invite me to their wedding then made me the bad guy,"**EDIT:** Update at the bottom!  (Another update will come tonight after Tracey calls me when she gets out of work)

**EDIT TWO:** FINAL UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM.

Sorry for the long story, I added a tl;dr. I'm definitely looking for advice but it comes with a backstory:

A friend (Greg-28) in my circle of friends met (Shannon-28) about 5 years ago and they immediately hit it off. Everybody instantly fell in love with Shannon because she's friendly and really fun to hang out with. They were everybody's favorite couple and really made our hang-outs much more fun. We all knew they were perfect for each other. They both made our crew that much better.

The engagement was expected but much welcome news. Our friends circle was buzzing about the inevitable wedding. Then the invitations went out.

You know those ""save the date"" magnets that people send out? Well it really sucked seeing them on everybody else's fridge when I visited friends knowing I didn't get one and wasn't invited. Feeling left out really sucks. But it gets worse.

I completely understand how stressful wedding planning is and I believe nobody should feel that they have to invite people they don't want to their wedding. It's their day and their ceremony and they shouldn't have to have people there who they don't want there. I didn't cause a fuss or express to anyone that I was hurt that I felt excluded from the wedding and by extension, excluded from the group. I didn't want to be looked on in an even worse way that I feel I was apparently being looked at. But one friend actually stood up for me.

When their wedding came up in conversation and people talked about booking flights and rooms (destination wedding in New York City) eventually I was asked if I booked yet. I said, ""We (me and my girlfriend) weren't invited."" Nobody could believe it but I insisted that I wasn't upset because I know how situations like this can go. I didn't want to cause trouble because then the happy couple might resent me. Then I'd be the bad guy.

I heard through other friends that my friend Tracey thought it was really messed up that I wasn't invited. She and I never spoke of how I wasn't invited to the wedding but she really felt a certain way about it. So a month before the destination wedding I got a text from Greg basically saying sorry for forgetting to send an invite but that they would love to have us come to the wedding. It was way too late at that point for me. 

I couldn't get away from my job and I didn't have a chance to put money aside for a year for an expensive NYC destination wedding like everyone else did. I didn't even get a Save the Date. Every flight and hotel (no rooms where everyone ELSE was staying, obviously. Too late for that) was unaffordable for me. I texted him back that I couldn't make it.

The wedding came and went and I felt bad about everything. I saw the Facebook pictures of my friends all having the time of their lives. It looked like a great wedding. There's even a picture of just the group of friends labeled ""the crew"". I don't think I've ever felt so left out, honestly. It really made me feel worthless and unwanted.

So naturally the typical thoughts surfaced. ""They don't like you. They think you're annoying. They think you're an asshole. If you can't identify the schmuck in a group of friends, that means you're it. They think you try way to hard to be nice and think you're a phony.""

Then as if it couldn't get any worse, Shannon messaged me on Facebook asking why I didn't RSVP and said they missed me at the wedding? RSVP? **RSVP?** Doesn't one have to be *invited* in order to RSVP? Everybody got a year to prepare between getting Save the Dates and *actual* wedding invitations. I got a text message a month before the wedding! Just as I feared, I'm being made out to be the bad guy and I even made a point to keep my feelings to myself and play it cool. 

But as usual I didn't say this to her because I know how I would end up looking. I actually apologised for... I don't even know... but I made a point to mention how I spoke with Greg about it. I also made sure to compliment the wedding pictures and say it looked like fun. I did everything I could in that conversation to make it easier on her and of course now I feel like a total schmuck.

That was this past Summer and I haven't seen them since. I feel like that's it for me in the group now. I see some of the friends in our group every now and then but everything feels different now. None of them even responded to my birthday party Facebook invite this month. I feel like things are being said behind the scenes and I feel completely out of the loop. It felt like a passive aggressive message that maybe Greg and Shannon never actually liked me. My fiance gets along great with Shannon and she's just confused. Seeing her confusion just makes my heart break even more because she's a sweetheart who's never offended anybody in her life. I wish I could break it to her that I'm just the guy in the group that Greg and Shannon think sucks but I don't know how and I feel like a complete loser who deserves this.

I'll always appreciate Tracey for sticking up for me. She may never know how awesome it feels hearing about how she told everybody it was messed up that I was left out. I haven't even spoken to her about how the whole thing made me feel (or ANYBODY for that matter, Reddit you are the first to hear about it) because I didn't want it to appear like I am making a stink and become even more disliked. 

This whole thing just fucking sucks. I feel like I don't have friends anymore. And to make it worse, soon I'll have a wedding of my own and I'm afraid I won't have any friends there (except for Tracey, of course). How am I supposed to handle who I invite so it doesn't seem like I'm leaving people out for petty revenge? How the hell do I navigate a toxic situation that I had no hand in creating? I still feel like I'm in the dark or could be over-reacting. What the hell????

tl;dr: Friends forgot or chose not to invite me to their wedding. After a friend stuck up for me I was invited via text message (with little notice), had to decline, then asked why I didn't RSVP and that I was ""missed"". Soon I'll have my own wedding to plan and don't feel like I have any friends to invite/don't know if I should invite certain people/don't know how to even approach the situation I didn't create.


**UPDATE**. I half took everyone's advice and brought it up with Tracey. She just confirmed that Shannon was full of shit when she asked me why she didn't get my RSVP and wanted to absolve herself of guilt. I'm not sure if they forgot or if I just wasn't invited yet but Tracey said we'd talk about it more tonight when she gets out of work. 

**Final update:**

 I spoke about it in depth with Tracey. It turns out Greg's best man(someone who was never in ""the gang"" but grew up with Greg) always hated me and Greg thinks I'm annoying. Shannon later felt bad they chose not to invite me and pressured him to invite me over text knowing I wouldn't be able to make it. Also it wasn't only Tracey who thought it was wrong that I didn't get an invite and the ""chatter"" is what made Shannon ask me why I didn't RSVP (to make it seem like my invite was lost in the mail).

It feels better knowing this because, like I said, they don't have to have people they don't want at their wedding. But knowing Greg doesn't like me fucking hurts because I always thought we were friends. Turns out *he's* the phony. Unfortunately everybody else (except for Tracey and a few others) like Greg more than me so they kinda felt like they had to choose a side after Tracey (and a few ot hers, it turns out) brought up why I didn't get invited. Lots of people feeling guilty about this, apparently. They still felt like they had to ""choose a side"" for whatever reason. Probably because most of them went to high school with Greg. 

Oh well. That's life. Thanks for the advice about being more assertive. Those of you polite about it were very helpful. Thanks.

Throw_me_away8273,2018-03-29 13:05:18+00:00,"[M/30] My ""religious"" [F/28] wife is cheating on me, 6 months after our wedding","Hi All,

Well I'm in a pretty dark place right now.

Together 3 years, married 9 months ago.

When i was dating my wife then girlfriend, she wouldn't live with me because her catholic faith doesn't allow it. Sexual encounters were also very rare (I was her first). I swallowed it all and fastforward 2 years and we got married, she came to live with me and everything was good.

But it wasn't.

She told me a couple months ago (crying) that she was kissing (only kissing?) with a colleague of hers. I know the guy and TBH we are very alike (both lawyers-different specializations, both tall, both athletic, good families) its just I'm not so irresponsible as him. I dont like to party too much, i dont drink to blackout, I'm not going for sports events. And maybe I'm not as good as a lawyer as him (in the long run).

She says that she is attracted to him because ~~I dont fulfill her sexual needs~~ *She is too used to me, and the sex is boring* (I try everything but since the wedding shes unable to have any orgasm)  and he party much more than me and hes more like her.

FFS, what should I do? Should I file for divorce? Should I change who I am to please her more? Should I beat the guy to a red pulpe? But honestly it has been going 4 months strong already, when she's going at his volleyball training they end up kissing. 

Her faith is so BS. I know im not perfect but fuck me if im not a good husband. Financially I make twice as much as him and i take care of everything.

Thank God we dont have children. And yes, i have recorder her saying she is having an affair.

EDIT: Just to add salt to injury we barely have any common hobby since she moved on to live with me. She doesnt have any hobbies tbh. Shes only work, volleyball, sleep, money(saving) and facebook. She wont watch a movie with me nor a tv show. Gaming I can forget, IT/tech stuff also. Any geek stuff she doesnt understand. 

We have joint property over our salaries but the money she earned before taking the vows she doesnt want to add to our account as its hers (legally yes but fml, I paid for the renovation of the house, the wedding, all the trips from my own private pocket) and shes constantly telling me she needs her own place if we get a fight for her to move there. But to buy one she first needs a estate separation for the flat not becoming mine in 50% also.

EDIT2: I cant just leave the house i was living in before we got married and I cant throw her away because I still have feelings for her. But there are days I just want to say FU, ghosting and jump towns.

EDIT3: Thank you all for your comment :) It is really heartwarming! At the moment I am thinking about a sex/marriage counselor 

EDIT4: She told me a couple months after the marriage that every morning she's waking up terrified that she took the vows and now it's ""the end"". She's also showing me that she is very miserable and unhappy. BUT FFS WHY DID YOU MARRIED ME?! YOU JUST HAD TO TELL ME ""CAN WE WAIT ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO?!"" I would have said yes.

EDIT5: Just asked if she could give me her smartphone to check. She refused stating that it is her propriety and she doesn't like to be attacked. Then she compared me to her ex who ""was paranoid"". Normally we dont check our smartphones but I wanted to see if she would give it to me without deleting anything.

FigetAboutIt,2018-03-26 04:08:40+00:00,Do you spend every day with your SO and feel like you are more like roommates instead of each others sexy other half?,"I want to put some love advice out here for everyone who walks in similar shoes to mine. My background. My boyfriend (M27) and I (F26) have been together for six years and living together for five and a half years. We spend more time together than doing anything else or hanging out with anyone else. We are the best of friends talking for hours, or just doing nothing together. We hit a LARGE lull in the romancey sexy time department and we live like roommates who just sleep in the same bed, with different sleep schedules.
No sexy time makes a strain on a relationship, you both start to second guess your worth to each other on some level. He was unsatisfied with his dead end job, and I deal with severe depression and anxiety. He ended up getting a job where he is gone for the week and comes home for the weekend.

Anyway to the advice. 

This separation is awful, but also a blessing. I missed him so much I looked for anything and everything to do at the home as a gesture to say, ""I did this for you."" But most importantly, when I knew he was coming home, I took a lesson from the ""Princess Diaries"" and cast a spell of beauty on myself. I planned a full day of pampering for myself; things I do when I want to feel better when I am sad. I felt pretty and sexy;  confidence, the girl had. And when he opened that door I treated him like a war hero. No nags, no honey do list, just raw love. In return he told me he missed me but was tired ( and we were about to go back into our old  routine), but I told him, ""I know you are tired but let me at least show you how much I have missed you. I really want you to know."" I insisted and we had a passion filled weekend.

If you are a similar couple that spends everyday together with little to no separation, you fall into a super comfortable zone of unflattering clothes and static evenings of Netflix or games.  Take a trip to go see family without your SO so you realize how much you miss that person's smell and feel next to you. You ignite that desire and passion that has been dormant for this person you love.

Or if traveling isn't an option, you have the work day off but your SO does not. Beauty spell yourself, dress sexy just for your SO and tell them how much you have been thinking about them when they walk through the door. No texting them during the day, that ruins it.

Be genuine, be raw, be playful. 

I hope my experience and advice help.

First off, thank you to everyone for their kind words, stories and opinions! I am honestly speechless, you have all been wonderful!

I broke things off with him shortly after posting to this thread. I actually took a screenshot of the post on my phone and sent it to him with the caption ""bye"". I then deleted him off all of my social media and blocked his number from my phone. I have 0 intention on contacting him ever again. He doesn't deserve a chance to explain himself. A picture is worth a thousand words and there were five of them.

I messaged the woman who posted the photos in question on Facebook. I told her that the guy she was seeing was my ex and that he cheated on me with her. I told her that I in no way, shape, or form blame her for the cheating, since I doubted that she knew about me. I told her that my message was sent in peace and that if she choose to continue seeing him, I would not interfere. I thought she had the right to know his true colours.

The woman messaged me back and profusely apologized. She deleted the post and swiftly broke up with him as well. I have since learned, with her help, that he had been sleeping with various women since he was posted to Petawawa. So he's been cheating on me for at least two months. The woman and I are now friends.

I have no interest in dating right now, but I figure that I will give it another go in September, when I start my masters degree. I'm pumping the breaks on LDRs.

To the military men of Reddit: I will not count out dating a military man in the future just because one of you happened to be a rotten apple. I thank all of you (and the military women!) for your service and I hope that you find and SO worthy of your time.

A couple of people have chosen to bring up a previous post I made about not contacting your SO everyday. I 100% stand by my post and what I said. There needs to be some level of trust between you and your SO. If you prefer texting everyday, that's fine. If you're not a big texter, that's fine too! To each their own.

Again, thank you for everyone who cared to comment! You are all lovely people :)

Hello everyone, 
I was encouraged by many to make an update, and I have one for you. Brace yourself. This is going to be a long one. 

First I must point out, I was not expecting the amount of responses I received, and I appreciate everyone who shared their honest, transparent and even vulnerable input. It was overwhelming, but in the best of ways. 

As for my response to all of this, I felt my feelings and fears were validated. I felt I had a right to voice my hurts, but for real this time. I was determined not to accept the defensive, “Why are we talking about this again? What’s happened? I thought you were over it?” responses I kept getting. 

My husband and I talked. I laid it all out there. I honestly thought and carefully prepared myself for a mutual separation. I thought he was as done as I was. That was not the case. I do not know how to relay other reasons for my actions without giving some more background to the situation, why I reached a breaking point, and sought the advice of strangers. I find myself asking why I’m doing this, but this is a place for relationship advice, and I feel my experience could help others. So here we go.

In December my mother attempted suicide. She has battled mental illness for the majority of her life. It took a toll on my family. A lot happened the days following. She survived, but it is still a delicate situation. During this, my husband was there, but wasn’t “there.” During one of the hardest moments of my life, cleaning my mom’s vomit off her bed, washing her sheets, while she’s breathing on a ventilator, praying she wakes up...I felt alone. 

My husband and I had been through our own tough situations, but this event was shattering for me. I needed him, more than I ever had. And I don’t think he didn’t want to be there for me, I just don’t think he knew how. I had a little break down, about a month ago. I told him, “I just need someone to hold me and tell me everything is going to be okay.” He just sat there. Wouldn’t even look at me. 

I brought up my feelings in this situation to him, asked how he could just play Xbox while I balled my eyes out in the bathroom, after screaming at God in the car on my way home. My face a wreck, makeup running. He says, “I thought you were just working through it.” 

I get that, sure, maybe some people do. I have before. I’m capable. I’m doing it now. But when you have a significant other...I guess I expected empathy, sympathy, anything. I would much rather cry alone, then cry more wondering why I am doing it alone. 

Back to my update, we had a long talk. I shared those thoughts and then some. He left at my request. He showed up the next day, telling me how hard this was for him. I asked him to give me space, and he respected it. That evening he asks to talk. Says he went to the park where we had our first date. Thought about what went wrong. He said he felt he had to be this “adult” for me, so much so, he forgot how to just love me. He wrote me a note, “I still love you, I just forgot how to show it.” He told me all the things he loved about me. Things I had never known, or heard him say in our eight year relationship (six married). He sent me flowers. Found more on my car this morning. 

The day after he left, I went to the doctor. I hadn’t had an appetite in a week, and hadn’t eaten in a few days. I was waking up every other hour, and felt terrible. I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder. They gave me meds. I haven’t taken them. Right now, I’m just working on getting on a routine. I may introduce medication later. But for now, I know what I’m dealing with, and don’t want to throw another variable in the equation. I’m sharing this, because it further ratified my decision to ask him to leave. I am a wreck. I can acknowledge that now. And I don’t know how to try and work on a relationship, while trying to pull myself together at the same time.

With that being said, we are still separated. It has been about two weeks now. And to be honest, I don’t miss him like I think I would if it was meant to work out. Maybe it will hit me later? Is two weeks really long enough to process it? I don’t know. Probably not. But for now, I’m happy. I’m doing yoga again in the mornings. I’m walking the dog by myself. I’m buying my groceries alone, and there’s more room in the bed at night. 

I think I held on as long as I could, but somewhere down the road, I gave up. I don’t know the day, or the moment. But I think my heart gave out before my head. Once my mind justified it, I couldn’t help it. I am alone, but I am happy. 

I told him, during our initial talk, that it has been especially hard for me because I have been in relationships, where I didn’t have to ask someone to hold me while I cried and tell me it’s going to be okay, where they knew to take my hand when I was hurting, whistle at me if you think I look good, send me a song that makes you think of me, sleep with me for god’s sake…

I have never tried to compare him to other people. I don’t believe that’s fair. But when you’ve been treated better, and you know it’s possible to be understood by someone else, and not fight for empathy on any level, it’s hard to settle without it. 


“You’re not happy either, XXXXX. And I believe there is someone else out there who can love you, and understand how to show it better than I. Someone who appreciates the things you do, the gifts you buy. I’m not that person. And you deserve to be happy, too.” 

Those were and still are my honest words to him, and anyone else who feels like they’re fighting to be loved. It’s not worth it, with as many people as there are in the world, you can find someone who understands you, who loves your quirks, your habits. Who appreciates how you show love, and can reciprocate it. There are too many people in the world to settle. I have found it before, and I can find it again. So can you. 

Thank you for going on this journey with me. 
It isn’t over, but I am more optimistic about the future than I have been in a long time.

since-the-first-day,2018-03-11 19:02:53+00:00,I have been dating my cousin without knowing she is my cousin and I don’t know what to do?,"Alright my repution is hurting and everybody is clowning on me right now. I am 17 and my cousin Brianna is a month older so she’s also 17. I need to give background on how this happened. We were dating for a year. So my mother divorced my biological father when I was born because he was having like 3 affairs (holy shit). She raised me as a single mother up until I was like 3 years old and she met my stepdad Chris. I am really cool with him and I can trust him just like if he was my dad. My mom cut off absolutely all contact with every family member from my biological’s father side. 

I grew up not really trying to meet my real father since chris is basically my dad he raised me. My real father tried getting in contact with me over the tears but that was forbidden. Okay I was scrolling through facebook and I got a friend request from a random woman and I had only 1 mutual friend with her, which was an uncle from my mom’s family. I inspected her profile and it was a real person’s profile. I met Brianna one day I went to the movies with my friends and there was a group of girls in the same theatre. 

As a teenager obviously I went to go flirt and I ended up getting one of the girl’s number which was Brianna’s. I started going on dates with her for a while and the relationship was getting really serious and comitted. She finally invited me to meet her mother (her father passed away) and it was the same woman from facebook but since I’m inactive on facebook I didn’t notice it was her. I only greeted her and told her I would be taking her daughter with me on a small trip with some friends (I didn’t have a full on convo with her).

We came back, (3 day trip camping at te closest mountain range) I dropped her off, only waved goodbye to her mother and got home. My mom was looking through my FB so she was basically facebook stalking me. She called me over to her room in a pretty upset voice. She showed me the woman’s profile on her phone and I was asking what was the problem. She said that was an aunt from my real father’s side and she told me she wanted to block her. Looking at the picture of the woman, holy shit, that’s my girlfriend’s mom.

I’m shook. I kind of didn’t believe her and thought it was a joke so I went to my girlfriend’s house and see what was going on. I talked to her mom asking about facebook and how she had me as a friend. I had no profile picture of myself just of my truck and my family as my cover photo. I asked her why she had added me and she had a sick look on her face. She threw up in the trash can and she said I was her brother’s son (her nephew). We had to tell Brianna about it and she was upset with her family and she was sad because a whole year together we were basically in love

TL;DR I do not know what to do in this situation because I love her, but she is my cousin, I don’t know

Edit : we are staying together. We love each other too much, after we graduate we are moving into an apartment together (we graduate in 3 months she is turning 18 next month I turn 18 in 2 months.). We are going to stay together in an apartment while we go to college we are going to same university since it has majors and certificates for many different departments.

reladvthrowaway3,2018-03-08 04:17:34+00:00,I'm [26M] wheelchair bound and my girlfriend [25F] brought me to the casino for my birthday. She's demanding half of my winnings; what do I do?,"I was in a motorcycle accident last year and still wheelchair bound. Hopefully by end of year I'll be out of it. My girlfriend of six years for my birthday brought me to the casino as I never went before, and being unable to drive meant I needed a way to get there. She has an (alleged) distaste for gambling so she wanted nothing of it. Just drop off, I met a couple friends, and spent a couple of hours doing slots.

I ended up leaving with around CAD$3500 more than I came in with. I told my girlfriend and she flat out said I need to give her half because she drove me, and since we've been together for so long, it should be 50/50 split in any case. I wanted to use these to pay off the final remainder of my school loans with some leftover to treat her for a nice dinner and maybe a new piece of furniture.

The short of it is she refused to pick me up and we had a huge fight. It's been a few hours now and it hasn't really calmed down. She's not home (I own the house completely) and won't respond to texts.

On one hand, I feel guilty she got so angry but I also think this is pretty stupid and telling of her character. I think I'm done. I'm not in the wrong, right? We don't share our finances, and in most respects, she's more well off than I. I inherited this house but otherwise work. My girlfriend gets a trust every month and ultimately makes more than I do.

tl;dr: I won $3500 at the casino. Girlfriend demands half of it. Am I obliged to put up with it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/82urpg/im_26m_wheelchair_bound_and_my_girlfriend_25f/,relationship_advice,2064,465,0.0
OtherwiseCarrot,2018-03-05 17:43:43+00:00,My[28M] wife[26F] got tested for STDs the same afternoon that she returned from an 8-week long business trip. Used a solo shopping trip to conceal the appointment.,"tl;dr SO secretly got tested for STDs the day she returned from a long business trip; is clean, but concealed the appointment and intentionally hid/deleted any evidence of testing. SO has been disinterested in any sexual contact for two weeks since her return. I found out about the test but haven’t spoken to her about it. What is the best way to broach the topic? 



Throwaway for reasons. My wife is a great person and we have always gotten along. We have been married for almost two years and we’ve been together for four and a half years. We are in a monogamous relationship and have both had several partners prior to our relationship. Every year, my wife goes on a long business trip (typically about two months). During this time, communication over phone and email can be difficult, contingent upon the technological issues where she works. She really enjoys her work during the business trips and usually comes home feeling fulfilled and excited about life. 



Normally when she comes home, she takes a day or two to rest and overcome the jetlag (28 hour travel time and 21 hour time difference). The following days, we tend spend lots of time together, sex, dates, cuddling, catching up etc. because she’s been gone so long. 



This year, she came home as her same excited self after having had a great trip. In fact, she seemed so excited, that she wanted to work on some projects, but would need to go get some material from the store. About three hours after picking her up from the airport, she says she wants to go shopping for her craft project and that she will likely spend several hours out shopping. She really emphasizes how much time she'll need to go shopping--many hours. I think this is a little weird considering that she just came back from a 28 hour flight, hasn’t slept, and she’s usually not the type to spend more than an hour or two shopping, but w/e it’s fine. About 5 hours later, she comes home with a single bag of craft material, I register this as strange, but don’t really think about it. I chalk it up to taking a lot of time to pick out her materials, carefully selecting them instead of bulk buying.



Over the next few days, she didn’t really go through the jetlag phase and stayed distant. I thought that was weird but ended up giving her space and just focused on school. About two weeks post-return, we still haven’t had sex, despite my advances and lightly prodding the issue (getting a “I’m just feeling off and don’t feel like it”). I find that strange, since she is usually a 3-4 times a week kind of person and we’ve been exploring some new kinks prior to her trip—which we had talked about kindling once she returned. The first few times that she doesn’t reciprocate sexy-time advances, I don’t think anything of it. We’ve always had a very open “No” policy and are attentive to one another needs i.e.—time, tired, not feeling it, need it now. After two weeks, the combination of her distance and no sex feels really “off.” 



Over the weekend she went met up with her girlfriends for a day out. During that time, I snooped on her computer. If that bothers you, stop reading now. We have always been extremely open with our phones and social media—we both know our phone passwords/computer passwords/she knows my Facebook etc. While she was out with her friend, I looked on her computer. She left her work and personal email, Reddit, and Facebook open/logged in. So I looked. Nothing out of the ordinary. I looked in the recycle bin and found that she had taken some self-nudes with her phone, sent them to her email, downloaded, then deleted them (hence the recycling bin). I thought that was odd, normally we would send nudes to each other, not put them on our computers—maybe she really liked them (she did look hot) and decided to keep them. This has my gears turning, because she has been really disinterested in sex since returning, but is taking selfies in the nude wearing lingerie. I looked at the metadata on the picture, confirmed it was taken recently and that it was downloaded from Gmail. 



I went and looked at her Gmail. Nothing terribly odd here—but anything before 3 days after returning home had been deleted from her inbox, then deleted from the trash folder / not-archived e.g. if she came home on the 1st, everything before the 4th was deleted. However, in her trash bin, was a confirmation of appointment for a health clinic in an adjacent city. It had a link with a user ID to login into the patient portal if you needed to change your appointment. I logged in with the ID and her common passwords (which I already knew from us sharing). The portal is mostly empty, but showed that she had scheduled and kept an appointment the same afternoon that she got home from her trip. The portal allows you to request records from visits, so I did. They were delivered to the portal about 30 minutes later. She had gone in for STD testing 5 hours after coming home from an 8-week business trip.
 

To summarize:

1. Gets tested for STDs while saying she is going shopping the day she returns from an 8-week business trip.

2. Concealed the fact that she was tested, didn’t leave phone number or address at clinic, careful to delete emails pertaining to the clinic, made cover excuse to go out

2. Super distant with me (very engaging towards friends/coworkers) / no sex

3. Says not interested in sex, but dresses up to take nudies/clearly masturbating (found lots of porn open on her computer, vibrator out—not anything odd, we watch porn together and alone, open about masturbation etc) 

4. On a similar business trip, she did almost the exact same thing. Got tested as soon as she got home (7-week trip), refrained from sex for about a week/distant, I found out via similar ways (shared computer, saw email from health clinic about results on portal). Previously, when I asked her about it, she said she had a UTI and went in for a full STD panel. Totally plausible—I let it go. I just feel like there’s a pattern here. Also said that STD test was normal for women during checkups—although most clinics say that you must ask for the tests/reasonable suspicion. 

6. No real reason to suspect cheating, but god damn, this feels weird. All the elements of possibility are there I suppose.



Possible explanations:

1. She had another health problem that seemed to resolve itself, maybe she wanted more followup and didn’t want to belabor me with the details—although the other health issue isn’t urogenital related. She didn't receive any tests that would aim to diagnose the concomitant issue. 

2. Health information could be weird if someone reading over your shoulder sees an email in your personal inbox from a clinic, so you delete it. I’m not sure this explains why her inbox was cleaned / stuff deleted from the Trash.

3. Maybe she feels a little detached from me after being away for so long and needs more time to warm back up?

4. Could have also had another UTI and got STD panel at the request of practitioner? Although, no antibiotics/treatments were administered during the visit / weren't documented

5. Maybe she thought I was cheating and got tested? Although, 8-weeks later seems a little outside of the incubation period. 


The secrecy of the whole thing really bothers me. Any ideas on how to approach this topic with my wife or other possible explanations?

RareRunway,2018-02-17 14:28:34+00:00,UPDATE: My blind date ended up being a former bully from high school.,"Here's the original story: https://redd.it/7y2iki

After reading through the comments on yesterday's post, I got a pretty good idea of what I was going to say to this girl. (Let's call her Jane) First, I decided to message one of her friends on Facebook, a friend who was close to her in high school. I just wanted to confirm that she had indeed changed and according to this friend, she's been a completely different person ever since graduating high school. Simply put, Jane just reflected on the things she did and came to realize that she was wrong. She always felt bad about what did, but she didn't have the guts to ever message me or formally apologize. However, Jane did put forth the effort in telling as many people as possible to not believe the rumor she started and that they should leave me alone and stop harassing me.

Her friend also explained that she was a bully mainly because she was always one of the most popular girls in school and she wanted to keep that image. She didn't want anyone to potentially find out about her own problems at home (parents constantly arguing and an abusive older brother) so she deflected them onto me. But her friend kept emphasizing that she's genuinely sorry about everything and she would take it all back if given another chance. I thanked the friend and decided to call Jane.

I called her and I instantly told her that I forgave her for everything that she did. I told her that I believe her to be a new person and at the very least, I'd like to get to know her a little more and start anew. The next thing I know, we're planning a very last minute date and we end up going to the movies last night. I was amazed at how different this date was compared to the previous one. We were both laughing, talking about our interest and goals in life, and there wasn't any awkward silences or anything like that. We actually got along and clicked really well. She also went out of her way to be extra courteous to me, doing things like holding the door open for me and offering to pay for stuff like my ticket, concessions, etc.

After the movies, we went to a small ice cream shop and talked some more and things kept going on strong. After that, we ended up back in the parking lot again and we got ready to say goodbye. I told her that I had a great time with her and that I want to do something again soon. She said the same and then she starts thanking me for giving her another chance. She then starts to explain that she always felt bad for me, but her guilt grew tenfold after her parents divorced just a few months after graduating. She said that she felt what it was like to live with the thoughts of never being good enough for a parent and she started to get a little teary-eyed. I hugged her and I told her that it was OK. And right before we left, I told her that she can always come to me for help if there was ever any continuing problems at her home.

So that's how last night went. We both had a great time and I look forward to spending more time with her soon. I don't know if I'll ever post any more updates with Jane, but I'll just wait and see what plays out in the future and update if anything major happens.

RareRunway,2018-02-16 22:33:51+00:00,My blind date ended up being a former bully from high school.,"This past weekend, my friends set me up on a dinner date with a girl that they thought was ""really nice"" and ""has a great personality"". I never saw any pictures of her or anything, all I had was her name, but I was still looking forward to having dinner with her.

I arrive at the restaurant and I find her waiting for me in the parking lot. That's when I see that this girl is someone who I went to high school with just a few years ago. She was also a girl who use to frequently bully me in our senior year. I live with adoptive parents and I never knew my real parents since they gave me up for adoption when I was just a baby, and this girl was always there to remind me. She would always tell me that my real parents never loved me and that nobody was ever going to love me in my life. There was even one incident when she started a rumor on Facebook that I killed my real parents and that reputation stuck with me for the rest of our senior year, to the point where I actually got talked to by our campus's security guard.

We both instantly recognized each other and what followed was an awkward ""Hey"" from me and then silence. We both just kind of stared at one another and then she said ""So are you ready?"" and I just awkwardly gestured for us to go inside. As far as the dinner goes, we just made small talk about some of our recent activity since graduating, but it wasn't what I would call ""fun"" or ""enjoyable"".

I decided to be polite and walk her to her car and she immediately broke down. She began to legitimately cry (actual tears) and she apologized profusely for everything she said and did to me. She said that she was ""immature"" and she wished that she could take back everything. She said that she realized during our dinner that we had a lot in common and I was a really nice guy who didn't deserve to be treated badly and she genuinely wants to put the effort in a potential relationship, but she also said that she would understand if I didn't want to pursue anything. I told her that I'd think about it and we left each other for the night.

I'm really torn. I believe that her apology was genuine, but I'm not good at judging these sorts of things. Do you think she was being serious with her apology? And do you think I should give her a chance? I was surprised at how much we had in common and she came across as a whole new person, but I'm not sure. She made my life a living hell on campus. She constantly made me feel bad about being adopted and the rumor she started resulted in a lot of students (and even some teachers) to avoid me and talk about me behind my back. What do you think?

justfuckingendmenow,2018-02-15 02:07:58+00:00,My wife is cheating on me on F*cking Valentine’s day,"I am crushed right now. Now I have a real reason to hate valentine’s day. This morning, before leaving to work, I[32M] saw my wife’s[33F]  phone notification light flashing so I checked, it was a message from a private number so I read through all the messages. The messages were from the night before and here are how some went; ‘hey can’t wait to see you tomorrow my husband is going to work so we have all morning long’ ‘Look wear something like this for me tomorrow baby’ ‘I wanna be inside you already especially inside your own house’ ‘I will do anything you want me to do for you in bed, I’m doing specially for you I don’t even do it for my husband’. We have been together for 12 years total and we had plans to have kids already and have a family

I took pictures of the chat with my phone since I think this is most likely ending in a divorce. I decided to come home early and I walked into my house silently and it was confirmed they were cheating on my own bed. I left without making noise and I had a big beautiful rose for her, I cut a small part of my wrist and let some blood on the paper with the rose and I wrote a note to her saying ‘here is your love’.

I drove off to a liquor store and bought whiskey and swishers and I picked up half an ounce of Marijuana from a friend. I drove to a mountain that has a cliff of the whole city and right now I’m here and she keeps on texting and calling me like she is desperate. I am losing my mind here. I am still up here just looking at the lights and I feel like my world just ended. I hate the thought of myself now and I just feel like I don’t even belong here anymore

Tl;dr my wife is cheating on valentin’es day and I don’t want to be here anymore

Update 1- I am driving home now and will probably sleep outside in the hammock or something

Update: I am home safe now ordered some food and I have another blunt left but I will stay outside in the backyard for now- I am invited my cousin and his wife over, he is basically like a brother to me so I will most likely be okay

Update- she heard my cousin and his wife pull up and she came out. Okay she started crying and basically throwing a tantrum and begging me to forgive her. Well my cousin’s wife Maria took her inside and sat down with her so they’re talking and I’m outside with my cousin taking a smoke break

Update: I woke up to her crying to me and begging. I didn’t say anything. I feel dead on the inside like if somebody ripped my heart out and smashed it on the floor

iPiPrince,2018-01-10 02:36:35+00:00,"My [23M] gf [25F] has a disgusting fetish, and I don't know if I can handle it.","So, I met this beautiful woman about 7 months ago at an alumni function. We hit it off and honestly she's everything I could ask for. I'm not sure if I'm still in the honeymoon phase, but so far everything is working out and she even moved in with me two months ago with no problems.

However, this past holiday season she started doing something gross. Honestly, it's so disgusting I haven't even asked my friends or family for help on this matter. On Christmas Eve, I woke up pleasantly surprised to see that she was cooking breakfast. But, when I looked at my scrambled eggs, it looked really really sketchy. It looked way too moist. My gf told me she used a fancy cheese which is why it was extra moist and smelly. I believed her and ate it. The texture was absolutely horrendous, but taste-wise it was fine. She beamed and started planning our holiday. 

Then on New Year's Eve, we were cuddling and doing couple things. She brought strawberries and whipped cream. We did some fun with the whipped cream and she fed me the strawberries. Then she chewed up a berry and fed it to me. I thought it was weird, but I was so horny I didn't mind. We finished the rest of the berries in the same manner, and the subsequent sex was AMAZING. 

But... now she's starting to chew her food and feed it to me. Sometimes not in a sexual manner. Steak, chicken, salad, eggs, etc. It's so disgusting. When I tell her to stop she starts crying and says I don't love her enough. All of our fights were about this issue. I eventually eat some and its so gross. I recoil whenever I think about the texture. 

Help??? I thought maybe she needs to talk to a therapist or maybe I should contact an ex of hers to see if he went through something similar. She is perfect for me except for this one issue. 


--**Update**-- 
So in the comments below, apparently her saliva started fermenting/digesting the eggs for me. This is probably why it had a sour smell. Also, she's very attractive and needs constant validation. She makes me eat her regurgitated food as ""proof"" that I love her. Besides this, she's honestly my ideal partner. I don't want to throw this away. I will be meeting with an ex of hers tomorrow.

Commissar_Malvick,2017-11-18 23:09:10+00:00,I took your guys advice... and it worked!,"So a couple of weeks ago, I posted a thread about this girl I'd been seeing on the bus.

I wasn't really that interested, just thought they were cute but one I noticed kept glimpsing at me, smiled even that made me want to approach her, but I couldn't. 

So after that, I came to Reddit for advice. I wanted to go speak to her, approach her on the bus without coming across awkward and whatnot, and posted a topic here. I've deleted the post now, regrettably. 

I received a lot of good advice from people, but the thing that stuck with me most was ""just talk to her, because you have nothing to lose and everything to gain"" and with this in mind, I did. 

In the 20 minutes that followed, I got her name and number and found out what she studies (same course that I did a year ago, strangely enough). Two weeks on, we're now dating. 

So I'm posting this to not only as an update for all those great people that gave me the advice and motivation to do this, but also to advise anyone else in similar situations. Just do it, because like what that user said to me ""you have nothing to lose and everything to gain"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7dwj1s/i_took_your_guys_advice_and_it_worked/,relationship_advice,1154,69,0.0

Hey, Reddit!



I don't know if anyone will remember me and my post from last September (it was originally posted in r/relationships but they only allow one update so I'm posting here), but I found out that my fiancé at the time, Dale, was emailing his ex and was still in love with her. He also made fun of me from everything from sex to my disfiguring scar. My update got removed but Tickld did an article about my story (crazy!) and you can still read the update through the link they provide at the end of the article. I'll provide the link to that article in the comments!



Now, the reason I'm posting is to thank all of you. I got an overwhelming flood of love and support from you, Reddit. You all gave me strength and confidence that I was doing the right thing. Many of your comments also made me laugh during a time where laughs were few and far between.



I'll also give you a little update. I am doing great! I haven't spoken to Dale since our split, though he did show up at Jake and Mike's place twice and they had to basically shoo him away and he would send flowers and cards to Jake and Mike's place for me for close to 3 months before giving up. I have no idea what is happening in his life these days, which is a wonderful thing! I ended up going on my honeymoon alone and it was fabulous! I went to Spain and had such incredible experiences. And the food! You all, it was wonderful!



About 5 months ago I bought a home. My very first home! Just a small little starter home but it's mine and I love it. I've also done a far share of traveling. Mostly by myself because there is something just empowering and magical about traveling by yourself. Quiet moments alone just taking in amazing sights and experiences. Though I've also traveled with Jake to Canada, which was a very fun trip, and had a Vegas trip with 5 other friends.



As far as my romantic life... I'm having fun, Reddit :) I am staying single and I would like to stay single for a while. Unless I meet someone who just sweeps me off my feet. I have met some men during my travels and around the city that seem to have no problem with my ""circus freak"" scar though.



So that's about it, Reddit! I am forever grateful to how much you all rallied around me and lifted me up during a very low time. It meant and still means so much! You are all wonderful, kind people. Even when I logged on to this account today for the first time in months I still had people messaging me words of encouragement as little as 2 weeks ago. That is, not to sound corny, sort of magical. That complete strangers show such compassion. Thanks for being rad, Reddit!



&lt;3 ""Elle""



TL;DR: This is an update to my posts from last September. I got an amazing response from you all and just wanted to check in and tell you that I am doing phenomenally well and that I am incredibly thankful to you all and your support! I've been traveling, hiking, eating, making new friends, having fun with the opposite sex, and just living my life fully.

[deleted],2016-10-08 22:08:09+00:00,UPDATE: I (33m) overheard my girlfriend (28f) making fun of me pretty brutally to her best friend (27m). When I say brutally... I mean brutally.,"Link to original post:

Well, supportive Reddit strangers, I stayed strong and broke up with Jenna Thursday evening. This has honestly been the most dramatic couple of days of my entire life. I am exhausted. Things got pretty ugly on her part. Sorry that this is so long, a lot happened.

At the suggestion of my friends, mother, brother, and many of you, I talked to her in a private but still public place. The thought behind that was that someone who can be so cruel and reveal herself as a liar is potentially capable of trying to turn things around on me and say that she left me because I hurt her or some other nonsense. I'd like to think she wouldn't do something like that, but who knows, especially after everything that has happened. Better safe than sorry.

I thought about just boxing up her stuff and breaking things off with no explanation. But it has been over 2 years together, I decided the best thing to do is to confront her calmly and then hear her out. If she had an explanation, I wanted to hear it, even if it didn't change my decision to break up with her. So I took her to a wine bar in downtown that has those little individual booths with half curtains. 

She's been sugary sweet since Monday. Which tells me she either a) felt guilty about what a jerk she was, b) thought I might have heard her, or c) she just knew I'd been acting distant and was totally clueless as to why. So she dressed up really nice and, despite everything that has happened, I can admit that she looked stunning. She was also very affectionate and kept making a lot of sexy comments about all the things she wanted to do to me later. Normally, my precious little baby carrot would have been thrilled by this, but given the circumstances, it was difficult to hear and act normal.

I had rehearsed what I was going to say to her over and over so as soon as we sat down and got our wine, I started. I can't remember word for word, my adrenaline was kicked in pretty high gear so it feels fuzzy. I basically started by saying how much I've loved her, how she's the only woman that I've ever felt connected to so profoundly that I opened myself up to her completely and trusted her. I told her that she's the only woman I've ever thought about marrying, that I've gone ring shopping for (I left out the part about how I already bought a ring), and that I've actually imagined having children with in the next few years. She kept interrupting me to say ""aw"" or to tell me how much she loves me, too.

Then I looked her in the eye and asked her point blank why, if she loved me so much, she horrendously made fun of me to Dylan. 

I have to say, the look on her face was a bit satisfying.

As expected, she denied at first and acted like she had no idea what I was talking about. She said Dylan knows how much she loves me and that she's never made fun of me to him. I kind of just looked at her and said something like ""come on, Jenna."" But she still denied even after I told her that I'd come home early on Monday and had heard her. 

It was pretty frustrating but I kept my cool. I just told her that she and I both know she's lying and that the things she said were unforgivable and that I couldn't wrap my mind around why she would say things like that to anyone, let alone Dylan, especially because she was lying just to be able to rag on me. 

Still denied and acted like I was crazy, she said she loves me so much, that she's not dissatisfied with our sex life and would never say she was or complain about my size, and that she knows how smart and sweet I am, that's why she loves me.

If I hadn't heard what she said to Dylan myself, I would have believed her. She deserves an Oscar for that performance. Some commenters asked if I was sure she was talking about me when I overheard her. When she was talking about her ex bf and his kraken of a dick, she said my name when she was making the comparison. I'm definitely sure that she was talking about me and that she was lying to my face about it.

I told her that I would drive us home and she could grab the essentials she needed and her dog. My brother and his girlfriend would be at the house, too. I wanted to make sure there were other people there just to have witnesses that I let her get her stuff and didn't do anything aggressive or destructive. I told her I'd pack the rest of her stuff up and leave it out for her to get whenever she could.

She was in total disbelief that I was actually breaking up with her. She pleaded with me but my mind was/is made up and I wasn't budging. It was hard not to cry in front of her though when she kept saying how much she wanted to be with me forever and that she had planned to be the mother of my children someday. 

I own my house and since Jenna hasn't helped with expenses by paying any rent or utilities, I wasn't too concerned about, putting it bluntly, kicking her out. She kept asking me what she was supposed to do and where was she supposed to sleep? I told her it wasn't really my problem anymore and that she has plenty of friends she can stay with until she gets her own place. Basically all of the furniture and decor is mine, she just has clothes/toiletries/etc. to get out. All of the ""redecorating"" she did to my house was done on my dime. 

Then came the waterworks. She started crying and saying that she didn't understand how I could do this to her. She said she thought I was a nice guy about a million times.

I told her I am a nice guy, which is why I didn't just throw her stuff on the front lawn, change the locks, and give her no explanation. 

Then, I swear to you, this woman dug the knife in even deeper. She said she didn't know why she said those things to Dylan (she finally acknowledged it!) and that maybe it's because Dylan brings out the best in her and she's able to laugh about things that would normally make her cry. I guess like my penis? 

I told her that it's really sad to me if what I heard was her at her best. It was petty and usually I'm above making snide comments, but I told her that she can go back to her hometown and go live with Dylan or her 9 inch dick ex boyfriend.

It was amazing to watch how fast those tears disappeared.

Apparently I am an asshole, I don't know how to treat women, I'm a loser, my penis is tiny, I'm going to be alone forever, she never really loved me and I was more like a friend but she didn't want to hurt me so she stayed with me (makes a lot of sense...?), she would have said no if I'd proposed, again, I am a loser and an asshole, and in case I didn't get it the first time, she meant it when she said my penis was a baby carrot. Oh, and I will die alone.

I told her dying alone is preferred to dying married to a woman who is cruel and doesn't love or respect me.

No joke, she started to scream. Not words, just a long, extremely loud scream. It was alarming and then she just booked it out of there after calling me a disgusting pig.

After paying the bill and apologizing to the waiter about the drama, I left and Jenna was just standing outside crying. I know what she did was horrible and all the things she said just a few minutes earlier were horrible, but... I still didn't like seeing her like that and didn't want to just leave her on the sidewalk. I'm in New England, it's already pretty cold here. So I told her to let me give her a ride back to the house so she could get her stuff but that she needed to leave and go stay somewhere else as soon as she packed a bag.

She agreed and we didn't talk at all in the car. Talk about an awkward ride. My brother and his wife were at the house when we got there. His wife stayed inside while Jenna got some stuff together and my brother waited outside with me.

That went by pretty uneventfully and she had a girlfriend come pick her up. I got my key back from her before she left. She texted me throughout the night and the texts ranged from sorry to sad to angry to really angry and back again. I didn't answer any of them and only texted her yesterday morning to tell her that her stuff was on the porch and that she should come pick it up while I'm at work.

I didn't hear from her all day until it was almost time for me to go home. Pretty nasty text wishing me about every ill you can wish a person. I didn't answer.

Well, I came home to a disaster zone. She smashed everything. I don't know if she had made a spare key at some point that I was unaware of or if she knows how to pick locks, but she got in to the house somehow and she destroyed it. She smashed stuff that's irreplaceable, she ripped up the furniture, she clogged two sinks and left the water running, she left my refrigerator open and threw food all over the kitchen. It was wrecked. The only considerate thing she did was lock my two dogs up in a bedroom, I guess so they didn't cut themselves on glass or eat the food.

I have two vehicles, one for everyday use and then an SUV for work. I use the SUV for when I make house calls and may have to bring a large or exotic animal into the vehicle to transport it to the clinic. In the middle of all the drama, I'd forgotten I'd given her a key to the SUV in case she ever had an emergency and needed to drive somewhere. I went out to check the car and she trashed the inside of it, too. She dumped flour all over the inside in addition to tomato soup. 

The stuff is just stuff, I suppose. It's more the fact that she could do something so childish and awful on top of everything else. It blows my mind. Last weekend I took her to a play, went out with her and friends, we played Monopoly one night and made up our own drinking game with it, we hung out and watched Netflix, made love several times. And this weekend my house and vehicle are destroyed and so am I. Amazing how fast things change.

Not my finest moment, but I was so pissed off that I got right on to Costco's instant delivery and ordered 20 5lb bags of baby carrots and had them shipped to her friend's place, addressed to Jenna. 100lbs of baby carrots. They deliver within an hour. I got a slew of interesting and insulting texts from her that evening. Yes, it was petty, but the only regret I have about it is that it was a waste of food. Hopefully she donates them or cooks some of them or something.

So, that's that. I blocked her last night after the nasty texts from her just kept coming. I'm feeling pretty beaten down right now and I've cried more than I have in a long time. It's obvious that I made the right choice; Jenna is clearly not emotionally stable or mature. She really is cruel and I know I do deserve better.

I have spent a lot of time since Monday thinking about myself as a partner and trying to figure out what could have led to her obviously having some resentment or something for me. I'm going to be 100% honest here. I work *a lot*. I try to still make time for the people I love and I try not to bring work home with me when I've had a bad day. But sometimes I do, I know this. Jenna and I have fought about it before and I have really tried to pace my days a certain way so that I can get home at a reasonable time and I've tried to leave bad days at work as much as I can. 

However, anyone who is a vet or has worked with one knows we're always on call for emergencies. Sometimes we have patients that we have to check on or stay with throughout the night. Time off can be challenging. It's doable, but it's challenging. My staff is incredible and can handle most situations, but I do still get a lot of calls or texts from them when I'm on vacation or off for the day.

I'm sure there have been times when Jenna felt second best to my job. Well, I guess I know there have been, she's told me as much in the past. I did try to make changes but there's only so much I can do. As far as I can remember, I've never been purposely mean to Jenna. I've had bad days and been grumpy or absent, we've had our share of disagreements and fights but nothing unhealthy or excessive. I really thought we had a solid relationship and that we were *both* happy. I know I was.

It's hard to not question myself and wonder if I really am a let down or if I neglected her to the point that she felt unloved enough to act the way she did. I don't know, but I do know that no matter what, the way she put me down and the way she reacted to breaking up was way, way out of line. I didn't deserve that and that's on her.

So thank you for rooting for me, Reddit. It's been great to read all the nice words and advice. Time for me and my baby carrot to eventually find a woman who appreciates us for what we are.

**tl;dr:** I broke up with Jenna Thursday night. Did not go well. She got nasty and ended up destroying my house, car, and me. But I did it, it's over, and I've blocked her from my phone/social media. I also sent her 100lbs of baby carrots in a moment of angry weakness.

Edit: I did file a police report and took pictures, which will hopefully help with recouping some of the money lost through insurance. As far as the police report, it's very doubtful anything will come of it since I can't prove it was her. Same goes for trying to sue her in small claims court. And honestly, I'd rather not deal with her anymore. I'm going to hope that insurance will cover the damages and just move on with my life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/56jaej/update_i_33m_overheard_my_girlfriend_28f_making/,relationship_advice,1331,321,

I mean brutally.,"I originally posted this elsewhere, but it was deleted for whatever reason. I'm reposting so that I can link to it when I post the update. If that makes sense.

My girlfriend, ""Jenna"", and I have been together for 2 years, a little over.

I'm a veterinarian and we met at my office. She had just moved to the city and brought her dog in for an ear infection. We started talking and what should have been a 15 minute appointment turned into an hour long talking session.

I've never been so smitten with a woman before. Before Jenna, I lived the bachelor lifestyle. I was beginning to think I'd just stay single forever, even though that lifestyle of nothing but casual flings was growing really old and empty.

Jenna is a charismatic woman with a lot of friends. Her best friend is a guy, ""Dylan"", she knew in her old town. I trust Jenna but I'd be boldfaced lying if I said that her relationship with him doesn't bother me at all. I don't get angry with her or fight about it, she's reassured me that they've been friends their whole lives and have never had any sexual relationship.

I'm secure and I'm not insane, so I accept that they are friends and have tried to buddy up with him as well. He has visited the city 3 times. He's a cool guy, however, he does not seem to like me much. Jenna says he's just protective. It comes off a whole lot more like jealousy than protectiveness, in my opinion.

Jenna just finished up grad school this spring but she's had a really tough time finding a job. We have lived together for a year and I've been understanding that she can't help pay rent, etc. right now. I'm very financially secure so it isn't an issue, however, I am careful to not become a reason for her to not get a job and have her own financial independence. I just think it's important for everyone to have this sort of independence. So, without being pushy, I've let her know that she does need to start paying half of the expenses once she secures a job.

Anyway, she texted me at work on Monday to tell me she got a job. It's a job she really, really wanted and had to go through some pretty grueling interviews to get. I was so happy and proud of her that I decided to leave the rest of the day at the office up to my staff and took off early without telling Jenna.

I bought her favorite booze, grabbed a bunch of Chinese take out (her favorite), and bought her flowers.

I had bought her a nice necklace that she'd seen at a store a couple of weeks ago. Nothing super extravagant, but it has a shark on it and that woman is just obsessed with anything to do with sharks. I'd hidden it in the basement and figured I'd give it to her soon, totally surprise her with t once she'd forgotten about even seeing it in the store. I got home and came in the side entrance to the basement so I could grab the necklace and then surprise her.

When I came up the basement steps and opened the door, I could hear her talking on the phone. Normally I wouldn't stop and listen but I heard her laughing uncontrollably, like belly-laughing. It was pretty cute so I figured I'd wait for her to get off the phone before I surprised her.

She was talking to Dylan. Nothing new there, they talk at least once a week.

Then I heard what they were laughing about.

It took me a few dull minutes to realize that she was laughing about our sex life. She said something about how ""No, he can't even compare to (ex bf). Ex bf had at least 3 inches on him."" ""I feel bad every time I eat a baby carrot around him because it must be traumatic to see me chomping down on something the same size as him."" ""It would almost be cute if it didn't suck so much. His body is amazing as long as he keeps his boxers on."" Lots of laughter.

So look, I don't really give a crap what people on Reddit think about the, erm... size of my member... but, I do think it's important to say that what she was making fun of wasn't even true. Which in my opinion, makes it even more hurtful. I mean, I don't know about the ex bf, maybe he was a horse, but I'm very.... average. Just good old fashioned average. Not going to upsell myself here. It's nothing to write home about. But it's also not laughable. I've never felt self conscious, it is what it is.

To hear her ripping me apart to this guy that she knows I have some concern about was just beyond hurtful. Hurtful doesn't cover it.

She also made fun of me for being ""gorgeous but not super smart"".

Um... I'm actually highly educated. This isn't even remotely a concern of mine, I know I'm smart. Gorgeous and super smart with an average sized penis, thanks very much.

I left after that. Did I throw the flowers out of my car window? Yes. Did I cry in a parking lot? Yes.

I think she may have heard the basement door close, maybe she even saw my car driving away, because she started texting me pretty quickly after I left. Asking when I was coming home.

That was Monday and I haven't brought it up. I don't know how. I think I'm still processing everything. It's horribly embarrassing and hurtful. But... damn I love this girl. Not saying I'm going to forgive her necessarily, I just want to stress how hard this whole thing is for me.

I know I need to bring it up to her. But how? Any suggestions on how to start this conversation with her? I'm extremely hurt and I don't know if I can forgive her for this

tl;dr: My girlfriend made fun of me with her male friend. About our sex life/my penis. Pretty hurtful stuff. I feel like a puppy that just got kicked in the face. Joking aside, I'm devastated. I was planning to propose in the next few months. Now I don't see how I can even forgive her and stay with her. Advice?

Edit Wow, hey thanks everyone! I just wanted to add that I definitely will be breaking up with Jenna. I grabbed a beer with three of my friends tonight and told them. Their sentiments matched the majority of yours: dump her and do it quick. I called my mom and told her about it (yes, I told her everything, embarrassing as it was; we are pretty close and I wanted to tell her the whole story) and I've never heard her so angry about anything. She knew I'd bought a ring for Jenna. I will post an update after I do it (probably tomorrow), though it may take me a couple of days to post about it. I'm going to be pretty wrecked emotionally. Thanks again for all the comments/messages of support and encouragement, I really didn't expect everyone to be rooting for me like this!
