What signs do you still exhibit?,"Childhood emotional neglect is a failure of parents or caregivers to respond to a child’s emotional needs. It’s can be difficult to ascertain as it’s done unintentionally or very subtle and not in clearly neglectful or abusive households but those with two parents, high achievers/earners or families that provide children with fundamental needs (food clothing shelter).

Some signs: 
* Feeling empty
* Low self esteem or self worth
* Fear of dependency on others
* Not trusting kindness from others, believing they want something from you 
* Fearing emotional intimacy or emotionally unavailable 
* Needing constant reassurance 
* Unrealistic self image 
* No self compassion but shows high amounts for others 
* Feeling Guilty, anger and shame for reacting or feeling certain emotions 
* Difficulty feeling, expressing or managing emotions

Because of your interest and engagement, we hit 1 million subscribers in a subreddit that started as a spinoff of another sub (including 40% of our subscribers in the last year).  To that end, we promise to keep the sub in line with its mission, free of trolls, and childish stunts.

To celebrate hitting a million subs, we would like to make two announcements.

1.     Over the test run of Casual Convo Friday, we took some input and saw what worked and what didn’t and we wanted to let everyone know that it will be a permanent feature of the sub moving forward.
2.    We are doing a community feedback survey.  For the next few weeks, [you can click HERE](https://forms.gle/xiqiLuP5irpVxEkH7) and then we will drill down the data and look at how to keep curating the community how our subscribers want.

“Honey, you have to make sure you always have a plan for just yourself. When I was five, my parents were drunk and fighting again, and they were threatening divorce. They were ‘splitting up the kids’ (she had three older siblings) and saying who they wanted to take. My father wanted Lucy and Sarah, and my mother wanted Bill. And nobody picked me. 

“I ran out the front door and laid down in our grass, looking up at the stars. I sang ‘Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star’ while crying, and then I said ‘I wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish I wish tonight.’ And I wished for my OWN man, one who would take care of me and love me and want me. And I thought because I put it out there into the universe, that it would happen.

“I was always looking for MY man. I went through the rest of life looking for him. And he never came. And now I’ve accepted that he’s just not going to come. 

“And sometimes I still look for him. At church today, I took a peek around. ‘Nope, no one here.’ I have to be okay with just being on my own.”

Coming from my mother, this is the saddest thing I’ve ever heard. Mostly because I know it’s a reality and a possibility for me (and anyone else), and that she may be right. She may live the rest of her life alone.",AskWomen,2539

Even those who aren't familiar with the label may recognize some of their rhetoric or even notable incels (like Elliott Rogers). You may have seen reference to ""Chads"" (men they feel have all of the above qualities they lack) or the idea that women should be assigned by the government to men for sex, or that their day will finally come when sex robots are common and they can finally do away with ""femoids"" all together. 

It's been a particularly peculiar branch of self-loathing that has grown more and more outwardly hateful and hostile over time. Reddit has banned it today due to violations of their violent content rule. 

Please use this thread to direct all your incel related thoughts, feelings, and yes, questions (It looks like they're looking for places to go- as their home base has been taken and no- we're not going to host 85 threads on ""why male models"" and ""How threatened are you by sex robots plus VR) from the newly displaced population)

But please do remember our general rules which wll be enforced which include 

* No disrespectful/hateful commentary
* No graceless generalizations of gender (yes, that includes claims of women only liking money or looks)
* No Invalidation 

So please report comments that violate the above and any of the rules in this sub. And of course, please use the search bar for previous topics on virginity and attraction. 

Edit- Note that this is being discussed on a wide number of subreddits right now. We felt we needed one here due to their oh so common presence in the new queue and so many of our inboxes and the violent rhetoric that got them banned was typically aimed at women.  ",AskWomen,1256

What are your first impressions of this idea?","Whitney Wolfe, one of the co-founders of Tinder, is creating a new app called Bumble that is being promoted as ""women first"". Bumble requires women to make the first move. If she doesn’t start the conversation within 24 hours, the match disappears. 

http://www.racked.com/2015/3/24/8266243/whitney-wolfe-tinder-bumble

I think the section below best summarizes the article and the goals behind the app:

&gt; **How does Bumble give girls power?**

&gt; That’s where the whole ""girls speak first"" aspect comes in. We wanted to modernize dating. I’ll go out with groups of my friends and someone will see a cute guy across the room, or in the bar, or in the restaurant. She’ll be like, ""Oh, he’s so cute, I wish I could talk to him!"" And then we all encourage her—""Go say hi, go send him a drink, go do something!""—and she never does. There’s this unwritten rule that it’s not ladylike, or it’s wrong, or the guy should go first. The whole thing feels silly and outdated! Women are extremely independent in every facet of our lives, except dating. We wanted to encourage a confident connection. Making the first move, whether a woman is matching with a man or a woman, gives her a boost of confidence right off the bat. It immediately puts her in the driver’s seat.

What are your initial impressions of this app?

Conversation drifted to how different people perceive the world differently. I said something like ""Hey come on, all girls get *some* kind of attention at bars"" and then she asked me to name all the women who were in our group. I could only remember about 5 of them, and then she pointed out that I had left out basically all of the ""conventionally unattractive"" women.

It made me feel like a total asshole. The rest of the night, I kind of observed these girls and noticed that they were basically treated like shit.

Guys would come chat them up occasionally but it would be an obvious ""wingman"" stunt so the guy's friend would get to chat with the hot girl nearby. Etc.

Edit: Whoa, this got more popular than I expected! Thanks to everyone who was willing to open up and share their experiences--it probably wasn't easy to do that, even with the anonymity of the Internet. 

One question to play devil's advocate: A lot of you ladies are saying that being unattractive makes you feel unmemorable and invisible. Doesn't that technically mean you're average? IMO, someone unattractive is equally as memorable as someone attractive. Just a thought! :) :)",AskWomen,1265

DO YOU EAT IT?!","Does it depend where on the boob? Like, would you eat it if it was hanging out on the top of your boob, but not eat it if it was sitting snugly by the nipple or further downwards?

Would you eat it if you were alone but not with a partner?

Does it depend on whether you still have any of that candy left?

Does the meltedness of the coating matter?",AskWomen,1068

littlelibertine,2014-01-09 14:16:17+00:00,"Is anyone else super turned off when men list ""not crazy"" as one of their requirements for a romantic partner?","I don't know, man.  It makes me worry that, somewhere along the line, they're going to take my perfectly reasonable and valid emotional response and try to gaslight me.

Edit: can't say I'm impressed by the chucklefuckers insisting that ""OP is the crazy one.""

Second edit:  I've seen a few people say, ""Well, a lot of people just hide their crazy until they've got you in a relationship and then they let it fly free.""  I don't think anyone is going around saying, ""Well, I know I'm crazy, so I'd better keep it on lock until I've got this new person in balls deep."" That seems manipulative and sociopathic beyond the ken of the average person.  I think it's more likely that a new level of trust reached later in the relationship allows that person to open up about how they're feeling more and more to a new partner, or else that person's deepening feelings about their new partner provokes a deeper emotional response.  Writing all of that off as, ""well, he/she was crazy, but they waited until I was already in it to spring it on me"" assigns a lot of blame to the ""crazy"" person that they don't deserve.",AskWomen,1067
blahmythrow,2012-08-27 14:55:00+00:00,Update - Passing a girl on the way to work,"This is an update from my thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/yr2lr/pass_a_girl_walk_to_work_everyday_smiles_eye/) 



I was walking down the street on the way to work today and almost forgot about my ""master plan"" you all helped me with.  So I took out a business card - wrote my cell number on the front and on the back thought that since I was reverting to middle school flirting I would try and be a bit cute with it.  



So I wrote ""Will you go out with me? 

* Coffee (with a check box); 
* Lunch (checkbox); 
* No thanks, find a new way to walk to work



Saw her right around our usual place, got a smile and as we got closer gave her the ""1 second"" finger, she slows down and as we approach I take one ear of my headphones out, she does the same and I hand her the card ""coffee-side"" up and said ""let me know tomorrow"".  



She was understandably a little thrown off, so I smiled and just said, ""hope to hear from you"".


I had resigned myself to the full day waiting game but I just got back from a meeting and had a voicemail on my work phone.  



""Hi, this is _____, the girl you handed the cutest note in the world to today.  After I read it I actually said, 'I'll do either' but you were already too far away.  I wanted to give you your note back tomorrrow but feel bad making you wait for the answer, so lets talk soon and find a place for drinks after work"" and then left her number.




So score.  Thanks again for the advice and with a meeting story like this, I hope something substantial comes out of it.  

+++++ **UPDATE 2** +++++

Went out for a drink last night and we had an amazing time, I'm so glad I went for it.  We had a few drinks, some appetizers and a bunch of laughs.  Had a great non-awkward goodnight and shared a ton of texts afterwards.  On the walk to work today, I came around the corner to a big smile, and was a bit unsure of the protocol, do we both stop, slow dow, etc.   

She made it easy, I met her on my side of the street with a big smile, she gave me a quick kiss on the cheek and said I looked nice and then ""have a good day at work"" with a wink and walked away.  While walking away I get a text that says ""How proud of me are you that I didn't make-out with you on the sidewalk :)""
